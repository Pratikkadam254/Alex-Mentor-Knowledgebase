## 🎁 What You're Getting

This isn't just another PDF dump. This is a **structured knowledge system** designed to work with AI tools like:
- **Cursor** / **Antigravity** / **VS Code** / **Windsurf** / **Claude Code** with AI extensions
- **Claude** / **ChatGPT** / **Gemini** with file upload
- Any AI that can parse structured knowledge

### 📚 The Library Includes:

| Folder | What's Inside | Value |
|--------|---------------|-------|
| **01 Strategy & Foundations** | `$100M Leads`, `$100M Offers`, `Money Models` | Core frameworks that generated $200M+ in sales |
| **02 Scaling Roadmap** | Stage 0-8 business scaling guides | Step-by-step roadmap from $0 to $100M |
| **03 Departmental Playbooks** | Sales, Marketing, Operations, Pricing, Branding | Tactical SOPs for every business function |
| **04 Raw Intelligence** | Transcripts, social media archives | Unfiltered insights for deep learning |

## 🧠 How It Works

The magic is in the `AGENT.md` file. It transforms any AI into a ruthless business mentor:

```
✅ "Teach Then Do" Protocol - Learn WHY before HOW
✅ Stage-Appropriate Advice - No $10M advice for $0 problems
✅ Hormozi-Style Voice - Direct, no BS, volume-focused
✅ Citation-Based - Every answer grounded in specific playbooks
```

### Example Prompts:

| You Ask | Alex-AI Responds |
|---------|------------------|
| "How do I get more leads?" | References `$100M Leads.pdf` → Explains the 4 core ways to get leads → Asks about your current lead gen |
| "Should I raise my prices?" | References `$100M Pricing Playbook.pdf` → Walks through the pricing psychology → Gives stage-specific advice |
| "How do I scale from $100K to $1M?" | References `Stage 02-03 PDFs` → Outlines the exact constraints at your level |
