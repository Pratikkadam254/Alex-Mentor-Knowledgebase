5:18
And so gossip is a gift to the person who's not there and so I think if we can learn and this is something that I think is learned through repetition, is that whenever I'm now seeing people lower, their voice, or want to go on a walk together, a little bit further away on the edge on the periphery, right?
5:34
Right?
Where they don't want people to hear, where they have their genuine, the genuine real conversations that happen are these back conversations, but if you bring that person in and so I had had a couple of these that happened over the weekend where someone be like, hey, you know, I don't think this is.
And literally, as this employee was telling me what they thought that was - a third employee.
5:54
I was like, hey John, come over here.
I was like, we think you suck at this and it was like like I could see the look of shock but then it was like, oh wait, it's okay, we're all here.
No one's Die.
We're actually have a real conversation about this and solve it now, right?
Make the person aware that you think that Real quick guys.
6:13
If you can think about how you found this podcast, somebody probably tweeted it told you about it.
Should it on Instagram or something like that?
The only way this grows is through word of mouth and so I don't run ads, I don't do sponsorships, I don't sell anything.
I only ask is that you continue to pay it forward to whoever showed you or however you found out about this podcast that you do the exact same thing.
6:32
So if it was a review, if it was a post, if you do that, you mean the world to me and you throw some good karma out there for another entrepreneur.
Because 90% of time, they have no idea, right?
And we have this fear that they're going to what hate you, but it's like, it's I feel like so many things that I've learned over time, in terms of like life have been reversed, right?
6:52
In order to, you know, gain your life.
You have to give it away to other people in order to like trust other people, you have to give like, there's just so many reverse situations in order to get the most, you have to give the most right?
7:07
And so, there's so many things that are so ironic about.
Life.
And so a lot of times I feel like having genuine conversations is is giving the thing that you're the most afraid to share, right?
The thing that you think is going to offend that person, the thing that you think that person is going to be angry or upset about and they might be, but they might, they probably won't be angry upset at you, they'll be angry or said at themselves.
7:32
And I think it's our duty especially as Leaders to have and create an environment where those types of conversations can happen.
And it starts with us, right?
And so you can tell this when there's a leader.
Now there's, there's a difference between a dick right?
7:47
And being able to deliver information in a way that is real.
Right there was there was, I mean I was like, hey, you know, Marissa is like, what have you been doing the last two quarters.
I was like, you haven't grown this this division at all.
8:05
Like I was like, I'm wondering like what, like what is, what is, what do you feel?
You are doing right now.
That is a higher priority than these actions that you've put on that.
You've rolled over two quarters in a row.
Like, what are you doing?
That is like, what do I need to take off your plate in order for you to do this because you're Miss prioritizing your objectives.
8:26
It's in front of the whole team, right?
And it's like, shit.
I can't believe you said that, right?
That I turn to the next person and I'm like, hey, it's like you and I'd the bottlenecking was an actual real, real example, right?
And I mean, a lot of these are real examples, right?
Hey, so and so you'd like a lot of people perceive you as really -, and I think that you gain a lot more influence in this company.
8:46
If, if you weren't perceive that way, so what can we do to try and remove the things that you are - about or that your people perceive - about?
Because I ultimately think that you You should rise in this company and I do think you should have lots of influence.
I do think you're very smart, right?
And so I think it's literally just being brutally honest, right?
9:05
Which is why one of our core tenets is don't sugarcoat.
It it's just say it like it is and I think the more we as Leaders can consistently practice this trait, the more breakthroughs will be able to help our teammates have and ultimately the faster, the communication will happen, right?
9:22
Because speed is King only happens if people actually know what's going on and No.
What if the person doesn't know where they can improve, doesn't know what people really think they'll never get better.
And if someone can't handle that, then that's okay.
But at least you expose that early and then they can find a company where people don't talk about real things, right?
9:41
And then they can, you know, be sheltered and whatever.
But that in my opinion, will have no place in a company that I run and I try to lead by example there.
And also you know, Layla and I will usually give transparent feedback to one another in front of the team that way they can at least have permission and see What transparent feedback looks like.
9:58
And a lot of times it's, you know, gut Jabs are got, it feels like a gut punch, but, you know, that the person who's delivering it to you, is doing it because they actually want you to improve.
And they actually want, because everyone's on the same team, we all want the company to win, right?
And so, I think, starting with that, and realizing why people have authentic Communication in Gossip is because they don't have it in their normal lives.
10:19
You can foster that that repetitive action of bringing the third person to the fold and delivering the gossip and then over time.
I'm you can do it in larger and larger groups so that eventually it just becomes transparent communication company-wide immediately when someone experiences something that's negative.
10:36
So I hope that was valuable for you, for me, we're talking about team meetups, I think it's really valuable as we go into Q.
For some of you guys are going to have, you know, your cue for meetings.
That means like talking about the last in the last The End Zone, the last quarter of the year.
You probably have some goals that you did or did not hit.
And so I think having this as the Forefront of the lens that you won't have the conversations might be valuable for you and Your teams.
10:57
So lots of love.
Hope.
You guys have an awesome weekend and I'll catch you guys soon.
I'm going to be writing some more chapter stuff, and if you like this, drop a comment or a like, and if you didn't even tell me to fuck off.
All right, lots of love kitchen, but








0:00
Real quick.
Because you guys already know that, I don't run any ads on this and I don't sell anything.
And so, the only ask that I can ever have you guys that you help me spread the word so we can have more entrepreneurs, make more money, feed their families, make better products, and have better experiences for their employees and customers.
And the only way we do that is if you can rate and review and share this podcast, so the single thing that I have to do is you can just leave review will take you 10 seconds or one type of the thumb mean, the absolute world to me.
0:25
And more importantly, it may change the world of someone else.
Now here's what's interesting.
About this and I'm going to try and point out the nuggets and the wrinkles of what small tweaks make this thing super successful.
All right, one is welcome to the game where we talk about how to get more customers, how to make more per customer and how to keep them longer in the many failures and lessons.
0:43
We have learned along the way.
I hope you enjoy and subscribe.
What's going on everyone?
Happy Thursday, hope you guys are starting your ending your week off but starting your day off with a good vibe.
All right.
So what I want to do is break down a Cairo mousetrap and the reason I want to This one down, is that I've seen a handful of you guys were running Cairo, burning, professional type services.
1:07
So this would apply to anything that has any kind of medical service just understanding The Mousetrap behind this.
I think will make you guys in your class, lot of money.
So first things first, I'm going to start with the offer.
So the offer that that generated this was off, $1200 of AD spend, they generated 196 leads through a funnel and they got 126 to show Oh 65% to schedule.
1:31
Scuse me and of the hundred and twenty-six that scheduled 100 showed.
All right, so they'd 51% of All Leads that showed up.
So double the lead cost is what the ad spend per show was all right.
Those are good numbers. 51 percent showed up.
Now what I want to do is break this down for in from that they were also able to make nine thousand dollars up front before selling the 2K back ends.
1:53
All right which ended up being 64.
People decided to pay for the in-person visits.
I'm going to You through this.
So, first things first, they offered a free scan, a free body scan, all right.
Now, that's just a sexier different way of saying a free assessment right now.
2:10
Here's what's interesting about this and I'm going to try and point out the nuggets and the wrinkles of what small tweaks make this thing super successful.
All right?
One is instead of saying assessment which everyone is saying, right?
They said it was free to get this type of scan, right?
But what they did is they separated the scan and the technology in the software from the cost of a consultation in a visit, right?
2:32
And so what they said was this scan is normally $260 but it's free.
And so when people would opt in right through the funnel, right?
Note for a funnel not really tickly.
Dad's they would then opt in and schedule and when they got on the phone and it said, you know, for a 30-minute consult before your free scan, right?
2:49
And sitting on the phone, they say they would position the offer is saying, listen, this is normally a $260 skin will do it.
Absolutely free and machine in the software is very expensive, but we'll do it absolutely free now.
Normally Our every first visit is $130, you don't need to pay.
Now I've seen a card on file to make sure that you're going to show up for it.
3:05
All right, so we have a 50 dollar no-show fee but the appointments $130 for your first visit.
All right, now they were able to sell 64 out of 100 people that showed up on the phone, call for this 130-dollar first appointment.
The reason is important.
Again second note Little Nugget here.
3:22
So first is that they made it a free scan and they separate it from the first assessment.
Second, they position.
The scan is a 260 other thing that was given away for free.
So, there's more value third.
When, when they closed them, they didn't get charged the 130.
They said, I change your card your first appointment $130, and when you get here and you do it will charge you then we should your card for a no-show fee, which is 50 bucks, right?
3:46
And so, by doing this, they position the appointment and then that basically makes every single one of these people 130 dollar sales at minimum.
All right.
Now from those 64 people that they close, they close them on 130 dollar first consult.
4:02
So this isn't a $19 first console.
If this isn't a $29 consoles is 130, our first console, all right.
And so when these people came in now, all 64 of those people.
Now have $130, they're already paying for the service.
4:18
So this this Cairo already made nine thousand dollars before the backend sale before the lifetime value of the customer before selling any product, right?
And so, this is the key of making like, if you guys want to succeed and you want your clients to succeed, follow the best practices.
4:35
All right, so I'm giving shout out to Tim here because Tim was new into the Cairo space.
You hadn't really done it.
And so unlike many of you, he didn't have preconceived notions about what he should do, or what was working for him.
He followed the Playbook and so he didn't drive it straight to in person.
4:52
He drove it to a phone call because he knew because what we told them is that phone calls work better for most of those people because you can have Max availability.
What else did he not?
He didn't use lead ads because he saw that when he used to funnel, we know that we get two and a half times more people to show now.
Specifically for him, he got 51 percent of his leaps to show.
5:08
Now, if you compare that to the throughput, that many people are getting, you know, 10% 12%. 15% in those specific niches, trying to go create new and person that asked him to do something else.
It doesn't work because it happens.
We'll get on the phone, though, some to cancel that appointment, and then we'll set another one, right?
5:26
And so, then you get cheated out of the shows that you're actually Eric right?
So here like this is like like Follow The Playbook, all right?
And so I just want to, I want to outline this for you because some of you are trying to figure out a way to make more money for your customers or you should be with The Mousetrap the keep.
5:43
The key thing here that you did was use it with separate with a through the free thing they were giving away.
Free is stronger than discount.
But separated from the other service that there was being rendered, right?
A scan is one thing the assessment is another.
And so they gave this game away for free but charge for the assessment of the scan scan.
5:59
Nothing without the professionalize that can provide value from it, right?
And so that was the, that's the, that's the switch, that's the magic here.
And so now every one of these shows 130-dollar customer and the likelihood of getting one of those people to buy a two thousand dollar package is significantly higher.
6:15
And you make that argument for a chiropractor was like listen if someone's going to pay $130 they're not going to buy it.
So those are back from you're not going to be customer so let's just read those people out on the phone before hand.
And that's okay, because rather than wasting your time, you're checking your secretary we those people out ahead of time, right?
These are Aren't hard sales, right?
6:32
And so Point here is that he schedule them for phone consults.
He used the max availability from the from the front desk.
They close them.
And had, you know, whatever 100 of 126 shows like 84% show, something insane, right?
Because it was convenient and the times worked for them and they were scheduling them in that way.
6:52
Hey guys, love that you're listening to the podcast.
If you ever want to have the video version of this which usually has more effects more visuals, more graphs, you don't drawn out stuff, sometimes it can help hit the brain centers in different ways.
You can check out my YouTube channel.
It's absolutely free.
So check that out if that's what you are into and if not keep enjoying the show, All right.
7:14
And so if you want to build a mouse trap like this, think about the other offers that you can layer into this because they were already able to make, you know, off $1200.
They made they made almost 921 right clothes.
They made 921 before they sold the tooth, huh, stock packages right?
7:31
If you have 64 people, even if they suck ass all 64 of these people now have 100 dollar 130-dollar show up, right?
Right?
Sophie essentially, and if 30% of them, Were sold, which is think the average, then they would make 20 sales at two thousand dollars, right?
7:48
So they make 49,000 on $1200 bad, spend and you could easily get for the for the hundred shows that you generated your 99, your 129, or whatever on those, right.
And so, then all of a sudden all in, they paid you 10.
They paid Facebook 12:00.
8:04
So there are 11 to, and they made conservatively 50 Grand, all right?
Like, that's the that's the game that we're talking about here.
And so if any of you guys saw, The post that to me about how he had his funnel set up.
I would highly encourage you to look at the funnel, right?
8:19
He sold some of the benefits of the thing, and the opt-in was actually at the bottom of the page.
So people actually had to be a little bit more qualified, his average cost per liters, 14 bucks, right?
And so, for many of you, it's not that II heard someone say to me via message of there like funnels didn't work for us.
8:35
That's kind of, like your client saying that Facebook doesn't work for them.
It's like web pages don't work for us.
It's like you fucking kidding me.
Of course, they work.
Like you just aren't good at them.
You don't I mean like it's like kind of a ridiculous thing to say.
Of course they work.
You need to get better at it.
You need to optimize you need to make a better offer you to make better copy to make more compelling few.
8:54
No benefits that are going to resonate with that person.
And so anywho I say, let's say there's always a way sometimes you have to split some little details out that that can that can make the whole mousetrap work.
So anyways, hope you guys have a good Thursday for anybody who's in the Professional Services space.
9:11
All right, so that's physical therapist.
Kairos, whatever.
For many of you, the thing that's going to dictate what type of appointment you are, selecting is the availability of the type of appointment.
If they can give you full availability for walk-ins then, by all means, do it in person.
9:28
If they cannot, then you have to use it off the front desk or this will not work.
This game won't work.
I'm just telling, and it's not going to work with anyone else, either.
Like, they have to make these.
They have to make these changes in their business and they have to listen to you because your performance partner, right?
You're not asking for a retainer.
9:44
And if they're not willing to do that, then they cannot be a customer, right?
You have to confront that on the sale?
So, big picture, if you can find a way to separate the two things you can make you irresistible offer, independent from what you want to charge, someone, you're going to already prequalify, customers.
And that every single person who comes in the door, they already know is worth 100, 150 200 dollars.
10:03
Then all of a sudden there will make significantly more.
And I think what made that sale easy was saying I'm not going to charge you right now.
I need a card for a no-show and when you show up, it's gonna be $130 if you don't show it.
You box right into that way by doing that, they ended up getting getting the card and making sure that every single person who walked the doors already worth $130 before, before anything even happens, right?
10:25
And that's the beauty of this whole thing, right?
So as soon as the person comes in, boom, you build them.
And then they have their first console, you second set the second sale where you go through the actual, you know, package sale, that's get her, the treatment plan that's going to go with this and then pre-sell them on, you know, 30, whatever sessions at 50 bucks, 80 bucks or whatever, you know what I mean?
10:44
Is matter.
And so anyways, that's that was The Mousetrap and that was the little tweak that he did.
The first part was that, he followed instructions and used to funnel and had them schedule and, and did a phone call because you knew they had Max availability that way.
But, the backend tweak was that he separated the free offer from getting them to buy and value that front and thing.
11:04
And you didn't make it a hard sale because they didn't have to actually close 130 hours on the phone.
They said it's it's normally 264 the scan and it's 130 dollars for the thing.
So normally This $500.
All right.
But instead the to 60s on us and it's only $130, you don't have to pay for it now.
11:19
It's just once you come in, right?
That's it.
Now you do that after you get the car to the no-show, right?
And then you're going to go.
So anyways, if you did reach out to Tim, I would highly recommend doing that if your numbers are not at 50% of lead showing that I would suggest that you model the process that he did.
11:39
And that is all I got.
So have a good Thursday, hope you guys are crushing life. life and I'll catch you guys soon, but,








0:00
Real quick guys.
If you can think about how you found this podcast, somebody probably tweeted it told you about it.
Should it on Instagram or something like that?
The only way this grows is through word of mouth and so I don't run ads, I don't do sponsorships, I don't sell anything.
I only ask is that you continue to pay it forward to whoever showed you or however you found out about this Pockets that you do the exact same thing.
0:19
So if it was a review, if it was a post, if you do that would mean the world to me and you throw some good karma out there for another entrepreneur.
Any of those six channels will get you more clients than you have, but the key is to not stop.
Stop the one you're doing.
You just add this on Top?
Welcome to the game, where we talk about, how to get more customers, how to make more per customer and how to keep them longer in the many failures and lessons.
0:39
We have learned along the way.
I hope you enjoy and subscribe.
Good morning everyone.
Happy Sunday.
Hope you guys are having a restful end of your weekend.
I am still continuing to edit the book on offers, very excited about it.
0:55
And recently, I tweaked my back and so I was going to the chiropractor and I was asking us, you know, just normal business talk was like, hey, how is how's business going?
How are you getting clients?
I was like, have you tried, you know, advertising on Facebook and he said I tried Facebook didn't work for me and I just kind of laughed because like to myself, I wasn't going to try and sit there and lecture the guy or anything, but it's just, it just became really apparent to me that we don't give things a chance so quickly, right?
1:29
And so, What I wanted to do today was talk about 6 different sources for getting customers because a lot of us are like, man.
There's just only paid advertising it as somebody who's grown, you know, a ton of businesses using paid advertising, obviously, when you get good at a certain type of acquisition.
1:49
You do a lot of it, right.
But I think that there are other opportunities that we are, you know, getting into with Jim launch and their bearing fruit actually pretty quickly, but I think we're the biggest misconception is is kind of like the chiropractor.
We don't give things enough volume, we don't give things enough time.
2:06
And so what I want to do is walk through each of the six ways that I, that I know of, if I wish there were 77 with some cooler.
But I couldn't, I could literally only think of these six ways and I think they may be these six ways.
You can leave me.
Comment, if you think otherwise, but first off, you've got paid right paid advertising.
2:24
So that's all platforms.
All paid advertising platforms while placements, you know, Billboards mail drops, like, all that stuff are is paid ads, right?
It's, it's buying access to eyeballs to get clicks actions towards right?
So number one, number two, and hopefully, by walking through this, if you're looking for different ways to acquire customers, or you feel constrained with your paid advertising because Let's say you're in a local market, where there's there might be as many people that having alternative ways or additional ways to generate inflow might be valuable for you.
2:58
So that is number one.
Number two is out belt.
All right, so outbound, that's cold, calling cold, emailing, cold messenger, paying people to reach out at scale.
One-on-one, this is again, one of those ones where I feel like people really underestimate the volume right.
3:16
You need to be counting in thousands, not in not in Tens and hundreds, right?
When we're talking about outbound volume.
So like a sales rep should be doing, you know, 3,000 plus Outreach per month 100 plus per day on any of the media channels in order to get in flow, that would be acceptable.
3:37
Whenever I see people who teach outbound and whatnot, the number one issue that they deal with is that people just don't try hard enough.
They don't do enough of it, they do not do it long enough and outbound is one of those ones that also like pay traffic.
It scales and snowballs with time, right?
The longer you do paid the more kind of brand awareness in general you have and the more when you run more ads, people already know who you aren't.
3:58
So there's just an inherent Trust of being exposed to multiple times to the same degree without bound.
If you have people from two months ago, four months ago, who all of a sudden come back into the, into the fold and that's really just building a pipeline, right?
So first is paid, second is outbound and all of the channels that are associated with it.
4:17
Alright, the Third, Is referrals.
So internal referrals are your clients, referring clients to you?
Depending on how you structure this, this can be a massive inflow for you.
Jim wants to date.
I think at our last event I so into different instances.
4:33
So what we, what my financing tells me, is that we're like, 1/3 referrals, but when I went to our event and I asked everybody raise their hand.
If another gym owner had referred them, like, 80% of the room and raise our hands.
So we might not be able to track it well, but but basically, having having a lot of emphasis on creating referral processes teaching people how to refer incentivizing referrals, give me a huge inflow.
4:58
The next one is Affiliates.
So that would be like the Strategic partner.
So people who have your clients that you could send over that, you'd want them to send over and you can either, you can incentivize them directly or indirectly, a multi-ton, multitude of ways.
5:14
There's tons of companies that are built a hundred percent on a It's a Partners like, namely every MLM that exists, you know?
I mean, like there's their strong affiliate basis that if you structure it properly, people can get very incentivized by doing it.
The fifth is earned media.
5:31
All right.
So, this is, you know, if I make a post on Instagram or you make a post on your Facebook, anything that you, that platforms, have given you a certain amount of eyeballs for free because you've earned it from the value of the content that you provide.
Like literally what I'm doing right now is earned media, right?
So using that type of Media to generate in flow for the business and doing it on a regular basis, right?
5:53
And then I'm going to wrap up the last one in.
Then I'll talk kind of bigger picture about how to weave these together and the final one is owned media, right?
All the lists that you have access to.
So earn me.
Like I don't have access to you directly, but I can make a post and hope that the platform pushes his out there whereas, you know, if I email or text our list and that's direct access that's owned media.
6:12
And so, those are the six ways that I see about getting new clients, getting new inflows into your business.
But what I think is what's interesting is that you have to have one more than enough, volume done, consistently right?
And this these all the things that I'm saying right now are all the things that everyone is all the simple not easy, right?
6:31
All these things are simple to do, but not easy to do.
It's like, you know, the podcast for being a niche podcast, it is no longer.
I just rebranded it as the game but for the first, you know, two and a half years, it was just Jim content, right?
And so being in just gym content, really?
6:47
Severely limits the podcast, but I just pulled up and we get half a million downloads a year, which I was like, wow, how about that, right?
And so, which is pretty cool.
I honestly didn't know I did this.
Just for anybody who's new to this?
I am, I did I do these for me?
7:05
I I do these because I want to document the journey and kind of think about I wanna be able to go back in time.
Be like that's what I was thinking about at that time in my career and so anywho, you know we just started doing outbound sales literally in the last Last 14 days and we just turn it at our first outbound sale.
7:21
This week, we also for the first time started doing, believe it or not messaging our own media.
Like, I've literally never emailed my list, which if you are on my list, hopefully, you saw it.
It's just like, I'm just going to give really good stuff for a long time.
And every, once in awhile be like, hey, if you want to buy something, you know, you're welcome to.
7:41
But, but yeah.
But anyways, the point is, is that we're just starting to do these things and he's in a lot of this came from seeing how all the guys for doing nine figures plus.
We're doing it is that they didn't just have one acquisition Channel.
Now mind you, they built a lot of their business off one but then once they kind of I don't know if they had tapped it out.
7:59
They started to roll into other channels.
Hey guys real quick for those of you guys who are 100 million-dollar offers fans I love you.
I added in a lost chapter that has never been released.
I'm releasing it now transparently.
I'm doing that to build hype 400 dollar leads but you will have the unreleased chapter it talks about your first Avatar and how to segment customers to make more money.
8:21
You can get it by going to acquisition.com forward slash leads.
Its fo free in exchange for your email so that I can email you when we launched under Miller leads and so that you can not miss Out on it because last time I sold out for like eight straight weeks really fast.
So that is my way of making sure that y'all get first dibs.
8:39
And so, the big thing with like paid for example, is that people don't spend enough and they don't have the skill.
I think paid is one of the hardest ones because each platform is so specific and so nuanced and you have to spend a lot of money to learn the lessons.
Unfortunately, right outbound again, it is way more work its way more effort, right.
8:58
You're paying in time, not in money but a lot of times you're going to pay someone else's time to do it.
What I have noticed is that it's cheaper than paid unless a new new plan.
Form opens up.
You know maybe Tick-Tock is going to be super cheap for paid ads or whatever, who knows?
9:15
But the point is that typically I think if you look at business in cycles and you'll watch kind of the what people are teaching and what's making money right now.
I feel like if you look at it on like a 10-year Long window, it Cycles back and forth between inbound and outbound because people just always use the thing that has the cheapest cost of acquisition where they can have the most Arbitrage where they can buy eyeballs and sell them at the greatest.
9:39
See.
And so, you know, when Facebook came out, gosh, you know, 2010 it was just so ridiculously cheap that like it was cheap, it was cheaper and so much more scalable than any kind of outbound could be right now. 10 years later outbound, I would say, probably, I mean, most of the gyms right now that we have, that are doing very well, have a heavy medium, too strong, a pound component to their inflow.
10:03
And maybe when another platform opens up, they're going to be, like, screw this.
We're just going on the platform or otherwise ones we'll just Keep the flow in stack, the next floor on top, which is, which is what we're trying to do is just keep keep the flows, like, never turn a flow off.
Keep get the process dialed, and then just add flows, and add flows, and add flows.
10:22
And so with each of these, they take a lot of work.
And so I wouldn't say do like in each of them have subcategories like paid is like, you've got Facebook and Instagram, you've got, you've got, you've got, you've got YouTube, You've Got Google Display Network, you've got AdWords, like all of these things are, different places and placements.
10:39
For your paid ads and each of them is nuances.
So like if you my recommendation would be, if you have one that is consistent.
Add another of that type in there because the the systems and processes don't need to be overwhelmingly changed, right?
Like if you have outbound if you have an outbound team for example then you might have you know people who do sets which is sdrs or beauty are spending on where you look at it.
11:03
And so then it's really just like, okay we're going to just also add people who are doing message or question man, but all of them are feeding to this team.
Then set close calls, right?
And so you know, with a referral strategy, like you need to constantly be pouring into that with Affiliates, right?
Because our whole cell phone company and our software company both based on the Affiliates having a structure in place that you continue to pour value until you continue to hone and refine continue to stick with them is the hard part.
11:30
That's the volume that no one does.
Everyone thinks that they did 100 cold calls and they're like, why didn't I make money?
It's like we need to do 200 every day, right, that's it.
Like yeah, that's how that works.
Well, I emailed a hundred people.
It's like we need to know like 500 a day.
Oh, I didn't understand that.
11:47
Well, I tried paid ads.
It's like when you spend $500, you need to spend $500 a day like.
Oh right.
Like I made five posts and I didn't get any clients.
It's like, well, you need to make, you know, five pieces of content a week for two years and then you will have your earned media like, oh right, I sent out my first email.
12:09
I didn't make money.
Well, you know, maybe you have no good, well yet.
And you need to do it more frequently.
And so I say all that to say, hopefully, for some of you who want more flows of clients, just thinking about one of those six, whether it's paid, whether its outbound, whether it's referrals, whether its Affiliates, or strategic Partners earned media owned media, any of those six channels will get you more clients than you have.
12:30
But the key is to not stop the one you're doing.
You just add this on top, right?
And so if you're like, well, I don't know if I could add this on top because the other one Not systematize.
Yes, then cool.
Let's get the other one system sized and then add this on top, and that's part of the game.
12:46
I mean, that's part of the business game.
That's why people don't go from 0 to 10, acquisition channels and their first month.
Like it takes time and it takes skills to find the people and all of those many lovely things about business.
And so, anyways, I hope you're having an amazing Sunday.
I hope this give you at least a light bulb of one of those six ways, that you might be able to potentially add in or experiment with, if you have someone else who's doing, Doing some of those other pieces for you and you're like, man, I'd like to directly contribute to the bottom line, I'd like to drum up more business or or you might just be freaked out by the fact that you only have one acquisition Channel.
13:19
I mean, I certainly have been for many, you know, for plenty of times with Jim launch that are our biggest acquisition, General, still still pay it on Facebook and Instagram, and so, and just just you guys are updated on my journey with this.
The reason that we now have email, Outbound that's that's working and outbound with cold calling is, we're doing both of those that the reason that those are actually working is that I let go and stop trying to do everything.
13:46
And so I brought in one of the best email marketers out there to help us get our, you know, our SMTP whatever set up so that we had better deliver building.
Because a lot of the email providers, they spam block anything that's marketing related and a.
And so like we got somebody to some specialist to do that so we can make sure our emails actually got the Delivered to people, which we had like no deliverability apparently, which is why I didn't email because it never seemed to do.
14:13
And so, you know, I was able to let go and let this guy do something, he's way better at than me.
And then we brought in a guy who's really good at outbound, any built-in outbound team and just letting just getting out of his way and letting him do that.
And so, it's just this constant, at least for me right now, it's this constant journey of Letting Go and finding people who can do the things better than I am hiring Solutions.
14:34
Not people, She's very different way.
And I mean many of us probably like have done the thing, and that's how you have to start, right?
You do the thing, you learn the thing and then you teach someone else to thing to do the thing for you, right?
But at a certain point, and this is, you know, this is why there's always levels to the game at a certain point.
14:50
You don't you don't think how.
But you think who you don't think what you think?
Who can I find?
Who already has this?
This problem, there's solution pre-loaded into them.
They already solved.
This problem.
They've already done this before and I don't need to learn it.
15:05
I need to To find that person and incentivize them in a way that would get them excited.
So anyways, hope that was all before you hope they give you one lightbulb of one of the six ways paid outbound referrals.
Affiliates earned media and owned media, one of those six ways to hopefully help you generate another inflow and my recommendation is systematize around it, right?
15:27
Create a consistent system, not a one-time one off thing.
Because if it is not consistent for any of those six things, it will not work in the long run.
So if you're not sure how to do it, go read blogs about it.
Go read, you know, go on YouTube and look at what people are saying, and you'll probably get a lot from that.
15:46
So, anyways, lots of love, have an amazing Sunday and I'll catch you guys on the flip side, but,








0:00
Hey guys, love that.
You're listening to the podcast.

Sometimes it can help hit the brain centers in different ways.
You can check out my YouTube channel, it's absolutely free.
Go check that out, if that's what you are into.
0:16
And if not keep enjoying the show, I'm pretty excited because I think you guys will all immediately be able to make a lot more money.
Welcome to the game, where we talk about, how to get more customers, how to make more per customer and how to keep them longer and the many failures.
And lessons, we have learned Along the way.
I hope you enjoy and subscribe.
0:32
What's going on, everyone?
Happy Wednesday, super pumped to make this podcast for you.
I have so many things that I want to share with everyone because I'm writing this book and I just finished it yesterday.
I'm still working on the title but basically it's going to be about how to make magical offers so offer.
0:51
So good.
That people feel stupid saying no and I walked through the different monetization structures that we've discovered over our time and A lot of the magical offers that created the businesses that we have.
So, one of the subsections of a subsection inside of this book is naming the actual offers and so I figured I would make this for you guys because I see a lot of people struggling with making the offers especially in local markets convert, right?
1:20
And so one of the key pieces, I think for understanding the differences, you have a, the offer, like the monetization structure, which is behind the scenes, which is what you're Going to sell in the person comes in and the upsells, and then you have the naming convention like what you're going to actually wrap around that to the general marketplace, right?
1:38
And so over, you know, for years, you may not actually change the monetization structure of the business, but you may change the naming Convention of the thing that you're shown to the marketplace 20 times, right?
And so the the magic offer headline formula that I put together is actually an acronym to make it easy to remember, all right?
1:58
So magic and GIC right stands for em.
The magnet.
So what's the what's the Matt netiq reason why something's going to click?
Is it free?
Is a discounted, is it Springtime?
Like there's got to be a reason for why we're doing the offer.
That's the m in Magic, a is Avatar so the avatars to know that it's specifically for them.
2:19
So the idea is you're trying to discriminate against everyone else, all right?
So this would be like, you know, be cave mobs, right?
Or dentists, right?
These are like Like, you know, older dentist or dentist making over 20,000 a month.
Whatever?
Right.
So to me discriminatory nature.
2:35
So first is grabbing their attention with a magnetic reason.
Why M A is Avatar.
So you're discriminating against everyone else in just pulling at your avatar.
G is the goal right?
What's the goal of this thing that we're marketing to them?
2:51
Right?
If it's a you know pain-free is that the goal is little black dress.
The goal is you know filled up Clinic the goal like what's the Right.
It's DJ the eye is indicate a time interval, right?
3:07
You want to give them some sort of time interval, that this is going to happen in, right?
So, 12 weeks, six months, 30 days, six hours, whatever it is, right?
So it's the, I is the interval of time and then C is the container, right?
3:22
So you have these first four things, you got the thing that grab their attention, give them the reason why, right?
You discriminated for exactly who you're looking for, which is the The Avatar a you gave them the goal that they're gonna get really excited about G.
You told them when it's going to happen I and then finally have to package all that together into a container, right?
3:40
And that's why in some in sometimes I used to call it the power word but I like using the word container because you're just kind of containing all these things in this word so that's incubator intensive challenge, blueprint system Sprint, kickoff jumpstart like all of those things are container words for the first four parts.
3:59
Of this.
And so when I'm looking at trying to make headlines for things are different, variations of headlines, you might make 10 different variations.
And if you use that, that acronym magic, right?
The magnet the Avatar, the goal, the interval, and the container.
You'll be able to make quick variations of these things for the same offer in terms of monetization structure to the marketplace.
4:23
Hey, most efficient quick break just to let you know that we've been starting to post on LinkedIn and want to connect with you.
Alright, so send me a connection request.
A note.
Let him know that you listen to the show and I will accept it.
There's anyone you think that would be should be connected with tag them in one of my or Layla's posts?
And I will give you all the love in the world.
4:39
All right, so let's get back to the show.
All right, so you can and this will keep your ads fresh, right?
This is what's going to keep them popping and continue to convert.
And what happens is you don't have to change the back end right now to change the actual business model, how you make money, it's just changing the front.
4:57
And so with any of these things, the things especially that you're going to be switching will be the duration of time.
It may be, the goal may be the reason why the magnet right now, who you're calling out to the Avatar.
It's unlikely to change but you To be specific about who you're looking for.
5:16
Within a local market, you might want to you might, you might call out specific.
If you're calling out men versus women, you're going to have different.
Looking creative, different-looking funnels.
If you're calling those people out, right?
If you're calling out men over 40 verses 20 year old guys, very different creative, very different copy, very different everything, right?
5:31
And so that business that you have or you might be serving might serve a specific type of clientele or even if they don't you can sub segment out the type of clients in and then you have higher converting offers because to that discriminatory Specific Avatar, this goal might be better than the goal for a 35 year, old mom, right?
5:49
Very different.
And so big picture in creating that formula I like having acronyms that are easy to remember and so magical offer.
So magic headlines.
So magnetic Avatar is called out go intention.
6:05
Sorry.
Interval and then And container, right?
And so I have a nice cool little graphic that goes with it.
That's in the book, the books like 320 pages right now.
So I'm super excited about it.
Then you're gonna love it.
The first people I've seen it too.
6:20
Maybe I'm, they said it's really good, and I'm pretty excited because I think you guys will all immediately be able to make a lot more money.
The entire first half of the book is about basically creating the single offer and then the second half of the book is all the tactics.
6:38
And monetization the different ways you can weave in free different ways, you can weave in discount offers and so drag as much cash as possible up front.
So, anyways, hope you guys dig that.
Hope you guys write that down and use that for your creative teams.
When you guys are making offers, especially in a local Marketplace.
6:54
Like that's what I was like, if you're, if you're marketing nationally, your marketing B2B.
You don't need a very at the offers nearly as much, but when you're marketing b2c and like a local market, you've got to change headlines.
All the time, you know?
I mean, you need to change headlines very frequently.
7:11
A lot of time, you know, every 12 weeks, every, every, every month, sometimes you have to change the wrapper for the thing.
It's not that you're changing.
The thing, you're offering, but you need to make sure that you're getting around Banner blindness.
And so they're not like, oh, I've already seen this thing.
So, anyway, so those are our four.
You hope that made sense of that gives you a easy contract to think through making headlines.
7:28
You don't need to use all five of them when you're making your head like a sometimes I like to get long.
So in my in my thought process around us is What I found useful is make it as short as possible, but no shorter, right?
Ideally hit off, head all five but if you feel like some of them get too long, then you can chop off, one of them, one of the pieces, and it's an interesting example of this would be sometimes, there are container words that kind of hit to needs.
7:58
So like if I said a free six week, summer, slim down, I've got free and summer, which are both kind of magnet or E reason why It's I've got six weeks, which is the duration, right?
And then slim down, slim down is kind of both a goal, but it's also a container.
8:17
And so words can be can have multiple uses within it.
And so I would need to add like container system.
Sorry, I like lean down blueprint.
Like it just seemed kind of duplicative.
And so being selective about the words that you're choosing will ultimately allow you to have more brevity the headline, and make them punchier.
8:33
And the extra bonus points that you get for this.
If you can get any of those aspects to rhyme.
It will count for two.
So anyways, lots of hope you guys use this and I'll catch you guys soon.
But








0:00
Hey guys, real quick.
So Leyland are definitely working on our social media presence.
If you guys haven't noticed and we're just breaking now into LinkedIn.
All right.
It's not as bad as I thought it's actually a pretty awesome so far and you guys have been really cool in there and people are sharing our stuff a lot.
So if we aren't connected on LinkedIn, it go ahead and let's connect, and let's rock and roll.
0:17
And so hopefully if you're running paid ads right now and you're trying to get leads and you're like, how does this work?
These are the pieces.
Welcome to the game, where we talk about, how to get more customers, how to make more per customer, and how to keep them longer and the many failures.
And lessons, we have learned And along the way.
I hope you enjoy and subscribe.
What's going on, everyone?
0:33
Happy Wednesday.
Hope you guys are as excited as I am for the new setup that we have here.
I can't even tell you how stoked I am.
This has been a long time coming.
Thank you guys for, you know, the the support and just the messages that I've been getting as been great.
So what I want to talk about today is so many of the ideas that I can finally put on paper and make visual for everyone, which is how to fix lead cost, right?
0:57
And I think one of the things that I like and I This, when I started out was, you know, I had like one play, one way that I knew how to do and it was just like, okay, don't change anything because I don't know how any of this works.
I just know that.
Like, when I run this to this, it does.
Okay, but the thing is, as soon as it breaks, then I was like, crap, what am I supposed to do now, right?
1:15
And so, in thinking, through this, it's it really came down to understand the aggregate parts.
And so, it's kind of like, when I started, you know, in Fitness, you had your own kind of, way of doing things as that's what work for you, right?
You're always trying all these new diets and stuff and then finally, when we Works and you're like this is the way, you know, it's keto or it's intermittent fasting or it's veganism or whatever, right?
1:35
And so then when you get a first client, you're like, okay, do this and don't change anything in the thing is obviously, some people need different things but on top of that, when you don't understand all the integral integral pieces of, you know, programming Etc.
Then when someone gets stuck, you don't know how to fix anything because you just know how this whole thing works together.
1:53
And that's all I know, right?
And so once I figured this out within the marketing, all my anxiety around, Inge and paid advertising Etc.
Just kind of went by the wayside because I just understood all of the integral integral pieces so that I could fix it, all right?
2:08
And so there's three pieces to figuring out what your cost per lead is, all right and I'm going to break down each of these things.
And this is going to be a big kind of bigger picture overview and I literally just went through this so I thought it would be valuable for you.
So we just ran into campaigns.
We ran a we're in 25A challenges back to back and we had different different campaign cost and cost per group opt-in.
2:29
And so I wanted to figure out what the issue was.
All right.
And so the way that paid ads work from a from a to z Soup, To Nuts, right?
Is understanding that fundamentally what we're doing is we're buying eyeballs.
All right, so in the beginning you're going to buy this nice eyeball from Facebook or YouTube or Google, right?
2:47
They're going to there's a little little people for you, right?
You're going to buy these eyeballs and these eyeballs for most markets will cost around $25.
There's obviously some niches that will be more expensive but for most the cost per eyeballs 25 How many eyeballs does that cost?
And the term for this is CPM.
3:04
All right?
And just so you don't get confused about this CP foremost, CP stuff is cost per, right?
So you only got to remember what the last letter means.
So m is just the Roman numeral for 1000, so cost per thousand.
So cost 4000 eyeballs is $25 simple.
Right?
Which means is two and a half cents inaudible crazy stuff, right?
3:21
And so you buy 1000 eyeballs, I'm going to put a thousand under here just to make this really simple here.
All right.
And then from there, you're gonna have a certain In percentage that taken action, right?
That click all right.
And so we call that the CTR right click through rate.
That's what that stands for.
CT are now we really look for Unique, click through because that's what we care about is not one guy, clicking a hundred times, but I want to know how many unique people click the add now from a benchmark, standpoint, normally going to have between you know point five percent in one percents kind of like average you get above 1% you're doing.
3:53
Well if you get above 2% you're just killing everyone, right?
So let's just say we have 1%, all right, that's what our click-through rate is.
So we've got 1,000 eyeballs. 1% click what that means is we're going to get 10 clicks, right?
A thousand times, one percent is 10 clicks.
4:10
All right, so hopefully this is starting to make sense.
Most Nation real quick.
If you are a business owner that has a big old business and wants to get to a much bigger business, going to fifteen hundred dollars.
Plus, we would love to talk to you and if you like that or like to hear more about it, go to acquisition.com, you planning on the page and talk to one of our team and see if we can help you get there.
4:36
Now, what's my CPC remember?
CP was the see click my cost per click?
So my cost per click is a me this 10 klicks from $25.
So if I have $25, right and I get 10 clicks, then it means that my cost per click is $2.50, right?
4:55
It's just 25 dollar lie, / 10 cost per right now.
It's still not my cost per lead.
So what's the next thing that's going to happen?
My 10 clicks, all right are going To go to a landing page.
And then I'm going to have a conversion percentage on this page, right?
5:11
Not 100% clicks, obviously become leads.
And so what's my conversion percentage?
I'm going to use 20% because for a lot of people that's that's going to be a good starting point for many of you in terms of what a decent conversion percentage, can be in some niches, you can make it better and it depends on your offer etcetera.
5:27
But let's just use 20%.
And so what that means is The of my 10 20 % or opting in which means I get to leads.
All right, so the next question is what's my cost per lead?
So we did cost per click here.
5:42
My cost per lead is going to be $25 just like before / to leads which means my cost per lead is $12.50.
Right?
And so, the reason that it's so important, and I remember when I figured like when I understood this part because this part, I kind of understood but But not where the actual cost per came from right?
6:03
Is that if I'm looking at a campaign like my own, the last campaign I ran side-by-side campaign, a I had more expensive eyeballs, but I had more clicks and I had a higher conversion, all right?
And so that might mean that what I had was a little bit spammy or more like direct response e0 and because of that, the platform doesn't like those things as much.
6:26
They charge me more for the eyeballs because it wasn't as engaging right?
The audience thought it was really interesting, so they clicked more and they thought the offer was better.
So they opted in one, right?
We tried another one to decrease, our CPM, and be a little bit more friendly to the platform and we did drop our cpms, but our click-through rate and our conversion on the page actually went down and overall we ended up actually doubling our cost.
6:51
And so looking at each of these pieces, is how you can diagnose your campaigns and ultimately be able to fix it, right?
And so for me, this was like a huge Breakthrough in understanding that took.
I mean, honestly probably took me two or three years to actually understand this.
And so hopefully if you're running paid ads right now and you're trying to get leads and you're like, how does this work?
7:10
These are the pieces, right?
This is going to be how much the platform likes you and how many other people are marketing to that same audience.
That's where the cost is going to come from for your click-through rate.
It's going to be how compelling your messaging is and how good the creative might be.
And then the same thing here on your conversion.
7:26
Is how good is the offer?
How good is the headline?
How compelling?
You know how?
Well designed is the page.
How fast is it?
Load, Etc.
So you can increase this conversion percentage.
A lot of times people want to lower their lead costs, and they just look here because they feel like it's the only thing they can understand.
7:42
When a lot of times you're sometimes losing or winning the war based on the click-through rate or what you're actually, how your ads are being displayed.
And so one of the first things I do when I'm looking at a campaign if it's not acting, right?
Is I'm looking at my cpms, I'm like, well how much is it costing for us to get this displayed and if it's like 80, you know, eighty dollar Plus cpms.
8:01
I'm like, okay, I don't think that's reason why.
I think we Som something is missed in the creative.
We really need to fix this and so then, I don't, I don't look at my funnel.
I'm not, I'm not worried about could through rates because I know that this is the big issue, right?
If my click-through rate is like, point to that, I'm like, alright, our messaging is way off.
8:16
I don't need to worry about this other stuff because this is where I need to focus.
If I've got a you know, a page is converting at 5%.
Then I'm going to try and fix this because these two don't even matter if I'm at that percentage.
So hopefully this makes sense like when you're when you're walking through trying to fix campaigns and Not an understanding, each of the integral Parts allows us at least for me to be able to not have anxiety around this stuff, because it just feels like, all right?
8:39
They're just variables, they play together and I just need to fix the thing that's broken.
And then, as soon as it's fixed, it works, which is the point.
So, hopefully those value before you hoping this is cool.
Hopefully you like the new setup.
I'm super.
I'm like Beyond stoked about it.
I can finally, I can make these on my own.
8:55
Now, I'm so like so excited and so, anyways, if you like the setup, shoot, a comment, shoot a review, You tag somebody and if you like more stuff like this, hopefully do because it's going to be done, then, I can't wait to give you more stuff.
So keeping awesome.
Lots of love and I'll catch you guys soon.

You tag somebody and if you like more stuff like this, hopefully do because it's going to be done, then, I can't wait to give you more stuff.
So keeping awesome.
Lots of love and I'll catch you guys soon.








0:00
Real quick.
Because you guys already know that, I don't run any ads on this and I don't sell anything.
And so, the only ask that I can ever have you guys that you help me spread the word so we can have more entrepreneurs, make more money, feed their families, make better products, and have better experiences for their employees and customers.
And the only way we do that is if you can rate and review and share this podcast, so the single thing that I have to do is you can just leave review will take you 10 seconds or one type of the thumb, mean, the absolute world to me.
0:25
And more importantly, it may change the world of someone else, if you've ever Struggled at the end of the month and worked all the way there to only to look at the bank account.
And find that there was nothing there.
There was too little for you to take out and then like I literally just worked for an entire month for nothing.
0:40
Then this video is for you, welcome to the game, where we talk about it, get more customers how to make more per customer and how to keep them longer in the many failures and lessons.
We have learned along the way, I hope you enjoy and subscribe.
So one of the number one issue that I see when I talk to small business, owners are missing or medium-sized business owners, is that they don't have an adequate grasp on the difference between gross and net.
1:00
Ian and the reason I'm coloring the background green and I'm using my green pen.
Is that margin is about the money.
So this is a topic that people do not talk about it is also probably the number one thing that I look at in a business determine its health and whether I would be interested in investing or any of those types of things.
1:15
So let me break down the difference between gross margin and net margin and then I'm going to tell you the functional ways that I use to fix a business.
Alright, so gross margin Gross margin is what the direct cost of fulfilling your goods or services are.
1:33
And so the equation for it, don't get everyone's like, I don't like math, it's subtraction.
All right, it's not math that you beer, you're confused about if you like zone out at this moment.
It's because you don't want to do the thinking to understand the words on to be really clear.
I'm literally going to use subtraction here.
All right, it's the revenue.
1:49
How much money you're making?
- the cost of goods sold.
All right, that's the cogs.
Now, the thing is, If you're in a service business, your cost of goods, sold isn't the physical products that you're selling, you're not selling those, you're selling people, you're selling payroll hours, all right?
And so the cost of goods sold for a service business which is what the majority of people are listening to this are using is the incremental cost of the additional unit, which means that that doesn't count your front desk.
2:15
Girl, that doesn't count your HR Director, it doesn't count your rent, none of that stuff counts.
It's just the cost of one additional unit, all right, very important.
Our net margin.
I'm going to give you examples in a second.
Your net margin is, is your chop, right?
2:32
That's, which it's the juice.
At the end of the month.
It's what you get after everything is paid.
What's left over?
That's what you end up taking home.
All right, but the gross margin in my opinion.
Well, they're both obviously very important but the gross margin is the one that baguettes that creates the net margin.
And this is the one where I always focus.
2:49
And this is the thing that I fixed and this is what I help people fix.
And this is the game.
All right, so my Revenue Minus cost.
So let's say we're selling a service for $60 per per, you know, per hour.
That's what, that's what it let's just say.
You know, you're a hairstylist, are your trainers Mount, right?
3:06
You're selling $60 right in your business and your cost of goods sold.
Let's say is 20 bucks, right?
You're paying somebody $20 for the sixty dollar thing.
You're like, that sounds good.
There's $40 left over for me, this makes sense.
Right wrong.
3:22
All right.
And I'll get get to why in a second.
And what number I use?
Use, but let's just do this.
So you can understand what the gross margin is here.
So the gross margin on this and that's assuming we're not using any product to, like, work on this if you were like a hairstylist, for example, but let's just say, simply here $60 is what you're charging. $20 is what it costs and $40 is left over right now what you do to figure out your margins, you take that $40 right?
3:45
What's left over /.
The sixty dollars of Revenue which is what you got gross and what that does is it gets 66%.
That's the gross margin.
You're like, oh, that sounds reasonable.
That's not that much, you know, that's not that bad.
The thing is each incremental, gross margin point is enormous and so let me show you the difference.
4:05
So let's say at the end of the year, you're running a business that runs on 66 percent gross margins and let's say at the very end of the year now we're in the net margin category.
You you end up with 12 percent margins.
All right, now most brick-and-mortar businesses run around their crazy, right?
But that's what most brick-and-mortar businesses run around.
4:22
So if you're at 12 percent margins and I say, Listen, you got to be at 80 people like well, 80 and 66.
It's not that different.
If you bumped your margins to 80%, What happens at the end of the year.
That's 14.
All right, so what that does is you now have twenty six percent Net margins.
4:43
The theater.
We more than doubled.
We 2.2 x.
How much you make?
So, do you think this is important?
Can I double how much you make simply by changing this one number?
Yes.
All right.
So let's use the 80% example, which by the way, is my rule of thumb.
5:00
This is the number that I get any service based business over.
All right, doesn't matter what you're selling.
This is what you have to get over.
All right now, I'll show you different scene, 80 90, 95, 100 in a second, but this is important.
All right, so if 80% gross margins, what I need, there's two ways I can do it one.
5:19
I can decrease this.
Cost, right?
I could say that I get this to twelve twelve dollars, right?
This becomes 12 bucks.
So cross that out.
And now my, my new take home on this is $48, right?
And so $48, Over 60.
5:40
Equals eighty percent.
So one way you can increase your margins, decrease your cost, gross margin, the cost of actually doing the thing, right?
The second way is by increasing how much you charge this guy, right?
And so let's say instead a 60 and we have this 20.
So what is how do we get 80% leftover, if we have a twenty dollar cost?
6:00
Well, it's easy with this number because 20 is 20 percent, right?
And so that means that you'd have to charge $100 for your twenty dollar thing to have.
An 80 percent margin and so way.
Number one, you decrease, the cost of fulfilling the thing.
We number two, you increase the price right now.
6:18
This is why this is so important.
Obviously, I showed you at the end of the year, you'd have a lot of money, but besides that, if you're making a hundred dollar or you're charging a hundred dollars or something, right, and it cost you 20, you got 80 dollars left over.
6:35
All right, now from that $80 and here's what's important, you have to pay for everything else in the business and have enough money to Market, to acquire more customers and you have to have enough money to have a profit, right?
And so, it seems like you're like, 80% Alex, that's crazy.
6:53
And so, by the way, all successful business that the biggest business in the world, they're not running 80 percent margins, they're running 99% gross margins.
All right?
And you're like, well, they're only, that's only 19% more.
It's actually not, it's so much more than that.
So let me break down this difference real quick and then I'll finish this example.
7:10
So, the difference between eighty percent margins Ninety percent margins. 95 percent margins.
Right.
I'll just go all the way to 100, right?
And 100, let's do this.
Is that difference between 80 and 90?
7:26
Is that this is twice as profitable as this.
Why?
Because it's half the cost, right?
Means I took that 20 and made it ten, right?
That's the difference.
You're looking at this side of the equation, not all of this.
All right.
Additionally, 90 and 95 percent gross margins again twice.
7:43
Is profitable.
And what I mean by that is that you can sell twice as many people for the same cost, that is the magic.
And that is how you scale, that is, how you get something that's enormously profitable, allows you to acquire customers and has tons of profit kicking off every single month.
7:59
And so, this is where a lot of entrepreneurs.
Get messed up because they feel bad about charging a lot for their services or a lot for their products or whatever.
Right.
But the thing is that, if you do not do this, you will make no profit and you will not be able to scale.
You want to help more people.
Less you get this, right?
8:14
So you got to get over this mental barrier, that you have around what you are able to charge for things that don't cost you a lot of money.
Hey, guys, real quick.
If you're new to the podcast, I've a book on Amazon called 100 million-dollar offers that over eight thousand five star reviews.
8:31
It has almost a perfect score.
You can get it for 99 cents on Kindle.
The reason I bring it up is that I put over a thousand hours in the writing that book and it's my biggest gift to our community.
So it's my very Shameless way of trying to get you to like me more and ultimately make more dollars to that later on in your business career as a partner with you.
8:48
So that's my give go check it out Amazon and back to the show.
Right, right.
Okay, so back to this example.
So if I have 80 dollars left over, that means that it depends on what my cost of acquisition is.
9:04
So let's say, you know, there's a certain percentage of my Revenue that I'm willing to give for cost of acquisition.
Let's say it's 20%, right?
So if 20% this I'm willing to give that means that $16 is what I have left to Market this, right?
Because you see like you can only use it off of what's left you and you still Well, after you pay your marketing, right?
9:26
You still have the rest of your cost.
You still have rent, you still have payroll.
You still have, you know, a role for all the non-essential stuff.
You still have software, first of all these other costs of doing business, all right?
They have to come out of just the remainder between here and here.
9:41
All right, this is the game.
And so in sum total here, if I'm looking at a business, the big number that I'm looking at is 80% and that's I Target I Target any business.
Especially for service that's over 80%.
10:00
And so, if I'm trying to invest in something, I'm trying, like this is the game that we get to.
And so, you can do this for any brick, and mortar business for your business, for anything.
You got to be over 80 and ideally pushing from eighty to ninety or ninety to ninety-five at each of these increments doubles the productivity of the business again, right?
10:20
And that's where it gets magical.
And so, the two ways you can do it, just as a quick recap to increase.
Your gross margin is number one.
You can decrease the cost.
And number two, you can increase the price.
And that is how you can increase your gross margin percentage.
10:39
Alright, so I hope that was all before.
You hope that made sense.
I hope if you look at your own services and you're like well like what's my gross margin?
Break it down, what's the additional cost for one more person?
Right?
If I like I said earlier, if I was selling something for $60 and if you don't know, let's say you've got one person, I'll give you one more example for this.
11:00
Let's say you've got the type of business where one person fulfills for many people because I don't know what my cost would be.
So actually had this example not that long ago, is that a mastermind and a guy said he's got coaches and Coach people, right?
And so I said, well, what are, you know, what are your gross margin seems like?
11:15
I have no idea.
I was like, well, let's walk through it together.
So he was paying his coach four thousand dollars a month.
All right, that's what he's paying his couch.
And I said, cool, how many clients can your coach handle?
You said, well, my coach can handle. 40 people, write 40 clients.
11:33
I was like, okay, what do you charge your clients per month?
Is why sell packages?
And I was like, all right?
What are your package is costing is like it there.
Twelve hundred dollar packages.
I was like, okay, what is $1200?
Get me.
You said gets you three months?
I'm going to give you a real world example, yourself please.
You Dice take this?
All right, which means that it's four hundred dollars per month if you spread it out, right.
11:53
So he's got 40 clients. $400 a month is, what is what?
They're what, they're charging.
All right.
Which means 40 times, 400.
Hopefully, my math is right here is 160,000.
Hopefully, my messing something up here.
I think it's 160,000 04 times. 4,000 not 16,000.
12:13
That's like whoa.
It's sixteen thousand dollars per month, right?
That's cool, right?
That's neat.
So sixteen thousand dollars per month and the cost of the coaches, 4,000, right?
Everyone following with me so means that there's 12,000 left over So that's what's left over after the cost and then we're just dividing it by the total revenue.
12:37
Right?
Which is this guy just bring it back down so it's just 12 divided by 16, right?
Which in this instance we 75% So he's close to 80 but he's like well you know, I don't want to change anything because because I'm already a 75 but remember at the end of the year, the end of the year let's say you've got fifteen percent margins.
12:58
Right let's just say the end of the year.
You got 15% bumping the extra five takes you to 20 right?
You're like oh wow, that doesn't seem like a big difference 15 to 20% net margins.
At the end of the year is a 25%.
Increase and how much money you make?
13:16
That is how important this is.
And so anyways, so what do you need to do?
Either has to pay this guy less, or he's got a charge charge more money here.
And so the way to figure this out backwards, if you wanted to, if you didn't want to change, excuse me, if you did want to change your your price to get it over 80%, then you simply basically increase with this number needs to be until it's 80%.
13:40
So gosh, what's the it?
one point six times eight, whatever 8 and then God, it's 12.8.
Yeah so that would mean that he has to get to 12,800 if you wanted to get over 80%, which means he either needs to charge the the extra 40 clients and extra two hundred dollars now $20.
14:07
Yeah, you need to charge an extra 20 bucks here right per month or he could pay this coach 3200 per month and that is how he would get from 75 to 80%.
Aunt and that my friends is the game.
14:23
So I hope you found this useful.
Hopefully you like this.
Hopefully thought this was awesome.
If you didn't well at least I'm a I just want to make stuff that you guys find my label.
This is the game.
This is the stuff that I dive super deep into.
I'm trying to fix a business model or Consulting with somebody and I hope you find it valuable to.
So anyways, keeping awesome.
14:39
Please leave a poster review or any of that.
Good stuff.
And I will see you on the next one.
Bye.

Most Nation real quick.
If you are a business owner that has a big old business and wants to get to a much bigger business, going to 50 $100.
Plus, we would love to talk to you and if you like that or would like to hear more about it, go to acquisition.com, you can play anywhere on the page and talk to one of our team and see if we can help you get there.
0:18
What's going on everyone?
If you've ever struggled to figure out all the different numbers in marketing and figure out what's important, what's not important, what's good?
What's bad and you just can't get your stuff to converter.
You can't make you can't make Of all the stuff.
Then this video is for you.
Welcome to the game where we talk about, how to get more customers, how to make more per customer and how to keep them longer in the many failures and lessons.
0:38
We have learned along the way.
I hope you enjoy and subscribe.
So when I got into marketing, there were so many different numbers.
Kpis cplc PC like ctrs.
I like I was like, I was I had no idea.
My head was spinning out, trying to figure it out and over time, it's kind of like you start to distill down what are the big buckets of things that matter?
0:57
And then once you discovered, those three are Then you can open up the drawer and look for more details and whatnot.
And so, what I want to do is outline, the three numbers that I'm looking at a high level in any business that I'm looking to invest in our, I'm looking to partner with or whatever.
All right, and I'll show you the relationship between them that I am looking for and hopefully that will help you for your own business.
1:17
So, the first number is what my cost of acquisition is, which I call Keck.
All right?
It's not I call it, that's what people call it, right?
Cost of acquisition or CAC, right?
So, how much does it cost me to acquire customer?
Now this number, You should include everything.
So that means your sales commission.
1:32
That means your ad spend means the marketing team.
That created the inquiries, whatever your software that's associate.
With its all of the costs of acquisition put together.
That is CAC.
Alright, number two, Is LTV.
Now, I Define this a little bit differently because I think it's important.
1:51
So LTV is not the total revenue that I'm going to get over that right lifespan of a customer.
But for me, it's the total gross profit that I'm going to get over the last bit of customer.
So let me give you a simple example.
So if I were selling meals for example, or selling food and my cost of delivering food, let's say was nine bucks.
2:10
All right.
And I know that someone's going to order $700 a month of food and it We $9 and I'm selling it for 10.
All right, that means only have a 10%, margin gross profit, right?
Gross profit on the meal sold and so 700 dollars of food over the lifespan of a customer, might sound like a huge LTV but the reality is, it's actually only 70 which is what I'm going to make on that customer, right?
2:37
And so the reason I use gross profit is that if I were doing marketing for food for example and you know my marketing was like hey man, we're spending too.
Hundred dollars to acquire a customer who's going to pay a $700.
I would be like that's horrible because we only make seventy dollars on the 700 which means that we're spending 200 to make 70, right.
2:54
And that's why it's so important to understand them gross margin of your business, right?
Because this is where all of your decision should be based off of.
All right it's on that margin.
The third number is what I call 30-day cash.
3:10
All right, now in the formal business world, the fancy World, they Call this.
They use a different metric.
They call it payback period, which is how long does it take you to pay back your cost of acquisition, right?
Because inherently whenever you're getting a customer, there's usually a cost that's put into it.
3:27
And that cost might, there's always a cost of either paying in time or you're paying in money or you're paying in someone else's time, which is then payroll.
I was, but there's always a cost, right?
There's a cost of acquiring customer and then you have the payback period.
I use 30-day cash for this reason.
3:44
I think that virtually every business can gain access to a credit line which means a credit card or an Amex or even a bank and loan you, whatever, we're over 30 days.
They can they can use that money and then pay it back.
Virtually interest-free credit cards are all interest free for the first 30 days, all right?
4:02
At least all the ones I'm aware of, right?
And so that means is that if I can, if I can know what the my 30-day cash value is, and if I can get that to be, at least equal to my kak, then it means that I can use other people's Has money to acquire customers.
And this is why we've had such big growth in the companies that I've had is that I don't actually need to use my own money to acquire customers.
4:22
I can use someone else's money, acquire them get the money in the first 30 days to pay back the debt.
And now, I'm left over with customers and ideally customers and profit that I can still continually upsell into continuity if you can understand the words that I'm saying, right now you understand how big of a deal.
4:38
This is.
All right.
So what are the relationships that I'm looking for?
So, for me, For LTV like, from looking at it because there's there's different relationships that I need to draw here.
And what I'm looking about how the marketing is working.
Alright, so my LTV to kak ratio I want to always have greater greater than three, two, one.
5:01
All right.
Three two, one is the number that I'm looking for, which means that I need to be able to generate more than three times, the cost of acquisition in gross profit.
Look, look, guys.
5:17
You guys already know that.
I don't run any ads on this and I don't sell anything.
And so, the only ask that I can ever have you guys that you help me, spread the words we cannot more entrepreneurs, make more money, feed their families, make better products and have better experiences for their employees and customers.
The only way we do that is if you can rate and review and share this podcast, so the single thing that I have to do is you can just leave review but they can 10 seconds or one type of the thumb to means the absolute world to me.
5:41
And more importantly, it may change the world for someone else.
All right, so that means let's say my gross profit, I'll get a number another numbers.
Let's say that my gross profit on a service that I sell, is, is 80%.
All right?
5:56
We'll use that as a number and so it's 80% is my gross profit and I have a thousand dollar lifetime, all right?
That's how much they're going to spend a lot of time.
Which means eight hundred dollars is what I am going to use as my number.
6:12
Now if $800 is what I make then I have to 321 be able to acquire customers for less than 270 or 260 5.66 dollars, right?
So, my cost of acquisition has to be less than $266.
6:31
All right.
That's the total thing.
Now, that's the first relationship that I'm going to look at.
The next relationship that I'm going to look at is the 30-day cash, requirement compared to my kak.
And so for me, if I have a one-to-one relationship between my 30-day cash, and my kak, then that means that I am breaking even on getting customers, all right?
7:05
And I'm breaking even within a window that I can use other people's money to finance the acquisition, and that's where this gets super cool, all right?
And so using the example that we just had, if $260 is what it has to be under, right?
7:20
For it me to get three, two, one, then let's say that if I can just get my, ah, if I can get my 30-day cash to be greater than 260.
Then it means that in the first 30 days I'm breaking even in my acquisition for free.
7:37
And then I'm still going to collect the other 500 in whatever dollars that's remaining from this process.
And so those are the two biggest relationships that I'm looking at.
What's my LTV to kak ratio and what's my 30-day cash to CAC ratio?
7:54
All right, I want this to be Be greater than three times.
What?
It cost me to acquire a customer and that is how I know.
I will have sufficient profit to grow the business.
I want my 30-day cash in my kak to be at least greater than one.
So that I know that I can use other people's money OPM to acquire customers.
8:14
All right?
This is what it looks like visually Person comes in the business.
Let's say I pay, let's say I pay $200 in CAC.
8:30
All right, so I'm now - $200 this person now comes into my business to do, you know, they've got their little money.
They come into my business, they decide to give me money, right?
Now at this point this could be you know, day one and this could be day.
8:52
Seven whatever because it depends how long it takes them to give me money, right?
And so, maybe the first time they give me money, they only give me 50 bucks, right?
I'm still - but by day 30, let's say I have another upsell or two and at this point, now, I've made $200.
9:11
On this customer. what this means is that now, I've covered my cost of acquisition.
And then at the end of this point, I'm going to continue to sell them or their continued to buy.
9:28
Let's say it's on recurring they 60-day 90-day 120 Etc and I was able to break even to then get all of this money that happens on the back end for free.
That is the power of this concept.
And so to summarize this, the three numbers that you need to always know when you're marketing is going to be your kak, Zoom your LT.
9:50
The important point is that it's the gross profit, not the total revenue and the 30-day cash that you can make per customer and you need to break even on 30-day cash to CAC.
And you want this to be at least three times greater than your cost of acquisition for you to have a viable business and that is the game that I try to play.
10:12
So anyways, I hope those out before you hope, when you're looking at your business model, look at your marketing and you have these metrics you can make decisions empirically quantitatively.
And the nice thing is, if something's below these metrics, then you just know that you have to fix it.
Is there an upsell or is there, is there some sort of liquidation thing?
10:28
Can we give them some sort of special offer in their first week or two?
Can we sell them ancillary products and we have an affiliate relationship.
Can we refer stuff out in order to increase this 30-day?
Cash number?
The reason this is important, is if I can make this really, really big, then it means I can spend more to acquire on customers, which means I can even open up further my acquisition net and still make more money.
10:48
And obviously the amount that you had your 32, Asha still going to add into your total lifetime value of the customer.
So hope that is why before you hope this makes sense for your business.
This is how I think through these things and I hope hope you do too.
So anyways, have an amazing day enjoy and I'll see you next video.








0:00
What's going on, everybody?

Good morning.
Welcome to the gym sneakers podcast.
0:31
My name is Alex.
I will be your host on this beautiful Saturday morning and whether it is not a Saturday morning for you, well maybe you can be a Saturday morning at heart.
Anyways, if you're a gym owner and you like to get more clients and get you 20 to full capacity, you can go and apply work with us at I don't hate money.com.
0:51
So as long as you don't have money, you can definitely or should definitely go check that out.
Anyways, to the main point of today, which is what do you need to have in place when you scale your business.
Now, if you're doing a service-based business which if you're a gem, that's what you do, this kind of goes for any business.
1:10
And so I'll tell you the things that we've done that have worked extremely well, and just kind of the product specialist for the checklist that we have when we are on boarding.
A new team member.
So for us, there's five pieces to it or the way that we see it, there's five pieces to any new position, whether that's customer, service, for Us sales, administrative stuff scheduling, whatever it is right.
1:34
Five main pieces and we usually have six which is an overview, but there's first thing, you'll have is an overview of what your role is.
Okay, just an overarching.
This is kind of just to get an idea.
What your what you do in this business and where you fit within the larger piece of the machine.
Okay?
Underneath of that, there's the Five core components.
1:51
One is what we call the four r's document and this is something I got from Al Sharpton and it's awesome and it just simplifies it.
So, you have role responsibility, which is what you're supposed to be getting done requirements.
What type of person is supposed to be doing it, so requirements for that role and then results.
2:08
So when you're doing your responsibilities, what's the result, what's the outcome?
And what it does is basically establishes clear, expectations, clear lines of communication of what you're supposed to be doing, right?
And usually, it's page page and a half Max, okay.
Four hours.
Okay.
Each one of those ours is maybe three, four sentences.
2:25
The point is that someone can read it and understand it, not for you to be verbose and write paragraphs and paragraphs.
The point is for it to be really clear.
Really concise?
If you can use bullets, these bullets where you can write after that, you have product expertise.
So product expertise means is a combination of two things, expertise in terms of understanding what the company is and what we do as a whole because like, for example us like we're so Niche, where Supernatural you, serve gym, owners, and we show them how to get more clients.
2:49
And make more profitable business.
It's right now if I have someone who worked as, you know, worked as an office manager at a dentist clinic, right?
Which I have one person my team that was her background.
How do I get rid of how do I bridge that Gap?
Right?
It's so it's basically industry knowledge and understanding of what we do in our whole business as a whole, okay?
3:08
That's products fees.
And then underneath it, that you have her specific product expertise, which is how to do, you know how to handle billing, and how to handle, you know, customer service teams, blah, blah, blah, blah, okay.
And those would have To be independent drinks.
Now, beyond that, you have your external communication cycle, which is basically a long list of FAQ zip of how they speak to customers.
3:29
Now, a customer, service rep is probably have a much longer external communication cycle.
Then let's say a sales rep would be, or not necessarily longer, but there's will be more vast where it wire has the sales reps.
Picture.
Communication cycle is what you would consider sales training, which is what is the flow of this conversation.
3:45
How does it typically go and where the typical, you know, off shoes that are going to happen in the conversation?
I'm still tripping, right?
But that's an extra communication cycle, how they're talking to customers and you have internal communication cycle, which is how they are when they talk to you for how long about what know, what medium, okay, so we are talking on the phone for five minutes about the stats that you need to record that day.
4:13
So for customer service rep might sound like I took six calls today, four of them were about, you know, It's tough to then we're final issues are resolved all of them, right?
Boom, that's the communication cycle and it might be like, oh, and since I had a billing question, which I routed to billing and then that like that's what a Communications like will look like there.
4:34
And if the issues are like and there was one question I did not handle, what should I do with this?
And then that gets put back into the external communication training and then that is how you build trainings over time so that you can scale your business without spending all of your time hiring and training people because the training is taken care of.
Digitally real quick, guys.
4:52
If you can think about how you found this podcast, somebody probably tweeted it told you about it.
Should it on Instagram or something like that?
The only way this grows is through word of mouth and so I don't run ads, I don't do sponsorships, I don't sell anything.
I only ask is that you continue to pay it forward to whoever showed you or however you found out about this podcast that you do the exact same thing.
5:11
So if it was a review if it was a post, if you do that would mean the world to me and you throw some good karma out there for another entrepreneur.
All right, so every single position that we have in our company has digital training.
So the last piece is what we call one of the other either a perfect, a template, or a daily checklist.
5:29
Okay.
But more structured roll like a sales position is actually usually very structured because they do one thing, take leads and they turn them into sales.
So it's really how many leads you get.
How many points is schedule.
How many shows?
How many clothes real simple, right?
And so their days are going to be more structured whereas with an administrative type role, they're going to have more fires to put out more sporadic.
5:49
That are coming in to their world and so for them they're like it's really just better to have a checklist of like beginning of day midday and of day which is how we run ours.
And so just as a recap for this first, you're going to overview that person's role where they fit within the company, okay?
6:10
The next thing that you're going to do is explain to them their own product expertise, right?
So, What the actual business does, if it's really someone external, if it's your for promoting someone, then you don't, they don't really need to go through that again because interests and the business.
6:28
And then the only thing will really have to learn is let's say you're how to you know, a screen flow of how, someone does a cancellation, how someone does a refund?
How someone does a changing billing date?
How someone does?
Like I'm just giving billing as an example but all the tasks that they would need to do within that would be held within product expertise, right?
6:46
They'll have their four r's document and an explanation of that for ours which is roles responsibilities results of requirements, not in that order.
But that's the way there's the four r's And then they'd have their external communication cycle, how they talk to customers internal communication cycle.
7:02
How and when they talk to you in about what, and again, I gave you an example of like we talked to the we talked on the phone for five minutes about these stats daily weekly, whatever?
Right.
It could be I shoot you a text at the end of the day with my numbers, I mean the communication will be whatever you want it to be or like for us, I only touch our customer service reps once a week, they speak with their manager.
7:26
Daily but I only talk to our customer service Weekly.
Right?
So should we have different communication Cycles depending on the role?
And it's usually when I'm addressing the whole company, right?
And then, lastly, right?
What's your daily checklist?
And this is a really good starting point for.
If you're like, well, I don't know what I want to have the daily conversation about pull up their daily checklist and then just go over each checklist and ask them how each one of these things got done.
7:47
And to what extent they got finished if there were any hiccups or any constraints that they felt.
It's a really easy way to do it especially if you have an administrative role that's going to be coming into your business.
So didn't want to make this super long.
I wanted to kind of give you an overarching overview of how we structure positions within our company.
8:04
The way that we actually host.
Those is each one of those items should have a piece of paper, a PDF.
And the easiest way that we found is that if you pull up the PDF and you go through it, line by line and you record yourself as a screenflow with you, talking about that piece of paper as the video training them on that piece of paper.
8:22
Not just simply providing them the paper then that way you're hitting all types of learning mode.
So you're getting people who are visual audio and well I guess Visual and audio which is going to cover most people.
But it's also interact because they're really watching you go through it and going through it with you at the same time and so it almost fits like as close to real training as you can possibly get in my opinion.
8:41
Like in-person training and for us, the easiest way to do is we make membership sites on clickfunnels and if you're not doing that for years, I think you should and you don't know how to do that.
Sign up for our stuff will show you how to do it.
Anyways, hope you guys are amazing amazing day.
Hope that was useful for you.
8:58
Those are like that is like, literally how we scale like if you scale service, that's how you, skellies God's go by training.
And so we have an amazing day.
And if you are a gym owner and you're struggling or you are not struggling, you just want to crush it more than you already are.
Go check out.
9:14
I don't hate money.com only if you donate money or hate helping people and upon that page and we would love to hear from you.
So have an awesome day and I'll catch you guys on the flip side.









0:00
What's going on, everybody?
I'm bringing some more books, but I wanted to say that, if you haven't checked out Hunter million-dollar offers, I would definitely suggest that you start there.
I've gotten some solid feedback and it couldn't be happier with its.
Number one ranking on Amazon for direct marketing and over 5,000, five star reviews.
So, thank you guys so much for that.
0:15
It's 164 pages.
I really can help you out.
It takes about four hours to get through, check it out.
On Amazon, the Kindle book is 99 Cents.
The audiobook is Lowe's, they'll let me put it on for it, so I think it's 12 bucks.
So enjoy that and let's start the podcast.
If you are not Acquiring customers every single week week in week out.
0:33
Then this is for you.
Welcome to the game, where we talk about, how to get more customers, how to make more per customer and how to keep them longer in the many failures and lessons.
We have learned along the way.
I hope you enjoy and subscribe.
All right, so fundamentally two ways you can cook.
Well, there's six ways you can search for clients but to that I want to talk about today is going to be outbound and inbound, alright?
0:54
So outbound being like you're actively reaching out to people and getting a certain small percentage to respond and the other version of that Is paid ads which is fundamentally again, outbound, you're displaying stuff, it's just you're paying a platform to have the eyeball rather than doing the menu work to get the eyeball but the result is more or less the same a certain percentage like 1% click from the ad and then they go through the process.
1:14
Whereas when you're doing outbound you have 1% that might respond to your a pain response and then it comes inbound, right?
So what I want to talk about here is the number one thing that I see people that mess this up is that they do in sufficient volume.
And so, what I want to do is give you a rule of thumb that I'm coining, the rule of 100, all right, and what it basically States.
1:36
And I haven't heard this from anyone.
So, I'm, I'm claiming it as my own, all right?
Is that if you do 100 of something every day, you'll likely get better at it and you'll likely be doing enough that you will be able to start seeing an outcome.
So, in theory, if you were like the biggest master of all time you would need to do less volume to get the same outcome.
1:55
If I was the best paid Advertiser of all time, then I wouldn't need to do a ton of paid vajra.
Using to get a lot of sales, right?
Right to the same degree.
If I was the best cold caller in existence, I would need to do far fewer calls, in order to generate the Alchemy looking for more sales, right?
2:12
But here's the twist, how do you think you become the best paid Advertiser of all time?
How do you think you become the best cold outbound cold messenger, cold email or cold caller of all time volume.
And so the volume begets, the skill.
2:27
But the thing is, is, as you get better at something, you like doing it more.
And so this is actually a circle that continues to reinforce itself.
And the thing is, is that most people do not start with the first thing in high enough quantity.
They do not do sufficient volume, which is why I'm introducing the rule of 100.
2:44
And so, basically, it states that if you are not acquiring, like right now, if you're not acquiring, customers Then you're not doing the rule of 100.
It's very simple.
If you're not spending a hundred dollars per day, on advertising, or Doing 100 reach outs.
3:04
Per day.
Then how do you expect to grow, right?
And I'm saying this, you can add zeros, you can remove zeros whatever.
But the idea is that as a base level and this is per person, this is per per human being, right?
That you have this working, if you are not doing this, then you are not going to grow, right?
3:23
And so most people do outbound and they do it one time a week or one time every two weeks when they feel motivated, they don't do it every day to the same degree, they're doing, paid ads and they're like, well I spent, you know, I spent bucks.
It's like, so what do you got to spend a hundred dollars every day?
3:41
Right.
And then, what's going to happen is you're going to suck in the beginning and you hope you can break even and then over time, the skill will improve and then you will get more back from your volume, right?
But everyone wants to have a huge skill and do low volume to get their outcome.
3:57
But the reality is that to generate the skill, you have to have the volume and then in so doing you do more volume times, the skill in the skill gets better and then the outcome continues.
Increase and so right now, if you're not doing 100 outreaches a day in your business, where you're not spending $100 a day on ads, how are you going to get clients?
4:16
Like, what's the plan?
Like I like, like how is this working?
And so one of the number one, things is when someone's reaching out to me, and they're like, man, I wish I could get more clients.
I'm like, what are you doing either of these first question?
And if they're not, then it's like, well then don't pass.
4:32
Go do one of these to pick one, it doesn't really matter.
The thing is, Is that if it's just you running in your business then this is going to be the cheapest thing to do because it's just selling your time right in the beginning and you'll be able to do this and then you could teach another person and then another person and then another person how to continue to do this because you will then have the skill that you can drop into their brains and so that they can replicate the same results you will and reality is they're not going to replicate the same result.
5:00
The probably do it half as well or a third as well, but if you can still get, you know, 32:1 12:50 returns, On on the reach out to efforts that you're doing.
Then you can stand to have a, you know, 50% as effective person but have 10 people doing it right at the end of the day.
5:17
Most people, especially when you're earlier parts of the business, the people you hire are going to be better than you are at these things.
Real quick guys.
If you can think about how you found this podcast, somebody probably tweeted it told you about it.
Should it on Instagram or something like that?
5:33
The only way this grows is through word of mouth and so I don't run ads, I don't do sponsorships, I don't sell anything.
I only ask is that you continue to pay it forward to whoever showed you or however you found out about this podcast that you do the exact same thing.
So if it was a review, if it was a post, if you do that, you mean the world to me and you throw some good karma out there for another entrepreneur.
5:54
But 10 of them will be better than you are at those things.
And that was one of the biggest jumps I had to take, is that sometimes you have to take a short step back when you go from, you not selling to somebody else selling, right?
But you can quickly go from one person to three people to five people selling because you are no longer the bottleneck of the constrain.
6:12
Alright.
And so, just recognizing that.
And using the rule of 100, as a rule of thumb, for any of the, any of the acquisition efforts that you were doing, I guarantee you will.
Will serve you in your life and so it's like if you have not spent $100 every day or if you have not done a hundred, reach out to every day and you were struggling to get clients then do that first and then keep doing it.
6:34
Not one day do it every day for 90 days, right?
Do it every day for 90 days and I guarantee you, you will have customers by the end of that process.
Alright?
So anyways, lots of put those right before you if you did enjoy this drop a like drop a comment and I'll see you guys soon.








0:00
Real quick.
Because you guys already know that, I don't run any ads on this and I don't sell anything.
And so, the only ask that I can ever have you guys that you help me spread the word so we can have more entrepreneurs, make more money, feed their families, make better products, and have better experiences for their employees and customers.
And the only way we do that is if you can rate and review and share this podcast, so the single thing that I have to do is you can just leave review will take you 10 seconds or one type of the thumb, mean, the absolute world to me.
0:25
And more importantly, it may change the world of someone else.
What's going on, everyone?
In this video, what I want to do is talk to you about how you can scale outbound.
Welcome to the game where we talk about how to get more customers, how to make more per customer and how to keep them longer and the many failures and lessons, we have learned along the way.
0:41
I hope you enjoy and subscribe.
One of the issues that I see that's being really prevalent in.
Kind of like the marketing communities is talking about how organic or Outreach is not a scalable acquisition system and you should only use paid and I actually used to believe this and that's why I'm making this video and it turns out that this it's couldn't be further from The truth.
1:00
And I also now have over time continuing to believe that a pond might actually be more scalable more consistent, more reliable than even paid.
And the reason this came to the Forefront is about a week ago, I was talking at a mastermind event and one of the girls in the audience was like, Hey I really want to have.
1:16
I want to have a scale block position system because what I'm doing right now, it's in scalable and I was like, what are you doing?
And she was like, well I do Outreach.
And I was like why do you think this isn't scalable?
And she she thought for a second she was like, I don't know.
I just, you know, I'm the one doing I was like, right?
You can pay someone else to do it.
And then now you can pay more people to do it and then, there you go, right?
1:33
So what I'll do is actually walk you through the math behind this, and just kind of understanding the theoretical piece of how this works, right?
So just like, there are different platforms.
You can do paid advertising on, right?
You can do you too bad, you can run Facebook ads, going to Instagram ads, whatever, right.
1:50
You can also do outbound on different platforms as well.
You could do cold calls.
You can do cold emails, you can do direct messages on Instagram or Facebook or whatever, right, all of those.
Just different channels that you can do out but not right.
So it could be a phone, right?
It could be the email like I said or it could be you know chat whatever.
2:09
Whatever chat looks like.
You get the idea, right?
So there's different platforms.
You can use this on.
So what I'll do is walk you through kind of how the scaling works and how you can calculate Roi the same way as metric driven as you can for paid.
If anything I mean I think it's equally quantifiable and so what I'll do is I'll walk you through how our numbers work just as a real life.
2:29
Example for you so you can see this in your own business.
So right now we're doing it because this is something that we started implementing just recently because I wanted to scale our acquisition systems.
And so we are using phone primarily and we do 100, 100 cold calls per day.
2:47
All right, that's what we're doing.
You're like, wow.
That sounds horrible like.
Well, let's, let's walk through the math.
I'll show you.
All right.
And that means, and we're doing this times 5, so it's five days a week.
We've got one guy who's doing this, and so, it's 500 total.
All right, that's the total amount.
Not that we're getting from that 500.
3:03
Well, typically you get about 10 interested people, all right?
And I'm defining this as people who said, yes, I'd like to have another conversation about this, whatever, right?
From those 10 will get 7 to shop for that next appointment.
And then from there, from the following, we usually close one sale.
3:20
All right.
That's like those are, those are the metrics that we have right now?
Now, the reason this is interesting to me, right?
Is that, I'm looking at the cost, okay?
And so this right now is actually one person Who's working part time?
They're not even working full-time.
And so, let's just say for for, you know, money sake right?
3:39
That we're paying, you know, fifteen hundred dollars.
I'll say $1600 just, you know, 40 bucks a week, right?
$1600 per month for this.
All right.
That's what's Happening.
Now, what's wild about this is that, that means that we would be closing one per week, right?
3:55
From outbound using this process, which is about what we are doing.
All right, now compared to the volume that we get from paid.
This is really not a lot.
This is not a this is going to Bear Bells, this isn't going to like keep the lights on it.
Jim watch right.
But the process is understanding how this scales and the metrics behind it.
4:12
So check this out.
So $1600 a month, right?
Is equating to because this is one week, right?
That equates to four Styles, right?
For sales.
Now for sales, right means that my cost of acquisition.
Is $400, right?
4:28
Sixteen hundred, divided by 4.
That's that's where this is, right?
Is 400 bucks.
Now, to put this in perspective, I usually pay 2,000 to 2,500 dollars per sale using paid advertising.
And so my, my cost of acquisition on outbound is actually significantly less.
4:47
We're talking like two three, four, five, six times less than what I'm used to pay.
And so the next question is how can you scale this right?
Well, Well, right now we're getting, you know, one person to do this.
But what's to stop me from having 20 people doing this, right?
5:04
And if I had 20 people doing this, all of a sudden, we're at 80 sales a month, right?
Which is great.
That would make a meaningful difference in our business and what's more is that those 80 sales in total, What it cost me, thirty two thousand dollars.
5:22
Hey guys love that you're listening to the podcast.
If you ever want to have the video version of this which usually has more effects more visuals, more graphs, you don't drawn out stuff, sometimes it can help hit the brain centers in different ways.
You can check out my YouTube channel.
It's absolutely free.
So check that out if that's what you are into and if not keep enjoying the show, Which is a lot less than I spent right now in marketing.
5:48
Right.
Not to mention that this process also includes like, if you take my marketing costs, not just for my advertising but the actual team I've got creatives, I've got graphic designers, I've got videographers about copywriters of got funnel people.
I've got traffic like all of those are additional payroll that go on top of the abdomen that we're spending in order to do this.
6:10
And so the next question that comes naturally from this, It's like, okay.
So I understand how to scale the people, right?
That's operations, right?
You have to train people on how to do the script, how they, how they, you know, get your foot in the door.
Kind of how the conversation generate interest all, I kinda stuff, right.
But the next one is like, well, well how do I get these names right?
6:25
How to get these these lists of names, and that's where the channel that you're using right matters, right?
And so if I were scaling phones, which is probably one of the you know, most time-tested ways of scaling, then it means you're just you can scrape lists off of.
6:43
The internet Etc.
Whatever.
And then just feed them into a dialer.
This is not complicated stuff.
There's a zillion different tools that do that.
Alright, if I was doing cold email there's a zillion different tools for cold email that you feed in 500-plus emails a day and from 500 emails, you might get five to ten responses that are meaningful.
7:03
And what's interesting about outbound that I have found, is that believe it or not?
These people are actually warmer than cold traffic.
Which I find interesting but I think this is just my theory on.
This is that if you're in that 10 people out of the 500 that those 10 people are inherently in a moment of pain or higher interest than they would otherwise be with cold traffic, it's more Interruption based.
7:29
And so you have people actually believe it or not, her more like It's called buyers and power but basically they're they're kind of on their back foot like, maybe I'll see, maybe I'll click.
Whereas if you're responding to this, at this point, it's probably of more importance to you, all right.
And so same thing here though is understanding the actual numbers.
7:46
All right, so if you're going to do and cold email, you probably have to have 500 per day.
In order for it to be meaningful, 200 minimum, right?
In order for the volume to be meaningful.
Same thing here, 100 cold calls a day is probably the minimum it.
Would, it would take for it to be meaningful.
8:02
Messenger same thing right now, this is where it's interesting.
It's like, well, where do you get Messenger people?
Well, one you could hit up all the followers, you have are all the friends you have.
That's the first and easiest thing you can do beyond that.
It's going into the the groups of people the ponds that exist and then doing messages from there because you already know that they're qualified or they're more likely to be a certain type of Avatar where you can likely serve all right?
8:26
And so scaling outbound really comes down to just multiplying two things.
You have to increase.
You have to get the lists.
You get the names were of the ponds are right times activity.
Which is the effort, the 100 a day, right times people.
8:47
That's it.
That's the process.
That is exactly what you do.
And so right now, I've got one guy, right?
Who's doing outbound right?
And he's, you're entering one sale for week and then you then ask yourself.
Well, I want to have 20 sales a week, well, then you need 20 of these people.
9:05
And the only next question that has to come up is Will, is it worth it?
And so, that's simply a function of what the cost of acquisition is compared to the price.
Right?
And so in this instance, if you were doing that and let's say you were one sale a week from someone and this is again, like I said, part-time if my cost of acquisition mind you right, said was $400 As long as my profit on a customer that is coming in, and that's gross.
9:33
That's gross profit.
That means like after my pasta fulfillment is over 1200 dollars, that's 3x.
Then it is worth it and is a scalable system.
All right, so hopefully that makes sense for you.
Hopefully broke.
9:49
At least a little bit of beliefs about what, like whether or not this is scalable and what price you need to have.
And what kind of cost of acquisition would be necessary.
This is where having some people, there's a lot of va s who will do this for significantly less.
So if you're let's say, you're paying a VA $500, a month, for example, and let's say from that VA, you're able to generate I don't know, 10 appointments a week and from this set appointments, you're able to let's say because you're not selling something super high ticket like we are.
10:17
Let's see.
You're able to sell to people a week.
All right, let's say for your business, for example.
So if you have two per week and that means you're getting a two month.
I'm just doing rough math here and you're paying a VA five hundred dollars per month which is a great great Roi.
10:34
That means that your cost of acquisition is is Tiny.
Right?
Is Right, 60 bucks ish, right?
So the question is, and if you're selling something for two thousand dollars, plus which you should be no matter what industry you're in, right?
Especially if you're doing cold Outreach, then at that point, your Roi is insane.
10:54
Right?
If you see if it cost, you $60 to acquire somebody for two thousand dollars you're looking at just absolutely insane.
Numbers, you know, getting three, two one, is exciting, this is getting, you know, 10 to 12 be 600.
So 32 1 returns, you know, 32 to 1 return 0 Yes, and that's something that you can truly print money on.
11:12
And so, when you can find these kind of Arbitrage opportunities, which this is inherently is, outbound is an Arbitrage opportunity, and the only reason that people don't succeed what it is.
They just don't know how to do the activity number one, or they don't do enough of it.
And so if you can break that pattern in yourself and understand where the, where the ponds exists, what activities and in what amount are going to generate the outcome and then simply adding more people to that process so that you can get The amount of sales that you want on a reliable basis and not be constrained by any platform in your life.
11:45
So is this is why I get really excited about it when I see 30 30 to 1 plus returns because I'm comparing this to paid ads, I mean, acquiring customers for sixty dollars in just about any business has a really, really good acquisition cost and just understanding how to do it.
12:00
So anyways hope that made sense.
Hope you found that valuable hook.
It was in jail before you if you were somebody who's only doing paid having the outbound kind of be a slow growth thing that you becomes this foundational base that every single every single month, you had one more person than you.
Just know.
You get another 428 sales every month.
12:16
And one more person other 48 sales that is consistent scale.
And as you add people, you can also add people on the backend which sometimes can be easier than having the blast off that paid advertising can be, but also the troughs of when an advertising campaign stops working or are you launched a huge campaign and it doesn't work or doesn't convert, that can be really difficult from a business, from a cash flow perspective.
12:39
Perspective because it's uneven.
Whereas this is extremely reliable and consistent.
So anyways, hope that was value before you leave a comment.
If it was and if it wasn't you can also leave a comment for just don't tell me to fuck off but anyways.
Keeping awesome.
Lots of love and I'll catch you guys soon.
Bye.








0:00
Real quick guys.
If you can think about how you found this podcast, somebody probably tweeted it told you about it.
Should it on Instagram or something like that?
The only way this grows is through word of mouth and so I don't run ads, I don't do sponsorships, I don't sell anything.
I only ask is that you continue to pay it forward to whoever showed you or however you found out about this Pockets that you do the exact same thing.
0:19
So if it was a review, if it was a post, if you do that would mean the world to me and you throw some good karma out there for another entrepreneur.
The inherently limit themselves from learning because they have this check box in their head.
That as soon as it gets difficult, they said ah, I'm bad at this.
I am bad at this.
I identify with being poor at this thing and therefore will never succeed at this thing.
0:40
That's a requirement for being successful.
Welcome to the game.
Where we talk about it, get more customers how to make more per customer and how to keep them longer and the many failures and lessons, we have learned along the way.
I hope you enjoy and subscribe what's going on everyone?
Happy whatever day of the week it is Friday.
0:56
Happy Friday.
I wanted to make this a short video for you because it's a had two or three things happen, or less handful of days.
That just seemed to be this repeated thing and reminded me that a lot of people struggle with this, which is They believe that they are inherently bad at things because they are not good at them.
1:19
And I think that that is an incredibly dangerous belief set to have.
And so, what I want to do is kind of break that belief sit down to hopefully, break it for you.
So I think one of the most valuable beliefs because, you know, in terms of building on success in my opinion, first you need to develop skills, they need to develop character traits to make sure that you do those skills.
1:41
And then you have, To make sure that your beliefs are correct that you can open up the world, right?
But the beliefs are kind of imbued throughout the entire process, because if you don't believe, you can acquire skill, you never will write.
If you don't believe you can have a character trait, you never will.
And so I was having a conversation with a friend of mine, who's looking to, you know, switch career paths.
2:00
You're trying to figure out she wasn't making as much money.
She wanted to make and the issue that she was dealing with, she's like, she just doesn't have a value on a skill set, right?
And she's like, I want to make this much money and I was like, well, you're never Do that doing what you're doing, right?
And I was like, have you considered learning how to sell, right?
2:16
I'm gonna view cell.
You have a fart, you know, if you still have the desire for security, but if you know how to sell you can, you know, pretty much, write your own paycheck, if you know, where to look and she was like, I'm not I'm not good at sales.
I'm not a salesperson and I was like, well, how many hours of sales training have you gone through?
2:32
It was like, you know, none was like well, then why would it be reasonable for you to be good at sales, right?
Like that doesn't that doesn't make any sense.
Of course, you're not good at sales.
Like you haven't done it right?
Well it's so it's the same thing.
Like well, I'm not a very marketing type person was like, well, how many courses have you gone through?
2:48
How many hours a day do you spend studying marketing?
Well, you know, none.
Well then why is it reasonable that you like, why would it would be unreasonable for you to be good at this skill?
Given the amount of investment you've made, right?
And so, it's this.
It's this recurring thing that I've seen over and over and over again and it also presents itself in different ways.
3:07
Like I, you know, I'll speak at some event or something and I'll start getting into Basic math about about business, just business math.
Like, you know, how much it cost to acquire customer, how much was the lifetime value?
Things like that.
And ice can see people starting to freak out because they're like I'm not good at math and I have to lean back and Arlene you know pressure on to that belief because one that's a belief that literally never serve you.
3:30
It's like saying like I hate employees.
It's like, well, good luck.
Owning a business that you want to grow to any appreciable scale, right?
But with the math example, most You can, you can, you can massively succeed in business, knowing only out, like not even algebra just basic multiplication.
3:49
Subtraction division.
Like, if you just know how to do that, that's all you need to do and just about everyone knows how to do those things.
And at the very least has a calculator who can do multiplication division addition and subtraction.
That's it.
That's all you literally need.
And thing is, is that people mistake that they are bad at math.
4:08
When, in reality, they do not understand the concept.
B create the math, right cost per acquisition, right?
Okay, that's a math statement.
Just expressed in words.
And so everyone gets tripped up and then they say I'm bad at math.
4:24
When in reality, they just don't understand the term.
And by doing that, they inherently limit themselves from learning because they have this checkbox in their head.
That as soon as it gets difficult, they said, ah, I'm bad at this.
I am bad at this.
I identify with being poor at this thing and therefore will never succeed.
4:41
Feed at this thing.
That's a requirement for being successful.
And so I think that for me, one of the Cornerstone beliefs that I that has helped me a tremendous amount.
I just want to share it with you.
Is that if someone can therefore I can and sure is that it does, that necessarily mean that you're going to, you know, go to the go to the go to Mars.
5:06
It's like, no one's ever done that before.
I think that's the next level belief.
No one's ever done it.
And I'm going to be the first, right?
But I think if you can at least just believe that if someone has done it it is therefore possible and therefore I can do it too.
If I do the same things and the nice thing about actions is that they are agnostic to your level of deserving this and skill.
5:26
What I mean by that is if you spend an hour a day, practicing sales over a year, you will likely be in the top ten percent five percent two percent of people because most people do nothing.
Most people do absolutely nothing except for deal with their emotions, on a regular basis and procrastinate and give themselves reason for why they are not successful.
5:50
Besides the obvious one, which is that, it is not reasonable that they would be successful given the amount of time and effort that is put in to achieving.
Hey guys, real quick for those of you guys who are 100 million-dollar offers fans I love you.
I added in a lost chapter that has never been released.
6:08
I'm releasing it now transparently.
I'm doing that to build hype 400 million-dollar leads but you will have the unreleased chapter, it talks about your first Avatar and how to segment customers, make more money.
You can get it by going to acquisition.com forward slash leads.
Its fo free in exchange for your email so that I can email you when we launched under leads.
6:26
And so that you can not miss out on it.
Because last time I sold out for like eight, Straight weeks really fast.
So that is my way of making sure that y'all get first dibs.
And so I the only reason for this is because I had that conversation.
6:43
I spoke The Mastermind with a girl talked about not understanding the math.
And just, there's just so many repeated events like this, where it's like, can you ask yourself with reason?
Would it be reasonable for me to be good at this skill?
Given the investment I've made and as a corollary as an antithesis to that example, I've got an 18 year old kid who Across the street from me and I sort of you know semi Mentor him.
7:11
He's a good kid.
You worked super hard, lot of hustle.
And the thing is, is he's too young to know that he can't do things yet.
And what that does is it makes him incredibly dangerous because he hasn't been slapped in the face by the world yet.
And so he believes that he can accomplish anything, he has no reason to think otherwise and so I've been actively trying to speak that into him and now he's he's wholesaling real estate right now, is 18 years old right?
7:36
I love this, right?
And how did he do it?
He watched YouTube videos for free, right?
And then he picked up cold calling because I was like, this is a book.
You need to read for cold calling and so he just started cold calling based on what the YouTube videos said, off of a free list that he found on the internet and he closed his first deal as eighteen-year-old and so, it does he have an inherent skill?
7:54
No, but I did was I prepared him mentally by saying like you're going to suck at this, for a very, very long time and eventually after doing it so many times, it will be unreasonable for you to suck.
And at that point, you will be Right?
And so I think if we can all approach the skills that we feel like we are deficient in with that kind of concept of, of course I'm going to suck it would not be reasonable for me to be good, but if I do these actions it would overtime.
8:19
Be unreasonable for me to be bad at these things.
And I think by doing that, you unlock it, different ability to learn and by extension grow.
And so, anyways, I hope you find this valuable.
It's just, it's a belief set that I find repeated, especially in people who are Are smaller business owners who are getting started etcetera and it drives me nuts because it's just saying that you can't do something before you've even started.
8:44
And that's why people spend so long in the beginner stage is because they they inherently, dispel away their ability to learn and get better because they well I'm not good at that.
Well obviously you're not good at that.
You have not done it.
And so anyways, I hope you found this valuable.
9:01
I hope you know you share it or tag an employee who you feel like you Needs to invest in a skill and is afraid of it or somebody who is bad at math, but has never tried, or learned it, you know, you're bad at drawing and just to bring this home, I've said this before, but I'll say it again.
9:17
Many of you are, I hear regularly that people consider me to be good at math.
Right.
Until I was 23, I thought I was horrible at math.
Like, I just like, I need you to understand this.
Like I believe I was horrible at math.
9:34
And so what I did was I stopped allowing myself to use a calculator and said, I had to do all the math in my head and what it up happening is I got a lot of stuff wrong for a long time.
But over time, I started to get better at math because I did everything in my head and now people are like, dude, you're so good at doing Mental Math but I spend every day not using a calculator for almost every calculation I make so that I can get better and now it seems really cool because I can do a lot of math in my head pretty quickly.
10:04
But like, I can't like, I was bad.
Like I literally cheated my entire way through High School in math class just to just to get by.
I told myself, I was bad at math, unlike the sat in the GMAT, there was are the sections.
I was most afraid of right?
10:20
And I studied so much harder on the math for the GMAT and I ended up doing, you know, hitting 99th percentile on it, but I didn't.
But that was because I did 16 phone books of problems.
Over four months, I spent four hours a day for four months.
10:36
I was like, I will do so much work.
That would be unreasonable for me to not be good at this.
And so, I say that just because like, I feel like so many of us just limit ourselves when you just like, have to try and so, anyways, love you all.
Give it amazing day.
I hope that.
10:51
If there's something that you want to acquire from skill standpoint that you will allow yourself to be recently, bad until a point where it would be unreasonable for you to be at given the amount of time and effort, you've put into it also, Being awesome.
I'll catch you soon.
But








0:00
Hey guys, real quick.
So Leyland are definitely working on our social media presence.
If you guys haven't noticed and we're just breaking now into LinkedIn.
All right.
It's not as bad as I thought it's actually a pretty awesome so far and you guys have been really cool in there and people are sharing our stuff a lot.
So if we aren't connected on LinkedIn, it go ahead and let's connect and let's rock and roll that everyone wishes for the American dream and routes for you for the American dream.
0:21
Until comes true.
Welcome to the game.
Where we talk about it, get more customers, how to make more for customer and how to keep them longer and the many failures and lessons.
We have learned along the way.
Way.
Hope you enjoy and subscribe.
What's going on everyone?
Happy Saturday today.
I wanted to make this podcast for you because I got off the phone with attorney and he and I had a long conversation about a wide breadth of topics and was like, dude, you should talk more about this kind of stuff.
0:50
And so what I want to do is actually share with you kind of my experience of having the chip on my shoulder and kind of where it got me.
And what I learned in the process.
And so if you have any kind of like thoughts around like trying to beat someone and like, like, you're going to take these guys down and like all this stuff.
1:12
And I know many many people in this space, you know, feel that way towards me.
I can tell you having literally gone through the entire process.
It's really interesting.
So, like, when I, when I had my gyms, I wrote this huge essay and it was for myself because I actually have a creative writing background that most people don't know about.
1:33
But I entitled it that everyone wishes for the American dream and routes for you for the American dream, until comes true, and I felt that way with my clients, you know, they were rooting for me when I was sleeping on the floor, they're like good for you, like pursuing your dreams.
And But as time went on, you know, and I started to be able to hire people.
1:53
We started making more money and eventually I didn't have to work in the business, they're like, oh, you're too good for us now, like a big businessman.
Right, and everyone roots for you until you do better than them.
And so what ends up happening is that you have to set Higher and Higher Goals for yourself to drive yourself, right?
2:12
And for me, I definitely was an angrier person, or maybe I'm just better at hiding.
It now, I have no idea, but I was definitely angry or about stuff.
And I set this goal that I was going to beat beige Rose.
If you guys recall who Pedro schooling, and he's a big Guru or was bigger You in the, in the gym space, you can set body.
2:33
And and I started telling myself, all of these things, you know what I mean?
Like, how he's wrong people on.
He's ripping people off, and I would tell myself these stories.
You know what I mean to try and like get myself a that up about like how I'm just going to like write the industry and do everything.
2:50
And I'm going to be bigger than him and like all this stuff, right?
And the reality is, you know, as time went on and and Jim, which grew and grew, and grew, and grew and, you know, I'm not, I don't know, it is numbers are but I'm fairly certain that our coaching program is and has been bigger than his in this space at least for a while.
3:12
And when I got there, you know, I guess to the heart, you know, to match that and surpass.
First off, I found that it was incredibly empty.
But secondly, I felt and realized that he was Completely unaffected.
3:32
He had, he was still incredibly wealthy, he had other entrepreneurial Endeavors, he was pursuing and this my success in no way affected his life.
And it was one of the most humbling and also freeing moments of my life when I realized that.
3:51
Because He wasn't an enemy.
I and I doubt I was even, you know, like a blip on the radar during that time and me obviously they know who we are now, but it didn't affect his life and all this malicious, you know, list is Vengeance.
4:11
This Vendetta that I had, like the only person who poisoned was met and you know, there's two sides to this coin on one side.
You have like the the drive You know, if you guys have seen the Jordan documentary talks about, how used to make things up that other people would say about them, that they never actually said and I feel like it's kind of like that and it's and that chip on your shoulder does drive you.
4:33
So I can't say, it didn't drive me but I don't think it made me a happier person.
Most Nation real quick.
If you are a business owner that has a big old business and wants to get to a much bigger business, going to 50 $100.
4:49
Plus, we would love to talk to you and if you like that or like to hear more about it, go to acquisition.com, you can play anywhere on the page and talk to one of our team and see if we can help you get there.
And so, and believe me, I'm not, the guy who's like, go, go hug trees and be happy.
5:06
Like I'm all about achievement achieving stuff so like bombings, go do whatever works for you, but I can tell you that it seeing it truly, seeing my success not in any way.
Impact someone, else's success, really radically.
5:25
Transformed my feelings about competitors about the space about the industry.
About other coaches in general about what I was going to do to help other coaches, Etc.
It really transformed me.
I started calling up other people who are in our space and just saying like hey how can I help you grow?
5:44
And they're like seriously and I was like, yeah man, I'm like I mean you're not going to take my stuff and I'm not going to take your stuff because people are attracted to different people for different reasons.
You know, people like everyone has different psychographics that they attract like I'm 81 percent male like women in general.
Don't find my my content appealing I'm just like, those are the, that's the data, right?
6:03
Those are the stats.
But the thing is, is that by freeing myself of this, I realized it didn't impact My Success at all.
And other people growing with my, you know, with me helping or without me helping didn't affect my success either, but it did massively affect my mental well-being.
6:22
And so, I guess there's two sides to this message that you can take one is if you were the, you know, the line climbing up the mountain, By all means, stay hungry as hell do.
Whatever it takes for you to stay motivated, but I would say, don't don't do anything stupid, you know, don't don't don't say anything, don't don't take massive, you know, malicious attacks.
6:48
I didn't do that but I'm just saying like, don't do that because you will end up Burning Bridges.
I've had a lot of people do that to me and I'm sure Bader has had it too.
And you know something guys have been in the space for a long time.
I've had people do that and what is happening is that you just kind of burn your Reputation.
7:03
And you know what's going to happen is somebody who's taken a massive, you know, swipe, it may you know, they're going to want to do a deal with someone else and that guy's going to call me and he's like what you think about this guy?
And I'm like yeah I think he's a little bit.
I think he's naive.
I think he's I think he's new but I think he's small bones.
7:19
I think he's an emotional person.
I don't think he's able to restrain himself.
I think he's very volatile, I wouldn't do business with him.
If it were me, you can do whatever you want and I would just be like this is my experience with it.
I would I don't touch people like that.
Ten-foot pole, but do what you want.
And usually, when people hear that, you know, from someone that they think is less volatile, they will usually heed that advice and there's been probably a lot of people who have taken tax.
7:44
I mean, who somehow find things that just fall through for them and that may or may not have been as a result of, you know, me.
But the point is that I think that that anger use it to fuel your soft, but don't use it to attack, it just doesn't end up going well.
8:00
And also people make associations Ian's with how they feel about what you say.
And so if you're always talking negatively in general about other people, people will not remember who you were talking about, but they will remember how you made them feel, and they will associate the negativity with you.
8:15
And so, that's something that I learned early on, in like, some of the persuasion book sounds like, oh, okay.
I need to watch out for that.
And so is hard for me, especially cuz I was like, so angry or when I was younger that to not do that, right?
And so that's that's one side of it, right?
Is if you are, if you are climbing the mountain, and I guess the message the other side is that like It's just you're not going to affect anything like you're not going to hurt anyone by your success.
8:42
And that's like that's probably the biggest message I can give is like, you're not going to hurt anyone.
Like it's not like you're not going to hurt anyone.
Like when people make swipes, it feels like it doesn't hurt me.
Like, it doesn't affect me at all.
Like, it doesn't affect my business.
It doesn't it?
Just, it just affects you and I'm only sharing this because, like, it was something that I think really hurt my mental, well-being, when I was younger.
9:02
And I, and if I can provide value, you know, I hope that that doesn't affect those.
People if they see this Sony's and maybe that's you, you know, maybe it's maybe there's a competitor in your space or maybe there's another, you know, another business down the street that you're like, screw this guy blah blah, blah.
9:20
I can promise you you would make so much more money if you guys just like talked and shared like best practices because it there.
So few markets where it's actually winner, take all there's, it's there.
So few, you know what I mean?
That it actually works that way and it's a zero-sum game.
The reality is that most businesses can't. handle the amount of demand that there is for the service and the solution that they have, the problem that they solve and the other reality is that there's a lot of people that like things solved in different ways, you know, if Layla and I were entering the weight loss base, it's not like I have to start attacking Weight Watchers, you don't, I mean like there's just certain people who are attracted to that type of messaging and if Layla and I got in that space we probably have a very different angle brand message, look and feel then they would and we would attract different types of people with different values and so it's there's A lot of room and the oceans.
10:10
Very, very big, it's so much bigger than everyone gives a credit for.
And that's I think I told a story recently about a competitor quote competitor, another person, another companies, in our space, who's doing this, like the same amount as I as we are.
And they're not even, they're not even like marketing on Facebook.
10:26
And I'm like, are you kidding me and they have their entire outbound team?
And when I heard that I was just like, gosh, I just like I continue to have my mental barriers stretched around these concepts of like if the game is so big and the Person you hurt when you spit hate as yourself.
You hurt your long-term prospects because people at the top to talk, like it's like they're definitely is like, I think I heard 84 cell say this.
10:48
It's like, everyone's just like, hanging out, like, they're all just like most of us know each other.
You know what I mean?
And like, we text each other and hey, how's this working for you?
Hey, I was just like, there's no animosity.
Like I'm friends with a lot of people who are in the gym space who served him owners.
Like I have no malicious intent.
If someone's like, hey, you should I work with something like, give him a shot, you know what I mean?
11:06
Like everyone has a different way of doing things.
Things, you know, this is what ours works well with and if you like our style you like you know you like selling hard, you like going high ticket, you like marketing hard you like focusing on metrics like that's us, you know what I mean?
Like there's people who like more done for you that like that's cool too.
11:23
Like there's guys who do that really well.
So anyways, I I wanted to share this with you because Ed inspired me to share this message with you because if you, you know, if you are angrier, you've you have this anger inside of yourself.
11:38
I want 100% get you, I feel you but I would just say try and use it to Spur yourself on, do not use it to throw shade because it will not benefit your well-being and it won't benefit your long-term success.
So anyways, hope you found it valuable.
11:55
Hope you enjoyed this.
If you did leave a like or comment or view or just listen solemn.
But anyways, hope you have an awesome day and happy Saturday.
I'll catch you guys soon.
Bye.

Sometimes it can help hit the brain centers in different ways.
You can check out my YouTube channel, it's absolutely free.
Go check that out if that's what you are into and if not keep enjoying the show but the more I thought about this concept, the more I realized that all businesses Arbitrage And how much money you make in the extent to which you, you you crush, it will be dictated by how big the Arbitrage is.
0:33
Welcome to the game, where we talk about it, get more customers how to make more per customer and how to keep them longer and the many failures and lessons, we have learned along the way.
I hope you enjoy and subscribe.
What's going on, everyone?
I'm going to be talking to you about my favorite, one of my favorite topics Arbitrage and so the first time I heard this word was actually in a fancy dinner.
0:53
I was sitting in an earlier, I don't know what's going on.
And these dudes and finance, we're talking about derivatives and crazy stuff, right?
They just kept saying, Arbitrage was like, what is it?
You know, like finally I was like, what does that mean?
And they're like, oh, it's like when you just take advantage of an inefficiency in a market place and I was like, Wow.
1:11
And so then they explained it to me and they're like, well, it's sort of like when you go on eBay, right?
And you can buy something for $5 and then you can take the same thing and then just go into Amazon and sell it for $50.
What I would be a big example but you The idea where you buy 45, and you saw 450, and it's because there's an inefficiency in a marketplace where there's, that's where the Arbitrage happens, right?
1:35
And so, the definition of Arbitrage is where you buy in one market, right?
At one cost and then you sell in another Market at another cost.
See you sell High.
You buy low pretty simple.
Right everyone understands that make shake.
1:52
That should make sense in.
Here's you the middle making all your money being happy.
Yeah, there's you.
All right, so that is basically what Arbitrage means, but the more I thought about this concept, the more I realized that all businesses Arbitrage and how much money you make in the extent to which you you you crush.
2:10
It will be dictated by how big the Arbitrage is, right?
Even if you think about basic business, a service business, you're buying labor in the labor market just Market one.
This is why this is important is that you're buying and selling between different markets.
All right.
It was a point of nuance that I didn't understand when they first told me how this worked.
2:28
And I also didn't want to ask because I was embarrassed that I didn't know that mean.
So hopefully you can watch this and not be embarrassed or someone says it.
All right, so Market wanted Market to.
So there's an inefficiency, this little line here is the inefficiency between the marketplace what you're buying at when you're selling it, right?
2:43
Right.
And so Market, one can be a labor market, you're buying labor at X price and you know that you can sell the labor at another price to Market to write and then that's how you make a profit.
But every business fundamentally works.
This way, I can buy from a manufacturer for a dollar and sell it over and Market or market.
3:01
Number two for $5 right now and even the manufacturer buys from raw ingredient producers, who buy it from Farmers at one dollar and sell it for $5, right?
And so that's the game that continue gets played between Market one and Market to, and a supply chain is literally a series of markets in a row of markets, buying and selling buying and selling, and buying and selling.
3:24
And then the person the middle His owner is technically arbitraging all of these things right right okay.
Now here's where I think this is interesting.
There are so take this concept, pocket it and your mind for a second and so one of the concepts that I've tried to explain and I'm partially making this video so that I can I know that I learned things better when I teach them.
3:44
All right, so is the difference between economic profits and accounting profits?
If anyone took economics if you did right then they would talk about this and the difference I'll start with accounting profits because it's the it's the easier one understand.
They're not hard to understand but it's the easier.
4:00
Alright.
So economic profits Force accounting accounting.
Counting profits are revenues - all costs, right?
That is an accounting profit, right?
That's what most of us do.
When we do our tax returns, that is an accounting profit.
Simple everyone should understand them and hanok economic profit is where you take the revenue, minus, the explicit cost of doing business.
4:24
And then you also subtract out the opportunity cost which is the implicit cost of using the resources that you have in that particular Market or path versus another opportunity.
So let me give you an example.
Hey, most Asian quick break, just to let you know.
4:42
We've been starting to post on LinkedIn and want to connect with you.
Alright.
So send me a connection request.
A note letting me know that you listen to the show and I will accept it.
There's anyone you think that would be should be connected with tag them in one of my or Layla's posts?
And I will give you all the love in the world.
All right, so let's get back to the show.
5:01
So let's say you own a paper mill, right?
And your company owned a forest and that's where they cut the trees down and then they turned it into paper, right?
Simple.
Now, the economic profits of that business, the opportunity cost that would be factored into that economic profit, is whether or not you could make more money, just selling Timber, right, we're selling sawdust, or selling would, those would be different examples of things that you could do, with the existing resources you have?
5:29
Which is this guy in the It'll hear he's got resources, he's got people, he's got maybe equipment skill, sets Talent etcetera, that if you were to apply those skills to a different Market, he could then make more money and that is the difference between economic profits and accounting profits.
5:47
And the reason this is important to me as an entrepreneur is that, when I'm looking at what I want to get into, right with with things are interesting to me or for investing because I invest in businesses now, which is kind of wild to me, but anyways is looking is this given these resources of humans and skills and equipment and software at everything we're currently pursuing, Arbitrage opportunity, a right, but what if with the same skills I could have Arbitrage opportunity be where I'm buying in this market for rock-bottom prices and there's another Market over here.
6:27
That is paying top dollar, right?
So, between the first example I have where it's a, it's a normal amount of money that's being made compared to this Arbitrage opportunity.
I would want to be in this one right now.
What's going to dictate whether or not, it's going to be one of these markets versus one of these markets.
6:45
Well, the growth of the market place overall.
There are growing markets like, online fitness is a growing market, right?
And so it means that there's likely going to be Arbitrage a greater degree of Arbitrage because there's going to be more demand and so if I can find a markets where I feel like there's more demand for the same things that I can buy cheaply.
7:08
Then I want to go to those things and so when I'm thinking about all opportunities because I think that that's one of the biggest super powers that we have to have as entrepreneurs is not sure.
Like right now, I could go and run a gym and make money.
I could I could also run a massage parlor to make money.
I could also run a cell phone company.
7:23
Make money I do that's it right?
I could run a lot of different businesses to make money but We opportunities Under the Sun of all the different ways I can make money, which is the best.
Given my resources skills, Talent team Etc.
And then if I look at all of those things on a board, these are the things that were absolutely amazing at and these are the different Arbitrage opportunities that exist which of these Arbitrage opportunities will be best fit for the skills.
7:50
Talents traits team Etc that I have and then by answering that question will inherently answer.
The very important question which is What can we be the best in the world?
And so I think, for me, this has been a really valuable concept to understand is that all businesses Arbitrage, it all functions off of an information Advantage between the buyer and the seller.
8:10
The Bots are the seller.
Always has the information advantage or many times as the information vintage and so fundamentally.
When you find out that an iPhone cost $17 to make people are shocked by this, but that's because there's obviously other gods besides the manufacturing obviously.
8:28
But all big business is run off of extraordinary degrees of Arbitrage, right?
Facebook is able to have eyeballs and sell eyeballs at a significant amount cheaper than it.
Cost them to manufacture them, right?
Right.
Verizon, it cost them pennies to add another user to their base.
8:45
And so the reason this is important for me to at least Express is that for a very long time.
When I was when I was earlier on in my career I had these weird morals and ethics around how much more I could charge for something.
The reality is, there is no limit.
It is simply based on the market demand and so whether it cost you a penny to make something that's worth a thousand dollars or cost, you a penny to make something with two pennies that price that you charge should never be in any way relation to what it costs you and only related to what the market will allow and then it's up to us as entrepreneurs to look at which Arbitrage opportunities exist, between marketplaces that best fit, our skill sets.
9:20
And by doing that, we will then find ourselves in the best opportunity vehicle for us to grow in the long term and probably make the most money.
So anyways, I hope that was I before you hook this made sense for me, this is a topic that I love talking about and I hope that you find Value in that and otherwise have an amazing day.

Hey guys, real quick.
So Leyland are definitely working on our social media presence.
If you guys haven't noticed and we're just breaking now into LinkedIn.
All right.
It's not as bad as I thought it's actually a pretty awesome so far and you guys have been really cool in there and people are sharing our stuff a lot.
So if we aren't connected on LinkedIn, it go ahead and let's connect and let's rock and roll that everyone wishes for the American dream and routes for you for the American dream.
0:21
Until comes true.
Welcome to the game.
Where we talk about it, get more customers, how to make more for customer and how to keep them longer and the many failures and lessons.
We have learned along the way.
Way.
Hope you enjoy and subscribe.
What's going on everyone?
Happy Saturday today.
I wanted to make this podcast for you because I got off the phone with attorney and he and I had a long conversation about a wide breadth of topics and was like, dude, you should talk more about this kind of stuff.
0:50
And so what I want to do is actually share with you kind of my experience of having the chip on my shoulder and kind of where it got me.
And what I learned in the process.
And so if you have any kind of like thoughts around like trying to beat someone and like, like, you're going to take these guys down and like all this stuff.
1:12
And I know many many people in this space, you know, feel that way towards me.
I can tell you having literally gone through the entire process.
It's really interesting.
So, like, when I, when I had my gyms, I wrote this huge essay and it was for myself because I actually have a creative writing background that most people don't know about.
1:33
But I entitled it that everyone wishes for the American dream and routes for you for the American dream, until comes true, and I felt that way with my clients, you know, they were rooting for me when I was sleeping on the floor, they're like good for you, like pursuing your dreams.
And But as time went on, you know, and I started to be able to hire people.
1:53
We started making more money and eventually I didn't have to work in the business, they're like, oh, you're too good for us now, like a big businessman.
Right, and everyone roots for you until you do better than them.
And so what ends up happening is that you have to set Higher and Higher Goals for yourself to drive yourself, right?
2:12
And for me, I definitely was an angrier person, or maybe I'm just better at hiding.
It now, I have no idea, but I was definitely angry or about stuff.
And I set this goal that I was going to beat beige Rose.
If you guys recall who Pedro schooling, and he's a big Guru or was bigger You in the, in the gym space, you can set body.
2:33
And and I started telling myself, all of these things, you know what I mean?
Like, how he's wrong people on.
He's ripping people off, and I would tell myself these stories.
You know what I mean to try and like get myself a that up about like how I'm just going to like write the industry and do everything.
2:50
And I'm going to be bigger than him and like all this stuff, right?
And the reality is, you know, as time went on and and Jim, which grew and grew, and grew, and grew and, you know, I'm not, I don't know, it is numbers are but I'm fairly certain that our coaching program is and has been bigger than his in this space at least for a while.
3:12
And when I got there, you know, I guess to the heart, you know, to match that and surpass.
First off, I found that it was incredibly empty.
But secondly, I felt and realized that he was Completely unaffected.
3:32
He had, he was still incredibly wealthy, he had other entrepreneurial Endeavors, he was pursuing and this my success in no way affected his life.
And it was one of the most humbling and also freeing moments of my life when I realized that.
3:51
Because He wasn't an enemy.
I and I doubt I was even, you know, like a blip on the radar during that time and me obviously they know who we are now, but it didn't affect his life and all this malicious, you know, list is Vengeance.
4:11
This Vendetta that I had, like the only person who poisoned was met and you know, there's two sides to this coin on one side.
You have like the the drive You know, if you guys have seen the Jordan documentary talks about, how used to make things up that other people would say about them, that they never actually said and I feel like it's kind of like that and it's and that chip on your shoulder does drive you.
4:33
So I can't say, it didn't drive me but I don't think it made me a happier person.
Most Nation real quick.
If you are a business owner that has a big old business and wants to get to a much bigger business, going to 50 $100.
4:49
Plus, we would love to talk to you and if you like that or like to hear more about it, go to acquisition.com, you can play anywhere on the page and talk to one of our team and see if we can help you get there.
And so, and believe me, I'm not, the guy who's like, go, go hug trees and be happy.
5:06
Like I'm all about achievement achieving stuff so like bombings, go do whatever works for you, but I can tell you that it seeing it truly, seeing my success not in any way.
Impact someone, else's success, really radically.
5:25
Transformed my feelings about competitors about the space about the industry.
About other coaches in general about what I was going to do to help other coaches, Etc.
It really transformed me.
I started calling up other people who are in our space and just saying like hey how can I help you grow?
5:44
And they're like seriously and I was like, yeah man, I'm like I mean you're not going to take my stuff and I'm not going to take your stuff because people are attracted to different people for different reasons.
You know, people like everyone has different psychographics that they attract like I'm 81 percent male like women in general.
Don't find my my content appealing I'm just like, those are the, that's the data, right?
6:03
Those are the stats.
But the thing is, is that by freeing myself of this, I realized it didn't impact My Success at all.
And other people growing with my, you know, with me helping or without me helping didn't affect my success either, but it did massively affect my mental well-being.
6:22
And so, I guess there's two sides to this message that you can take one is if you were the, you know, the line climbing up the mountain, By all means, stay hungry as hell do.
Whatever it takes for you to stay motivated, but I would say, don't don't do anything stupid, you know, don't don't don't say anything, don't don't take massive, you know, malicious attacks.
6:48
I didn't do that but I'm just saying like, don't do that because you will end up Burning Bridges.
I've had a lot of people do that to me and I'm sure Bader has had it too.
And you know something guys have been in the space for a long time.
I've had people do that and what is happening is that you just kind of burn your Reputation.
7:03
And you know what's going to happen is somebody who's taken a massive, you know, swipe, it may you know, they're going to want to do a deal with someone else and that guy's going to call me and he's like what you think about this guy?
And I'm like yeah I think he's a little bit.
I think he's naive.
I think he's I think he's new but I think he's small bones.
7:19
I think he's an emotional person.
I don't think he's able to restrain himself.
I think he's very volatile, I wouldn't do business with him.
If it were me, you can do whatever you want and I would just be like this is my experience with it.
I would I don't touch people like that.
Ten-foot pole, but do what you want.
And usually, when people hear that, you know, from someone that they think is less volatile, they will usually heed that advice and there's been probably a lot of people who have taken tax.
7:44
I mean, who somehow find things that just fall through for them and that may or may not have been as a result of, you know, me.
But the point is that I think that that anger use it to fuel your soft, but don't use it to attack, it just doesn't end up going well.
8:00
And also people make associations Ian's with how they feel about what you say.
And so if you're always talking negatively in general about other people, people will not remember who you were talking about, but they will remember how you made them feel, and they will associate the negativity with you.
8:15
And so, that's something that I learned early on, in like, some of the persuasion book sounds like, oh, okay.
I need to watch out for that.
And so is hard for me, especially cuz I was like, so angry or when I was younger that to not do that, right?
And so that's that's one side of it, right?
Is if you are, if you are climbing the mountain, and I guess the message the other side is that like It's just you're not going to affect anything like you're not going to hurt anyone by your success.
8:42
And that's like that's probably the biggest message I can give is like, you're not going to hurt anyone.
Like it's not like you're not going to hurt anyone.
Like when people make swipes, it feels like it doesn't hurt me.
Like, it doesn't affect me at all.
Like, it doesn't affect my business.
It doesn't it?
Just, it just affects you and I'm only sharing this because, like, it was something that I think really hurt my mental, well-being, when I was younger.
9:02
And I, and if I can provide value, you know, I hope that that doesn't affect those.
People if they see this Sony's and maybe that's you, you know, maybe it's maybe there's a competitor in your space or maybe there's another, you know, another business down the street that you're like, screw this guy blah blah, blah.
9:20
I can promise you you would make so much more money if you guys just like talked and shared like best practices because it there.
So few markets where it's actually winner, take all there's, it's there.
So few, you know what I mean?
That it actually works that way and it's a zero-sum game.
The reality is that most businesses can't. handle the amount of demand that there is for the service and the solution that they have, the problem that they solve and the other reality is that there's a lot of people that like things solved in different ways, you know, if Layla and I were entering the weight loss base, it's not like I have to start attacking Weight Watchers, you don't, I mean like there's just certain people who are attracted to that type of messaging and if Layla and I got in that space we probably have a very different angle brand message, look and feel then they would and we would attract different types of people with different values and so it's there's A lot of room and the oceans.
10:10
Very, very big, it's so much bigger than everyone gives a credit for.
And that's I think I told a story recently about a competitor quote competitor, another person, another companies, in our space, who's doing this, like the same amount as I as we are.
And they're not even, they're not even like marketing on Facebook.
10:26
And I'm like, are you kidding me and they have their entire outbound team?
And when I heard that I was just like, gosh, I just like I continue to have my mental barriers stretched around these concepts of like if the game is so big and the Person you hurt when you spit hate as yourself.
You hurt your long-term prospects because people at the top to talk, like it's like they're definitely is like, I think I heard 84 cell say this.
10:48
It's like, everyone's just like, hanging out, like, they're all just like most of us know each other.
You know what I mean?
And like, we text each other and hey, how's this working for you?
Hey, I was just like, there's no animosity.
Like I'm friends with a lot of people who are in the gym space who served him owners.
Like I have no malicious intent.
If someone's like, hey, you should I work with something like, give him a shot, you know what I mean?
11:06
Like everyone has a different way of doing things.
Things, you know, this is what ours works well with and if you like our style you like you know you like selling hard, you like going high ticket, you like marketing hard you like focusing on metrics like that's us, you know what I mean?
Like there's people who like more done for you that like that's cool too.
11:23
Like there's guys who do that really well.
So anyways, I I wanted to share this with you because Ed inspired me to share this message with you because if you, you know, if you are angrier, you've you have this anger inside of yourself.
11:38
I want 100% get you, I feel you but I would just say try and use it to Spur yourself on, do not use it to throw shade because it will not benefit your well-being and it won't benefit your long-term success.
So anyways, hope you found it valuable.
11:55
Hope you enjoyed this.
If you did leave a like or comment or view or just listen solemn.
But anyways, hope you have an awesome day and happy Saturday.
I'll catch you guys soon.
Bye.

Most Nation real quick.
If you are a business owner that has a big old business and wants to get to a much bigger business, going to 50 $100.
Plus, we would love to talk to you and if you like that or would like to hear more about it, go to acquisition.com, you can play anywhere on the page and talk to one of our team and see if we can help you get there.
0:18
A lot of times I feel like we need to be reminded more than we need to be taught and this is one of those instances.
Welcome to the game where we talk about, how to get more customers, how to make more per customer and how to keep them longer and the many failures.
And lessons, we have learned Along the way.
I hope you enjoy and subscribe.
What's going on everyone?
0:33
I wanted to bring this video to you.
Downtown coming in hot from Austin.
What I want to talk about today is a saying that we have said over and over and over again in our community and some real-world applications to it and that saying is don't be cute.
0:51
And so the first time I heard the saying was from a Serial CEO, he was a mercenary CEO.
So basically, that is CEO, who's you know, once a Like a private Equity, Firm purchases, a new company.
They go have this kind of Black Book of their, their All-Star players, their SWAT team that they drop in so that they can grow the company.
1:09
Right?
That's kind of how it works.
And so he's one of these CEOs.
He's one of these guys that's brought into a deal, they get the company and then he grows it again for the private Equity usually, in a three to five-year span.
And then they exit, he's done this exit process for times and he was the one who told me this story and so he was like hey don't be cute.
1:28
Is this Long Island accent?
And I was like, I don't really know what that means.
He's like, all right.
So you know, when you playing backyard football I'm not even trying to the accent and I was like, yeah.
He's like so you've got to, you know, you try and make these super fancy plays.
1:43
You're like, are we going to go fake left and then double fake right?
And then we're going to swing around and then you're going to pretend to be the quarterback and then I'm going to throw it that way, right?
He's like what happens, he's like you try it.
And then, you know, Tommy fumbles, the ball, you lose ten yards and you lose the ball, right?
He's like instead he's like Put the two fat guys in the middle.
2:02
Run to the right, right?
And what is that?
He's like, consistent yardage and he's like, don't be cute.
And so that story has always stuck with me because it's so true in business.
And that's what he was applying it to.
But I feel like so many of the entrepreneurs that I talk to in the ones that we work with a lot of times, you know, myself included like we try to be cute and we try and get fancy when it's usually the fundamentals that breed success.
2:27
And one of the biggest telltale signs.
I think if somebody who's Newer is that they do not repeat successful actions and that's there's two types of successful actions.
Their successful actions that you do that yield a good result.
And you think oh I did that.
That works.
Let me go.
Try and do something else rather than doing more of that thing, right?
2:44
That's the first way.
The second way is where you are paying for a system or you're paying for advice or whatever and the person says, do it this way, and then you do not repeat their successful action.
And so, this is one where a lot of times I feel like we need to be reminded more.
3:00
Need to be taught.
And this is one of those instances, because over the last probably week I've had three separate conversations to, with entrepreneurs are doing about three million a year.
And one with a brand new entrepreneur, Maya my neighbor, I think I've referenced them before.
And when I was talking to my neighbor, he just bought this system so you can start flipping real estate and he's doing well and you know, he was he was like I think I might do it this way and I was like listen until you make more than the guy who taught.
3:29
You that system, you do the system exactly.
The way that it was outlined.
All right.
You don't don't get cute.
Don't think you're special.
Don't think your snowflake just do it.
Exactly.
As it's a line because there's a reason it's outlined that way.
And the two entrepreneurs, that I talked to who are on our agency side, her doing about three million a year, we just did a call and I was like, hey, what are your winds from this last month?
3:53
And both of them were like, you know you know, we do know what we've been trying a lot of stuff.
And finally we decided to just You know, do it the way that you would outline it, and we're actually seeing a lot better results and they said, it kind of the tone was, like, I don't have reluctance the right word but like feeling feeling silly right about themselves, that they had taken this long to do that, right?
4:16
And the reason, I'm bringing this up is that if you purchase a system, if you take advice, if you watch a YouTube video of somebody who's doing better than you at something, which is why you're trying to learn, right?
And they're doing it a specific way, there's a reason Reason that they're doing it that way.
It's probably because they have the same goal that you do and probably suffer from the same cons that you suffer from.
4:37
And they've already balanced those for the best outcome, right?
And so recently, this morning, I was on a call with our marketing team, our traffic guys and I was looking at our funnel that we're often.
We're in the process of optimizing and my traffic.
4:54
I was like, man, if people knew how much we work on optimizing our conversion process, he's I feel like they wouldn't want to change anything because they know that we've probably already tried it.
And I wanted to, at least pay homage to that.
Because right now, we're maybe OT three weeks into optimizing.
5:13
This conversion process of series of pages and copy and messaging and whatnot.
And even in those three weeks we've already tested over 100 different pieces of this conversion process, this funnel this series of landing pages, the messaging Etc.
And so that means we've changed the headlines, a handful of times.
5:29
We Change the buttons, we've changed the flow of the pages we've changed where each one leads multiple times.
And so these iterations stack and stack and stack.
And so if I'm going to eventually show someone, hey this is how it works, what do you think the chances are that if they change something, it's going to be better.
5:47
Probably low, right?
And so the thing is that we somehow, you know, I think it's an ego thing as entrepreneurs.
Like, we always think we're special, we think we're different.
We think we're smarter whatever.
But my word of my Thumb for me is until I'm doing as well.
Or better than the person who taught me this thing.
6:05
Do not change it, replicate before you get fancy, right?
And so that's where, you know, doing the boring work, don't be cute.
Those kind of saying, we need to be reminded more than we need to be taught, like those sayings are pervasive in our community.
Because I think they are the things that are the Bedrock of successful entrepreneurship and it's repeating successful actions.
6:26
And there are certain points where once we get this conversion process.
Sized where I think it should be, I probably won't change.
I won't be pushing as much attention to that.
I'll be pushing more of my attention towards filling the top side, right?
So right now we just I'm putting enough attention on bringing in traffic so that I can find the optimal way of converting that traffic.
6:48
But once I feel like, the numbers are optimized, I probably won't tweak that very much because now it's a successful action, and I want to repeat it as many times as I possibly can.
And then I'm going to be focused all in my attention.
On bringing traffic into the top of that conversion process.
7:05
Look, guys.
You guys already know that.
I don't run any ads on this and I don't sell anything.
And so the only ask that I can ever have, if you guys that you help me, spread the words we cannot more entrepreneurs, make more money, feed their families, make better products and have better experiences for their employees and customers.
The only way we do that is if you can rate and review and share this podcast, so the single thing that I have to do is you just leave review, but they can 10 seconds or one type of the thump.
7:29
It means the absolute world to me.
And more importantly, it may change the world for someone else.
And so, as a total side note, because that's what these are for.
I guess if you are in the process of optimizing something, which if you're using someone else's templates or anything like that, then use them the way they are.
7:48
There's a reason they are that way, but if you're coming up from these things from scratch, what I can tell you is that, after having now done this, I've done this optimization process is zillion times in my life.
Now the the headlines and the messages, the top that literally the first one, to two things that someone reads are.
8:06
We do have the biggest swing on the needle and so many times, I've spent hours and days and weeks optimizing the bottom part, the, the images, and the pages, and the, the certain at the pages, the like the copy bullets and things like that that are below the fold right on the newspaper.
8:22
If you, if you flipped it open, there's a fold and then you can flip the second half landing pages.
Work.
The same way above the fold, is what someone sees when they land on their desktop or on their mobile phone.
That's above the fold below the fold as everything else.
I routinely Lee have seen changes of doubling to quadrupling the throughput of a page.
8:41
Meaning the percentage of people who click to do the optimal action you want them to do simply by changing the sentence, at the top, or the sentences at the top, and the one image that someone sees.
And so if you are trying to optimize something, if you're, if you are below, if you're way below where you need to be, don't even worry about anything below the fold.
9:02
And in fact, you could probably spend 90% of your attention above the fold.
Get way higher Returns on your time, then everything below the fold, and I can't see the amount of times.
We're literally just deleting everything below, the fold, got us better better.
Throughput on those types of pages and actions than even putting anything there to begin with, right?
9:20
And so, just recently, I change the headline of our landing page for agencies who are going to be partnering with us for our Allen software and we 3x the throughput of that one page simply by changing the headline, right?
9:36
Right.
And on our scheduling page, which is the third step in this process, we 5x the throughput by removing a headline that was there.
We didn't even add anything.
We literally removed something that was there and so which was hey, you know, you finished this process.
9:54
The next step is this.
We just took out, you finish this process, basically.
And so if you were like, oh, I'm not done.
I need to take this next step and so it's just this huge, massive Jump by removing something that was there.
And so, all of this, At least for me, is this continuous reinforcement that we need to be reminded more than we need to be taught.
10:11
We need to repeat successful actions when they're there, if someone gives us advice or we're taking advice from someone especially for paying for that advice to not take advice is akin to literally burning your money, right?
Because this person or this YouTuber or this, this thing that you're trying to learn from this person trying to learn from has already suffered the consequences of trial and error.
10:31
And so why would you not at least just duplicate Replicate their process and what they're doing first.
And then when you surpass or at least match them, then and only then you will have the understanding of the process to improve it.
10:47
And the thing is, is a lot of times people will become experts because of how many failures they have.
If the first time you step to the the plate, you hit a home run.
You may not know why you did that, is it because of your hips dance is because when you dropped your drop, your elbow, was because you kept your eye on the ball.
11:03
Like there's so many other factors, but if you want the short, Cut to getting to where you want to go replicating other people, success repeating successful actions, both on yourself and what other people have done, is one of the shortest paths to getting there.
And so anywho, don't be cute.
11:20
Don't try and get fancy.
Don't run the, the super crazy, whatever play.
Just look at the fundamentals, follow the steps.
Only iterate.
After you've duplicated, the results of the person you're trying to learn from.
And so that was my message for you today.
That was top of my Find the same advice.
11:37
I gave the 18 year old.
My neighbor who's flipping?
Real estate, not right now, really proud of them and the same advice I give people were doing 3 million plus a year is don't be cute.
Repeat successful actions.
We need to be reminded more than we be taught and then just keep doing the same things over and over and over again, and you will get outsized returns.
11:57
So, anyways, have a happy day.
Hope your marketing is converting like crazy money and leading you to Oil wealth and freedom, only to realize that it is empty in that in the process.
You will turn.
Most of the people that who know you secretly against you.
12:15
They won't purposely tell you that but they secretly in View and that's okay because I'd rather be in bed than pity.
So with that have an amazing day and I'll catch you guys on the flip side.
Bye.

On Amazon, the Kindle book is 99 Cents.
The audiobook is Lowe's, they'll let me put it on for it.
So I think it's 12 bucks.
So enjoy that and let's start the podcast.
If any Group one person or one being one, animal, whatever brings more to the table.
0:34
You are now envious of that person.
And what it does is it elevates the rest of the group to go and achieve the same, which is good for the collective.
Welcome to the game, where we talk about, how to get more customers, how to make more per customer and how to keep them longer and the many failures and lessons, we have learned along the way.
I hope you enjoy and subscribe.
0:52
Hello everyone.
And welcome to another episode of the game.
What I want to talk to you about today was a conversation that I had with Nick Bayer.
We went to dinner last night.
He is a master Mind of Men called billion dollar billion dollar Brotherhood and we were having a conversation about motivation and I figured I would share with you cuz I think it was of a lot of value.
1:14
And so I was sharing that recently, I had delineate, it between the feelings of envy and jealousy and how important it has been for me to be able to first name those emotions.
So that I could then, Analyze how I was feeling about them in the actions that I would subsequently take as a result of them.
1:34
And so I want to at least first cover those and then I'll tell you about our conversation and so Envy is having the desire for something that someone else has that you do not have so you are lacking and someone else has something that you want and do not have.
1:51
That is Envy.
Jealousy is when you have a threat that someone is going to take something that you have that they do not Have, all right?
And so, for example, I'll give you an example of each.
So nvi may be envious of a friend of mine, so I was actually talking to a good friend of mine who runs a big weight loss company and right now he's doing better than I am.
2:12
And now, I am envious of his success.
I am, I can feel it.
I'm envious.
I got off the phone.
I was like, I'm envious of you right?
On the flip side.
If someone comes to talk to Layla, right?
It is the fact that they pose the threat of taking attention, or her attention that I think should.
2:29
In you Loosely belong to me that I would feel jealous over.
I haven't had even felt jealousy in a long time, but that is that is an example.
You could also be like with your kids.
If you have some, you know, some other adult in their life, starts taking their attention, or has more influence over them.
You are jealous of the influence that that person is now, is threatening your influence over your child, right?
2:50
So, two examples there Nuance, but I think it's important and when I was talking to Nick barely about this, I was talking about how I think Envy gets a bad rap and I'm not going to go into the spiritual religious side of this or even the happiness side of this because I think Envy, absolutely does not make you happy, but I do think that Envy will make you successful.
3:09
Alright.
And so this, this is where I want to kind of dive into this.
Envy is adaptive right as human beings.
This is actually from our old brain, right?
This is animals have this to, they are envious of one another.
And it's because if in a group one person, or one being, when animal, whatever brings more to the table, you are now Us of that person.
3:30
And what it does is it elevates the rest of the group to go and achieve the same, which is good for the collective, not happier for each of the individuals, but as a pro survival tool, right?
And so for me, understanding this, and at least being able to name the emotion, rather than saying, I don't like this guy, or I'm angry at this person or having this negative feeling that you cannot put words to instead being able to say I am envious has been very relieving for me because now I can actually tell those people.
3:58
Hey, I'm envious of And for some reason I think it just creates another level of Candor because it's a certain level of vulnerability and saying you have something that I wish I had.
But then you'll notice that the conversation is not defensive on that person's part most of the time, they're like, well, let me help you.
4:14
And it's only when we guys are intentions or trying or try and Fain, you know, pretend to be a different way than we are.
Where people also can sense that you're being disingenuous like great job man, right?
When realize deep down and they can tell from your your subtle tonality changes in the way you look that the that you're actually not happy for them.
4:34
Right?
And so I think if you can only say it then actually gives you power.
Real quick guys.
If you can think about how you found this podcast, somebody probably tweeted it told you about it.
Should it on Instagram or something like that?
The only way this grows is through word of mouth and so I don't run ads, I don't do sponsorships, I don't sell anything.
4:53
I only ask is that you continue to pay it forward to whoever showed you or however you found out about this podcast that you do the exact same thing.
So if it was a review if it was a post, if you do that would mean the world to me and you throw some good karma out there for another entrepreneur.
Now, in terms of judging your motivations, because obviously might think that Envy is a bad motivation, it is my belief that I would rather deal with people who do good things for bad, reasons than bad reasons.
5:19
For good things are, I said the same thing twice, but they do the right thing for the wrong reasons, rather than the wrong things for the right reason.
All right, I'd rather someone who does the right outcome and he gave me an example, that was really powerful.
5:35
He said a friend of his Was a top Navy SEAL.
And, you know, one of the best Navy Seals who trains Navy Seals just total badass, right?
And before that, he was an EMT and he talked about his experiences being an EMT is that most people think, you know, EMTs have to be really caring that you want them to, you know, they have to save these people's lives every day and he said, the Navy SEAL was saying, I was not compassionate at all, I didn't really care that much about the person who was on the table in front of me.
6:04
But what I did care about was my staff.
So I cared about the status of being the best.
I wanted to have the fastest to the hospital, want to have the highest survival rates, highest success, rates of the people that were under my care because I cared about myself being the best.
And so the question is, if you were the person who's on the table having a heart attack, would you rather have the compassionate EMT or would you rather have the self-interested EMT who is doing it for status?
6:33
Well, if it were me, I'd rather have the guy who wanted to Pride, himself on being the best in the world and did.
Given care about me at all because I knew his result was going to be more Pro me than the other person's.
And so I think that as humans as entrepreneurs, we judge ourselves a lot on our motivations and our intent in our intentions, but I think that if we can take a step back and a name the emotion.
6:53
So that's not this amorphous thing that we can understand.
But then take the next step and say, is this, is this, a pro adaptive?
Emotion?
Is this something that's going to help me?
Or is this an emotion?
That's going to drive me to do something that is - and I think, at least even even in naming that we can increase the time between emotion and action.
7:12
And the further that time Gap is in general, the better the quality of the decisions you make because the more rational we are, we're never completely rational because we're emotion driven beings and we have limbic systems that override things.
But the more we can decrease the triggers, the emotional triggers that cause us to make bad decisions.
7:31
Ultimately the better decisions we make.
And so I say all this to say big picture, ER, first naming, the emotions, it's important second, it creates space so we can make better decisions.
Third, we can analyze those decisions and say is this something that is going to help me in my life?
7:48
Or is it something that's going to hurt me?
And then, as a result of this, we don't have to judge ourselves as strongly on why we are doing things and rather, what is being done?
Because candidly, I am a very envious individual and maybe this is me just Just rationalizing.
8:08
My own -, you know, emotions, who knows.
But at least for me saying it that way and framing the thought process in that way has helped me, feel better about myself, and just not, or really just less bad if that's probably a better way of saying it, and not constantly berating myself for having desires, that I think are wrong.
8:31
And so, Dan Sullivan said this and I'll end with this.
Is that When people want something.
If you want to make more money, if you want to have a bigger house, you want to have a bigger car, you want to build a podcast Studio, whatever right.
He said wanting is reason enough because so many times we ask, but why do we want that?
8:51
We're probably not going to change the desire.
And so letting us letting ourselves desire things and giving ourselves permission to desire things.
And myself specifically has been incredibly freeing and what it's done is given me a tremendous amount of my attention back.
9:06
Back that used to be allocated to analyzing why I'm feeling this way or why this is right or why this is wrong.
And instead accepting the fact that I want something and that wanting it as, okay, as long as it is not something that is hurting other people and that is not something that is starting me.
9:25
And so anyways, I hope that makes sense.
I hope that provide you some value or hopefully maybe some clarity around putting words to your own emotions.
The decisions that results from them and whether they are positive or negative and eliminating the judgment That equation, provided it's something that helps so anyways.
Keeping awesome, keep amazing and have an awesome great Magic Bunny day.
9:44
Get you do.








0:00
Real quick.
Because you guys already know that, I don't run any ads on this and I don't sell anything.
And so, the only ask that I can ever have you guys that you help me spread the word so we can have more entrepreneurs, make more money, feed their families, make better products, and have better experiences for their employees and customers.
And the only way we do that is if you can rate and review and share this podcast, so the single thing that I have to do is you can just leave review will take you 10 seconds or one type of the thumb, mean, the absolute world to me.
0:25
And more importantly, it may change the world of someone else.
The only things that don't actually Really have an end to them or things that you do not understand.
Welcome to the game, where we talk about, how to get more customers, how to make more per customer and how to keep them longer and the many failures and lessons, we have learned along the way.
I hope you enjoy and subscribe.
0:42
What's going on?
Everyone, I want to make this short short video for you because I had a number of conversations last week that resulted in kind of this consistent point of coaching which is, it's never going to work forever.
And so I've seen this happen in so many different situations where people We'll try and give themselves a reason to not even begin something because they think that there is an end to it.
1:06
When the reality is the only things that don't actually have an end to them, or things that you do not understand.
And so, if you don't, if you see something as a forever option, then it probably means you do not understand it well enough to begin doing it, so there's a little mindfuck for you.
1:23
And so let me give you a couple examples to bring this home.
So, you know, when I was in the fitness space that had a lot of people who'd Come up to me and be like, hey man, like I want to start working out.
I want to get bigger was like, awesome, you know?
This is how you gotta train blah blah, and they'd be like what I want to get too big.
1:39
Like, you don't even look like you work out.
So why don't we start with that?
And then we can worry about you getting too big.
Right?
So it's not a perfect example for business but that's an example of somebody trying to Discount starting because they think they see an end that they do not even understand the journey.
1:56
Well, enough to comprehend another example, would be.
Hey, We're running Tick-Tock ads right now and we're crushing it, right?
And someone says, well we don't know how long takes Hawks going to be around or SnapChat or insert, whatever new opportunity there is and so we don't want to do it, right?
2:16
But the reality is all opportunities are by their very nature Arbitrage where you're taking advantage of in efficiencies within two systems or two markets.
And so over time all Arbitrage, Disappears.
Right?
And then markets become more efficient?
2:31
That's how markets work.
Right.
More and more people, see the opportunity the bit, the Arbitrage, decreases, until eventually it sufficient, right?
And so when you're looking at opportunities and you see something and it might be a big opportunity, only is going to be open for two years, three years.
Do you do it or not?
2:48
It's another series of questions.
I would happen after that, but I would not discount it simply because, you know, that it is finite because all opportunities are finite and to take this exaggerated, you know, this example to a Max degree of Exaggeration, think about the Fortune, 500, there's only one company that's been on there for over 100 years and that's G just one.
3:10
One company, right?
And so every one of those companies you might have thought or during their day me like this thing is going to be here forever.
The reality is it's not in markets changed so rapidly, it's difficult to reshift an entire infrastructure.
Some companies can do it.
Many fail.
3:28
Hey guys, love that.
You're listening to the podcast.
If you ever want to have the video version of this which usually has more effects, more visuals, more graphs, you know, drawn out stuff.
Sometimes it can help hit the brain centers in different ways.
You can check out my YouTube channel.
It's absolutely free.
So check that out if that's what you are into and if not keep enjoying the show, And so, if your business is founded upon taking advantage of an Arbitrage opportunity or an inefficiency in a Marketplace or something, that is fleeting, right?
3:58
That comes and goes, that's okay.
Many businesses were built off of Arbitrage opportunities, that created cash flow, human resources.
That could then be deployed in pivoted in another Direction when the opportunity closes.
And so, it's kind of like saying well I don't want to invest in this investment.
4:18
Because it's only going to Triple my money in three years.
Well what do I do after it?
Triples my money, will you take the money you invest it somewhere else, right?
It's the same concept except you're just applying it to your business and so this is just a caveat that was top of mind that I figured I would share with you because just so many times we try and take 10 steps forward without even realizing that there's this big pile of money and you can just pick it up and move about your life and it doesn't need to be forever and so it's just a remembering like if this were an investment.
4:47
Would you triple?
I mean three years, probably.
So then don't worry about you're going to do in 20 years because you're gonna be such a different person than anyways.
You might even want to be in the same thing forever.
And so I think sometimes we just create this reason because the real reason is that we fear failing when something seems so easy, right?
5:05
We fear failing because we might not think we're good enough or we're being lazy and we don't want to even start our try and so it's usually the fear thing but for some people you can you get off your ass.
Anyways, I hope I I hope you found this valuable.
Maybe this, you're a decision right now where you're thinking about investing something, or your thing, about taking advantage of an opportunity, or think about investing your time into taking advantage of some sort of inefficiency.
5:30
And if it's a massive one, even if it's going to be fleeting, as long as the return is high enough, I think many times, it can be worth it.
So, anyways, this is more targeted for newer entrepreneurs.
If you're in an existing vehicle means you've already found in Arbitrage opportunity.
5:47
So don't try and do another Other one, unless it's something that feeds your original model.
But anyways, I hope that makes sense.
Keeping awesome have a fantastic day and I'll catch you next video.








0:00
Real quick guys.
If you can think about how you found this podcast, somebody probably tweeted it told you about it.
Should it on Instagram or something like that?
The only way this grows is through word of mouth and so I don't run ads, I don't do sponsorships, I don't sell anything.
I only ask is that you continue to pay it forward to whoever showed you or however you found out about this Pockets that you do the exact same thing.
0:19
So if it was a review if it was a post, if you do that would mean the world to me and you throw some good karma out there for another entrepreneur.
Most of us are just a normal markets that are growing a normal amount and the nice thing is if you're In one of those markets, you can still make a tremendous amount of money.
Welcome to the game, where we talk about, how to get more customers, how to make more per customer and how to keep them longer and the many failures and lessons, we have learned along the way.
0:39
I hope you enjoy and subscribe.
Good morning everyone.
What I want to do is share with you, the three things that will have the biggest direct impact on how much money you make.
All right.
And so these are the three biggest levers for growth in a business.
Three big levers for Biz growth.
0:57
All right.
Going up.
All right.
The first is going to be your Market, all right?
And so the reason that investors look at this stuff is because they know that if you put a great entrepreneur in a bad Market, or a bad Market or a, hey, a bad entrepreneur in a great Market.
1:15
The market will usually win.
And so let me tell you a quick story about this to illustrate this point.
So one of my friends Lloyd owned a great tech company, he started it probably a decade ago and they grew pretty Quickly and then it's sort of plateaued and then it started to go down and he's trying to figure this out and you were struggling with it and he called me up one and he was like, hey dude what do you think the issue is with this?
1:39
And I was like dude you're you're selling your software to newspapers because that was his exclusive customer for his his ad product and despite having an amazing offer and being a great salesman because it was a zero risk offer them.
He only just rev shared with them.
Despite both of those things, he was not able to grow because he was in In the newspaper Market which was shrinking by 25% every single year.
2:03
Over eight years that he had the business, right?
You still has it to the side but for eight years, use trying to figure out what was going on and you looked at every single piece of the business except for probably the most obvious one, which is the market itself.
And so what I want to reduce with these three levers and that's the first one is the market is you have to do these from the top down, all right?
2:21
If you were in a horrible Market, it doesn't matter how good your offer is, it doesn't matter how good your a persuasive abilities.
Are you prop?
You will not be able to out-power a bad mark.
And so the way I look at these levers is, is this going to be a plus?
Is it going to be, you know, a neutral or is it going to be a negative right?
2:38
And so as long as your Market is not a negative and is either a neutral or a plus, you can move on to the second lever for business growth.
Alright, the second lever is your offer, all right?
And what I mean by that is what you would literally giving a customer in order to transact with them, all right?
2:56
This is the the, the products and services.
Has that you offer in exchange for money and in the terms under which you offer them and what they need to do to redeem them, all right.
That is in essence, what an offer is.
All right.
And so these are the terms, the price Etc and what they get.
3:12
Now, if you're in a normal Market or a good Market, you're in a good Market, it doesn't matter, right?
If you were, you know, selling toilet paper during covid, it didn't matter.
What, what's your offer was or how persuasive you are, which is the third one you were just you were in the Right Market at the right time and you're going to make a ton of money, right?
3:32
But most of us are in this market, most of us are just a normal markets that are growing a normal amount.
And the nice thing is, if you're in one of those markets, you can still make a tremendous amount of money by offering a unique offering and a good product, right?
And so the offer is going to be the second thing.
3:48
Now, if you have an incredible irresistible offer then more people will say yes and you can make a tremendous amount of money but again here you can have an amazing offer.
You can have a normal office.
Were you can have a shitty offer, right?
And as long as you do not have a shitty offer or a normal offer, you can move on to the next one.
4:06
All right.
Which is the third big lever.
All right?
Which is persuasion.
All right, so some people are naturally good, persuaders, they're good, they're good marketers, they're good salespeople.
And the thing is that each of these is more important than the rest.
4:22
All right, so it goes from the top down so I'll give you some examples if I were in an amazing Market.
It Doesn't matter if my offer persuasion abilities are good.
I'll make a ton of money if I'm in a bad Market.
It doesn't matter if I'm in a good persuasion and good offering, I'm not going to make any money.
4:39
And so basically you can just move from the top down and check these off your list.
And so, most of us are going to be here in this normal market, right?
A normal Market, you serve dentist, your serve chiropractors.
You serve normal people who are in pain.
Those are normal markets.
They're not growing, they're not shrinking, they're just normal, right?
4:58
Hey guys real quick for those of you guys who are 100 million-dollar offers fans I love you.
I added in a lost chapter that has never been released.
I'm releasing it now transparently.
I'm doing that to build hype 400 dollar leads but you will have the unreleased chapter, it talks about your first Avatar and how to segment customers to make more money.
5:17
You can get it by going to acquisition.com forward slash leads.
Its fo free in exchange for your email so that I can email you when we launched under Miller leads and so that you can not miss out on it.
Because last time I sold out for like Eight straight weeks really fast.
So, that is my way of making sure that y'all get first dibs.
5:35
Now from there we move to our offer.
Now the thing is is that this is typically the easiest lever on any business to grow the business because any business, if takes a little bit of time to go from a normal offer to an amazing offer, you can't really go from a normal Market to an amazing Market with your business, unless you change your entire business.
5:55
But with an offer you simply can repackage the value proposition, how you charge in the terms under which you offer your services, and you can move from having a normal offering.
Or a subpar offering to an amazing irresistible offer, I call them Grand Slam offers, and the reason I call them that is because Grand, Slams are both very rare and very good.
6:14
But the difference between baseball and businesses that when you have a grand slam offer you can knock the ball so far to the park, you can win four thousand years and that's the difference right in baseball, you can only win, four runs, no matter, how good your offer is and business you going in for life.
And so making the actual best offer is going to be the second biggest lever on your business now.
6:34
Us assume that you've got a great offer.
Now if you have crap persuasion skills, you'll still make money.
If you have normal persuasion skills, you make a lot of money.
If you have fantastic persuasion skills, you'll make a tremendous amount of money.
All right.
Which leads me to the next piece.
So let's assume that you're just having normal offer or not an amazing offer.
6:53
All right, then it takes us to our third portion here.
The only way if that is your scenario, you're in a normal Market, your normal, you have a normal offer the only way for you to be hyper successful.
Is to develop, persuasion abilities, and stats, learning how to Market and sell how to acquire customers through multiple channels, right?
7:12
And so the thing is that, this one is usually the most difficult to acquire, in my opinion.
It takes a lot of time, takes a lot of effort, takes a lot of volume to, a lot of practice, a lot of failure in order to get good at this, all right?
And so, if I'm looking at a business and I'm trying to grow it, the first thing I'm going to do is check this off, is just say, like, are we making sure that we're not in a bad market?
7:30
And we're, at least in a normal or good Market?
You'll know if you're in a good Market, believe me, like I said, If you're selling toilet, paper covid-19, if you're selling hot dogs outside of a baseball stadium as soon as the game once out, you know, you're in a good market rate, but most of us are here.
So, as long as I'm not in a bad Market, I move on to the next one.
And so, if I'm looking at the business, I say, okay, what is the current offering?
7:48
What are we doing?
In exchange for money?
What are we giving clients, right?
What are the terms of the agreement, what's the price point?
And what are they getting in exchange?
All right, and so then what I will do is shift the business.
From here in this direction to create a grand slam offer.
And the beautiful thing is this can literally take a half a day.
8:06
Maybe a day, right?
Where you just re recombine repackage, reposition rename the offers change the terms under which you, you make, you offer your businesses and services and products and overnight.
You can take a normal business to an extraordinary business by doing this one thing, all right?
8:22
And then finally, the last thing that you can do is you can develop all the skills of persuasion.
So, If you're looking at the entrepreneurial Journey, my recommendation for most people is I start here.
This is the first thing I will do.
The second thing I will do is get them to focus here in on proving the skill and going from a normal sales person or normal Market or to an exceptional salesperson marketer because they should already be being reasonably successful because we fix the offer first and then move up to the top of the biggest lever.
8:51
And say, now that we understand how to make amazing offers how to persuade people in masses.
Now, let's go find a market that we know we can apply.
The skill set to that we think is going to crush it.
So right now, if your business is not growing, it might be because you are lacking one, two or all three of the levers that create success.
9:11
And so, if that hopefully, that found it, you found the valuable.
Hopefully, you can think about your own business within this context.
Am I in a, a great Market?
A normal Market?
Or shrinking Market is my offer and Singley compelling?
Is it normal?
Or is it bad?
My are my persuasion abilities.
Exceptional.
9:27
Can I acquire clients at the snap?
Fingers whenever I want do they come in kind of semi consistently but you know I can't really grow it or do I have no idea what I'm doing going to get people on the phone and I can never get money, right?
And so if you can rate yourself on these things, then you can identify where you have opportunities for growth and then follow these steps to get to where you want to go.
9:48
So, hopefully that you found value in that.
Hopefully, that was cool in terms of in terms of framing how growth and the biggest levers that exist in business overall and keeping awesome.
And I will see you on the flip side by see you on the flip side by

Hey guys, love that.
You're listening to the podcast.
If you ever want to have the video version of this which usually has more effects, more visuals, more graphs, you know, drawn out stuff.
Sometimes it can help hit the brain centers in different ways.
You can check out my YouTube channel, it's absolutely free.
Go check that out if that's what you are into.
0:16
And if not keep enjoying the show, what I want to share with you is the one sales tactic that is directly made over thirty five million dollars for my company and I want to show you how I learned it.
Welcome to the game where we talked about To get more customers, how to make more per customer and how to keep them longer and the many failures and lessons, we have learned along the way.
0:35
I hope you enjoy and subscribe.
So, when I was at my own gym, back in the day, probably eight years ago, I was really struggling, right?
And I was traveling to come back, home or something.
And during a layover, I saw this guy that used to go to college with and he he was, I didn't think this guy was like that one smarter than me and like, definitely didn't.
0:55
Like, I was in some classes.
I was like, I don't think this guy's that bright and he sits down next.
I mean he says he's like, oh how's your gym?
I heard you got a gym and was like, you know, it's going.
Well, I was like trying to be cool and he's like, yeah, I've got this supplement store was like, oh, that's awesome.
So I've got two locations now is like, oh well fancy it and I said, well, you guys do like a month, he says I don't know.
1:17
We do like 70, 80 thousand a month and I was like in supplements.
He was like yeah.
And at that moment it was like my mind broke.
I was like if this guy can do this I'm going to find a way like I said, I've got this whole gym full of people and I don't sell them, stop them once.
And so when I came back, I was like 100% committed to selling supplements.
1:36
Like I'm going to figure out how to do this and every single client look like you to my facility after I would sell them.
Our service package I was like Hey, by these supplements right?
And they were like, no I'm not going to and it felt horrible.
And I literally just again and again and again I just kept getting beat up and I bought all this inventory after I talk to that guy and so this cash just sitting on my shelf and I was like, I have to find a way to move this.
2:00
And so one day I think I had 15 or 20 consultation so I'd I'd sold a bunch of people into a new program that was starting and I was doing all the one-on-one orientations.
Now it's probably like 15 orientations deep and I just headed no after no, after no after no.
And finally, I was sitting down and this nice lady walked in.
2:18
She had like a nice ring in a nice person.
I was like, okay, if I don't sell this woman, I'm going to kill myself and so and she was like super upbeat and anybody who's ever done sales like you know, when you see that person you're like I'm definitely closing this one like I I have to close this one.
Like this is how I pay my bills.
And so she sits down and I remember getting to the end of the presentation and I just said instead of my normal pitch around like hypertrophy and maintaining body mass and just a whole bunch of jargon that she would never even understand.
2:44
I said, hey, so what the program is like, do you want to do?
You want chocolate or vanilla for your protein?
And she was like, which one do you like?
I was like, chocolate.
She's like, all right, I'll take one of those.
And I was like, I didn't want to scare her away so it's like, I've got for the Pre-Workout.
3:03
Do you want to do kiwi or strawberry?
I like the Kiwi.
She was like, okay, I'll do that one and I didn't want to sell anymore because I was afraid that you would somehow back out and so and I didn't want to like make any other purchasing decision.
So I said you wanted to use the card you have on file and she was like yeah that's fine.
3:21
And then I took these off the shelf and I slid them over to her and she grabbed them and she smiled and she walked out of the Scylla T and I made my first supplement sale and I was like, holy shit.
A Mossad agent quick break, just to let you know that we've been starting to post on LinkedIn and want to connect with you.
3:42
Alright.
So send me a connection request.
A note letting me know that you listen to the show and I will accept it.
There's anyone you think that would be should be connected with tag them in one of my or laila's posts?
And I will give you all the love in the world.
All right, so let's get back to the show.
I didn't even talk at all about what these even did or how to take them, or what the benefits were.
4:04
I just simply asked her which one she wanted and the key was, I didn't ask her whether she wanted them.
I asked her which one she wanted, and as soon as I realized that, that is when I was introduced to the assumed close, all right?
4:20
It is one of the strongest upsells in all of business.
All right?
Like I can't tell you whenever whenever I hear I hear someone if there's ever a sales process that generates tons and tons of traffic, and they're closing anywhere in the 80% plus range.
I usually know that it's an upsell, all right?
4:37
And the beauty of an assumed close is that the prospect is choosing between two options.
That both are buying from you rather than whether or not they're going to purchase.
And so the beauty is, if you can construct your conversations in a way that makes the sales seamless and make it assume that they're going to have this extra thing with your program, you can immediately upset A big, big big percentage of customers.
4:59
Whereas maybe normally you might close one out of three or one out of four or if you're really good one out of two of customers, walk in the door, with an assumed closes, an upsell you can sell nine out of ten, nine and a half out of ten of the people that you sit in front of and you can close them at higher tickets at higher percentages.
5:15
And part of the reason is because in an upsell opportunity, you're selling to a customer who already knows and trusts you, right?
And if you pair the fact that they already know and trust you with the fact that you already have a purchase that's already happened.
You have there.
Their information on file and then you simply present them with an either or option that both include buying you will typically get a huge percentage to take that option.
5:36
And so this this assumed closed rapidly transform our business.
I ended up making just as much if not more from the supplement sales and profit than I did for my actual facility, it became a staple.
In all the locations that I had.
I was able to cover all of my advertising spend simply from the upsells and so that took all of what used to be my service revenue and just turn that into profit.
5:56
Because I could cover all my acquisition cost simply with the table cells.
I taught this to all of the facilities that we had and they ultimately use that for selling Prestige Labs, which is the brand of something that we have that pays really, really high margins for gyms.
And so that single experience, where that lady, bless her soul just said, yes to the either, or option is what significantly changed a huge part of my life.
6:20
And so anyways, I hope you take something from that.
I hope there's, there's something you can look in terms of your sales process.
In terms of something you could upset doesn't It'd have to be a product, it can be a service, it could be, you know, it can obviously be any kind of retail stuff.
Physical products is really easy because already sold service.
So next that you want to think about what's the next natural thing that they're going to want to need or want, or going to have to normally Buy on their journey.
6:40
And if you're like I don't know how to find something like that, you just simply look at what the normal things.
That a normal that a customer will buy.
In addition to your services as a result of the decision.
You know, Fitness is an easy one, people go, buy clothing, finish clothes, they buy shoes, they might buy some at home stuff, they might start downloading some apps.
6:56
They might get different groceries.
So that's food or food, prepping, food, prep, materials, a Crock-Pot.
Like, all of those things are things that be a company than obviously supplements.
And so, a lot of times when it consumer makes a decision to work with you on a server side, there's other additional purchases that they're going to make.
And if you can, if you can, if you can predict what those are, which you should know, and we've those into your sales process as an either-or decision, you will usually get a very big percentage to uptake and a lot of times, those upsells can be all profit for you and even offset the entire cost of acquisition of Getting a new customer.
7:27
So I can't even stress how how impactful this was in my life.
And so anyways, hope you on the valuable.
Hope that was cool.
If you like this stuff, you know, like subscribe, all that kind of jazz.
And I think I've got some trainings that you can go through for free and go, click do that and get you








0:00
Real quick.
Because you guys already know that, I don't run any ads on this and I don't sell anything.
And so, the only ask that I can ever have you guys that you help me spread the word so we can have more entrepreneurs, make more money, feed their families, make better products, and have better experiences for their employees and customers.
And the only way we do that is if you can rate and review and share this podcast, so the single thing that I have to do is you can just leave review will take you 10 seconds or one type of the thumb, mean, the absolute world to me.
0:25
And more importantly, it may change the world of someone else.
Hey everybody.
This is the gym Secrets podcast.
And today, we're going to be talking about some of the frequently asked questions that we get most commonly from gym owners, and we said No Holds Barred ask us anything about any part of our Lives.
0:42
Hopefully, that's not about our program, but about other stuff.
So we are on a plane that we were able to fortunately privately chartered for ourselves to get out of the way of hurricane Maria.
That was heading towards Puerto Rico.
There were no flights left as we were fortunate enough to get on this flight.
0:59
So we are Very blessed and so when you get back and it's just questions.
So Layla has the list of questions shoot.
What does it take to be away from your business for 30 days and then 90 days?
And then a year excetera, have it run as close as if you were there.
1:16
I understand no one will rub your business like you well, but there must be systems in place for this to happen in my belief.
That's a great question.
And this kind of goes back to the analogy that I use that businesses are like Gardens and not like machines and I know that it's like it would be really easy for me to sell like the dream of yeah, like you're gonna You know, you know, you're a business, just print money and it's going to just, like, sending you checks in the mail all day long, and you never have to work, I don't know anyone who does that.
1:47
Like, seriously, I don't know anyone and like, we've even, you know, we saved our dollars and we're looking at investing in real estate and apartment buildings and things like that.
And I talk to my real estate buddies and I'm like, gosh almighty.
We got property managers.
We got tenants, we got to fix stuff, and I was like, this thing supposed to be a passive investment and they're like, haha, there is no passive income and so, It's, you know, they're the reason that the number one McDonald's in the world does a lot more than the the number 500 McDonald's in the world is because the guy who's pushing it.
2:17
Now, I say business can work like a garden instead of a machine because the garden.
You don't have to be out of garden all day long, right?
If you plan it, you played the see you to water it.
Well, it can grow, right?
But you still have to weed it.
You still have to water it.
You still gotta go market and get new seeds and plant new things.
2:35
You gotta water to bring new flowers, water employees water.
Ants.
But the thing is, you have to be there all the time.
And so not being there for 30 days is doable, but not being there for 90 days.
That's like a stretch.
I mean, like, do I think that Jim like even the business we have?
2:52
No, I think Jim Lynch could run like that maybe.
But like, I don't know if I'd want it to, you know, like the like I guess it's a really good question because it kind of confronts a different issue which is like most entrepreneurs like they seek the dream of freedom.
3:08
Them until they like, actually get on the beach in her, like, bored out of their mind after they spend three days, like doing nothing.
And they're like, what am I going to do, right?
And so it's think it's really connecting with the cause that you're behind.
So, like, if like, for us, like, I love gym owners, like I loved him owners.
3:24
I love solving gym, owner problems.
I all.
I think about all day long and I can try and come up with products and solutions to issues that I faced in that they, that they have as the marketplace changes.
And if you're thinking about your Rumors like that you'll be pulled instead of pushed to work.
3:41
You'll feel obligated.
Like, I have to help these people and I think it's by really thinking about Creative Solutions and elevating your level of service for those customers.
I know there's around about question but anyways, yeah, the simple question are simple answer, is, can you get your business to run on autopilot for a year?
4:03
No, visit not.
That I know of.
I'll put it that way.
I don't know how to do that with the gym and I haven't met anyone who could Do it either.
Now with a microchip.
That's owner-operated.
That's, that's specializes in service.
Not like a Planet Fitness.
That's a facility usage type.
Jim, it's a different animal, but yeah, if you're selling service then it's much more difficult.
4:21
Okay.
Next question, how do you know when it's appropriate fire client?
Remember.
Oh how do you know it's appropriate to fire a client?
We remember as soon as you think about them a lot.
It's pretty much the answer there like I think about someone and I got like a Turning feeling in my stomach.
4:40
I confront them.
If the filling doesn't go away, I remove them if it's at the my control.
Next question.
How is Charles Carroll?
He's awesome.
He's not really happy with this right now because he's been moving, and he's been on planes a bunch, but he's a cute dog and it, as much as I was against the having a pet, it's nice to like, have a little brightness in your day when you're used to like, a mental break.
5:04
You love some more than me now and it was what caused you to.
To shift to from done for you or I'm sorry.
What caused your shift from done with you two done for you.
What caused the shift from done with you to done for you are sorry.
5:20
Done for you done with you.
Hey guys, love that.
You're listening to the podcast.
If you ever want to have the video version of this which usually has more effects, more visuals, more graphs, you know, drawn out stuff.
Sometimes it can help hit the brain centers in different ways.
5:36
You can check out my YouTube channel.
It's absolutely free.
So check that out if that's what you are into and if not keep enjoying the show, Basically what the so there's a couple things.
One is scaling a sales team each month.
Like because what happened is we were able to basically sell out our services with six sales guys.
5:55
Six months out within two weeks.
And so for someone like me, that was really frustrating because I like, you know, I was getting on the phone with people being like yeah, like the first time we can take you seven months from now, and for me to continually scale salesman was really, really hard, because it takes a lot of hustle, and there's a ton of travel and Logistics not that it was under Table.
6:14
It just like there's a lot of moving pieces to it and because of the logistics and the travel in the hotel's, the rental cars, the insurance, all that stuff, and be fronting the money for the ads and all that stuff.
It wasn't as high margin as I wanted it to be tons of Revenue, but it's the margins weren't there.
6:30
And then the other reason was that I actually had a lot of resentful customers.
Some like, if someone averages, you know, the gym owners average about twenty thousand of your take-home income, which is really sad and it's sure that's what we're trying to fix.
But if there, You 20,000, you're taking a big tub and then like subdued comes in and makes 50 Grand and 30 days from his from Israeli, 21 days from this gym, they didn't really like me that much even if I gave him a bunch of customers, they just really like me so I didn't like that and I want my customers like being, which means I was like, how can I serve them in a different way?
7:03
And then it also allowed us to scale way faster and make a much bigger impact.
So that's why we made the change.
What tools should a manager have to determine if coaches are performing and working properly.
I use the same thing for customer service, which is I should be getting posts regularly about you about how amazing you are on Facebook.
7:25
If I don't see, post it to your like almost daily.
I'm going to think that there's an issue.
There, should be zero complaints.
There should be customers going out of their way, to personally, tell me how awesome they are and how I don't appreciate my employees enough or just like making comments like you need to pay someone some More, they're amazing.
7:41
Like like I know like that's why that's why they're my employee.
Like I know they're great because I hired and trained them.
But what else from the other pieces that like, I know they're doing your job is like you can like as long as you have cameras and you walk in, it's also having good relationships with your customers like even with our gym owners of our service providers are doing a good job.
8:04
Like I think everyone has good enough rapport with me to be like hey by the way, this sucks, right?
So you want to always This actually looks you said ways to do a separate issue point, but you want to always communicate that you have exceptional training, exceptional service and you want to make it clear to everyone.
That if they don't like that, they need to tell you if they get anything but exceptional service.
8:22
And so that way, your customers start policing your employees for you because there's no way you can be everywhere at once.
Next question.
Determine what's most appropriate for your continuing education.
Do you budget for it?
Most appropriate for my continued dedication.
8:41
I usually So I consume a ton of information courses seminars masterminds like a lot.
I hire guys, multiple thousands dollars an hour just to give me two hours of time on like how they are truly doing something and applied to my business or gym business or whatever.
9:02
I wish I could give you like the kosher answer.
I invested like probably three quarters of my income for the first three years, and learning more stuff.
So, I think that, I think that your mind is the long game.
You are the you are the biggest investment you can make because ultimately like if everything is taken for me like I can make it all over again because I have because I made that investment it's like the it's honestly like the easiest future-proofing.
9:26
Like you want to feel secure.
Get better, you know, Amy get smarter get faster.
Get.
Anyways, I don't need to go on a tangent there, but that's, that's my personal honest answer is.
I spend all the money I possibly can, and I just try and make sure that I vet, who I'm spending the money with that, they're actually awesome.
9:42
And the way that I see that is what have you done?
And is it for people like me?
And if you taking them to where I want to go, When you type your income, is it a direct deposit?
Or do you write the check, does it all go to the same place?
So for us?
9:58
So yeah, I mean it's a little bit faith-based for us but so there's tides and offering.
So for us, Tides is 10%, and so we give 10% of what our income is.
So, you know, the business can make one of the business makes but then whatever we write ourselves as a check is what we tithe off of.
And then an offering would be anything that we go above, and beyond that tide, which is always to our church.
10:19
So we tied to our church.
Because that's what's recommended which is Malachi.
Gosh, I wish I could remember the first of all, it's like Malachi 13 something.
But anyways, I always remember it because it's like basically if you gift if you give to the Lord, he says test me in this and watch and see if I don't open up the floodgates of heaven and pour out so much blessing that there won't be enough room to store it and basically that's been true for us.
10:50
So I'd highly recommend doing it and yeah, we do just pay via ACH.
And that'll be all the ethnic use for this podcast and you're going to get them in the next one.
And that'll be all the ethnic use for this podcast and you're going to get them in the next one.

Hey guys, real quick.
So Leyland are definitely working on our social media presence.
If you guys haven't noticed and we're just breaking now into LinkedIn.
All right.
It's not as bad as I thought it's actually a pretty awesome so far and you guys have been really cool in there and people are sharing our stuff a lot.
So if we aren't connected on LinkedIn, it go ahead and let's connect and let's rock and roll.
0:17
What's going on everyone in this short video, I want to tell you story about how you can position your marketing way that gets a lot more people to respond to it, independent of whether you may like it or not.
Welcome to the game where we talk about how to get more customers, how to make more per customer and how to keep them longer and the many failures and lessons, we have learned along the way.
0:36
I hope you enjoy and subscribe when I was starting out.
Right.
I struggled to get people to buy what I knew would help them, right?
So when I started in Fitness, I wanted to say, hey there's a sustainable way to look the way you want to look, you just need to learn how to count your Macros and and and and do resistance training.
0:56
And if you do that, you look the way you want to look.
But for whatever reason.
In my marketing that talked about that because I knew it was true didn't get people to respond right and I didn't get any new customers.
Even though I knew I was saying truth right?
And later on in my career before I learn this lesson, I was doing marketing for a dentist and I was and I was running ads and we had landing pages that we had built and it was working and he called me up Furious and he was like, this looks horrible.
1:25
This is terrible for my brand.
I would never sign up for something like this.
And I was like, what?
It's a good thing that you're not your customers.
You already have nice teeth, right?
And so the story that that rant, that drove this home for me was a story that's become famous in our community called the ham and the garlic.
1:42
And so, the way The Story Goes is there was a little kid and he was incredibly excited to please his dad, right?
And it's Dad one day decides to give him a dog and says, listen son.
You got to take good care of this dog and if you don't take good care of the dog, then I mean you're not Possible.
2:00
All right, so you got to take good care of it, if you're, if we're going to buy this, okay?
So give him the dog.
And so one day, the dad goes to work, you know, a couple weeks later and the kid sees the dog is playing with them and you notice, he's got ticks all over him and he's like, oh my God, he's super distraught.
He said, what am I gonna do?
2:15
I'm going to do.
And so he runs over into the other room whose grandmother who's looking after him while his dad's at work and says grandma, like, what what do I do?
The dogs got ticks all over and the grandma says, Ah, me whole, you just have to give the Ugh, some garlic.
All right, so go feed him some garlic and then The Tick's you know will go away.
2:34
So the kid goes and tries to feed the dog garlic and the you know, the dogs moving its head because he did because it smells like garlic is one, eat it, right?
And so he goes back to the grandmother's grandmother, I'd try the garlic, it didn't work.
What do I do?
And she says, meal, did you just try and give him the Garlic's straight up?
2:51
He's like, yeah.
Just, you know, you have to wrap it in ham, wrap it in hand first, then feed it to the dog.
So, he's like, oh, Actually wraps it in half and goes to the dog, the dog eats it.
And then a couple, you know, an hour later the tick start crawling up the wall because it's the dog starts, you know, sweating garlic whatever right.
3:11
And the kid feels saved because the dog is taken care of and the dead still is proud of them Etc.
But the moral of the story is that you have to give people what they want in order to give them what they need.
And so many times people are not at the perspective from which they don't have their perspective, they don't have the context to understand what you're saying because you already Be in the know, most Nation real quick.
3:35
If you are a business owner that has a big old business and wants to get to a much bigger business, going to 50 $100.
Plus, we would love to talk to you and if you like that or like to hear more about it, go to acquisition.com, you can play anywhere on the page and talk to one of our team and see if we can help you get there.
3:54
And so you have to go back in time to before, you knew what you knew what you know now and meet people where they're at and then walk them across the bridge to where you need them to go.
And so when we started marketing Fitness we would mark it, you know, short short duration, challenges detox is things like that, because we knew that people who were in that state of mind what they want is a quick fix, right?
4:17
And so, what we would have to do is we bring people in, we'd give them what they want to get them to respond.
And then once we earn their trust, we should Hey, I know you had a little bit, you know, we had some success in this first, you know, few weeks but you're not here just for a few weeks as you want to gain it back.
Right?
Of course not.
4:32
All right.
You really want this to be a long term thing is if you lose it and gain it back, what's the point?
They're like, yeah, that's like, and at this point we said this is the Garlic.
Which you need to do, is you learn how to count your calories, gotta learn how to use macros, and you gotta learn how to train for real, all right?
And so, when we had that, we now had the context to have the the truthful conversation with them and deliver the garlic, right?
4:52
But it took the ham too.
Get them in the door and so right now you may have something that you're trying to Market in your business and you're trying to get your customers in the door and your marketing from a position of already knowing the answer and that's the issue and you may shake your fist at these other.
These other marketers your competitors.
5:08
They're like, you're like, man, they're they're marketing short duration, things that their marketing, these whatever is right.
But the probably marketing because it's working for them and so it encourage you to shift your perspective from saying this is the truth to.
This is there truth right now and I need to meet Were there.
5:24
I'd have to go back across the bridge, to, where I used to be talk to them in that language, relate to them, understand their problems, and their fears.
And then with my once, I've convinced them to trust me enough, then deliver the hand, the garlic to them.
5:41
So you have to give them what they want in order to give them what they need and this is an Essence, what a lot of great marketing Enos.
Especially if you have any type of business that has any sort of transformation that you're delivering anything that the other person has to take some steps towards you in.
Order to be successful.
And so, that's stories, always stuck with me because it applies to any type of coaching or mentor-mentee relationship or really anything that you're marketing to the public, where you need them to break a belief in order to consume your service or, or get the result that you need them to have, right, or that they really need for themselves and so many times you can't begin with the end.
6:14
You can begin with the end in mind, you do not begin with the end, you have to start where they're at, and then tape them along the journey, the same one you did.
So that then get to where they want to go, which is Are you know is going to be the best place for them.
So anyways I hope this was valuable for you if you like that.
6:29
Sure there's buttons and things you can click and learn more and all that stuff.
But anyways, keeping amazing have an awesome day and I'll catch you soon.








0:00
Real quick.
Because you guys already know that, I don't run any ads on this and I don't sell anything.
And so, the only ask that I can ever have you guys that you help me spread the word so we can have more entrepreneurs, make more money, feed their families, make better products, and have better experiences for their employees and customers.
And the only way we do that is if you can rate and review and share this podcast, so the single thing that I have to do is you can just leave review will take you 10 seconds or one type of the thumb, mean, the absolute world to me.
0:25
And more importantly, it may change the world of someone else and as soon as he switched on, Selling newspapers to selling masks in manufacturing.
He went from a few million dollars a year to few million dollars a week.
Welcome to the game where we talk about, how to get more customers, how to make more per customer and how to keep them longer and the many failures and lessons, we have learned along the way.
0:44
I hope you enjoy and subscribe.
What's going on everyone?
What I want to talk to you about today is a question that I get all the time which is how do I know I have a good market right?
Which is what are the things I should be looking for to know I have a market that I should go after.
1:00
And the first thing I want to address here is, you know, I had this conversation yesterday and someone's like hey, I'm between, you know, dentists and hearing aid specialist and pharmacists right for what Market, I want to go after and serve, right?
And I was like, okay, cool.
Well, what are the considerations right?
1:16
And they didn't know how to actually analyze each of those businesses.
And so the first rule of thumb that I'll give anyone is as long as the market is not dying and is either normal or growing, then which of the markets can you provide the most value?
You too.
All right, so most value and that's given your skill set.
1:34
So if you have an advantage inherently, or you have experience working with people in a specific market place, or especially if it's personal experience, then I would usually recommend going after that market first because, you know, their pains, you know what, it feels like you will empathize with them, and you ultimately create a better product that will provide more value to them, and you'll be able to win.
1:52
Now, that's a great scenario, but many people, I talk to have basically no experience in any market and I'm like, okay, well then these are the Four things that I look for.
All right, so they are as follows.
The first thing that I'm going to look for is is the market in pain?
2:09
All right.
So do they have a desperate need for my product or Services?
Write a nice to have is not something people are going to take their money out and buy especially in a bad economic condition, right?
If we're in a good economic time when you're watching this and that's awesome.
And if we're in a bad one, then you'll know, right?
2:25
So the first thing I'm looking for is, do they have a desperate need?
Are they starving?
NG for the thing that I'm looking for.
Right there are some things that are Timeless right health wealth and relationships are the Timeless needs of humanity.
Right?
You know, are they, are they sad and lonely, that's relationships, are they broke?
2:41
That's always paint and health are?
They are?
They feel bad about how they look and are they unhealthy, right?
And so there's the three big ones, right?
But is their key pain that I'm solving the second is, is the market growing, right?
2:59
So I'll give you an example of this.
I think I've told the story of my buddy who own the newspaper company, he could not figure out why his company was not growing and he called me up and I was like dude like you're much smarter than I am.
It's probably cause you're selling newspapers.
He's like no, no, it can't be that.
3:15
And I was like, no I think it's that.
And as soon as he switched from selling newspapers to selling masks in manufacturing, he went from a few million dollars a year to few million dollars a week.
All right, same entrepreneur simply applied.
To a growing Marketplace.
3:31
All right, the the next thing that I'm looking for, in terms of market place is Are they easy to find?
All right.
And this is important. because if your marketing, And you can't find your prospects.
3:51
If I marketing to plastic surgeons for example, in the only people seeing my ads or nurses, then I'm not going to be able to get my, my product, my service in front of them or even get my offer to them if they're impossible to find.
And so whenever I'm picking a market I'm going to try and find one that I can easily Target that has associations they have groups, they have channels, they all watch their all congregated in one place and so that way I can cast my fishing line there and then I can hook the clients that can take a step.
4:19
Towards me because if you can't find them they'll never find you right?
Hey guys.
Real quick.
If you're new to the podcast I have a book on Amazon called 100 million-dollar offers that over eight thousand five star reviews.
It has almost a perfect score.
You can get it for 99 cents on Kindle.
4:35
The reason I bring it up is that I put over a thousand hours in the writing that book and it's my biggest gift to our community.
So it's my very Shameless way of trying to get you to like me more and ultimately make more dollars to that later on in your business career I catch the partner with you.
So that's I gave go check it out Amazon and back to the show.
4:54
And so one, they have to be in pain too.
They have to be growing three.
They have to be easy to find.
All right.
Now, the fourth one is purchasing power.
All right?
Which is do they have the money's right now?
A quick example of this is I had a friend of mine who is looking at this and he was like, dude I've got the perfect Market.
5:11
I'm going after unemployed people and I want to coach them on how to do their rsums, right?
Tons of paint on not having a job.
He said, it's definitely growing because people are coming in out of the market.
So there's tons of people that are coming in outside my ads won't get fatigued.
I was like okay.
He's like they're super easy to find and I was like, that's great, but then he's like no one wants to buy my stuff because they all said they don't they don't have jobs and so you wasn't able to have the purchasing power from this target, right?
5:37
And so let me give you an example of two different ways that you could use this framework, right?
So let's say, if I were a relationship coach, I was somebody who serves couples are, I'm good at helping people find love, right?
Well, I'm going to look for a market that has all four of these things, which means, instead of I'm gonna help you know college kids, right?
5:57
For me my service business, find love.
All right, instead of having that's a heart college kids, find love what I would probably do is instead go after seniors right in maybe their second half of life to find their next partner, that would probably be where I'd focusing.
6:18
And what happens there is seniors have tons of pain because they're alone, it's growing because people die and get older every day.
Right.
They're easy to find and I know that senior citizens in general have far more money than college kids do, right?
And so, even though I have the same core value proposition, I'm choosing to serve a better Market that I will ultimately probably make more money with all right.
6:41
And so this is kind of the process that I look at is number one above all else, which Market can I provide the most value to, if I have personal experience, that's going to Trump everything.
Now, if I don't have personal experience and I just have a skill of being able to Market ourselves, Or whatever.
Then I'm going to look at my market in these, in this for, for Peace Pipe system, whatever you want to say checklist and the thing is is you can't just have three of them right in the in the newspaper example, they were in tons of pain, they were easy to find and they had purchasing power.
7:11
The problem is they weren't growing.
They were shrinking every year, right?
The the unemployment example, they were growing, they were in pain but they didn't have the purchasing power.
So that's the, that's the problem there.
The nurses and plastic surgeons example that would be one or if I can't find them, then I can't display the ads to them.
7:30
And then obviously, if people don't want your product at all, and it's just a nice to have then they will not buy it.
All right?
And so you want to make sure that you do not have one two, three of these.
You want to have all four in any Market.
You pick and ideally pick a market that you already know, you can provide value to and solve a problem that meets these four criteria and you'll have the recipe for Success.
7:49
So I hope that made sense.
That's how I look at markets.
That's what I look at when I'm trying to invest in companies.
I look at the founder, I see if they already have experience in this and then I see if the problem that were solving matches these things.
And then at that point, I said, you know what, I think this is a good opportunity.
Let's do it.
Hope you enjoyed that and see you the next vid.

Most Nation real quick.
If you are a business owner that has a big old business and wants to get to a much bigger business, going to 50 $100.
Plus, we would love to talk to you and if you like that or would like to hear more about it, go to acquisition.com, you can play anywhere on the page and talk to one of our team and see if we can help you get there.
0:18
It was just so important me that I wrote it down, and I have it right in front of my computer, because it applies to almost everything.
But especially to communication and sales messages, welcome to the game, where we talk about, how to get more customers, how to make more percussive, Customer and how to keep them longer and the many failures and lessons.
We have learned along the way.
0:33
I hope you enjoy and subscribe.
What's going on everyone?
I wanted to share the rule of one with you that I learned from Michael Masterson and if you haven't heard of Michael Masterson, he's out the the chief growth strategist at Agora publishing which, to my knowledge, the biggest information seller on the market, that, over a billion dollars a year in revenue, and he is the person who created their entire acquisition machine, which is teams, and teams of hundreds of copywriters.
1:00
Who generate demand through compelling words, and I think there's something really magical about that because he not only has been able to do it himself and hit home.
Run after home, run hitter for home, run offer, but he's been able to duplicate it and other people and create and get people who've never sold a thing to writing copy that generates 20 million, 40 million, 80 million plus, just from a single letter or message.
1:24
And in his book, great leads the first concept that he introduces is our Really the most important, and he calls the rule of one.
And I've been, I, it was just so important to me that I wrote it down, and I have it right in front of my computer, because it applies to almost everything but especially to communication and sales messages.
1:44
And so, whenever he said, the common thing that most copywriters do or most business owners, who are trying to make an offer to be compelling to a Marketplace, what they do is they just stack as many different great things inside as they possibly can.
And then say, well, if that one doesn't work, one of them will work.
2:00
So I'm just going to throw them all in, he said that's the recipe.
For, he calls toss salad, copy, which is just you just jumbled everything together and you hope, you know, it's throw everything on the wall and see what sticks.
But the reality is the most compelling messages and he reviewed the top. 100 offers of all times since they work their 91 of them all centered on a single concept.
2:22
And so if you think about what that means, it means that you're looking for the one big idea, the one compelling message that has To be easy to understand, easy to believe, and interesting or unique.
And so he said those are the three elements of a one big idea.
2:39
And so when you're thinking about the sales messaging and this has been really just I've been I've been putting this at the Forefront of my mind.
Is that when you are writing copy for a for an advertisement, are you writing copy for a landing page.
The sub bullets should only be bullets that reinforce the singular message or the singular argument, right?
2:58
They should be stories.
He's they should be arguments, they should be facts that are presented solely to reinforce the singular concept, right?
And so if I said, you know, hey, there's six ways six ways to to, you know, wake up early or something like that or six morning strategies, if each one of them was kind of different, that's like it's a tossed salad.
3:25
Because you guys already know that, I don't run any ads on this and I don't sell anything.
And so the only ask that I can ever have you guys that you help me, spread the words we cannot more entrepreneurs, make more money, feed their families, make better products and have better experiences for their employees and customers.
The only way we do that is if you can rate and review and share this podcast, so the single thing that I have to do is you can just leave review but they can 10 seconds or one type of the thumb.
3:49
It means the absolute world to me.
And more importantly, it may change the world for someone else.
Whereas, if I wanted to centered around one, big benefit, or one core topic.
Now the six topics that I can underneath of it are going to still be sub points of the major one rather than, you know, 15 crazy headline ideas, right?
4:09
And so for me that has been incredibly powerful and if you look at if you have advertised before and you look at the best converting advertisements that you've ever had, you will probably see that similar Trend where the ones that do best are the simplest.
The most Direct and the clearest to understand.
4:27
Now the issue is, when you only have to pick one, it forces you to be incredibly tactful on your selection because you're only going to pick one.
And so I think what that ends up doing, is it forces us as marketers to really think is these?
The is this the best idea is this, the most centralized focused concept that I can point as the tip of my Spear of my communication message, right?
4:52
And so, a lot of these things around like any kind of unique selling proposition, that's going to be the rule of one, right?
You don't have 19 selling propositions.
You want to have one core one.
Everyone can immediately understand is is counter-intuitive and is believable, right?
5:08
And so when you put all three of those things together then you have a message that's compelling and people will take one step towards you.
And so I have now like I said I wrote that at the top of my computer and as I've been writing copy and keeping this a top of mind because I can guarantee you that even since I started doing this just even reading Book.
5:25
I've gotten the the copy that have been putting out, has been so much better and more targeted and crisper.
Because there's one central idea, I'm trying to convince the reader or Prospect of and then and then the sales message that follows is actually very transparent and simple to write the hard part is figuring out what that one idea is going to be.
5:42
But if you're going to think about one thing then that would be the one to focus on.
So anyways, I hope that is value before you, I share this stuff as it comes to me in my in my journey of marketing and sales.
And so I hope you enjoy this like subscribe.
All that kind of stuff and I'll see you next video.
Bye.
All that kind of stuff and I'll see you next video.

So enjoy that and let's start the podcast.
And when we make Make these choices.
0:31
I think, just as important, if not more important is the story that we are telling ourselves about why we made the choices and what that tells us about who we are, welcome to the game where we talk about, how to get more customers, how to make more per customer and how to keep them longer and the many failures and lessons, we have learned along the way.
0:46
I hope you enjoy and subscribe.
What's going on?
Everyone want to tell you a story that may be applicable to you if you're an existing entrepreneur new entrepreneurial or somebody's about to make a big decision in life yesterday I had a Precision that transpired between me and an 18 year old, who's now a freshman in college.
1:05
And I think they're wish I could have recorded it, but there are a lot of kind of decision points in lessons.
And thought processes that we walk through together that I think will be valuable for many because it's the same.
It's honestly the same decision making process whether you're making a multi-million dollar decision or you're making a, you know, relationship decision or whatever it is.
1:26
And so this is 18 year old kid is my neighbor, think I've referenced.
To them before.
And he's entrepreneurial, he did a little car washing business.
He's done a little e-commerce business that he started on his own and, and it's, and it's worked out, you know, pretty decently well for him.
But because of the pressures that he's had on himself, and from outside, he decided he had to do college.
1:46
And so, he started his first semester in college and to make a long story short, he did something, he wasn't supposed to do, and now he's in trouble, and that may jeopardize his future in college.
And so he's obviously really wrecked about this.
And so, I I said, hey, let's go for a walk.
2:01
And so on this walk I said, you know what's your plan?
He's well I think I'm, you know, I think I'm going to try and fight this thing and you know, give College another shot and I wanted to walk him through this because I wanted him to make any decision for the right reasons.
2:22
Right?
And so I said you know, do you think like what's the outcome you want to have from giving another Shot at college, right?
Because he didn't really like high school that much he's like well you know I just want to I want to give it a try.
I was like, okay again what do you want to have happen?
2:39
Or what do you think is going to happen?
What is the positive outcome that you're potentially looking forward to the negative outcome?
That you think Could Happen?
He's like well Honestly, I don't know.
And I was like, okay, now, we're getting somewhere.
So do you think that taking, you know, genders literature studies and history of Aztec culture, whatever is going to be more interesting to you now than the stuff that you studied in high school which was again, General literature.
3:08
Is that going to be interesting to unix-like?
We'll probably not.
I was like, okay, then what's the real reason that you want to go to college?
It's like, well, you know, I feel like I, you know, I'm a kid and I should Variants, you know, having fun and all that kind of stuff.
And I was like, okay, having funds fine, do you feel like you can have fun without going to college?
3:30
Do you think that you could not spend two hundred thousand dollars and four years of your life and still have fun in that same period of time?
If you weren't at college but still with other people who are your age like well yeah I guess so I was like, okay cool.
Then I'm assuming, that's not the only reason you want to go to college.
3:47
What else is there you started thinking like honestly I don't really know.
And so to give you a little bit more context before.
What I told him next, I asked him, what do you think?
Because he's doing his entreprise, she's starting a new entrepreneur thick thing right now with real estate and he hasn't he hasn't cracked it yet, right?
4:07
And so I said do you think it's possible that you want to go to college?
Because it's in a, it's a A socially acceptable shield for you not being successful in entrepreneurship.
Do you think?
Do you think that that might be a reason because if you're in college, then you, you're not seen as a failure.
4:24
If you're not winning at the thing that you're doing, right?
It's your side hustle.
It's your side gig.
He was like, well, maybe yeah, and I think, first off, you know, kudos to him for being able to realize and admit that.
But I think that that was such a core issue for many of us is That we present these socially acceptable, solutions to ourselves, when deep down, the reason that we're doing them is not for the right reason.
4:51
And so, in this instance, he's using it as a foil to protect himself against having to confront the realities of Life of business of the marketplace of not being good enough right yet.
And so I said, alright, well, what do you want to have happen in your life?
5:09
Do you think you want to have a job?
And he was like, no I don't have a job.
Do you want to do?
It's like I want to have my own business and I was like what do you think business school looks like in the real world?
He was like, well probably doing business.
I was like okay so if you have four years and two hundred thousand dollars, if you invest that in college versus investing, two hundred thousand dollars in four years into learning into trying to start your own business, which of them after four years, do you think will get you closer to your goal?
5:39
Looks like we'll probably the business one.
I was like, okay.
So then right now what you have is a clear logical to logical outcome in terms of which decision path to make.
But then now we have to start looking at what's the emotional driver?
That's preventing you from doing it, right?
5:54
And so for him, going all-in means making the first real trade-off he's ever made in life, right?
Because if you're newer, or you have a job or your, it doesn't matter where you're at in your life, A lot of times, especially, when were younger, there's there's fewer Big Branch points, right?
6:15
But as we get older, we have to commit and trade off something else, right?
It's this for that.
And I think, excuse me, sorry.
I think that a lot of times we have to frame these things in terms of the things that were willing to sacrifice.
And so I told him the story of when I was starting my gym, the mindset that I approached it with was, I will not Not out work everyone.
6:40
But instead, I will out sacrifice anyone.
And so what I meant by that is I'm willing to put everything and anything that I have on the altar of My Success.
And that's what I started from a mindset standpoint.
So I wasn't like, I'm going to be smarter, I'm going to do something else.
6:56
I just knew that anytime my competitors or other people were going out or they were, you know, seeing friends or playing video games or watching football games changed to do all the time.
Before I started a business, Or or sleeping in or just all the many things, you know, even honestly my fitness even suffered during that period of time, not saying it's perfect but I'm saying I was willing to do.
7:18
I was reeling to sacrifice anything to get to where I wanted to go and I introduce that kind of concept to him of like you tell me, you want these things and yet when it comes time to sacrifice to pay the piper to make the trade-offs that are that are necessary to have that outcome, That's when your faltering and so do you, are you willing to sacrifice for the things that you want in the long run?
7:47
That's like because he's my neighbor and we live in a nice neighborhood.
It's like, I'm the age I am, and we live here.
I was like, I sacrifice my 20s straight up.
I sacrifice them and I'm not saying it's the right path, but I want to make sure that whatever decision you make, you make it for the right reasons.
8:03
If you want to go four years in college, do it by all means.
But understand the In you're doing it is because you believe that four years of from college and spending two hundred thousand dollars is the best use of your time.
And then having the story that you'll have to tell yourself about the type of person who makes these types of decisions and then you'll have to live with that.
8:27
Because the thing is, is the stories that we tell ourselves our create the identity that we that we have, right?
My favorite scenes in Matrix is in the third one.
I know people don't like the second and third, I like all three is when Morpheus is sin, Standing in front of all of humanity.
And he says, I can tell you that I stand Here, truthfully, unafraid, not because of the path that lies before us.
8:50
But because of the path that lies behind me and I think that such a such a deep message because where we are is because of the stories that we have, that have led us to be who we've become and when we make these choices, I think just as important, if not more important is the That we are telling ourselves about why we made the choices and what that tells us about Who We Are.
9:16
Real quick guys.
If you can think about how you found this podcast, somebody probably tweeted it told you about it.
Should it on Instagram or something like that?
The only way this grows is through word of mouth and so I don't run ads, I don't do sponsorships, I don't sell anything.
I only ask is that you continue to pay it forward to whoever showed you or however you found out about this Pockets that you do the exact same thing.
9:35
So if it was a review if it was a post, if you do that would mean the world to me and you throw some good karma out there for another entrepreneur.
And so I wanted to clarify to the decision for him in terms of.
Is this what you want?
Yes, or no, of these two paths, which one will get you closer to that thing?
9:53
Yes.
Like this one or this one.
Cool now.
Why are you not making it?
Which now goes from logic to emotion.
And then at that point saying, okay, I think we've discovered the root issue, which is that you're afraid is being seen as a failure, if you're not immediately successful.
And so what I wanted to give to him was if you fail, it does not make you Fill your, it means that you failed and part of Entrepreneurship is failure and being able to deal with failure and how you come back from failure.
10:22
And I said, right now, you're in this instance, for this is the first real big hit life is ever given you, right?
Everything's Relative.
But in his life at this moment, this is the biggest thing.
Worst thing to ever happen him, right?
This bad issue that you had it with his school.
And so, I said the story that you now get to tell is what you do from here, right?
10:40
Do you use this as the Catalyst to As that you actually don't aren't interested in the school stuff.
And you never have been.
And I've always wanted to do the entrepreneur thing but it's been a side hustle.
You've never fully committed to it as like.
Is that is that the story you want to tell or do you want to go and try and fight this thing and try and beat it?
10:59
And then spend you know, another three and a half years spending more money and then be another 3.1 student that graduates from Pepperdine, right?
Which one is the story that you want to tell?
And so I think I wanted to share this story with you because I don't know where you're at or what decisions you're facing.
11:19
But I think there was a lot of many things that we kind of covered in that conversation and Unearthed and so many of us know what we need to do.
But have some emotional trigger that stopping us from doing it?
And I think digging deep and saying like what am I afraid of happening?
What's my biggest fear?
11:36
Because if I know this is what I need to do then why am I not doing it?
And I think You can simply name the fear of what you are afraid of.
It allows you to face it and it removes the power.
It has over you because then you have Clarity and then it's simply.
Am I willing to let my fear of failure, stop me from having what I want to eventually have in my life or die.
11:58
Rather let that have me walk down a path that never actually helps me realize my potential.
And so when you think about a maybe versus a never then I'll take a maybe over a never any day of the week.
Eek and so like I said, I don't know where you're at.
I don't know what trade-offs are facing.
12:14
I don't know what sacrifices, you may have to make in order to get to where you want to go.
But I think literally listing those things out of what you are willing to give up.
There was a point in my life, where I wrote down all the things that I had.
Additionally, give up because I was at a point of just rubber meeting the road and I had to push harder, and this is probably three or four years in my, our internal journey.
12:33
And I remember making this video about that, where I actively Gave up football and Sundays which was like a thing that I enjoyed.
Do you know watching?
I know that I gave up all TV of all kinds.
Even like the wind down TV.
12:50
I gave up any kind of going out and I'm not saying that you have to do that.
I'm just saying that, that's what I did and I know that this kid's father was like, hey you need to have balance.
You need to, you need to be able to enjoy life.
You're still young and my father.
13:07
When I was younger really hit on that really hard.
Hard.
And I really pushed back and I still pretty much do because I don't believe that anything great was ever accomplished by someone who is balanced.
I think that it takes extremes.
It takes extreme effort.
13:22
It takes unreasonable.
Sacrifice in order to achieve things that are unreasonable.
And so, you know, and I was telling him yesterday the kid, not my dad.
If you were competing against someone else, who was a coder, you guys are both coding software, right?
13:39
I was like in, you're going to You're having fun, you're going out on weekends and you, you know, you code a couple hours a day versus the kid who drops out of college code. 16 hours a day doesn't go out.
Doesn't see his friends just codes for three and a half years like who do you think will be further on?
13:56
He was like well the other kid now as a great I like how much further along he was like probably a lot further as like right do you think it's reasonable or unreasonable that he would be further ahead than you is like reasonable and it's like so why would you not want to take the reasonable bet?
Bet that you will be so much further ahead by making that choice.
14:13
And so all that to say, I don't know any people who are really successful who don't approach things in an unbalanced way.
And I think that there's a differentiation between seasons and your entire life, what you do for a season of life doesn't have to be forever but sometimes it does have to be for that season and sometimes you are uneven.
14:33
And so sometimes it's difficult to look, you know, at what I do now versus what I did to get here, right?
You know, I sacrificed my fitness for periods of time, right?
I'm not saying it was good.
I'm just saying I did, there were times where I did not sleep, as much as I probably should have.
14:51
There were times where I did not see, I didn't do anything social at all for months.
I'm not saying it was right, I'm just saying, that's what ended up happening and when I hear stories of many people who kind of go through the shit, who go through their Rocky Balboa, period, the rocky cutscene almost, every hyper successful person that I've seen Goes through three to five year period, where they just get hit in the face day after day after day after day, you know, some of the, some of the great marketer.
15:18
Some of you guys may have heard of, you know, Russell Brunson pitched for five straight years on stages, unknown before he became Russell Brunson, you know, Billie Jean did cold calling for 23 years, Dan Kennedy did face-to-face door-to-door sales for three years, right?
I did four thousand one-on-one consultations over four year period selling Fitness doing 1520 appointments a day, right?
15:39
And the thing is is like Wasn't Alex from 0 Z.
Then I was just a dude who's selling and just getting better and better.
And the thing is that there's this unreasonable amount of effort that's unreasonable, amount of sacrifice that usually has to go in to get the unreasonable goal.
And yet, people are not willing to make the sacrifice to do it.
And so I think if we can simply look at what is the decision that's going to get me to where I want to go, which of these do?
15:58
I think will be better and then what is the sacrifices required in?
Am I willing to make that sacrifice then I think it makes much simpler decisions and we know why we're making the decisions.
We are so that the decisions are not made for For us by life.
So anyways, I hope that was valid before you, it was just half a mind because I had the conversation yesterday and I thought, man, I wish I had recorded this but I don't know where you're at in your life and I don't know what decisions are facing but hopefully this provides a life for yourself.
16:23
Lots of love, keeping amazing, and get you next week.








0:00
Real quick.
Because you guys already know that, I don't run any ads on this and I don't sell anything.
And so, the only ask that I can ever have you guys that you help me spread the word so we can have more entrepreneurs, make more money, feed their families, make better products, and have better experiences for their employees and customers.
And the only way we do that is if you can rate and review and share this podcast, so the single thing that I have to do is you can just leave review will take you 10 seconds or one type of the thumb, mean, the absolute world to me.
0:25
And more importantly, it may change the world of someone else, most people who've made Millions.
It started with something that got them 100 Grand and I will tell you personally, the first hundred thousand dollars that I put in my bank account, was by far the most meaningful that of all the money that I've made in my life.
Welcome to the game, where we talk about, how to get more customers, how to make more per customer and how to keep them longer and the many failures and lessons, we have learned along the way.
0:46
I hope you enjoy and subscribe.
What's going on?
Everyone I've got a special podcast episode for you today.
What I want to break down is a conversation.
I was having with a different friend about how a hundred thousand dollars is the Amount of money to make.
And I was actually talking to him, he's starting his Physical Therapy Clinic practice right now.
1:08
And he's, you know, he's eating shit for lack of a better term, you know what I mean?
Like, you just, you just trying to figure this out and the thing is, is that a hundred thousand dollars is the hardest money to make for a variety of reasons.
And that's not me.
I'm not the first person to say that Charlie Munger said, who's Warren Buffett's business partner, said the first hundred, Grands a bitch.
1:25
He even says that it's a quote, you can look it up.
But anyways and and There's a bunch of reasons why and so I wanted to kind of walk through it.
The first is the biggest one, which is that when you're when you set the goal, two hundred thousand dollars, you only think of hundred thousand dollar opportunities, right?
1:41
And what I mean by that is you're not like if I were to say, hey, you need to make ten million dollars.
You can't hundred grand your way times 100 to get there, right?
You have to think of a different way of operating of doing business in order to make ten million dollars, right?
Because at that point you know you can't sell your time like it's not going to work, right?
1:59
You have You something else and so inherently when someone puts the constraint of, I want to make a hundred thousand dollars on themselves.
Then they automatically only constrict confine themselves to Vehicles where they have to sell time for money, right?
Which are inherently constraining, which is why it's a bitch, right?
It's hard because you literally have to sell your time in order to do it.
2:17
That being said, most people who've made Millions started with something that got them, 100 Grand and I will tell you personally, the first hundred thousand dollars that are put in my bank account, was by far the most meaningful that of all the money that I've made in my life.
I remember when I looked at Layla and I had a hundred thousand dollars in my bank account after everything, I remember looking at her and saying it's going to be okay, we've got three and a half years of money.
2:41
Now that if we mess up for three and a half years we'll still it will still be.
All right and I remember feeling that that sense of relief and the reason that I think it was so impactful is that difference between zero or let's say the difference between a thousand dollars, you're making a hundred thousand dollars is 100x.
Increase for me to have that same hundred X increase, I'd have to go from a hundred thousand and ten million in my It can't have the same proportional increase in terms of security.
3:04
I'll tell you even after I 10 million dollars in my bank account, I was like, it still didn't feel as good as the first hundred grand, all right?
And so it doesn't matter where you're at, like I'll tell you, if it's hard right now, it's normal.
It's supposed to be hard, but it will get better because you're gonna start thinking differently, all right?
Now back to the original topic of why, a hundred thousand dollars the hardest money to make first is you think of time Vehicles, time for money Vehicles?
3:26
The second is that you have no leverage.
All right, so what I mean, There that is that inherently all businesses Arbitrage, right.
You're buying and selling things at less and you're making the difference, right?
If you're in a service business, I'm buying people's labor and I'm selling it at a higher price to the marketplace because I see the discrepancy between that and I can add value to a person by training them in certain ways, or putting them inside of a system.
3:46
And then the sum of the individuals are sorry, the sum of the whole is greater than the parts, right?
That's essentially what it is.
But when you don't have money, you have no leverage on anything and so you have to do everything yourself.
And so Again, it takes tons of time to get small amounts of output.
4:03
And so because of that, you're really inefficient, right?
Because you have to and you also have to wear all of the hats, you have to learn every aspect of the business, in order to really turn the first dollar and that takes time.
And it takes effort a lot more effort than you think it will write.
4:20
And then once you finally figure out how to make the first dollar, you have to keep repeating that action over and over and over and over again until you have you know a hundred thousand dollars in your bank account.
But once you have that You can start paying people to do things, you could start paying for, you know, advertising and you're not worried about paying your rent or and what happens is you now have start having the Big L word, right?
4:40
Which is leverage.
You can you can you can move the world a lot faster because you can have 10 people doing outbound for you.
You can pay a team to make advertising for you.
You can have a video setup or whatever.
That's going to get you a higher Roi or make yourself look better.
And you get more you know you get more engagement or whatever, right?
4:57
But the thing is that that first hundred grand Is so hard because the vehicles that exist for it require all your effort.
If you're doing sales right?
You're working all the time.
If you're doing a job, you're working all the time.
If you're, you know, if you want to drive Uber to make 100 Grand, you probably work 12 hours a day and it would require time.
5:14
But thing is that once you do that though you can you can then start piecemealing out pieces of your day and you do that in reverse order of the value.
That you can buy that same skill in the marketplace.
So let me let me dive into that for a second, so, Let's say that in your business, you might be doing 15 different things, but you might find out that the administrative work of scheduling and answering the phone might be the least valuable.
5:39
It may be, it may not be whatever, but let's just say it is.
And let's say that the market place you can buy that skill for a $10 an hour.
And so what that means is you can get let's say four hours of your day back for $10 an hour.
And so now you have four more hours and if you can make more money in those four hours and this is a key point, I see this one is a mistake to is Blowouts or certain work that they're doing, but they will not replace the time with higher value skill.
6:04
So that then they basically just pay people and then stopped working to make the same amount of money which can be cool.
But if you want to grow, then you're going to need to continue to work and just do higher and higher, and higher value higher leverage time in the time that you buy back, right.
But fundamentally, when you think about your business as what would it take for me to make a million dollars?
6:23
Would it take for me to make 10 million dollars?
You think of different vehicles in order to get there?
And if you don't know of the vehicles I would Highly, highly encourage you to look at the vehicles that already exists.
So like one of the things that's, here's an interesting nugget for you.
There's no reason for anyone, the United States to make less than $25 an hour.
6:41
Why?
Because in one day, you can go through a certification to become a phlebotomist, make $25 an hour.
So who wouldn't take a one-day education to Triple their income from minimum wage?
Who wouldn't do that.
The reason people don't do it is because they don't know people are ignorant.
6:58
Hey guys, love that you're listening to the podcast.
If you ever want to have the video version of this which usually has more effects more visuals, more graphs, you don't drawn out stuff, sometimes it can help hit the brain centers in different ways.
You can check out my YouTube channel.
It's absolutely free.
So check that out if that's what you are into and if not keep enjoying the show, Right.
7:20
And so if you're watching this and you didn't know that, that would that even existed, there are so many other opportunities that are like, that, that you can immediately get more leverage on the time, just as your starting.
So if you're, if you're working a job in, you're not making that will then go find go.
Find small opportunities.
Go find little mini certifications that you can get that qualify you for now that's only going to serve your if it's required.
7:39
If it's just like this is a certain, don't worry about it.
But like if you can find these little opportunities, you know, like I'll tell you for me, my plan B of like if my business was going to fail, Well I knew that what I was going to do was I was going to drive Uber and I was going to strip at night that was going to be my 100% my gig.
7:55
Because I knew that if I drove over 12 hours a day and I strip for four hours every night, I would be able to make about 200 Grand and I knew that, even if I start at 0 I could do that again and try and try and get another do over, right?
And the thing is that, as your skill set increases right, the base level of your building is I like to consider it like, this is your building of skills.
8:15
The base level, your basement continues to rise, right?
So the level that you could fall down to continues to go be higher and higher, right?
And so once I learned how to sell, I knew that I would never really make less than two hundred fifty thousand dollars a year because I knew I could always go to a car dealership and sell cars.
8:31
No matter what I could go sell cars, make two hundred, three hundred, four hundred thousand dollars a year.
I knew that because I had that skill and that means that from this point going forward with my life, I'll never make less than that, right?
But then I learned how to Market.
And then as soon as I learned how to Market, I knew that that was going to be my because now I could take my sales skills and pair it with marketing.
8:48
And then I could generate demand at will, right?
And then that means that my new level might be three million dollars a year that I'll never make less than because I have the skills that even if I have to start over I can end there.
And the thing is that if you think about your your journey as an entrepreneur in terms of as a skillset stacking, all you're doing is acquiring skills and putting your back pocket, put it in your toolkit right?
9:10
Then you inherently become more valuable and you stop seeing your failures as failures, but rather lessons on the way to where you're trying to go because you inherently become Valuable because your work works on you more than you work on it.
All right I'll say that again your work works on you more than you work on it and so even if you didn't make 100 Grand the first year, that's okay.
9:29
Because you developed the foundational skill sets that maybe got you above 50,000 a year, right?
But as long as you were continuing to acquire skills, that Baseline will go up and the speed with which you move up will be how much volume you do.
9:44
So volume of work for a specific skill with deliberate effort.
It will improve your skill set.
Now you can do it faster or slower depending on how quickly you learn the skill, but you still have to learn it and there's usually a certain amount of volume that has to happen, which means that there's some amount of time.
10:00
But then how do some people acquire skills faster than others?
Some people are more deliberate with their practice.
Some people get mentors and experts that feed into them.
Every valuable skill that I've acquired in my life.
I've paid someone to acquire so I could get it faster, all right.
And so, if you're like, why don't have money, then do the high-value, do the do the leverage, do the shitty work?
10:17
Now, do the first 100.
No, that's a bitch.
Do that work.
Now you have to trade some of your, your life for money, and that's okay.
Which is why I have a saying, which is you can you can't be busy and broke, right?
You can't be both if you're busy, you should be making money, right?
And if you're broke, you're not busy.
10:33
Which means you've got time.
So you can always trade back and forth time for money, right?
If you have more money then and but you're busy all the time, then you can trade some of that money back to buy some time back, right?
You can't be busy and broke.
All right.
So think about that, and if you feel like you are busy and broke, I guarantee you're wasting All your time.
10:49
So anyways, to bring this full circle, a hundred thousand dollars is by far.
One of the hardest amounts of money to make.
Because we think about it only in time vehicles and for many of us, it's the first thing you have to do.
So just bite the bullet, go do it.
And then after that, you can start leveling up your skill set, you can pay for skills, you can pay for for things to happen faster for.
11:10
You can pay for other people to do some of the lower value work that you're doing because they're earlier on in their Journey so you can buy their time that's less valuable than yours and you continue to work up and build the foundation of that building that eventually becomes a skyscraper of your skills and then you'll have the perspective to identify the 10 million 100 million, the billion dollar opportunities and go all in on them because at this point you'll have the skill set to make it happen.
11:33
So anyways hope that was valid before you hope you're having an amazing day and I'll see you next time.
Bye.

Real quick guys.
If you can think about how you found this podcast, somebody probably tweeted it told you about it.
Should it on Instagram or something like that?
The only way this grows is through word of mouth and so I don't run ads, I don't do sponsorships, I don't sell anything.
I only ask is that you continue to pay it forward to whoever showed you or however you found out about this Pockets that you do the exact same thing.
0:19
So if it was a review, if it was a post, if you do that would mean the world to me and you throw some good karma out there for another entrepreneur.
Don't try and fix your non-existent overwhelmed.
Amon tissue.
When you haven't even made a sale yet, welcome to the game where we talk about, how to get more customers, how to make more per customer and how to keep them longer and the many failures and lessons, we have learned along the way.
0:39
I hope you enjoy and subscribe.
What's going on?
Everyone, I want to share a one-on-one conversation.
I had with a buddy of mine from high school who just started as own business.
And so he was texting me and he was he was saying, hey, you know, I've got this I've got this offer and my value ladder and I want to get your feedback on it.
0:58
And before I looked at I said, you haven't made a sale.
Right.
And he was like, yeah, he said, I'm worried about being stuck with providing fulfillment because I'm just doing too much and I'm offering too much and I was like, right?
So you haven't made a sale yet and he was like, yeah.
I was like, okay, you need to get over that.
1:14
And I said, what's the price?
And he said, 4,800 for 10 weeks and I said, listen man, just give so much that you feel like the person would feel stupid saying, no.
All right, don't try and fix your non-existent overwhelmed fulfillment issue.
When you haven't even made a sale yet.
All right.
1:29
Close a deal, then another, and then another.
And then once you are overwhelmed, you then have the, then you can start dealing with it.
And the benefit is that, once you've made sales, you will have the money from the sales.
Do you have resources to deal with the problem?
And so this is something that I see all the time, right?
1:45
People will they'll try and solve the issues that don't even exist.
I have somebody like this example, right?
Is like, I don't want to be overwhelmed with all this fulfillment.
Like, dude, your don't?
You have even made a sale yet, right?
Sell the world, right, sell everything you possibly can, Get them to say yes.
2:01
And then what happens is you're going to start making money and then at that point, you can start peeling back the things that take the most time that are not as valuable.
But in the beginning, you just have to create flow.
So one of the rules that I always have is create flow monetize flow, then add friction.
2:17
All right?
In that order.
So once you have demand, it means you're making a good offer of some kind.
Then you are getting people to say yes which means you make an offer that so crazy that I'm going to be stupid to say no.
And if that means selling your Time selling one-on-one stuff.
Doing the flying out to their house or driving over every day.
2:34
Whatever it is even if it's unreasonable.
Stop thinking about scale before you've even had the ability to have a single sale, right?
It drives me nuts because I'm like, dude, you're trying to solve a problem, doesn't even exist.
It's like, it's like when I would have guys who come into the gym and they'd be like, hey, well, you know, I want to get bigger but I don't get a big as you and I was like, you're not going to sneeze and fucking get jacked, all right?
2:53
I was like, there's a million steps between where you're at and where I'm at and believe me it won't happen on accident, right?
It's other Why don't want to get too like they're trying to solve problems?
I don't even exist yet.
I was like, why don't you?
Why don't we start with making?
You look like you even work out when we start there.
Fair enough, right?
And the thing is, is like, why don't we start with you actually just getting a sale before we even talk about what your fulfillment optimizing for profit even looks like right?
3:16
And so anyway she sent me the big graph of like what he's looking at and I was like, it's fine dude, just sell the world and deliver, right?
None of it's going to even matter because they're not going to remember any of it.
They'll just remember how they feel.
And how well, you understood their problems, right?
3:33
And if the solution felt unique, easy, to understand and easy, to believe that it would work for them, right?
And so he was like, yeah makes sense.
It's crazy.
How much of this has been like just removing my own self limiting beliefs and I was like, yeah, money's made in your mind first, right?
Poor people have poor beliefs.
3:50
You can't, if you're walking towards the door, right?
Before you go and turn the knob, you envision yourself, turning the knob, everything happens in your mind before it happens in reality.
And if you can Envision yourself actually making money doing it then there's no way it's going to happen.
Poor people.
Expect poor outcomes right.
4:07
Rich people.
Expect Rich outcomes and they don't they don't accept outcomes beyond that they don't make decisions unless they feel like that outcome is possible, Right?
Hey guys real quick for those of you guys who are 100 million-dollar offers fans I love you.
I added in a lost chapter that has never been released.
4:24
I'm releasing it now transparently.
I'm doing that to build hype 400 million dollar leads but you will have the unreleased chapter it talks about your first Avatar and how to segment customers to make more money.
You can get it by going to acquisition.com forward slash leads.
Its fo free in exchange for your email so that I can email you when we launched under Miller, All Leads and so that you can not miss out on it because last time I sold out for like eight straight weeks really fast.
4:47
So that is my way of making sure that y'all get first dibs.
And so what happens is those poor beliefs keep people poor, all right?
And so anyways, I was like, listen man, stop obsessing over.
Whether what you're going to include or what the little offer stack is.
I said just give away the farm, all right, make some sales.
5:05
And then you have money and a business, then you can worry about optimizing.
But for now you're solving around a made-up problem.
That doesn't even exist.
You have no fulfillment issues because you have no clients.
All right, cell first over-deliver and then optimize for profit.
Alright and so this was just a process that I just see it as a If you have been so many times and if you were starting out, sell everything, sell the most insane offer you can possibly think of get someone to say yes first.
5:33
Alright.
And then get another person to see us.
And if you're like, man, I'm so overwhelmed.
That's okay.
You're supposed to be overwhelmed.
It's normal, especially if you're starting out.
All right, but you're going to start learning how even to sell, right?
And you're going to start learning.
Okay?
Well, this is something that I'm offering, that might have been really valuable in the sale, but is actually really easy to fulfill on and something.
5:52
An else that I promised I would fulfill on they actually didn't care that much about it.
But now it's taking all my time.
And over time, you can start peeling those people pieces back and make it into an offer.
That's both profitable and attractive to the prospect, but when you're starting out, you don't know.
And so the best thing in my opinion is to just stack as much valuable as possible to get them to say.
6:10
Yes.
All right, and so, what that means is, you don't have to be exceptional at sales in the beginning, because what you do is you give something, you give an offer so good, that someone feels stupid saying no.
And so, what I'll do is I'll wrap up With a wrap up with the story of how I learned this.
And so when I was 23, I went to a conference and I paid three thousand dollars for a weekend conference and it was three thousand dollars a money I didn't have and it was run by a guy named Travis Jones, who went by TJ, and he was a business coach.
6:39
And I remember when I was there, he had offhandedly mentioned, he made a million dollars a year and I was like, I was like, man, I just want to be this guy, right?
I think I'll do anything to be this guy and everyone there was a business owner except for me and I was way over my head.
Head.
They were talking about like CTR is a conversion rates and you know, cost for Leeds I was like I don't know what's going on and so anyways during one of the breaks, he came up to me, he saw that I was like way over my head and he was like, hey man do you want to know the Secret sales?
7:04
And I at this point I was learning what the term sales meant.
I didn't even know what it meant.
Really honestly.
And I was like yeah yeah like tell me the Secret sales and so I like pull my notebook out I was like I selected one of like miss anything.
He said make people an offer so good they would feel stupid saying.
7:20
No and for me, it was this A huge moment and I underline it.
I wrote it down, I circled it.
And it was at that point that I realized that I could still make money.
Even if I wasn't good at sales, I just had to make an offer that was good enough.
That they would feel stupid saying.
No.
And so I meant if someone said, no, I could keep adding things until eventually they said.
7:38
Yes.
And that was one of the biggest epiphanies that I had in my life was realizing that if I could just keep going and keep adding value.
Eventually they would say yes.
And so instead of cutting prices, I would keep my prize and just add more than anyone else.
Could even imagine so much so that it would be ridiculous and I was willing to scale the unscalable in the beginning because I just needed people to say yes and start the flow right?
8:01
Get the flow monetize, the flow then add friction and so it was one of the most important lessons in my life.
It's one that stuck with me through my entire career and in Remembering this as I'm now getting, you know, I'm having my friend from high school, I've got my neighbor who's starting their entrepreneurial Journey?
It's really I'm me some of these lessons earlier on and I just hope I hope you don't mind me to sharing them with you as we go.
8:22
So anyways.
Keeping awesome.
Lots of love.
I'll catch you guys soon.
Bye.
I'm me some of these lessons earlier on and I just hope I hope you don't mind me to sharing them with you as we go.
So anyways.
Keeping awesome.
Lots of love.
I'll catch you guys soon.
Bye.

Hey guys, love that.
You're listening to the podcast.
If you ever want to have the video version of this which usually has more effects, more visuals, more graphs, you know, drawn out stuff.
Sometimes it can help hit the brain centers in different ways.
You can check out my YouTube channel, it's absolutely free.
Go check that out if that's what you are into.
0:16
And if not keep enjoying the show right now, there's probably lessons that you learn from failures that are the wrong lessons and just as if not more dangerous, there are lessons from successes that you had that were not the right lessons to take.
To the game where we talk about how to get more customers, how to make more per customer and how to keep them longer and the many failures and lessons, we have learned along the way.
0:36
I hope you enjoy and subscribe.
What's going on?
Everyone I think one of the best things about entrepreneurship is the lessons that we learn from failure right now.
I try and share as many as I can on this, on this, you know, Vlog podcasts Etc because I think that if I can help you not have the failure to learn the lesson then you can get the lesson without the scar.
0:55
That being said, one of the hardest things is learning the right lesson.
From failure.
And so let me let me unpack that because I think it's one of the most profound things that we as entrepreneurs are just.
We as people have to learn is making sure that we're getting the right, take away.
So let me give you a couple different examples illustrate, the wrong takeaways and then kind of maybe walk through a framework, that might be useful.
1:16
So let's say, you know, you're in middle school and you're dancing with someone of the opposite sex or whatever, you're attracted to whatever, right?
You're dancing with someone, you like.
And I'll just use the guy girl examples, that's what I'm used to.
So, it's like, let's say I'm dancing.
With the girl and and she breaks my heart, whatever, right?
1:34
If I said, ah, girls aren't for me right girls don't work, right?
That would be ridiculous, right?
Of course it would be, it would just mean that that didn't work in that one instance, but if I took the wrong lesson from it, that I might swear off women altogether, right?
And what's interesting is that that's an incredibly ridiculous example, but people do it every single day, right?
1:55
It's like a business owner who hires an employee and the employee doesn't work out and says Ah Employees.
They all suck.
They're not for me, right?
It's learning the wrong lesson from the failure and so I think it's just as dangerous, maybe even more dangerous to learn the wrong lesson because now you have a story that you've told yourself that reinforces the incorrect lesson.
2:16
And then from that point, going forward, you operate under this false, guys, this false belief that you've told yourself that you believe is, right?
Because you've experienced right?
And just as you have experiences mean, we took the right lesson from it.
And so I'll tell you one that's that's been really, that's been really interesting for me to learn is over the last, you know, or however many years, right?
2:39
I have succeeded a lot based on inbound marketing.
All right, so that means paid advertising to generate demand in words, right?
And what's interesting about, that is a lot of My Success is come from it.
But what's interesting is that I think that I've had a, really long term perspective when it comes to my health, right health and - like when I work out and how I eat, I've always tried to pick really sustainable things that I can do forever, right?
3:04
And I've been in pretty good shape for, you know, almost almost 20 years.
And so that's that's been a successful action that I've been able to repeat over and over again to the same degree.
My marriage is actually, probably one of the better things that I've done.
I pick that rationally my partner Leila and we both said we want to go this way.
3:25
We have this Mission, we have these values and we'll figure out the Love Stuff.
As we go, and we actually got married before you really in love mostly just because we thought we were so aligned.
And we've learned the love and every year it's actually gotten better.
And that was a rational decision that was made by, you know, by both of us.
3:42
But and it was based on long-term thinking.
But what's interesting is that I've like been able to observe my own actions over the last decade you know, in business.
And I actually even think that I've still been more short-term skewed in my thinking because of the thing that I got really good at which is inbound and inbound.
4:01
You can immediately, Jen.
You can snap your fingers and make money tomorrow and you can make a tremendous amount of money in a very short period of time.
And I think, in some ways, I may have learned the wrong lesson from my early success, which is Success should come big and should come fast right for me, right?
4:18
Because that's my own, it's for my own belief.
And as I look at the things that I've done that, I've done really well for a long period of time, none of them follow that, that path.
And so I've been you know strategically or a deliberately kind of deconstructing my beliefs around what I think success should look like and what growth should look like and I'm finding myself more and more trying to move in the direction of sustainable growth, which I remember hearing when I was younger and me like God's horse crap.
4:47
But now, as you know, I feel like I've gotten more scars and more experience, I actually think that if you really looking on an endless Horizon, which is what I try to shift myself, two words, then you only do things Is that you think are worthwhile and your obsession my own obsession with hurry and the rush, you know, I would love to say disappears but at least it decreases, right?
5:08
Because if you're like, you get from the finite to the infinite, you go for the, can I do this until I die?
I know that what I do in Fitness I can do till I die.
I know that, you know, the way that Layla and I run our marriage, I can do till I die.
Like the way that we've done this, we can do.
So I don't know.
You might be like, I, you've only been married for five years.
5:24
Sure, maybe.
Yeah, maybe like, maybe.
Maybe.
I'll have to keep.
Saying this, and then it's like, you've only been married, 10 years?
I've been married 20 years, I don't know.
We'll see, right?
A most ancient quick break just to let you know, we've been starting to post on LinkedIn and want to connect with you.
5:40
Alright.
So send me a connection request and note letting me know that you listen to the show and I will accept it.
There's anyone you think that would be should be connected with tag them in one of my or laila's posts?
And I will give you all the love in the world.
All right, so let's get back to the show.
But it feels the same long-term way the way.
5:59
The other one said because we have there's way less volatility, it's just a slow and steady progress and so when I think about what I like, how I'm trying to build things, now it's different right in the beginning was just like short hard fast.
Like let's go, let's go, let's go.
And I feel like now as I've gotten more experience, more weathered, it's more like, okay.
6:19
This is our current growth rate.
Can we just sustain this, right?
Because if we, if we can just sustain this this for 10 years will be at 100 million plus will be at 200 million.
Plus if we just do this, and what that's forced me to do is increase the time between my thoughts, and my actions, which entrepreneurship so interesting because you have to kind of unlearn, some of the things that got you started in the beginning.
6:44
You can't do anything because you're so paralyzed.
So you do need to decrease some of the time because you start taking action, right?
But a certain point you start becoming so good at taking action that you end up breaking things, right?
And so you actually have to start increasing That time.
And what that does is it gives you more space to make decisions that are in that are rational, set of emotional.
7:01
And so, that's when you see a competitor run, an ad, or you see an employee leave with clients, or whatever happens, and you want to have some reaction and most times, no reaction is the best decision.
And this is just like, it's been this repeated Trend that I've had.
And so, my current, the current lesson that I'm trying to see is, is actually not from failure, but making sure that I learned the correct lesson for my success.
7:24
Us and thinking it might have actually been bad for me that I was that I was so successful so early on and it might have been that I took the wrong strategy from it and so what I the things that I'm trying to build now are far more enduring and more stable and do not require me or my skill at all.
7:47
And by doing that, I feel like I'm getting closer to the first time in my life where I actually have businesses that truly run without me.
Like actually not as in like, oh, I don't do the day-to-day, that's definitely one level and one component of it, but when it can get to the point where it truly grows without me, and I'm really just there to guide Direction and be a sounding board for the leadership team that's in place.
8:11
I feel like that's, that's where I should go.
And I feel like the things that I'm building now are in alignment with that.
And it's been, it's taken years to get here.
And so anyhow, my goal is, if you are, if you You're in it and you're not growing as fast as you want.
8:28
But you are growing then extrapolate that over 10 years, right?
Extrapolate over five years and say, can I just grow at 10%?
Every every, every quarter that's huge growth, right?
Can I just do this every quarter?
Can I just make this sustainable?
8:44
Can I make this consistent?
Because what I'm seeing is the richest people in the world.
Just look for reliability.
They look for low volatility which means less of this and so if I Decrease the volatility the business by making things more consistent and not going for the big, the big win.
9:00
That's like right there, right?
And I just stay patient.
It continues to pay dividends and so that's kind of that the chapter that I'm in right now and the lesson that I'm trying to learn or walk.
And so I figured I would share that with you and also just the thought process around looking at your successes and your failures and making sure that you learn the right lessons from them because I've definitely taken lessons from my successes that that were not Not that we're not correct.
9:26
And I've taken lessons from my failures that were not correct.
And each of them is equally dooming or damning, right?
And a fun final thought that I'll leave you with is what if everything that you did when you were successful was not because of you but because of outside forces and everything that you've done to fail was your fault.
9:47
I've taken this perspective and tried to apply it to my life, and I've had an amazing amount of inferences and thoughts that have gone around.
Have been completely new.
So it's like, what if, what if when you were successful at one time, maybe it wasn't because of you at all, maybe it was just maybe it was just chance, right?
10:02
Maybe it's just coincidence and I think a lot of times we apply those Frameworks to other people, but never to ourselves.
If someone does something bad, we say it's their fault.
If something good happens, if we don't like them, we're like, oh, that was because they got luckier only because of this outside circumstance, that wasn't because of them, we never apply that to ourselves.
And I think that if we do, if you reverse it because we always want to say, we take credit for our for our wins, and we say our losses are because of outside circumstances.
10:24
But if we flip that a lot of times, I think you get some really interesting lessons that can come from it and just just walking through the thought process.
What if this wasn't because of me, what other things happened that did a lineup for me that were not my doing and by doing that you'll start to, you'll start to see different Trends in different patterns that may be.
10:43
You cannot.
You can you can take advantage of opportunities when they aren't because of you but you can still take advantage, right?
And so anyways, I wanted to show this off process with you.
For me.
It's been incredibly valuable.
And I hope it is valuable for you to so enjoy and I'll see you next video.
10:59
Bye.
And I hope it is valuable for you to so enjoy and I'll see you next video.
Bye.








Company0:00
Hey guys, real quick.
So Leyland are definitely working on our social media presence.
If you guys haven't noticed and we're just breaking now into LinkedIn.
All right.
It's not as bad as I thought it's actually pretty awesome so far and you guys have been really cool in there and people are sharing our stuff a lot.
So if we aren't connected on LinkedIn, it go ahead and let's connect and let's rock and roll.
0:17
One of the key differences that I see with people who are successful and do grow and do scale is that they have a firm understanding of probability.
Welcome to the game where we talk about how to get more.
Customers how to make more per customer and how to keep them longer and the many failures and lessons, we have learned along the way.
0:34
I hope you enjoy and subscribe, what's going on?
Everyone, I want to share a quick lesson that I had yesterday, with my 18 year old neighbor who's going through is entrepreneurial journey and this is a lot of fun for me because he's at Ground Zero.
So I'm hearing, you know, the anxieties and the worries and the false beliefs kind of come up as they go and I get to, you know, confront them and kind of ask you questions and so kind of the lesson or the theme of yesterday was around.
1:00
Volume and luck, right?
And so one of the key differences that I see with people who are successful and do grow and do scale is that they have a firm understanding of probability, all right?
And what that means is Chance, what's the percentage likelihood that something happens, right?
1:19
If you want to be an investor, right, then you have to calculate the risk associated with an investment.
That's a probability outcome.
If you are a business owner, right?
You have to gamble on marketing and assess the probability that you will get a return on that investment, right.
1:37
And what's interesting is that volume negates luck, all right?
So if you can put that in your brain, volume negates luck.
And so luck is a word that people who don't understand probability use as a as a space filler.
1:52
But if I were to say, hey for every, you know, 100,000 emails, I send I get 1,000 back and from That I get back.
I know that I'm going to close 500 of those people on a deal.
That's not realistic math.
I would probably just closed a lot more than that, but the point is, but if I explain that math to you, you probably like, is that luck that I closed, 500 deals?
2:15
You probably be like, no, that's just probability.
That's just I know that if I reach this many people, the probability that there is one person who's interested in the, in the services that I have is high, right?
And the thing is that if you do enough, Volume, you can negate luck.
2:32
All right, you can also negate skill, which is a byproduct of the volume.
All right, so let me, let me explain me dive into that.
Let me unpack that for a second.
So, let's say you suck, right?
Because your brand-new and of course, you would suck.
2:48
Because why would you be good?
Because you've never done this before, whatever it is right.
And so this is like the conversation I'm having with my neighbor, you can you imagine me as like like coach you get 18 year old, get them?
Like, of course, you suck.
You're supposed to suck, you're not supposed to be good, right?
3:03
And the thing is, is like because of social media, because of Instagram, because all these things, everyone, especially, you know, the guys were younger right now and maybe it's the same Four Guys, four in the 30th whatever is that they just immediately assume they should be a millionaire.
The first year, right?
This is like, I should be a minute.
Why am I not a Millionaire, right?
And so, that's what, stops 99% of people from being successful, because they're unwilling to suck, right?
3:23
And it hurts their ego too much to be bad.
And so, then they say, oh, this isn't for me, right?
And so anyways back to the point of the volume verse, you know negating the luck in the skill component is that lets say the normal numbers let's say I was I was coaching him on on cold-calling right because that's what he's doing right now and I said, listen it's going to take you know it should take you about a thousand cold calls to get you know one deal right.
3:50
Unless he comes to me and he says well I've done five thousand right?
I'm like okay and it's a lot of a deal.
I'm like And you suck.
Of course, you don't have a deal.
You've never done this before.
Do another 5,000 because the thing is, eventually, you will it will be unreasonable for you to suck any more, right?
4:13
It would be unreasonable for you to not have found one person.
If you do this for a straight year, and I'm trying to paint this longer picture for him a year.
And I know when you're 18 a year, sounds like forever but like a year, if you did this for five years if you did nothing but cold, call for five years.
Do you think you would be Good at cold calling.
4:30
He was like, yeah, probably.
As a do you feel like you're much better now than you were one month ago when you started this thing is like, I'm like nine-day better, like I can get past, you know, I can open.
Now, I can have conversation, I was getting hung up on, it was like, right?
And so you have this binary measure of progress, which is, I either close the Sailor, I didn't close the sale.
4:48
When in reality, there's tons of bricks on the bridge, on the way to getting the first dollar over, right?
And the first deal, the first dollar independent of whatever you're doing, is the whole ways, the hardest one, and it's because you have to learn a lot of little skills.
Owls before you get the big payoff, right?
And most people learn one skill or don't learn a skill and then sync up this isn't for me.
5:11
Most Nation real quick.
If you are a business owner that has a big old business and wants to get to a much bigger business, going to 50 $100.
Plus, we would love to talk to you and if you like that or like to hear more about it, go to acquisition.com, you can play anywhere on the page and talk to one of our team and see if we can help you get there.
5:32
Right?
And so I told him that the only way that I would give him my blessing for him to quit is if the entire he could convince me that the entire industry of wholesaling real estate had disappeared.
If you can convince me of the entire industry of wholesaling real estate has disappeared.
5:47
You will have my blessing to quit and obviously that's not going to happen because people have been making money and wholesaling real estate for a long time, right?
There's always going to be in efficiencies in marketplaces between buyers and sellers right?
Unless some magical technology comes through which it might In 10 years, who knows?
6:03
But for right now, it exists.
And so I said, the only thing that separates you from what you want is skill.
And the only way to acquire that skill is volume, right?
And the thing is, is when you have enough skill, you get luckier, right?
You don't need to do 10,000 calls to get that one deal.
6:21
Because honestly, maybe in the beginning.
That is that is that is the biggest lay down person you ever have.
But then it gives you conviction that it can happen, right?
And so the more volume you do, Better, you get and therefore, the luckier you become, but the big picture is that people who invest people who do business at larger scale, just understand probability, right?
6:42
They understand that there is a percentage.
Now what's what's the worst thing that can happen is?
Let's say his this is this is a fun scenario to think about is, let's say his first day he gets on the phone and he somehow closes the deal, right?
And that one deal may have been that one deal out of 10,000 that if he had Rated at the other end of the call list.
7:04
It might have taken him a month to get there, but he just happens to do it first.
How much do you think that messes him up a ton?
Maybe maybe, or probably even more than working really hard to get there.
And so I don't know about you, but I feel like I've definitely had occasions where I've lucked out.
And then I start questioning myself.
7:19
What am I doing different?
What am I doing different?
They might not be doing anything different.
You might have just hit the hit the gold nugget way too early in the cycle and now you gotta sift through a lot more nose to get to your next one.
You might have to sift through twice as many noses normal because you got to you.
Account for the nose from the first one that you never actually hit right?
And so, anyways, as I'm walking him through this, right?
7:39
It just reminded me of how when people are starting out, they don't understand the concept of large numbers, right?
If you want to become lucky, if you want to have probability on your side, you simply increase n, increase.
The number increase, the volume and eventually you will strike gold.
7:56
And the thing is, is that most people just literally don't go long enough.
He honestly was doing the The little system that he's, that he's purchased the wrong way up until like a week ago.
And so I was like, cool, well, your first three weeks are wasted that you weren't doing it the right way.
Right?
You've now officially been doing this for seven days, right?
8:13
You feel like it's unreasonable like do you feel like you'd be reasonable for you to have a top 1% income in the United States?
After one month of learning a new skill?
He was like No.
And I was like, then stop believing.
You should.
I was like, if you do this for four years because he's not right now he's pushing off College to do this.
As if you do this for four straight years.
8:31
I was like do you think of it Be reasonable that.
You be able to close one deal a month by the end of that.
And I was like, yeah.
And I was like cool.
Then you're already twice as wealthy as the average college person.
You'd be leaving, right?
Except you have four more years of experience than they do.
And so I'm trying to like paint these paint, just give him a different frame of seeing success and seeing the work that's required to get there.
8:51
And also, you can what happens if what happens if it's six years when you're 24.
What happens if in six years 24 and you're not a millionaire, yet what happens that is like I mean I'd be you know, it was like what you'd be disappointed, you're not a millionaire at 24.
Come on man.
The thing is he might actually be right if he actually sticks with it for six straight years, but most people end up hopping and and always doing these half built Bridges, where they learn to 3/4 of the skills but there's 10 that they have to learn and they say, this isn't for me and they jump to another one.
9:21
They start building a new bridge, right?
When the reality is you just have to keep laying the bricks, keep laying the bricks.
Keep laying the bricks, all the way across the bridge, from where you are to where you want to be, and then the first dollar walks across and it takes a lot of time to put those bricks in place and to figure out which brick you're missing.
And the only way to do it is more and that is how you will get better at the skill, that gets the dollar across the bridge.
9:40
So anyways, more more sagas of my 18 year old workout afternoon lessons.
Hope you enjoy this.
If you do subscribe, like, comment.
All that kind of good stuff and I'll see you in the next video.
Bye.

Real quick.
Because you guys already know that, I don't run any ads on this and I don't sell anything.
And so, the only ask that I can ever have you guys that you help me spread the word so we can have more entrepreneurs, make more money, feed their families, make better products, and have better experiences for their employees and customers.
And the only way we do that is if you can rate and review and share this podcast, so the single thing that I have to do is you can just leave review will take you 10 seconds or one type of the thumb, mean, the absolute world to me.
0:25
And more importantly, it may change the world of someone else.
It's not universally.
True is basically, the is my underlying conclusion on this.
Welcome to the game, where we talk about, how to get more customers, how to make more per customer and how to keep them longer and the many failures and lessons, we have learned along the way.
0:40
I hope you enjoy and subscribe.
What's going on everyone?
I wanted to make a short podcast blog etc for you because I was talking to Ed tourney the other day.
He runs all of our Prestige lab stuff and we were talking about, you know, some of the lessons that we've learned and One of the things that came up that really made me take a step back, was one that we've all probably heard, which is what got you to hear.
1:06
Isn't going to get you there, right?
It's kind of the underlying assumption that you have to change what you're doing in order to get to where, you know, the next level.
And what I want to do is kind of take pause on that because I think that it's more it's it's not universally.
1:24
True is basically, the is my underlying Conclusion on this.
And so I'll tell you where, I don't think it applies and I'll think and then I'll kind of explain why I think it does apply.
And so when I look at, you know, over the last however, many years that we've been doing Jim watch the things that made Jim launch successful, are we Market?
1:45
Well, we sell well and we have an amazing product that yields results, which then goes back to the end.
We get more word-of-mouth.
We get higher referrals will get easier sales.
We get you know more dollars back for our marketing because each Each client, we get refers point for clients to us, right?
2:02
And so, all of those things and what we mark it is we Market our results and that's the primary messaging that we do, right?
And when I when I think about the things of when when I try to, again, be cute or try and do something that was different because I'm like, well, that's what got us to hear.
But what's going to get us to there?
2:18
That's what it ends up doing.
Is just not repeating successful actions.
And so, so many times myself included and some of the entrepreneurs I look at they're like, okay well, I've been doing Going ex to get to here, I'll give you an example.
I've been doing a pound to, you know, to get to my current business growth, but I need to do something different to get to where I want to go.
2:37
When in reality most times when it's a tactical thing within business, usually, just need to do more of what you're doing to get, where you want to grow, which is why, or where you want to go, which is why that saying, I think is really misleading.
I think we're at where it more readily applies is much much, much higher level.
2:55
All right.
And what I mean with that is, it's much more.
Along the lines of how you structure your business, what business opportunity you're going after, right?
And so, I think it's much more about being a better person.
Being a more evolved person, you know, unlearning some beliefs unlearning character traits.
3:15
But it when it comes to actions, though, so many of us, at least me specifically, like, I want to change what I'm doing, or I think I need to change, what, what I'm doing to get to the next thing and say, well this is working okay, but What if I do something else?
When I just can't tell you the amount of times my life, where what what it took for me to get to, where I am to, where I wanted to go, was more of what I was already doing.
3:38
That was it literally, just more of what I was already doing the times, we're doing something different applied is when I had to make big, big trajectory changes in my life, which is usually, when I was like a kind of an inflection point between businesses between seasons in life, right?
3:55
It was in those instances where I had to you.
No level up.
All right, when I went from running my gyms to turn around others people's Jim's, that was a big.
I'm not going to do what I, you know, what I have been doing to get to where I want to go.
So I'm going to do this next thing.
So I'm gonna go from B to C selling weight loss.
4:12
To be to be selling getting clients, right?
And then there was a point during that where I was like, I don't know if this and maybe that model could have continued to work.
But I switch from actually flying out and doing everything where we flew out to, you know, 33 Jim's over, almost two years and turned around each of these Hymns to then switching to a consult a consultative model because it's just like I could help so many more gems that way, right?
4:34
And so that's where, like, doing what you've always done, won't get you to where you want to go, but I feel like it's so much more about being who you've always been won't get you to where you want to go, right?
Rather than doing what you have done because the actions of what made me successful in each of those businesses is actually the same thing, we marketed.
4:54
Well, we sold well, we had a good product, right?
And that was Exactly what I did with the gyms that was exactly what I did when I was flying out to Jim's.
I grew almost 100 percent off of Word of Mouth from that because I would just I did what I said I was going to do, I said I was going to put hundred people in the gym in 21 days that was that was my that was my promise, right?
5:14
I would take the gym to full capacity within three weeks and we did that again and again and again and again and again.
And so people you would tell other people and then I would just get new business, right?
That's how it's supposed to work.
And then again, with Jim watch, same Market your clients results, which means you have to get good results.
5:32
Mark it on the Hard.
Sell well, right?
And so what we actually did, would it what I was doing to go from here to get to?
There was actually the exact same thing.
I was just doing it in a different vehicle, and that's where I had to be a different person than I had been.
5:48
I do believe different things than I used to believe, but I actually my actual, my actions themselves were the same.
And so, this is where I feel like I have made.
The number one biggest mistake if I had to give an overarching chapter or a banner, right of a big sign on my promise, you get a big side in my in my office that says repeat successful actions.
6:13
If something has worked, then it worked for a reason and simply do more of it.
Hey, guys, real quick.
If you're new to the podcast, I've a book on Amazon called 100 million-dollar offers that over eight thousand five star reviews.
It has almost a perfect score.
6:28
You can get it for 99 cents on Kindle.
The reason I bring it up is that I put over 1,000 hours in the writing that book and it's my biggest gift to our community.
So it's my very Shameless way of trying to get you to like me more and ultimately make more dollars to that later on in your business career I push the partner with you so that's my give go check it out Amazon and back to the show.
6:50
Right?
And I can't tell you, I was even talk to an entrepreneur the other day.
Who's there have a four million dollars a year?
They're like, I want to get, you know, to where you're at and all that stuff in there, like, something about, like, because I've got feel like, I've kind of capped this market.
So they said, I feel like I've kept this market now.
It's like you're in weight loss, you're doing four million dollars a year.
7:07
You feel like you've capped this Market, seriously?
You know what I mean?
Like, of course, you haven't cap this Market, but it was because really, they had capped their ability to acquire customers in a Single Channel and so rather than just think.
Well, I will just learn another Channel or I'll do more of this channel.
7:26
They thought I'm going to start another business and Market to my same customers, right?
And so they thought they had to do more things, different things, sorry, different things, instead of more of the same thing to be successful and I keep, I keep hitting at this point so many times because it's, it's literally, the thing that I've struggled most with in my whole life because I am entrepreneurial, I do have lots of ideas Layla, I joked about it like I have she's like I've realized that you have like a new idea every two days and so she used to get really stressed out and I was like hey I've got this idea now she just kind of like lets me get it off my chest you know she'll bounce it back with me for a while and then I'll just kind of go back to my my workshop and keep tinkering with these ideas until eventually.
8:07
I'll have one where she all of a sudden lights up and she's like I think that's a great idea and then we do it.
And so anyways, the point of this is Need to be reminded more than we need to be taught.
Don't be cute.
Repeat, successful actions and many times what gave you success in?
8:25
The beginning, is also what will give you success in the future.
You just need to do it at a different scale, right?
If you were the, the salesman sales is working for you.
You seem to be able to do it with 10 sales people not just one.
And so the actions and the tactics themselves often you need to do more of.
8:42
But the who you are and the beliefs that you carry with, you are the things that need to change at each level.
And so that was a delineation that I thought I told Ed, I was like, you know, I'm like a podcast on next.
I think it's really important and valuable and it's been a lesson that I have learned and I still continue to learn and go to church every day the Church of business and pray that I get continue to get focus in wisdom, so that they do not Stray From the Path of success.
9:08
And I have done this over and over again.
I'll give you another example real quick for me in 2020.
One of the mistakes that I think that I made is that I A little bit more on content, which is ironic because this is content.
But the things that made me successful, we're not content.
9:23
The things that made me successful were running really good advertising, right?
Running really good.
Advertising have a really well.
Trained sales team, and having a really amazing product that got us a viral loop on, on all the marketing we had.
And so, I was thinking about that and so I just recently, deleted Facebook and Instagram for my phone.
9:41
I'm pretty sure it's permitting.
So I feel great right now, not having them for the last, however, many days.
Just not being sucked into this whole political climate and whatnot because it's just like, this doesn't make me money.
Just kinda like, just do all of these thoughts that I have because I'm on these platforms.
Serve me.
9:57
No.
Have my sales over the last year, been positively affected by my Instagram stories or my posts know, right?
And so, I think that when it comes to content, I think that there's two.
I'm just going to go on the stage of, hopefully, find it valuable.
I think there's really two ways to do content.
10:15
Version one is you have to do enuf content, that if someone finds you through your advertising, that they think that you are legitimate, and they can consume a little bit and be like this guy or this growl is legit, right?
They are who they say, they are on.
The other end of the spectrum, is that you use content as your primary marketing method.
10:33
Ryan, you're not running paid advertising, if you're using that as your primary marketing method, you need to do a hell of a lot more content than two days a week.
All right, on one platform, if you're really using content as your Winning strategy, then you need to be on 10 different platforms.
10:49
You need to be publishing daily on all of them often multiple times a day and so that means, you know, a video Everyday on YouTube.
That means, you know, three to five articles a week, you know, of blogs.
That means podcasts that are different than your videos probably every day or, you know, two three days a week at minimum, right?
11:09
But realistically, if it's your main thing, then probably every day and that's where it's one of those like, well, it takes massive action.
It takes.
And execution to hit those types of goals.
And again it's not doing different, it's doing more.
So if you've got people from your content then it's how could I you more content?
Not different.
11:25
And so the biggest lesson that I have, I'm remembering and I'm re teaching myself, is that the things that got me here?
Have been world-class marketing world class sales world-class product, right?
That's it.
That's the that's the trifecta.
That's what we do, right?
11:42
And doing that.
Well, and focusing on my attention on that and not letting Anything suck me away from that.
And so, I think that so like this, for example, if anyone's watching this like, this is what I would consider minimum effective amount of content to show that.
We are, we are legitimate business but it is not my primary acquisition strategy.
12:01
And so I think I kind of wandered away from that and I saw some of some of the I was like, you know, maybe if I just keep doing this for 10 years on the other side, this will pay off.
And I just keep thinking to myself like 95 percent of our sales come from From advertising, right or word of mouth.
12:17
But like, they're not coming from content.
And so, I was just reminded of like, just repeat successful actions dummy, like just do what you've always done.
Don't be cute.
Right?
And so I say this because I literally walk this out every day and I feel like most of these podcasts I make mostly for myself to remind me to keep doing the right things and not get distracted with the shiny objects.
12:39
But anyways, I hope this, I hope you found this valuable.
Hope that little anecdote made sense to you and otherwise have an amazing day.
Keep being awesome and catch you on the flip side.

I'm making a hundred thousand dollars in my bank account within the next.
I want to see six weeks that was in my big guy after having nothing.
Welcome to the game, where we talk about, how to get more customers, how to make more per customer, and how to keep them.
Longer and the many failures and lessons, we have learned along the way.
I hope you enjoy and subscribe.
0:34
What's going on, everyone?
Welcome to podcast.
I have a sweet episode for you today.
I'm gonna tell you about how I started from zero after I lost everything that rebuilt it.
So, the kind of the motivation for this is, I was on panel last week and the question for the whole panel was, what would you do if you lost everything?
0:53
All your running art, cause actually reputation.
And the only thing you have left in your skills, what would you do to build a business that make 5,000 a month?
So this is really cool because you got to see a lot of different successful entrepreneurs talk about, they do it and many of them just talk about what they actually did, which I thought was pretty cool.
1:10
And so the reason I think this is so like this hits home for me obviously is that I've actually gone through it and most entrepreneurs will cycle right on the entrepreneurial journey is one of those Cycles, right?
You, you make a lot and then sometimes you lose and then something to make more typically you want to go.
1:29
Up and down upwards but sometimes you lose it, right?
And there's definitely some investors that only invest in entrepreneurs who've already done a cycle or done or cycle twice, because they understand that, that entrepreneur doesn't believe they're unbeatable, right?
And so as one quick foreshadowed to the store, pregnant to the nitty-gritty of exactly what I did.
1:50
I did at making a hundred thousand dollars in my bank account within the next.
I want to say, six weeks that was in my bank account after having nothing but which I'll tell you that sort of the But when my Laila nice fathers are both from Iran and both of them fled During the Revolution and both of them, you know, their families had houses and land things like that.
2:11
And the government just said that's not yours anymore.
That's ours.
And so they just took everything.
That was our families and my dad exhibit here with a thousand dollars, right?
And with that use evil rebuild his life.
And the reason that he used so hard on that is that he had skills he was medically trained, right?
2:30
As a physician but he had nothing except for his skills to the skills is only needed which is why they say.
Once you make the first one of the hardest, because if you lose it, you know how to make it again and it's the skills and experiences and beliefs that allow us to recreate the same successes much faster because we know what to do, right?
2:49
And so that's why he was always so big on education in general.
Formal education is that's how he got educated in.
I'd end up just being being Education Without huge.
That's why I make these videos.
Because I hope that somebody, you know, it's it gets value from it.
But the reasoning skills are so important that your plan, be like what happens if you lose everything changes as your skills that improves, right?
3:12
So before I had the skill set, when I decided to start my gym, I my plan being my head was I will drive like everything fails and I lost everything at that time.
I was going to drive over 12 hours a day and I would strip at night, which is You know, some people have moral issues with that.
3:32
I do not.
I think you do what you got to do.
And so for that, I knew that I would make probably a hundred thousand dollars a year.
If I just did that, right is then as I started have my gym, I started learn more skills and learn how to sell it.
So that an my played be instead of being who burying and sure being in leveled up right now my absolute zero is I'm going to a car dealership and make between, you know, two hundred and four hundred thousand dollars a year and not have to take my clothes off, right?
3:58
And so that gives me almost a top.
Income just from knowing how to sell, right?
That's probably what I would do if I had like, at that time, given that skill set, that's why we're done, right?
And so the thing is that I develop more skills than just sales.
And so I also learned how to generate leads work leads, make offers and then present those offers to, you know, prospects and then sell higher ticket, right?
4:23
So, that's kind of the next stack of skills and that, at the time of when I lost everything is What I did.
And so this is probably what I would say.
Like, my third level of Plan B at this point in my life, if I lost everything, I might do that, I have a couple if I lost everything, and I had no reputation.
4:43
And that's, that's probably what I would do is exactly what I did the last time.
All right?
So I'll tell you what I did.
So I at this point, I had sold five, my gyms.
I shut, one of them down.
I felt kinda good about myself.
And so I felt kind of like a good entrepreneur, how so And we take all this money and go on black in this new Venture, right?
5:03
And then of course you can already guess based on how I start the story, The Venture did not go the way it was supposed to and just like that, I lost everything in.
The only thing I had left was $1200 in my, in all my accounts put together.
And I was like, this is horrible.
And it felt like I just lost four years of all.
5:20
The work I put in literally was just gone.
The rally was ahead of us.
Everything has its own skills, right?
And so what I did with the skills is I said, okay.
Well, I already know how to generate leads and I don't work leads.
I don't sell and how to make offers.
And also, I think it I'm going to just do that for local businesses.
5:38
Right?
And so I reached out to local business was like, Hey, you want more clients?
So people like yeah, sure.
And so, what I said was, I'd like to get you clients and you might be wondering what offer, you know, how do you get them to say yes, if they didn't know who you were, I said, don't pay me anything, right.
Don't pay me anything.
5:53
I'll go get my own leads all work believes.
As long as you have like a, you know, a hat and a t-shirt that I'll sit Front desk and I'll sell them for you, right in my deal.
When I did this because I had twelve hundred dollars.
I was able to say don't pay anything.
6:10
Now if I truly had zero dollars and zero I would have to do something that I could sell my time for to get $100 from there.
Then I would get a phone and then from the phone I would then search on Google for local businesses and then that is what I like that's how I get that first from 100 right.
6:33
Welcome, guys.
You guys already know that I don't run any ads on this and I don't sell anything.
And so, the only ask that I can ever have you guys that you help me, spread the words we cannot more entrepreneurs, make more money, feed their families, make better products and have better experiences for their employees and customers.
The only way we do that is if you can rate and review and share this podcast, so the single thing that I have to do is you can just leave review but they can 10 seconds or one type of the thump.
6:57
It means the absolute world to me.
And more importantly, it may change the world for someone else. $100.
But I had twelve hundred dollars and I knew that what I was going to do is going to work because I've done it so many times, right?
And so I told the I did it, Jim obviously cuz I knew that space but you can do this in any business that you frequent it.
7:18
So if you have anyone in your family, who knows, you know, you know as a mechanic or somebody who's a chiropractor so it was a dentist or so is a whatever right?
A hairstylist doesn't matter.
As long as you have some idea of how that business works and when the value propositions are you could do this entire process.
7:33
If you had the skill set, right?
Which is why I talk about the skills a little time because it literally saved my life.
All right?
And so that's why I'm passionate about this up, so, boom, I reached out.
They said, yes my offer was, don't pay me anything.
And my idea was I'm going to sell it up for a package, I will keep all of the profit after my I recover my time and I had spent right, you will fulfill, so that's your cost, right.
7:59
But then after that, the customer life cycle is yours.
Now that Work specifically for Jim because there's lifetime value Beyond initial package, right?
If I was working with someone that had, like, if I were doing roof fixing right now selling big Roofing jobs, then I would probably use some sort of split.
8:15
Like I would take, you know, after I recovered my husband I would get maybe 30% of the gross profit or half the gross profit of the deal, right?
If the other thing is, if I had truly no money after getting the $100, I'd probably just ask them to cover the ad spend and Save That after they got paid back first, then we split it.
8:36
So if you have a little bit of money I'm talking like a thousand dollars.
You can make the deal way more in your favor.
But if you truly had nothing that I would ask the first guy to cover the ads moment and then I would do the marketing, we'd split the profit after the husband and then the second guy, I don't have money and say, don't pay anything.
8:52
All carbon gets better.
Because if you can take on more risk, you can take them on the board, all right?
And so, you might be wondering, like, how could I, how can I go ahead and do this?
If I only had 12 across.
So I'm going to make a huge campaign.
So, I'll walk you through it ended up happening, right?
So I started spending $100 a day right on ads.
9:12
Now, that hundred dollars a day at the time we get me about 20 leads and 20 leads, I would typically closed for people at $500.
So, I would make husband a $100 and I end up making 2000, right?
9:28
That is exactly what happened.
And then from that hundred from this two thousand dollars, you can subtract 100 dollars for a day two, and I would have nineteen hundred dollars left, right?
And then due to the same thing would happen and that was pretty much the game now in the the first one that I did this was because this is literally what I did.
9:49
I think I did thirty four thousand dollars.
In 14 days, at my first kind of gym that I did this at the second gym, I did it at, I didn't do that.
Well, I think I was only like something was really rude about it and ended up doing like, 11,000 in 10 days or 14 1948 since two weeks for the second one.
10:11
It just, it was a hard-working of for a variety of reasons, but then the third one, I ended up doing a hundred, twenty one thousand dollars in sales and I did that in 20 days.
Right?
And that was awesome.
And then after that, I did another 120,000 at the next one and so forth.
10:31
And so as soon as that sort of working, I hired sales guys, and I said, let's do six gems every single month.
But this is how I went from zero.
And at the end of this period of time, I had a hundred thousand dollars in my bank account in about six weeks, now, is my profit.
10:47
That was literally what I had in my bank account after doing this, after losing everything.
And so, The reason I'm so big on learning the skills is that it gives you a peace of mind that money can't because money can get taken by governments can get overthrown.
11:03
And I say this not as an alarmist but because like both Layla, nice fathers have gone through this, right?
It seems like something like that.
Wouldn't happen here and I can understand that.
But for me, it's happened in direct connection to me.
And so skill acquisition is the only thing that can protect us because they cannot take our skills.
11:22
Right.
They can't believe.
No one can take that from.
You can make, you can make a bad decision.
Sure.
You can make a hundred bad decisions, but you still have the skills.
And so, just as a quick recap, I reached out to local businesses, I made an irresistible offer.
11:38
I generated the leads, I work, the leads, I sold, the people, and I was able to collect the money up front, and if I didn't have any money out, ask them to cover it.
The first time I paid him back and then I would split the profit with them.
And so, It's funny because a lot of people would be able to do this because they're just not willing to do the amount of work that's required here.
11:58
Like when I did this, I was working about 80 hours a week actually going to be working more than that.
I work 12 hours a day, probably six and half days a week when I was doing this, it is I just lost everything.
And so I needed this to work and so, I don't know, maybe you're in a place where, like, I need this to work and so may be thinking about from that perspective might be useful.
12:18
But anyways, this is how I made my f.
How after I lost everything.
Paying a hundred thousand dollars in my bank account within two months and it was by having the skill set of acquisition.
So I hope that was done before.
I hope that was neat, interesting.
And we've seen this video, I'd love that.

Real quick guys.
If you can think about how you found this podcast, somebody probably tweeted it told you about it.
Should it on Instagram or something like that?
The only way this grows is through word of mouth and so I don't run ads, I don't do sponsorships, I don't sell anything.
I only ask is that you continue to pay it forward to whoever showed you or however you found out about this Pockets that you do the exact same thing.
0:19
So if it was a review if it was a post if you do that would mean the world to me and you throw some good karma out there for another entrepreneur.
What's up everyone?
This is the gym Secrets podcast and my name is Alex.
I'll be your host.
And today, we are bringing you the show from 35,000 feet in the air, going over the Gulf of Mexico and we are actually at the golf I do.
0:40
I think it's the Atlantic Ocean.
Anyways, we are in the private jet to your really, really blessed and fortunate to be able to get out of the Escape Hurricane Rita before.
It literally was heading straight for our house and getting meaner and nastier every hour.
So I wanted to give back and do some fa Q's on.
0:57
A lot of the questions that we've gotten Specifically, and how we got to where we're going.
Question 1, I have a small facility in my first challenge.
I signed up 20 people, it's already a strain on the gyms infrastructure.
How are people signing up such large volumes of people and giving excellent Service delivery, okay.
1:17
So that's, that's like a, it depends on the level of service that you're providing.
So if you're like a one-on-one Trader that yeah, 20 would probably Max you out which is why I'm always a big fan of group because there's better margins and you can have much higher capacity, so it depends on your square footage.
1:33
It depends on your square footage.
And like your equipment but you can usually upgrade to a semi private facility for 2,500 bucks and literally like for extra income without really doing anything else, like you can just trade multiple people and have much higher margins.
1:49
So how do people have great service?
They follow the systems that we have in gem lunch and then in terms of retention, they sign up for Jim Legacy and then we give them all their attention Seekers that we do to make sure that people stay forever.
Alex, what made you not only want to scale up gym business but know how to do it?
2:08
Who are the mentors growing up?
Where did you get your sales experience and knowledge from okay.
That's like there's another question after that, I think so.
Okay so I'll answer where do I get my sales experience and knowledge from?
I'm really stubborn when it comes to selling stuff I really really like doing it and I'm like no it's a week it's been a weakness of mine that I've worked on the.
2:29
I just I just really have a reluctance giving up sales But I've got better at it as I've gotten older and more experienced but I did four thousand 101 closes and so I actually never did any sales training.
I didn't even know what I was doing, but you do 4000 at something and you tend to get pretty good at it.
2:47
So that's the sales experience.
Who are the mentors?
Gosh, biggest mentors.
I have Russell Brunson his materials.
Dan Kennedy, who was Brussels, Princeton's, Mentor day Kennedy's.
Awesome, consume all of this content, read all.
Of his books.
3:03
He's amazing, he's fantastic.
People change your business and your life, so definitely do that if you execute it.
Alex Tarpon is unbelievable.
He's brilliant.
When it comes to operations and scaling like the scaling part is really Tarpon, like, sharpens, been like the best ever for that.
3:22
Those are probably the answer to that question.
What was the first question about scaling?
What made you not only want?
Okay?
What baby know how to scale?
I didn't know.
I, I'm telling you like Niels Bohr said that an expert is someone who's made all the mistakes in a very narrow field and that's what it feels like for me.
3:40
I like, the reason we know X works is because we tried y z, w, and B, and like it didn't work.
So, but chaerephon has helped us a ton with scaling, this business.
And I, if I had known all the stuff that I know, now it would have been way less painful but it's killing.
3:56
The Jim's was really just Like how can I provide external?
It was really just figuring out what position at a time and all this stuff is covered in steps of freedom and Jim Legacy.
Like literally we have like the entire escape plan but the easiest way to think about a mentally is what is the highest return on my time that I can get and what activities do I am I doing that of the lowest return on my time and how can I get someone else to do them?
4:21
So I can free up more time to do a higher return to just continually do that process over and over again.
What is the difference between Jim launch and it Jim Legacy.
Awesome question.
Jim launch is a is a kind of just a complete product but it's a standalone product and what it does is it's just cold traffic acquisition.
4:40
So it's a play that acquires customers for Jim's and shows them how to do so profitably.
Well, usually very profitably for the gym so they not only get a lot of customers but they actually make money while they do it, which is cool.
But it's one play.
Jim Legacy is the rest of what's underneath the iceberg, so, With, if you've listened to my podcast about the pie equation, there are three ways to grow a business, you can acquire more customers, you can get them to pay more, so a send them to higher levels of service which is increasing transaction size or you can get them to buy more times which is a function of retention for a chip.
5:14
And so Jim launch is one slice of one of those three slices of pie so it's literally just one play with in the bucket of coal traffic acquisition.
We in Tim Legacy have For coal traffic, acquisition plays that are as if not more profitable than the original Jim Watch program.
5:33
I used too much as a way of attracting gym owners to me.
But Jim Legacy is the rest of the model at the freedom, that they seek at the systems of the time.
As the automation, if the customer service training is the retention training, is the referral training and supplement selling system.
It's all of the things that they actually need.
It's all of the internal promotions that we run you around, literally, again, done for you.
5:52
Just like Jim watches which is all the emails on the tax class.
All the Facebook post, the poster supposed inside of the gym and the clipboard thing that you're going to put next your poster.
And by the way, put them in the front door and the bathrooms.
That's where people see them.
The one-page summary that you use to sell your trainers on selling that promotion to internally what the price point should be.
6:10
And the two sentences they need to memorize so they can pitch it before.
And after each session, that's how we do plays and Jim Legacy is the rest of the place that you run warm traffic and retention.
And as well as three other coal traffic acquisition place so that you really never need to worry.
6:26
About acquiring customers ever again.
Hey guys real quick.
For those of you guys who are 100 million-dollar offers fans I love you.
I added in a lost chapter that has never been released.
I'm releasing it now transparently.
I'm doing that to build hype 400 leads but you will have the unreleased chapter it talks about your first Avatar and how to segment customers to make more money.
6:48
You can get it by going to acquisition.com forward slash leads its hope free in exchange for email so that I can email you when we launch on.
I mean they're all leads and so that you cannot miss out on it because last time I sold out for like eight straight weeks really fast so that is my way of making sure that y'all get first dibs.
7:07
How do you manage working together and being in a relationship?
I know this isn't 100% related to selling but so-and-so and I both run, Jim's together, 24/7 and are Polar Opposites.
I'm the crazy jump off.
A cliff figured out later person is the maker and planner.
7:24
We are so, so different date nights.
End up being conversations about marketing or work for clients for all LOL.
Seriously, curious to hear any advice for avoiding burnout and having balance and boundaries when you work together.
With your significant other 24/7.
That's an awesome question.
7:40
It's something that we've actually spent a lot of time working on all Leland.
I worked really, really well together and so we're really good business partners.
Layla is the like do everything operations organized detail.
Like make sure there's a checklist in bullet points into dues at agendas and all that stuff and I'm like, let's make awesome stuff and sell it guy.
8:04
So, I totally understand where you come from.
For us.
These are the things that like really really really dramatically changed our our lives and our marriage.
First thing is morning routine.
So our our morning routine we wake up, we drink a cup of coffee together we walk we usually walk a mile to somewhere.
8:25
So Layla drinks two cups of coffee in the morning, say she'll take a control, go down, trick you up with coffee and then come back and then I'll get up when she comes back.
She can pick up a golf to go walk to get the second cup of coffee.
And so then we walked in like a Starbucks or something like that that's usually close by and we'll like just chit chat on the way they're just like kind of what we want to do for the day.
8:43
Kind of set our intentions border, our coffee, usually sit at the cafe for until we finish our coffee and then we'll walk back whatever.
We can walk Barefoot.
We do, it's just nice.
Yeah.
And we and then after we get back we'll have a green shake and will read our Bibles together and then we pray for each other.
9:04
So like our morning routines, like Like an hour and a half of it.
Some people like I don't have time for that.
It's BS.
It's like if you get your head right you get so much more done from an Effectiveness standpoint.
When we skip that I'm scattered and I don't get nearly, I don't get nearly the stuff done in a waste more stressed.
9:21
I have way more pressure and noise my life and it's really hard for me to manage.
The next thing we do is that we work out together we have that plan in the middle of the day that's like non-negotiable like we always go and I mean I always go three days a week later.
Has every day but like - three days a week, that's what I commit to.
9:40
But it's like from two to four, that's when we go to the gym and so we go to the gym together and we work out together, so that's cool.
And then, after that at night, a lot of times we'll go for a second walk which we really really enjoy.
And again, we read at night or will like watch an episode of like Game of Thrones or something but we're really, really consistent with it.
10:03
And then we have one date night a week and then we have one like Relationship night a week.
So for us, Tuesday nights is like, where we work on our relationship.
We watch like, you know, relationship, sermon seminars, whatever.
Just to like always have it at the Forefront of our mind, because if you work on your relationship like your business will make more money like I promised you.
10:25
And so the whole point is like as long as we can.
Like just keep flowing with you big with that.
We also have really clear separation of roles.
Like I do, just like I make the sales processes and then I make the actual products that we sell and I mark it, and make the advertisement to get people to walk in the door.
10:47
Like I make, I'm The Rainmaker for our business and then Layla you can describe her role.
So yeah.
Alex is The Rainmaker I'm basically okay.
You made the rain.
Now who's going to, you know, collect the rain or get everyone umbrellas.
11:04
So if he decides hey we're all jumping off this Cliff.
I have to decide how we're going to create a ladder to get down.
And so that's the creation of processes.
Directing people trying to keep issues from getting to him and kind of acting as a barrier.
11:20
And honestly, like if you're in a relationship working together which a lot of our gym owners are, it takes work like we had times when we were dating and not married where it was wrong.
I'm like we didn't know.
How to decipher who did what and all these things.
And it wasn't until we rewrote it down and really decided that we had to separate everything.
11:39
We don't do the same things that it became really easy for us as well as like being okay with not having control over every area of the business, like, Alex is, okay God, yeah, I just want to say this one was really hard for me because like, Jim lunch was my business, like, it was my business first and then I started dating life.
12:01
Layla.
And so like to, like I did the sales, I'd you know, I mean like that was my thing and then now she made it just the sales team.
I don't manage the sales team not because I can't sell, but it because it's not the like that's how we divided rolls up.
She's CEO of, and I'm CEO.
12:18
And so we just keep those roles, really clear.
Also, if you are dating someone to have been dating for like three years, just marry them, you will make way more money and it's like all of your, you'll get so much attention back because you won't be like there's this like All Security in like no, like, okay, we're Partners were in this, like let's go.
12:39
And so essentially, just like you said, yeah, go all in.
It's really like, for both of us.
I think we know that were each other's partner and we're each other's everything in that.
We both have the same goals and we share the same vision of how we want to change this industry.
12:57
So if you and your partner, both have the same goals, you have to decide what you're going to do to get there.
Like saying that I was an operational person is alive when Alex died.
I meant I was really good at sales and that's why we started working together.
You know, a month after we started dating is because I had a skill that he wanted to try and replicate in someone else.
13:17
And so, he replicated his sales ability and me and then I and then him and I did in other people.
And so me deciding and taking over operations was not really out of wanting.
But out of necessity when you're with a partner trying to grow a business it doesn't really matter what you want to do.
13:34
Like yeah, of course, I think marketing is cool.
Unlike content is cool and like, you know, doing all this stuff.
But, you know, I think it's cool to is like having a business that actually freaking works.
And so, like, having him do that, and me do the operations, like you, like, whatever?
You're good at.
So, if one of you is not good at something or both of you are good at one thing and not something else.
13:52
One of you has to suck it up and become good at the other thing.
And when you become good at it, then you'll start to like it because I love operations now.
But I tell you, like, couple months ago, I did not like it.
And let's wrap this one up.
Hope that was useful for you guys.
We have any more questions.
14:09
No, that was last question.
Okay.
Awesome, guys.
Hope this was valuable and if you're a gym owner and you would like to fill your gyms, we kind of do that for a living.
So just go to, I don't hate money.com, apply on that page and we'll hop on the call.
No pressure not going to try and sell you anything.
14:26
Or at least.
I'm not going to try to pressure you into giving us money.
We don't take money on the first, we'll call it.
Anyways, have an awesome day, guys.
It's you on the flip side bar,









0:00
What's going on, everybody?
I'm bringing some more books, but I wanted to say that, if you haven't checked out Hunter million-dollar offers, I would definitely suggest that you start there.
I've gotten some solid feedback and it couldn't be happier with its.
Number one ranking on Amazon for direct marketing and over 5,000, five star reviews.
So, thank you guys so much for that.
0:15
It's 164 pages.
I really can help you out.
It takes about four hours to get through, check it out.
On Amazon, the Kindle book is 99 Cents.
The audiobook is Lowe's, they'll let me put it on for it, so I think it's 12 bucks.
So enjoy that and let's start the podcast.
What's On on everyone.
0:31
Happy Tuesday, I hope you're having a phenomenal day but every day, it is that you're listening to this.
I had a lot of requests from Instagram and DMS and thank you for those for the 2020 lessons and failures.
0:49
So this will be a sequel to my 2019, lessons and failures.
Which if you haven't listened to that one, I think my year-long recaps are I think some of my better ones, but It's obviously up to you.
So this one will probably be a little longer than what you're used to.
And that's because trying to summarize what I learned in a year is hard in one episode.
1:10
Welcome to the game where we talk about, how to get more customers, how to make more per customer and how to keep them longer and the many failures and lessons, we have learned along the way.
I hope you enjoy and subscribe.
For those of you don't know, I I keep an ongoing email thread to myself, consistently consolidating 2020, lessons and failures.
1:31
So I have this big thread that I just continue to email myself whenever I feel like I learn a lesson and so I will do my very best to tell you each of the lessons that I learned and how I learned it.
And 2020 was a was a packed year of lessons for me.
1:50
And so where to start from the 500 you know million dollar Mastermind.
I learned a lot from there.
I really learned about scale and seeing the people that were doing more than me.
All we're going after bigger markets so there's really two options for me to do that within the context of Jim launch one is go after.
2:16
Find alternative and additional channels to grow the business because, you know, it's not like we've sold a hundred percent of gyms.
And so that means that I have to find new ways to reach them.
So if my traditional advertising methods, obviously, you know, you can exhaust a platform, especially if there's a niche, it's usually much bigger than you think it is.
2:37
But you may, you may not have reached every single person on that platform, but you may have reached every person that you could reach on that platform profitably.
So that's kind of the a differentiation and so for me seeing all these people who are doing more than me and I was you know providing value to them in a lot of ways and I it's always like it's been a consistent effort of mine to try and understand if there's anyone who makes more money than me what it is that they have or what it is that I have that they do not have because sometimes the question is not this is an interesting one for you that I've learned also is it's not always good to say, what does this person have that I don't Sometimes it's what do they lack that I have and I think oftentimes it's more frequently the case which is why it's always backwards which is why I think the learning process is interesting.
3:25
And so, you know Champions beat normal people at their Endeavor not because they have something the other person doesn't but because they lack the ability to stop working they black the off switch.
And so I think sometimes not only thinking what do they have but what do I have that's limiting me rather than what do they have that's giving them an advantage over me.
3:45
So first off just even switching my thought process to thinking that way has been a lesson of 2024 me from an entrepreneurial perspective before I go any further.
I'll just say this so that you know, I'm supposed to keep things interesting during these podcast.
So we hit our hundred million dollar amount in 2020, which is kind of weird.
4:04
So just to clarify this for anyone the reasons I didn't put it on this award yet is because I'm not very handy with things and I'll probably mess it up.
So I have someone else do it.
But just for transparency, that means I've done a hundred million dollars in total sales.
The last three and a half years and so we did.
4:22
We did 30, we did twenty eight million, we did seven million.
In in 2016, we did 28 million in 2017 and 2020 18.
We did 37 million in 2019 and 2020.
4:41
I think we finished at 31.
We're still getting the final books for this year.
Yeah so that was you know that's the that's the deal.
That's how we hit 100 million.
So it's not like I did 100 million in 2020 just for full transparency because I think some people thought that it's not what it was but I made a podcast about how I I've been stuck at 30-ish million for three years.
5:02
And I finally figured out what I need to do to fix it.
And among those is hiring really good talent.
That is one another.
And it sounds like so like Alex, but I feel like it's so many times the lessons that I learned or not like nothing's novel like nothing's novel.
5:24
It's just at what point does we call him singe moments.
But at what point does something that you've heard your whole life become real for you, you know, for some of us it's like be kind to others is something you hear your whole life.
It may be some moment or some event triggers that for you and your like, maybe I should be kind to people and then you start changing the way you live.
5:43
And so for me, You know, I've always heard a niche down, I think it's important to Niche, especially when you're starting but you will eventually be constrained by that Niche.
But that being said, if you're like, I get this one all the time from our clients, which is like, man, I got my Niche, is too small and like home.
6:00
He's doing like five hundred grand a year.
I'm like, Your Niche is a six billion dollar industry and you think that you doing half a million dollars a year somehow tap that Niche.
You just have such a poor business model that your lifetime value of a customer is so low that you can only profitably reach a half.
6:21
I mean like a quarter of a quarter over quarter of a percent of your market.
So it's really important to delineate between a, my capping, my Niche, or are the economics behind my business model, stifling my ability to scale and grow.
Ali, I think those are two very different things, and everyone just likes to say likes to point out weirdly because it's easier to say, oh, my Niche is small rather than thing.
6:44
Saying, no, my my business model sucks and I have no way of profitably reaching these people, which either means you need to fix your business model, or you need to find alternative, or additional acquisition channels.
And so, for us, I think we have a, we have a, I don't know, of a lot of businesses that have higher LTV from from, you know, microderm owners than us and it's candidly because we provide more value than Everyone else does in the marketplace, that is why you get rewarded.
7:07
And so, I mean, I always am trying to expend all TV provide more value, find ways that we can, you know, solve problems.
And I will always continue to do that.
But given the numbers that we have the let one of the lessons of 2020 is expanding additional acquisition channels and so we were able to build an outbound acquisition channel in 2020, so that was really cool and the additional part of what made that cool for me, was that I actually had someone else on the entire process and in.
7:37
So, when I talk about hiring high level Talent, it's really for me, transitioning from the what to The Who and you've probably heard that before.
But on some level it became real for me.
And the obsessive nature of the entrepreneur of wanting to learn how to do, everything is absolutely required in the beginning.
7:54
But as you scale up, it is more about finding the who but the thing is that in the beginning, you think too soon, you need to find the who, when in reality you still need to learn the things that make the business work.
And so I think that's why context and timing is so hard with these things, because we have to find like, when I'm trying to give you, no advice.
8:11
It's, you know, you have to take it within like your current Paradigm and I understand that that's difficult.
And that's why sometimes it's hard listening to billionaires, because it's like, their Paradigm of of what's happening.
What is, what are the successful actions for them right now in their, in their current chapter is different than somebody who's at zero or at a hundred thousand dollars a year.
8:29
And so I'm going to try and cater this as broadly as I can with as much, you know, contextual points as possible.
Possible.
So number one, Adding additional channels number two, focusing on who not what?
And specifically high-value who and my picker, my ability to judge the quality of talent has increased.
8:52
I think I've gotten better at it.
I was not nearly as good at it years ago and I don't know how you learn that without experience so that is that is something try and find people with pre-loaded Solutions.
So as a caveat to that that's one of my lessons.
9:07
This is like I've now found people who Ooh, come pre-loaded with solutions.
They come batteries included, you know I'm like hey here's my problem.
I can point them out it and they're like oh this is all the things we need to do because I've already done this three times.
Like got it.
Yes please go do that.
And you know as a corollary to that my role within the company, I would say in 2020 transitioned from being CEO, to being investor / owner /, stakeholder shareholder whatever way you want to say it.
9:36
But really, I would say, for the first time In 2020, I really transitioned to being above the business not in like a weird arrogant way just like, not truly being out of it.
And so I think there's definitely levels to being out of it, you know, first your you own your own job, right?
9:53
You're self-employed and that's just you doing things for other people, for money.
You just someone else is paying you and you're doing stuff.
You know, above that you start becoming a manager and managing other people, right?
And then above that, you become a leader.
And then above that, in my opinion, become an executive, right?
Which is like, leading Organizational, change in and departmental change around objectives that are going to protect the business or grow the business, right?
10:17
And I think the level above that is where I feel like this year, I was able to get to, I could be wrong, we'll find out in 2021 lessons and failures, but I right now I'm not I don't actually do anything in the business besides meet with.
10:39
Two liters a week and really advise on the ways that we can strategically improve the business and provide more value.
And so, that's really the majority of my time is like, looking at the overall market place and thinking, like, how can we provide more value in a strategic way to everyone, right?
10:57
And what are some of the many ways?
What is the one thing that we're going to focus on?
And so, I think 2020 was also a really humbling year for me because we got to refocus on.
The few things that provide the most value.
And so for us, it's we need to get Jim's leads because that's what everyone wants.
11:16
We need to make Jim's more money because that's what everyone wants and That's about it, you know, pretty much any other, you know, Endeavors that are not focused on those things are kind of a waste as much as you know, people may need to have better retention tactics better.
11:35
You know, better profit margins and we talked a lot about that.
Whenever we do talk about that we lose people lose interest because entrepreneurial most entrepreneurs that I serve only thing about Revenue, right?
The only thing about growth rather than what am I taking home?
You know, how much risk of my exposed to that kind of stuff and I think that just comes with time, I'm but I will practice what?
11:54
I preach and not sell what I want to sell.
I will sell what they want to buy and so that is how you know we've cut a ton of excess out in 2020 in the business.
And so really focusing on a handful of key, priorities has been really useful and interestingly I think the business has actually improved since I've moved further away from it because I tend to break things a lot because I want to fix it till it's broken if you know what I mean.
12:19
And so giving our leadership space to just Transact, you know, run the business has been really valuable and I think it's actually been.
I think it's been better for the business overall.
So those are some of my, my initial less.
12:34
I've got a whole bunch.
So I'm just going to keep going through this.
So one of the next one's was, I was talking to Brooke Castillo.
He has an amazing business.
Good friend of mine.
If you've heard of her life, coach School podcast, check her out.
She's amazing posture, has a huge following.
And she She didn't say this directly but like the the term that came in.
12:54
My mind was scale, skill, 0 and simple scales, and r0 scales.
I'll have to come up with something catchy for that, but basically, The reason that I had to be get into the you know, quote in investor or owner type role I believe is because if I am involved in any really day-to-day activity, I will become the bottleneck.
13:20
Right.
And it's not a bottleneck of communication, which is what happens when you are the manager as a bottleneck but as as somebody who even provides value, in any way, if it requires you to be there to provide the value than, as soon as the Grows outside of you providing that value.
13:37
If it cannot grow without you providing whatever that value is then it will stop there.
And so I think that's 2020 was really my transition of moving above that.
And so I think that was kind of the wind for the year and so that was kind of one of the lessons that I learned is you have to skill zero.
13:54
Like I have to get myself to doing nothing and still have the company make money and grow and be profitable Etc.
In order for us to be able to grow go beyond where we're at and I think that's much easier said than done especially because a lot of companies start because the entrepreneur is skilled in a certain way or has a variety of skills which is usually what happens.
14:16
We have a stack of skills.
Which is why, you know why we start growing.
And then somehow you have to in the beginning, extra cab Lee, you know, are intrinsically linked yourself to every aspect of the business is what makes it grow.
And then piece-by-piece peel off each of these skills and traits and and things that you don't even know you do in the business.
14:35
Us to keep it moving, and that's taken time.
And it's, and it's taken, trial, and error, and it's been difficult.
But ultimately rewarding because now right now it's like one day a week is focused on all my leadership meetings.
And that's it and then beyond that it's just your teacher can cite on monthly and quarterly.
14:55
So that's given me a lot more time to really focus on the industry and how we can and help overall rather than being kind of like in the in the tactics.
Next one.
I have this belief and it just continues to be reinforced that See if you can just keep growing and not hire people, we have had, I mean, all you got to do is look at our atrocious class to reviews which stock to know that like we have, we hire fast.
15:28
We have had a tendency to hire fast and Fire fast, so we have followed that mantra.
But I and the thing is, is part of the difficulty of having a business that grows quickly is or has any level of volatility month to month is that you have these waxing and waning demands for labor, right?
15:48
And so it's like you need five people.
And then the next month, you don't need the five people anymore.
And, you know, I'm not saying we hired five people and then let them go.
It's more that like that consistent variability can be annoying from a from a payroll and labor standpoint and Unfortunately happened, many, many times is, will bring people on.
16:12
We will solve the problem and then they won't and it really should be like, you know, for defined periods of time.
You know, like Project based and whatnot.
The problem will be solved and after we let the people go, the business grows more and that's kind of weird and backwards for me as an entrepreneur.
16:31
And so I'm going to just try and make sense of it out loud with you. but, I kind of have this belief that only one out of five employees in a company is providing value.
Like, I actually like, kind of believe that kind of the 80/20 people are fractal.
16:50
I just can't.
Like, I just the amount of times that we've literally gotten rid of like a department because it just like we created a department.
For example, to solve a problem.
Let's say it was churn and provide value in all these ways to solve turn and then after scaling that After six months realizing that churn is completely unaffected.
17:09
And we just took 20 more employees on.
And then having just be like, well guys, you didn't solve the problem and as much as you're doing stuff it does it is not doing anything, right?
And so then we have to, you know, let people go because it is a business and and then and and then just realizing that the business literally doesn't change at all like Revenue doesn't change turn doesn't change, profit doesn't change or profit goes up and that's it.
17:34
And it's just like, it's mind-blowing to me.
It's like, There are so many people, especially as your organization grows that you're like, this person was totally unnecessary, and that's crazy.
Cuz from the employee perspective, it's like, how can you do that?
And I understand that perspective, but on the flip side is the owner.
17:49
You're like, man, this this person was ninety thousand dollars a year.
Like people are afraid of signing up for a mastermind and yet will hire an employee for fifty thousand dollars a year without even thinking about it.
And it's just like which of these things is providing more value, you know what I mean?
And so that's that's something that's been like mind-blowing to me is, is seeing a company grow after shrinking.
18:10
It's like, it's crazy.
And it's happened so many times and it happened twice in 2020.
For us where I would get rid of a key team or key, you know, series of individuals who are doing a role that we were tracking metrics on and we kind of implement it into to provide a solution and then it disappeared, right?
18:27
And because the solution like it did not solve the problem and therefore was not providing the value that it was supposed to.
And so people were essentially cutting grass with scissors.
Which doesn't they're doing stuff?
But it doesn't mean it's being valuable, right?
And so I am now really trying to add the constraints to, I want to see if we can Grow with no people like how can we look at Berkshire Hathaway, right?
18:49
How can we look at?
Warren Buffett who is 19 employees and runs a Gigantor, you know company.
How can we find?
Fewer smarter people that are pre-loaded with Solutions, like I said earlier, but it's like, I'm just trying to hit it this in multiple ways because it's, it's really ingrained in me this year how important having a player as compared like one, a player literally, does more work than 5 b players?
19:14
It's crazy.
Like most people actually do nothing like it's crazy.
Like most people don't do anything and and and that's why they can't progress.
I mean like as a tangential Side Story.
You know, I There's a guy that I've seen in a mastermind, this is not fun or right?
19:30
And he's, you know, he's like hey, you know, and this is three years ago when I met him.
He was like yeah, I'm going to start on Facebook ad soon.
I was like awesome.
Fantastic.
Like, that's a great idea.
And because his biggest issue was that he couldn't get lead gen right sorted and I saw him in an event three years later and I was like, hey man, how's it going here?
19:51
I was a business, whatever.
And he's like, yeah, just you know, we're going to start, we're going to, we're definitely going to start Facebook ad soon, and I was just like, Bro, it's been three years.
Like, what are you doing?
You're like, what do you like?
What are you doing?
You know what I mean?
20:06
Like you it just it, you know what I mean?
There's different.
It's different for me if someone's like trying to figure out what the obstacle is versus knowing what the obstacles are not doing anything about it.
That's that's the one that kind of drives me nuts and so it.
So I was like, dude, if you literally spent one day and just Googled how to run a Facebook ad, you would be able to run a Facebook ad by the end of the day.
20:24
Like this is not a quarter long solution like Do it.
You know what I mean?
And so I say that to say, a lot of people think they are productive.
When in fact, they are busy and actually do nothing and I don't know if it's their fault or whatever, but that is just an observation that I've had and seeing the company become more profitable.
20:43
And grow even while we contracted resources.
Is sadly reassuring.
A reaffirming.
And so it's just like, you probably know if you're in a company of any size that like there's like a handful of people that, you know, that everybody knows.
20:59
Because there's the people who move, right?
Like they're people in our company that I don't know who they are and I don't know their names and I'm like, who they're like, oh we let go of Kelsey and I'm like Who's Kelsey?
And then now I've kind of been like, well, if I don't know their name that's why they got let go because if you're doing something, I will hear about you, they're like, oh yeah this new girl in blah, blah, blah is killing it, right?
21:21
I'll hear about it, but if I'd never hear a name, it's because you're not doing anything.
So anyhow, that's that.
Another one of the lessons I told you this was a longer one and probably more encapsulated.
Ah, okay, next one.
Oh my God data management is has been the biggest Mistake or has been the has been the thing that I messed up the most in the last three years, which is having a really good Erp or CRM that I run everything through it as properly setup.
21:51
And I this is plagued my business for three and a half years and I think it's actually been one of the things that has kept us at 30-ish, you know, million a year.
And we just got HubSpot.
It's expensive.
22:06
I think we pay thirty six thousand a year for it.
But it's worth every penny.
It's just, it's just worth every penny.
It's so funny because we were like, man, that's so expensive for us here.
I'm, I'm like, do you think that the entire system in all the data of everything that you have is worth more than a front line employee?
22:22
Just one, you think it can provide value to everyone in the company disproportionately 21 Frontline employee?
Well, yeah.
Like well like think, you know, thinking relative terms, but now we finally are able to track from click to close, which has been gosh, the hardest thing in the world, and if I could start all over, Over again.
22:40
So if you are, you know, listening to this like invest early in really good Data Systems like it will make your life so much easier.
And like, I genuinely conservatively can say that we've left 30 probably 30 million dollars on the table, over the last three and a half years because of such poor data management.
22:58
And because of our T, it systems have been literally the bane of my existence.
And so now, when I start new things, or I talk to new companies, the first thing I'm looking at is we're using track data.
What's your CRM?
You know, are you one of a Google sheet?
You know, Tsar is that how you're running everything great, let's put the whole system in place.
23:18
So that's just a huge one that I feel like I now I got the I got the success from that and I've learned from three years of failures.
And so, that was a really big one for us.
Next one is three businesses, you know, I shouldn't have three businesses.
23:34
That's continue to be a lesson of mine because we have Prestige Labs, Jim launch and Alan.
And it's been very hard for me, not from a Time perspective, but from an attention perspective to split my attention like that.
And so, I think part of it is this was like a paired lesson in Failure.
23:50
Is that I think the decision was incorrect.
But I think that the lesson that I learned from it was it forced me to get out of CEO and into investor owner role?
And I think that was, that was the gift of the curse.
24:06
The curse is that like, I now know that I shouldn't do that in the future.
So now I'm trying to figure out really, how to run these as portfolio companies if that makes sense.
So that's, that's been the hard part and the thing is, you can't like, undo, something like that.
You know what I mean?
I've got, I've got, you know, 100 employees.
24:22
Like, I can't, you know what I mean?
So that's those are, those are mistakes that are, you know, Jeff basis as when I'm making a decision, there's there's reversible decisions and irreversible decisions.
Starting a company is in some ways, an irreversible decision.
And so it's not completely reversible, but it does.
24:39
As you know, it it's long and difficult, you know what I mean?
If you want to try and undo that which is either through a sale or, you know, whatever, or just winding it down, we're trying to like somehow sustain it and systemize has.
So it stays at a certain level and doesn't require attention is also hard.
24:57
And so, anyways, that's kind of, actually a lot of what I would say I struggled with, in 2020 that I've, you know, actively been putting Solutions together for 20, 21.
So I'll let you know how that goes.
This is a big one.
Note your game beyond the game.
Is this is a really big one that I've learned in 2020, which is, you know we've you know my wife and I have made a lot of money over the last three and a half years.
25:20
We took 35 36 million dollars out of the business just indirect distributions so that doesn't include like the actual value of the companies and you have to know what to do with the money.
And I actively, I'll tell you the thought process, I had behind this, which was My second year.
25:39
So in 2018 we took home 17 for in profit so it's two years ago and while at that point I said, well, if I were to get 20% return on my money, I would make 3.4 million dollars on the 17, right?
25:59
So, me working on my business makes me 17, so I should just keep working my business and ignore the money, but at a certain point, the kind of the Lost compounding becomes big enough, that that it can surpass your regular income and so you know, if you look at what 20% over, you know, if if for example I had actively Managed IT and had 30 million dollars and done. 20% growth would be 30 goes to 6:36 goes to 42 and at that point you're making eight million dollars a year and that's two years three years later, right?
26:36
And so at some point you have to the opportunity cost of not managing the money becomes bigger and so and it actually starts to take attention like a lot of my attention is getting drained on the fact that just this gigantic big stack of money.
That I was like what am I going to do with this thing, right?
I don't want to learn the real estate game.
26:52
I don't want to learn the you know, hard money, lending game.
I don't want like there's so many different games for money.
I don't want to learn the private equity.
So I spent probably 30% of my year this year on figuring out how to allocate money and I try to allocate them within our companies because those are things, I have direct control over and I'll get disproportionate Returns on which is, you know, candidly why I started Prestige Labs is because I had all this money from Demolition.
27:15
I was like well what's an ancillary business to?
What I currently have that can provide value to my customers that I can use the same you know distribution base and shared services on that I can make you know, that I can get a disproportionate return on and that's what started Prestige labs and now You know, two years or two and a half years later, Prestige, Labs is a good business.
27:33
It's a, it's a it's a very good business, it provides a lot of value.
We paid over 10 million dollars in commissions, so that's been really good but it I don't think it was the correct decision at the time but now that I have it, I am grateful that we have it.
27:51
So, that's kind of the long and short of that one, but knowing your game beyond the game because it will it will distract you because Ends up happening is like, once you start getting into that world, you get sucked into it and then your actual business starts losing your tension.
That's for your highest return on attention is inside your business, right?
28:08
Is your income and growing it right?
Because both your net worth in the cash flow from your business.
Both of the like it's one of the it's one of the cool things about being entrepreneurs.
Like the net worth that, you have inequity of your business is usually larger than what you have pulled out of your business.
Actually, most times it's largely we put out your business and so that's that's kind of, you know interesting and so for me, trying to figure out how to I allocate those things has been a priority.
28:31
So before I get the question, I'll just tell you.
This is, this is what I have invested my money in this year.
First we have a whole life insurance policy cat.
Hi, cat value upfront.
You have to be really careful about the people that you work with this because they can totally screw you.
28:49
And they are incentivized to screw you and most insurance agents, will not want to hear that, but they the the commission structure that they have for these policies is insane.
Destroys the cash value that you earn from these things.
So if you decide to set up a whole value, whole that cash value, whatever insurance policy one goat, the big four.
29:10
So that's Guardian New York, Life Northwestern Mutual and UMass or MassMutual scuse me.
So there's a big for they've been all around for over 100 years, you know, knee replacement on 483 years, they predate the tax code.
29:26
The reason I did that is because it it basically Ali creates a bank account for you that you can use.
You've obviously pick Austin beginning, but you can basically loan against the, the cash value of the insurance and the cash flow guarantee is, you know, it's guaranteed Road at about 4% a year.
29:45
And so if you just compare that to a traditional bank account where you're losing money, this at least covers for inflation, right?
And so that allows you to least Park the money in a way that's not devaluing itself.
And if you do see opportunities, you can loan against it.
Invest in those things.
So that's the first thing that we did.
30:03
If you ever do one of those you should be able to break even by your three to five at most if it's designed properly.
They'll tell you that.
No, that's going to it's going to sacrifice the long-term blah blah of the of the thing.
I think that's horseshit.
When you when you compare it to the present day cash, like the value of having your money available to co-invest.
30:21
The same time is it's not even an argument my opinion.
It's also how corporations and Banks and Fortune 500 company structure it.
So, Ask so look into coldly and boldly, which is corporate owned life, insurance and bank-owned life insurance, if you want to see how they structure because they know what they're doing.
And so that is how we structured it.
30:38
So, that's number one real quick guys.
If you can think about how you found this podcast, somebody probably tweeted it told you about it, should it on Instagram or something like that?
The only way this grows is through word of mouth and so I don't run ads, I don't do sponsorships, I don't sell anything.
30:54
I only ask is that you continue to pay it forward to whoever showed you or however you found out about this.
Pockets that you do the exact same thing.
So if it was a review if it was a post if you do that would mean the world to me and you throw some good karma out there for another entrepreneur.
Number two, we are investing in B and C Class multifamily apartment units, syndication, so that's big apartment buildings.
31:19
The reason for that is because I think I think single family might get hit hard in the next few years because I'm looking at like, you know, seven-year timelines.
I actually think that, I mean, who knows?
I don't even make my tradition because it's, there's no point but I think that that asset class has outperformed other asset classes and if people Downgrade their living standards because of some kind of recession because I'm really much more about downside mitigation than I am about getting the upside because my upsides in my business.
31:47
So, it's really, like, where can I park money that?
I know.
It's not gonna go anywhere.
And so I take inferior returns to know that I have no downside or less downside and so parking money, and B and C Class.
Real Estate has been one of those those places through syndicated deals.
The third place is I have index funds.
32:07
So that's Indexes of the entire Market.
Because again, this is one of those things that I don't want to think about.
And I'm not trying to stock pick because this is not how I make income like this is not.
This is the thing that everyone is like man.
I could get better.
Yeah, sure.
You could better returns of your daily Trader but you also have a business.
So are you going to learn that game and be better than the biggest institutions in the world that have true you know zillions of dollars to literally destroy you maybe but probably not and so but you can do is be really good at your business and provide good service and probative value and make more money that way.
32:36
And then be willing to take the Non-premium return, you know, of active management and basically make money on your own yourself twice because you're making money on income, doing your thing and you get passive from your Investments, I have a 5% hedge in crypto.
32:56
I don't really like speculative things.
But the only reason I have that is because if for some reason the dollar gets to valued and for some reason we lose the world currency that would Probably greatly, appreciate and value.
And would, the reason it's a hedge is that I'm not trying to make money on it.
33:15
I'm only saying that I'm putting five percent there so that if that happens, that will probably 5x if that were to occur, which would offset the losses I would have and basically, the majority of my investments.
And so that is my that is the conclusion of my investment strategy.
33:32
And what I am focused on outside of just value creation the business because that's actually the fastest way for me to increase my Net worth.
Okay, next one, if you are financially done, you must have a bigger purpose.
So that was one that I learned this here is like, you like like, I mean, I'm shared my numbers transparently with everyone.
33:54
I, we need to like, you have to, you have to sound stupid, you have to really like what you're doing and have a purpose Beyond it, otherwise, like, the money starts being meaningless and it's like it just It doesn't incrementally change my life in any way, you know, like think they think about it.
34:18
Like, I know this sounds crazy but just like, imagine if buying a Lamborghini, for example, was one week's paycheck.
Well, what do you do after you buy a Lamborghini the next week, right?
And let's say you buy a crazy house and that's like five weeks of paycheck.
Well, then what you do with the other 40, you know, five weeks of the years paycheck, right?
34:37
Like it's, you know, a steak dinner, you know, like is not That expensive in the relative term of things, like I had a steak dinner, two times a day or, you know, went to Capitol Grill and spent $200 at three meals a day even, right?
34:54
That's two hundred thousand dollars a year and that is crazy for sure.
But it's also like within the relative scheme and this is where like this is where the ultra wealth part starts to get weird.
Is that like If you have 10 million dollars and you grow by 15%, that's a million and a half dollars a year and it gets bigger and that's what sweet like it's you can't eat it.
35:19
You can't like I still eat chicken and rice.
Like it's not, you know be like nothing you bagels and I the the cheap deli meat from the supermarket like my life hasn't really changed.
You know I have a nicer camera.
Now there's a thousand dollar camera, you know.
But you really have to find something that that I'll put it this way.
35:38
I have found that.
I must do work that I find meaningful.
And that is what gives me purpose in life?
Is that what I do?
I find the pursuit of that, endeavor meaningful, and the actual process itself enjoyable.
And so that is one of my bigger takeaways from 2020 Layla and I spent more time together this year than we ever have and man it was the best thing about this year was my marriage.
36:03
Got a lot better not that it was bad but it just like we're just really good.
And the whole year has been great, which was definitely offset by the craziness of the, of the world.
And I think maybe that's It's maybe that's why we came even closer together, but really focusing on the merits is just being my life more enjoyable, even though we actually had less profit this year than we did last two years and so, yeah, that's that's that one I did make one good decision this year.
36:30
We actually developed a whole CRM for Jim's for the same reason.
Bringing up, is it, you need to have good data management and I spent a million bucks on this thing and I realized I couldn't have for businesses and so I pretty much just killed the project.
36:46
I just wasted a million dollars so I make lots of mistakes.
Just so you're aware.
Lots and lots of mistakes, but that was a good.
That was a good decision that starting, it was not a good decision but not doing the business after I had made, it was a good decision even with the sunk cost, which was hard, another one is entrepreneurship, comes in cycles and Seasons.
37:04
There are seasons of heavy work and there are seasons of there's seasons of reaping and seasons of sowing.
And I think recognizing that there are Eccles is really important and there's even seasonal Cycles, which sounds crazy.
But now this is like the fourth year for our fifth year.
You know, that we're going into for us.
37:20
And every year I'm always like I feel like January through June I'm like, we are on fire, you know what I mean?
And then like by December, I'm like we suck and we shouldn't be in business and we're horrible, you know what I mean?
And then like January comes again and then it was like everything explodes.
And so, I, you know, I've now I come to recognize it and I prepare the team for it.
37:40
And I think now that this is like my Worth of physical threat, I'm more steady and so that's been, I think a lesson in seasonality of talking to Brandon from way deal.
We lost lady boss weight loss and he talked about the same thing as that he and I started around the same time.
37:57
And he realized the same thing is like, doesn't matter what we do.
We are somehow also subject to the cycles of seasonality and they always have their you know Q 1 is always the strongest quarter, why?
Because people are more motivated and weight loss when they're going into Are going to Spring you just started, you know, I just had Valentine's Day and New Year's Eve.
38:15
So there's like all the reasons are all right there, you know, once once it's August, you know, or July, it's not usually a huge, you know, Fitness month and you know, a lot of my business is correlated to Fitness and weight loss, so that was that one, ah, three or life cycle of products.
38:32
So the average product or service has like a three year life cycle and, you know, Jim launches had to innovate.
It's I would say, product Suite twice.
So we started with kind of like the whole Challenge thing.
And then we transition to kind of higher ticket hybrid bootcamp packages.
38:49
And right now we actually sell the same packages, but the acquisition system is different.
It's all outbound based, because that's actually where the biggest Arbitrage is right now.
Meaning we can buy leads and get sales basically Roi on time is highest there.
And so we just continue to see the cycle of you know and you kind of get into these transition points where like a new opportunity opens as another one is closing.
39:09
And then you kind of have to like readjust the product and jump and Always just focusing on like what's working best right now, another one is having multiple acquisition channels and streams is really valuable.
Now that we have outbound You know, like I teach the gyms.
What I'm doing with my own business, having outbound has been really nice.
39:28
It's stable.
It's much more reliable.
It's slower for sure to grow it.
Took 90 days to really get it right for us.
It doesn't doesn't take nearly as I mean for Jim's, like we already have the whole system but for us to start from scratch and build the whole team and figure out how to find the data because like it's not just on the weight loss.
39:44
Like a lot of people are overweight, not a lot of people are gym owners so there's you know, it's different.
It's PC versus V to be but we had to figure out.
Okay, where do we find?
Data, how do we clean the data?
How do we create these lists?
You know, what software do we used to cold call?
What's the script?
What's the hook?
What do we say on the opener?
How do we train the team?
40:00
Where do we recruit from?
How do we compensate these people?
How do we set up the sales process at a two-step or 3 stat, like all those things are things that we had to figure out from scratch.
And it took us about 90 days to figure it out.
So, but now that we have it, it's actually really great, and it's just really cool having two things that are really firing side by side, between inbound and outbound.
40:21
I wrote this one again, but simple scales and so simple.
Like really trying to figure out at all levels, the simplest solution, not like often times the best solution is not the best solution because it is more complex and the simplest solution though.
40:36
It might not be the best solution becomes the best solution because it is actually able to be realized.
And so that is a lesson that I have learned in 2020 more so than any years like we have made our product Suites simpler.
Fleur and more digestible and immediately actionable.
40:52
And we are getting better client results now than even when there was like crazy Facebook Arbitrage and that took time, you know what I mean to just learn that because I would say like a year and a half ago we had so much stuff inside of our product that's like it could be so perfectly customized.
The thing is that it was overwhelming for the majority of clients and so trying to to rectify the complexity versus Simplicity equation you know you kind of have to find the middle ground in The Sweet Spot.
41:19
What's going to serve the most people at the highest level?
And so that was just reinforces here.
And honestly, right now we're doing we're I'm I'm more proud of the gym which product now than I've ever been, which is pretty cool for me.
Another one is that you can make the right decisions and be wrong and you can make the wrong decisions and be right.
41:39
And so this is really hard from a learning perspective because let's say, for example, I bet my life savings on black at the, at the At the casino right?
If it hits black.
Was it the right decision?
Probably not.
41:56
And so I may be rewarded for poor decision just like I could make a strategic bet in business that for all reasons was the right call and then covid hits, right?
And then all of a sudden, That's not the that, that wasn't the quote, right bet.
42:15
But it was the right decision, given the information available and so things change.
There are market dynamics and so I instead of beating myself up over decisions.
I think, if all I had was the the decision-making criteria that I had available to me at the time, the information available to me at the time, was the decision that I made the best decision.
42:35
And what I don't want to do is unlearned good habits, right?
Because we're constantly, you know, evolving and growing as entrepreneurs.
And so, not unlearning good habits and, and not reinforcing bad habits, that have good outcomes is something that I have focused on a lot.
42:51
This year.
And so sometimes there are short-term trades that have long-term outcomes.
And I think this year was actually much more of a long-term focused year for us, ironically with all the craziness that was going on.
We put a lot of foundational stuff in place that I think is really setting the stage for 2021, so pump for that.
43:11
And I would say my there's there's more to this, but I'll probably end on this note, which is Understanding an expanded time Horizon.
Has been immeasurably valuable for me.
43:28
And this is one of those things where you hear it all the time, right?
But it doesn't become real for you and I feel like it became real for me this year, which was I'm independently wealthy.
I don't need any more money for the rest of my life.
43:45
If we grow our current net worth at 10%, a year will be worth several hundred million dollars half a billion dollars by the time I'm 60 And so that probably means I won't need anything.
I could stop working now, right?
And that allows me to think from a slightly different perspective, but the thing is, is that I think the reason that the rich get richer is because it allows them to think from this perspective.
44:09
And so the hardest thing is trying to get yourself into this and so I'm making like this is if there's anything that you listen to in this entire video.
It is what I'm about to tell you.
If you can expand your time Horizon Beyond months and even a year or two, you will be so much better off.
44:28
If you expand your time Horizon Beyond just a month or a year and actually start thinking in five-year and 10-year terms, you will be so much better off and I think there's there's so many reasons for that one, is when you bet on long enough time Horizons, you can virtually get rid of risk.
44:48
And if you can make risk for risk-free guaranteed upside, then why would you not make those bets the reason?
Warren Buffett said this.
You said no one wants to get rich slow, right?
But I would rather get rich for sure.
Then get rich fast and lose it, right?
45:04
Or more realistically for many try and get rich fast for my entire life rather than just saying.
Well, if I just did this for Ten years.
I'd be guaranteed to be a millionaire and I think that is the issue and I think that's the problem that the world has.
And that's why most people will never become wealthy is because they cannot delay, their impatience, they cannot delay, their gratification.
45:26
And so, for me when I'm thinking about our businesses, I'm now really thinking like, do I think and this is because I've been reading a lot about investor stuff and I'm like, you know, private Equity firms will come in, and their goal will be to double accompany, you know, in In five years.
45:41
All right, double company in five years and I think about that with like Jim launch and there's so many times where I'm like we got a double this year, why don't we double?
But if I'd said like we just got a double in five and made the plan for that.
The plan would look so much different and also so realistically attainable that I think we'd probably over perform that but what it would do is eliminate the needless frenetic energy of all, we got to do this. now we got, you know, like craziness of the shifts and then turns and and like sure there's always things that you have to adapt in the marketplace but it just gives you this steadiness as a leader and when you can look at a five-year goal, but like I've never even believed in 5 year goals as a, from a goal perspective, but I think of it in terms of a timeline perspective of like, how am I measuring myself?
46:34
Like, when I think about where I was five years ago?
It's not it's like not even comprehensible.
And so I mean, I hope to have that kind of difference five years from now, we'll see.
But I think that if I can take a more steady approach, A more disciplined approach to growth and to Value creation within the company.
46:58
Everything that I've read about, you know, value-based investing and how, you know, companies do turnarounds which is really valuable if you ever want to get into a reading topic, look at, you know, by buying and buying and flipping businesses because you look at what they're looking at in the business as what they can do to improve.
47:14
And so you can basically come in with fresh eyes to your own business and think like, what would I do if I were buying my business fresh from day?
One today, which is actually, really good thought exercise.
And so I've kind of walk through that process.
In the things that I would do, are different than what I'm actually doing.
And so by expanding it to an Investor's time Horizon, I feel like I'm making much better decisions and I have much better perspective and it's been it's just incredibly calming because I think the reason that entrepreneurs are the, you know, the double-edged sword of us is that we're emotional people, we we get so excited and then we all these ideas and we want to do all of them and the realities that you can't.
47:52
You just can't you can't even do.
Can even do most of them?
Can do a very, very, very small percentage of them and when a private Equity buyer, for example, comes in to try and buy a business and improve it.
They will.
I'll tell you actually know, I'll tell you what.
This has been really enlightening for us.
48:07
I'll tell you what they do.
So the first thing to do is to create a hundred, a plan in the objective that hundred a plan is to align the economic interest of the management with the fund who in the investor, who's buying it.
Right?
And the way they do that is they first figure out what their primary to Two to three, kpis are going to be, that's it, 2 3, and then they figure out how to accurately and meticulously track those things.
48:34
So typically, you know, investors are known for, you know, cutting costs and increasing profits.
That's like a standard thing that they'll do, but they increase the cost on I.T in reporting and Villages.
And so for me thinking about that, it's like, okay, that just really shows how important the data and Reporting is which is kind of what I was.
48:54
Alluding to earlier.
And so they Implement a lot of Erp and CRM systems that they already have, you know, test and what not to get the tracking in real time around there KP is now the number one kpi that they track, which I found incredibly interesting, which we don't track, which is Wild is excess cash flow, and it's crazy because that's the thing.
49:14
I care.
The most about as the owner is one of my depositing, my bank account every month, but as financials become more sophisticated, you look at your profit your ibadah and like all the, you know, your p&l and you have to offset Revenue based on contract terms blah, blah, blah trite.
But all I care about is excess cash flow.
And it was ironic to me that the most sophisticated investors you know in the world.
49:32
Some of them right.
The thing that they care about is the thing that I care about which is just how much cash we putting off, you know?
And they have different reasons for that because they can serve a step better.
They can get better leverage, which means they can be better multiples.
And blah, blah blah, and they get better returns.
But for me thinking about that is something that I'm going to be reorganizing our business around which is how can we and, and set in aligning, the incentive of the management team around.
49:54
That that kpi.
And so that's what they do in their first hundred days and then after that, the only create two to three focused task Force's, right?
Small teams that can be held accountable to Big Domino, operational objectives that will provide the most value in the that have high probability of success.
50:13
Provide the most value to the business and so that is it and that's what they do.
And they just ruthless ruthlessly manager on those metrics.
And I think about that and what that means is, they allow the management and leadership team to run the business rather than metal.
50:29
And I think that I definitely have a tendency to metal because I like doing things my way and I want things to sound a certain way and blah blah blah.
The same things all of us do and and it's not it's not been it actually hurts the business and so because it removes consistency.
50:45
And so if we can create consistency of operations, it creates it creates less waste, right?
So you can be more Isn't it creates a more consistent experience for the customers?
And so it allows us to make more profit from less waste.
It gives, like I said, more value, and it allows us to just focus on a couple of things without feeling the constant overwhelm.
51:04
So, I actually think that our team etcetera itself would be happier with this type of approach and so that is how I'm kind of Shifting my my perspective on our businesses now because we have three of them in doing that and so that's been really cool.
51:21
Also taking on a number of small companies that I'm working with.
So companies that are doing 125 million dollars a year that are either, you know, Consulting service knowledge, education, based businesses or Niche, brick-and-mortar businesses that you know, have the desire to like franchisor scale nationally.
51:48
And so those are, it's just cuz that's that's the businesses that I know.
Intimately.
And so I'm actually working with some companies there and that's crazy for me.
Because if you think about from an investor standpoint, I have a company that I just recently became an advisor to, and they'd been at half a million dollars a year for two years, I think and now we're doing a hundred and fifty thousand a week.
52:14
Six months later, right?
So that's from five hundred fifty thousand dollars a month.
To six hundred thousand dollars a month, right wild.
So pretty pretty cool.
Very exciting and I'm just, I'm just pumped Pumped out the future.
52:31
I think 2020 was gonna be a good year.
I think there's a lot of cash on the sidelines savings across the entire United States, like went up a ton, which means they're printing money and people are holding on to it.
Which means that when people start spending that money, we should see a boom overall.
I do think that, you know, as we have an entirely Eric president, you know, all three houses or whatever, branches, the government are all Democratic.
52:54
I don't think they're going to want to not look good and so I think that they're going to pump the economy as much as they can, which will be good in the short term and we'll see you in the long term as much as everyone's really worried about the inflationary effects.
Which is definitely a concern.
53:10
There's also really strong deflationary effects going on right now to.
So I also think that the people who who are running monetary policy are probably more knowledgeable than we are, literally what they do for a living full-time.
So just something consider their yeah, that was 2020.
53:29
I have I've, I've had a I hope you enjoyed.
This is different than the normal types of podcast that I make.
This is kind of the, the top of mind, the things that have been most meaningful for me, and I'm I think I'm in the best mental place I've ever been, which is cool for me.
53:50
I'm not a particularly I would never have described myself as a particularly happy person.
But I'm I'm I'm pretty close to happy and I really like the word very much because I think it's really misleading but I'm really, I'm really pretty fulfilled.
54:08
I really like what I do, I think I'm good at it so I find that fulfilling I find it challenging.
I love the game of Entrepreneurship and I'm very grateful to be able to fly, you know, I really am and I'm going to leave you with one thing that I so I talked to my 18 Old neighbor, right?
54:27
And he's having a hard time, he's got more stuff that's happened.
Since the last time you've heard a podcast from me, just personal stuff, and, you know, he's having trouble with the sacrifices that are required for entrepreneurship.
You know, he's young, he wants to have fun and, and, and the thing is, there's nothing wrong with that.
54:46
It's just, the question is, how bad do you want?
What you claim to want, you know, everybody wants a six-pack.
It's just that they want donuts more, right?
They actually want donuts, they, they claim to want a six-pack.
But they want donuts more, right?
And I think that that, you know, analogy is the same for business, like he wants to be an entrepreneur, but it's hard to see your friends, partying, and having fun, and living.
55:09
You know, they're their youth youthful lives without you and it's easy to rationalize and say like why should enjoy my youth?
And I'm not saying you shouldn't.
I'm really not, I just know that if you, you know, the sooner, you start investing in skills, and I'm not saying he's going to like investing in skills is the thing, right?
55:25
What he does to invest in Skills is irrelevant, but investing in skills is how he gets there and putting a disproportionate amount of time towards developing.
The skills will allow him to you know, outpace the competition being, you know, everyone else right and I said something that when I was 19 was a huge Epiphany for me.
55:43
So I'm just going to share with you.
I was dating a girl for two years in college and she was very, very obsessed with happiness.
It was like, it was her major.
It was positive.
Psychology is our major Sure.
And she was really obsessed with happiness and she ended up being an amazing person, you know what I mean?
56:05
But I think at the base a relatively sad person and And I know that when we split up and during that time because, you know, people rub off on you, I I had become really, really interested in happiness.
How do I optimize for happiness?
56:22
Every it does.
This make me happy, like, all this stuff and I think happy is a horrible term.
I think it's a horrible term.
I think it poisons.
So many people, you know?
And I remember, you know, because you your kind of emotional near Unger and probably were emotional or older, which is better hiding it.
56:39
But when we split up, She and I and I, and I had these habits of, you know, reading all this positivity stuff and blah blah blah.
And and I just remember going to this place where I was just like fuck happiness.
56:56
I'm just going to win.
And that became my new kind of operating standard was like, fuck happiness.
Like I'm just going to move.
I'm going to take so much action that I don't have to think about it.
I don't have to think I'd have to be alone with my thoughts, right?
I'm just going to keep moving, and I'm just going to keep getting better, and I'm going to keep making progress.
57:14
I don't care if I'm happy and a weird thing happened.
Once I stopped obsessing about happiness, actually think that I became more content because the thing is, is I was constantly measuring self before that, to this, what I would suggest, you know, what, consider an unrealistic expectation of the human existence, And always finding myself deficient.
57:41
And so, the desire for happiness, Creates an unfulfilled expectation.
That makes me unhappy.
And disregarding happiness.
Gives me permission.
57:58
To not give a fuck.
And if I happen to be happy, or enjoy a moment or or find fulfillment in my work, then it becomes above my expectation.
And so, I have a positive experience.
And so one of the biggest things that I have worked on and this is what I was talking to my 18 year old neighbor about was the only reason that you were upset right now is because of a fictitious expectation that you arbitrarily made up in your mind that you are not reaching that you made up.
58:29
It's like if I said I wanted to gain 20 pounds of muscle in seven days and then was upset that I didn't gain 20 pounds of muscle and seven days because I worked out hard, it's the same thing, right?
I was like, you want to be a millionaire in your 19.
I was like, do you feel like it's reasonable that?
You think that after two months of beginning, your entrepreneurial Journey that you don't earn above the top 1% in the United States?
58:54
They do you feel like it's reasonable that after eight weeks of not being in school that you are not in the top 1%?
He was like well when you say it like that and I was like right but that's what you're thinking.
You're thinking like that, right?
59:09
And so this kind of goes full circle with what I was saying earlier about having the extended time Horizon.
If we can extend our Horizons, then we decrease our own expectations and by doing so we increase our fulfillment by default because we expect less or nothing.
59:28
And while we increase our fulfillment during the process, we actually get Better faster.
And That was what I have him having him.
Focus on is like why don't we say what's a five-year goal that we believe is reasonable and let's make it action-based.
59:48
All right?
So instead of I want to make four hundred thousand dollars a year in five years why don't we say what skills will I need to have that would allow me to make four hundred thousand dollars a year and then what actions would I need to take to acquire those skills.
That would be reasonable even with poor talent that I would achieve that.
1:00:05
And so, for example, we That lead generation and sales.
If you want to be an entrepreneur would be valuable skills.
And so I said, okay, how do you think that we can go about guaranteeing virtually that you will have those skills?
He's like, well, you know, reps and I was like, right?
1:00:22
So how do we get reps in and how many reps do we feel?
Like a reasonable, right?
I was like, you've like, if you make 25,000 calls this year, which is a hundred calls a day, just 500 calls times 52 weeks, right?
You think you make 25,000 calls to be, you'll be able to prospecting get business.
He's like, Yeah, I think after 25 thousand dollars that would be reasonable like, cool great.
1:00:41
So that's one year next year, what do we do?
Do you think after you if you took, you know, you know, 2020 height say, you know, calls a week over 52 weeks, you know, a thousand High ticket phone call closes.
You would be able to be at least proficient in sales.
1:00:58
He's like, yeah, I think I could do that.
Like, okay, we're we still have three years left on this, on this timeline, but I can tell you right now, if you can generate leads and you can Prospect for your own thing and you can sell at high tech it amounts.
You can make 40,000 year, no problem, but we're only two years in what else we're going to need.
He's like well I don't know what I'm selling.
1:01:13
I'm like, that's great.
So then we have to develop a skill, that's valuable, right?
And so at that point, I was like, I'm not going to make that goal right now.
We're going to develop these first two.
And then after that, we're going to go develop the other ones.
And so, I hope these kind of anecdotes about my 18 year, old neighbor are useful for you.
1:01:30
It's really, it's honestly, been one of the.
It's honestly, one of the most rewarding things for me because I feel like I get to live.
I can I can help someone not, you know, suffer as much as I did during that process and really short, cut the whole path to success.
Anyways, I love you guys for listening.
1:01:48
This is, you know, I appreciate those of you who find this valuable.
This is really just my mental diary for myself so that I can look back, you know, and maybe maybe hopefully, you know in decades to come I'll be among the the billionaire Bros who donates their life, life's net worth to some meaningful cause And they'll be like dude you gotta listen to her moans, he's old stuff and so hopefully that's what these are.
1:02:12
So anyways, I appreciate you all.
I'm focusing on simple, I'm focusing on longer time Horizons.
I'm focusing on finding good people, I'm focusing on getting them focused on just a handful of things and just driving those and doing living a boring, but steady business life.
1:02:34
And trying to come into it with no expectations and, and being pleasantly surprised about anything that happens.
And so that is, that is my Outlook.
And I know that the world has been rough.
My recommendation is to turn off all media.
1:02:51
It I turned off, I removed all the media from my phone because I thought it was especially overwhelming.
And I realized that my life was really the same without all of the news.
So, Hopefully that's why before you and I know that the news does not make me more money, and I also know that the news does not help me prepare for what is to come independently because I think to myself well, what would I do differently than I'm currently doing?
1:03:16
If these things were to happen and the answer is nothing, which means it's not really providing value and if it's like, well, I need to stay informed.
If there's anything major, I'll find out, I don't need to go surf the news to go do that.
So, anyways, 2021, I think, is a me good ear for a lot of us.
1:03:33
I think a lot of people grew a lot in 2020 and so as a result their businesses will grow in 2021.
Like they personally grew.
I personally grew more in 2020 that I did in any other year and I think that we're going to we're going to.
I think the result of that is going to show in 2021.
1:03:49
So keeping amazing and keeping awesome.
Lots of love and I will catch you guys in the next fit, but








0:00
Real quick.
Because you guys already know that, I don't run any ads on this and I don't sell anything.
And so, the only ask that I can ever have you guys that you help me spread the word so we can have more entrepreneurs, make more money, feed their families, make better products, and have better experiences for their employees and customers.
And the only way we do that is if you can rate and review and share this podcast, so the single thing that I have to do is you can just leave review will take you 10 seconds or one type of the thumb mean, the absolute world to me.
0:25
And more importantly, it may change the world of someone else.
I personally have made a lot more Mistakes than I have correct choices.
Welcome to the game, where we talk about how to get more customers, how to make more per customer and how to keep them longer and the many failures and lessons, we have learned along the way.
I hope you enjoy and subscribe.
0:42
What's going on everyone?
I wanted to talk about one of the biggest mistakes of my entrepreneurial career.
I'm going to try and talk about more of these because I think a lot of, you know, a lot of times, we only hear about the wins and not about the losses and Most of us have been in the game.
1:01
You know, a while have will tell you, you know, like, you'll make way more or I personally have made a lot more mistakes than I have correct choices.
And so before I dive into that, the longer I've been in this, the more I've adopted a single belief that I've inherited from people, smarter than me, that make more money than me and it's your mistakes will break you more than your wins, will take you.
1:27
And what I mean by that, is At least, I think it's true in business and in life and even in you know, marriages and relationships just in so many things.
The downside, it's many times, it's more important to mitigate downside risk than it is to try and maximize upside return.
1:43
And so, what I mean by that is like a lot of times we as on first get excited about the story about that one thing that changed and then like the company doubled or whatever it is.
But so many more times we get killed through our mistakes more than we get, you know, made through our, you know, our wins.
1:59
And so as I have, you know, I feel like matured in the entrepreneurial role I'm less interested in the big home runs and more interested in avoiding the mistakes that get, you know, the mistakes, right?
And so I'll share this with you.
So this is one of the biggest mistakes I've ever made.
At one point is probably a year or two ago.
2:20
Our company was struggling with turn and part of the reason that this is interesting is that I'll say this, I believed my company was struggling with turn.
My company was not struggling with turn.
I believed it was because I was extrapolating data from one industry to another and so I didn't know, right?
2:40
And that's why, you know, expectations and proper, you know, proper benchmarking is important, right?
But because of this, I was driving myself and my team crazy about trying to, you know, fix turn because it was just, it was driving me nuts, right?
And in reality, it was actually, it was, it was fine.
2:57
It was at, or below Market.
But anyways, in this process some of my team was, you know, they were responsible for churning right there, you know, their bonuses and what they were being measured on was chart lifetime value, right?
3:12
And I this is actually really funny that even said that lifetime value in turn are very different, right?
Because lifetime values influence by Price, turn is just what percentage of customers leave, right?
And so, I will tell you what I did and I will tell you how much it cost me.
3:28
So, We decided we're going to do this crazy, great idea and provide more for Less, right?
And so, we had this huge announcement, we're going to add this Hue new, you know, this new, all these new services in for our clients, and Whatever they were.
3:51
They were they were they were paying we were going to just literally have them pay less.
How stupid does that sound to you?
But I, you know, I The people in the front line who's who were being measured on turn were persistent and it was ultimately my call and trying to be a accommodating CEO, I said, okay.
4:23
And so we snapped our fingers and we made the change and it cost me five million dollars a year in profit.
Hey guys, love that.
You're listening to the podcast.
4:39
If you ever want to have the video version of this, which usually has more effects, more visuals, more graphs drawn-out stuff, sometimes it can help hit the brain centers in different ways.
You can check out my YouTube channel.
It's absolutely free.
So check that out if that's what you are into and if not keep enjoying the show, And turn to the change.
5:01
Five million dollars a year.
In profit.
And it didn't turn was unaffected.
Unaffected.
So, the moral of the lesson that I learned from this failure, was that many times are lowering your price is pretty much never the solution ever.
5:31
Like ever number one.
Number two, you can raise your price. because you feel like it, You can.
Number two, number three, understand benchmarks and expectations before making these types of decisions.
5:57
And I said this in a past podcasts and I'm gonna say it again here, Jeff Bezos has a thing about making decisions quickly, which is if I make a decision, I decide whether it's reversible or irreversible.
If it's reversible, I just make it quickly and move forward.
If it's irreversible, we take more time and thinking about decisions, like that allows you to move, you know.
6:15
Pastor in an organization.
This was an irreversible decision because I couldn't just lower it and be like a just kidding.
You guys are back at, you know, higher price my bad and so it's just wild is such a terrible decision decision.
It was such a bad decision and thing is The, the price reduction so that you have a relative understanding of what the reduction was is.
6:38
We did a it's crazy when I even say this out loud because it was so dumb, it was a 25 percent reduction in price.
A twenty-five percent permanent permanent discount.
Like imagine cutting your top line by 25% for most people that your prophet.
6:58
And I was somehow so obsessed with trying to conquer turn and thinking that price was the thing and it wasn't, it's like we're it's like retaining employees.
The price is usually never the thing, right?
It's not like, people don't stay for higher pay.
7:14
They stay for other reasons.
They for fulfillment a safe or if they're feel like they're growing, they stay, if they feel like they're contributing, they feel like they stay.
If they're feeling, they're making an impact, they stay, if they, if they enjoy their who they work with, right?
They don't necessarily like they don't really like people don't get happier when they get a pay increase.
7:33
They have a momentary blip and then they return back to Baseline.
And so did the same degree.
We didn't decrease turn at all.
In fact, I even had some people complain.
They were like, I can't believe you charged me what you were charging me before and they were upset about it.
And so I share this story because I just want everyone to know the many many, many, many, many mistakes I have made that was the single greatest mistake.
7:58
I've made it was a single greatest mistake that I have made and so my hope is that if you are considering this first off, don't do.
So right now, just don't do but If you're considering it, don't do it, don't do it.
8:18
But if you are considering it, I'm going to say don't do it again.
But the next thing the point is understand how much turn would have to be reduced in order for this to make it worth it.
And the answer is by so much that it wouldn't even make sense.
And so that is just one of my more than 1 million dollar mistakes.
8:39
So I will continue to tell you more mistakes that I've made that cost me more than a million dollars but that one The single greatest mistake I've made as an entrepreneur.
So It's all I got.
That is my, that is my scar of the day to share with you on my entrepreneurial journey.
8:56
I hope you find Value in it, and I hope it just prevents you from making the same mistake, rather than I've no lesson.
It's just our.
So, I've no, I've no tactic for you.
It's just, if you can avoid that mistake, you will, you will make so much more money by just not doing this terrible thing.
If you don't get a DUI and, you know, get pregnant before 16, your life will likely turn out better than otherwise now so you can.
9:18
It's just you have way more likelihood of succeeding.
Right.
And so if you don't just cut your prices for no reason, 25% of your top line, then you will likely make more.
So that is my, that's my gift.
That is my, my thing for the day and I hope you have an amazing rest of your butt.

Real quick guys.
If you can think about how you found this podcast, somebody probably tweeted it told you about it.
Should it on Instagram or something like that?
The only way this grows is through word of mouth and so I don't run ads, I don't do sponsorships, I don't sell anything.
I only ask is that you continue to pay it forward to whoever showed you or however you found out about this Pockets that you do the exact same thing.
0:19
So if it was a review if it was a post, if you do that would mean the world to me and you throw some good karma out there for another entrepreneur.
You get so caught in the monthly goals and weekly goals.
That you forget to make the long-term Investments that are important and not urgent.
0:35
Welcome to the game where we talk about how to get more customers, how to make more per customer and how to keep them longer and the many failures and lessons, we have learned along the way.
I hope you enjoy and subscribe.
What's going on, everyone?
Happy Sunday, this is coming from downtown.
Austin wanted to talk to you about one of the most profound belief and perspective shifts that I've had over the last few years and I think 2020 was that year for me where I made one of the most profound internal shifts.
1:00
And the shift has yielded me, unbelievable amounts of decreases in anxiety, for me.
And honestly, just increases my increase my level of certainty.
And I can understand why, so many people fail to a much higher degree.
And I think one of the biggest curses that I had early on in my career is that, you know, within months, I went from, it's just everything kind of aligned for me, mind you after five years of Eating shit.
1:31
But nonetheless things did a line for me and very rapidly went to from making not a lot of money to millions of dollars a year in profit to my second year doing almost 20 million dollars in profit.
And that, that that fundamentally I think ruined me in a lot of ways earlier on because I saw that as my, my Benchmark, you know what I mean?
1:57
I saw that as like, if it's if a business is not doing this and it's failing, Is something wrong and I think that it was a really poisonous Viewpoint for me are toxic Viewpoint.
And I want to share with you what I've shifted to and what has been such a dramatic Improvement in my life and I think my business.
2:14
So, when I look at investors and people make a lot more money than me, and people have much bigger businesses in the may, I see this common thread, of looking at it from an Investor's time Horizon.
And so, I feel like an entrepreneurship, everything is about tomorrow.
Everything is about this week, everything's about this month and Making payroll and all that.
2:30
You know, you have all the day-to-day things but you get so much.
You get so caught in the monthly goals and weekly goals that you forget to make the long-term Investments that are important and not urgent.
And when I look at the Billionaire's of the world and all of them are trying to build, you know, Escape paths to Mars, to me, I see that sure there's the cool Factor, but the fact that they're all kind of thinking about the stuff just leads me to think that they're thinking on such a larger time, Horizon than the rest of humanity, which is probably one of the reasons.
3:00
They're more successful.
And one of the things to think about this is kind of fast versus inevitable.
And I have tried to shift my perspective to wanting to do tasks and actions on a repeated basis that I know that if I repeat them over a long enough time Horizon will lead me to inevitably accomplishing my goal and so it what it does.
3:24
By shifting that way, as I look at tasks, I look at projects.
I look at initiatives in a very different light.
I also am so I mean, I wasn't super affected by competition in general mentally because of other things, but I think this has been probably the last nail on the coffin for me, in terms of like well, so and so's making more or whatever, right?
3:43
The things that we do to compare ourselves, if you remove the time Horizon and think of not next year, but maybe next decade.
Right.
I've been using five years because that is a timeline that I feel like I can wrap my head around and Israel for me, I had a mentor reach out to me and he was like, And you know, this guy sold his thing for three 3.4 billion.
4:04
He's like bro you need 100 Year timeline and I I took that in I accept that but I that was not real for me yet and so five years or something that is real for me that I can believe in.
And so what that does is if you think about time as an inevitable Force that's going to move forward, one way or another think about for a second how and this is for me.
4:28
Do I see time as a Threat.
Do I see?
Time is a liability.
Something that I'm always saying is, is working against me, or is time an asset that is working for me.
And I think this has been the single greatest shift in perspective, for me is now, seeing if I extend my time Horizon, then time stops being a liability and a threat and becomes an asset and how things compound over time.
4:54
Now works to assist me rather than hinder me.
And so I'll give you a simple example.
Simple.
So I have never believed in SEO, right?
Or really even inbound marketing and I have had a major shift in perspective on this probably in the last 12 months.
5:13
And the reason for that is because you know if your first 12 months of doing, you know, SEO and I'm saying that as a general as a catch-all term, really just any inbound marketing and that is not paid advertising that results in people because that's technically kind of still outbound, right?
5:29
Your You're putting ads out there and then getting people to respond rather than basically pull based marketing where you're putting your creating a water hole for people to come towards right.
And so I've never really invested much thought into inbound stuff at all.
I mean the only example of that is really this kind of log such podcast, which I never did for a really, any business purposes is just more for me to document my journey but nonetheless, thinking about this in terms of that perspective of and I've been talking to people who were like Yeah, we have this, you know, it's taken us five years to build this asset but now this asset creates 3,000 applications month for our for our software or for our whatever.
6:09
Right.
And I think I myself am like, man.
Just building a machine.
That just consistently month-over-month creates more and more and more inbound interest is just wildly compelling to me.
6:25
And so I think to myself, okay, sure.
We're going to have our outbound things both outbound in terms.
Of manual at bound, with people Cole, Cole, Cole, email, Etc.
You know, called the M but also we have our outbound with paid advertising across platforms, but the kind of the third piece to this is what can we quote invest in that?
6:44
If I did it over five years I believe it would be unreasonable for me to not have built another channel, that is reliable and sustainable and enduring.
And so, you'll probably see some more things for me in the next 12 months, along that line, Because I think it's really awesome and I want to use compound growth to my advantage rather than as a hindrance rather than as something that I compare myself to and feel always inadequate.
7:11
And so what I think that the shift from the CEO to investor mindset has helped me with is the stress that I put on myself for like quarterly goals and looking at someone else who might have started at the same time as me and is doing better than me.
Because then I get to think to myself, okay?
7:29
But we're not comparing ourselves.
Now, we're comparing ourselves to what's going to happen in 20 years, right?
Will their company still be here and I'm trying to build something that endures that lasts that maybe even can be passed on to a future generation.
And I don't think those were ever thoughts of mine when I was starting my entrepreneurial career and I wish they had been and so I don't know where you're at right now.
7:51
But maybe if you can, if you can take that perspective and think to yourself, what could I create that and what tasks that I do, what projects should I invest in that?
Even if they don't pay off this quarter or next quarter or even the next 12 months?
I think that it would be inevitable that I would have a disproportionate payoff five years from now.
8:09
And obviously, that begets, the obvious, you know, the single greatest constraint that most people have, which is they can't do anything consistently.
But I believe I can do things consistently.
And I think that many of the people listening to, this can do things consistently.
And so if you have that character trait already you've developed that discipline.
I feel like using that discipline to invest in things that are going to create.
8:28
Disproportionate returns is a good use of time, right?
For us.
And so I'll give you a a real example around this.
Hey guys, real quick for those of you guys who are 100 million-dollar offers fans I love you.
I added in a lost chapter that has never been released.
8:46
I'm releasing it now transparently.
I'm doing that to build hype for under million-dollar leads, but you will have the unreleased chapter, it talks about your first Avatar and how to segment customers to make more money.
You can get it by going to acquisition.com forward slash leads.
Its fo free in exchange for your email so that I can email you when we launched under Miller, All Leads and so that you can not miss out on it.
9:06
Because last time I sold out for like 8, Straight weeks really fast.
So that is my way of making sure that y'all get first dibs.
We're looking at doing an initiative on the gym, lunch and our journalist company related to just generating more inbound applications in one eye.
9:24
And I was talking to our GM about it and I was saying, listen let's let's not think about that for like this quarter.
I mean we can start now but let's not measure the ROI until you know next year.
And I don't think I would ever have said something like that.
A year or two ago.
9:41
I don't even think it would even be a thought.
But it's, it's been wildly freeing because there's so much less pressure around initiatives and I think it actually improves the quality of the initiative and the execution of the team, because they're not immediately be like, oh, it's been a week and it's not working.
9:57
So, we're failing, right?
And so, let me give you another really good nugget that I've had recently around this, which is rather than looking at week over week month, over month, sales growth instead I asked myself the question.
10:17
What one thing if I tripled it in our company, what non sales-related, you know what?
Not in Revenue related thing, that if I were to triple it, it would be unreasonable to believe that my company would not triple as well and for me that was inbound qualify or I'm saying about but just number of qualified applications generated.
10:37
That was a metric that I was like, okay, sometimes when you're increasing the number of applications that are coming in You have a new sales person or new sales team and their close rate is low, it happens, right?
It's part of scaling a business but over a long enough time Horizon, it would be unreasonable for me to believe that if I were to Triple my number of applications, I would not see, you know, a proportional increase in sales.
11:04
And so what's interesting to me is that if I can, I've never actually thought about a leading indicator because I've leading indicators on turn which is like customer activation and I talked about that in other stuff.
But I've never actually had a leading indicator on growth, which is fascinating to me that I've never had this, which is like hilarious, but actually measuring the number of sales accepted lead since that is, that's defined as a lead that the sales team accepts because they showed in our qualified, right?
11:31
They are the type of person who we can serve, you know, they have the size business that we work with, you know, and they showed up and they have interest, right?
So that, that would be a sales qualified lead.
And so trying to say, I want to increase sales by 5% a month is a fine goal.
11:47
The thing is that there are so many other variables that can affect it in a short time Horizon like that.
We're as saying I want to increase our number of inbound applications by 5% per month is far more Consistent and reasonable to do.
12:03
And so, if you thought about like a line, right?
If I increase, I know that I can increase through consistent activity, the number of inbound applications, either through adding more people to outreach, creating more channels for content and then, you know, obviously there's the paid side, which is you can add another platform etcetera, right?
12:20
And so if I draw that line, that is something I can consistently do.
And so when I'm thinking about growing my business and hitting a goal like tripling it right in the Just five years.
And I think, okay, well then let's take let's take our sales qualified sales qualified leads, right?
12:40
And let's draw that as our line, and that's going to be our Baseline, right?
That's what we're going to focus.
All our attention on the day-to-day activities around that those are going to be like the stock market right there.
Get there going to be up and down, up and down up and down.
And I think most of us are looking at such Small Time Horizons.
It looks crazy.
But if you look at it from an Investor's perspective, in terms of years or decades, then you can really see the truth and the That a stock will go up over a decade, is simply because of the true economic value that a company is providing right?
13:08
And so for me a leading indicator of growth would be the number of interested in queries that we get.
And so that is actually going to be.
My primary predictive metric that I will be driving because I know that of course, we're going to change processes.
Sure we might change crms, you know we might change our funnel or a say like all these things are small things but if I can simply increase the number of defied applications of people who want to, for example, grow their gem by 3x.
13:38
In the next five years, then I can reasonably believe that I would be able to achieve it and thinking that way it's just been amazing.
And so that is what I'm dedicated to doing and some of these smaller projects which for me we're like well this thing is going to double our lead gen so I don't want to do it.
13:54
I've really shifted my perspective on that and so I'm now looking at reliable inflows.
It's like okay.
I think this one thing can generate US 20 new clients a month that's not huge for us but it's it's it's noticeable and so okay.
14:11
Well then how do you know how much to say to invest in that?
How long do you know?
And and and let's start it, let's start the let's start the snowball, right?
And so that's one of the that's what I was talking about Jam about and so we're actually going to do this initiative that I think will results in about 20, new clients a month and it's going to take us time to get there, but I but I think it's going to be really, really valuable for us, right?
14:31
Right over the Long Haul.
Especially and so let me just take a quick look at my notes real quick because I wanted to make sure I'm not missing anything for you due to do.
Yeah, I think that's, I think that's that's my biggest thing, right?
14:50
That's, that's pretty much my message for what, my biggest perspective shift has been is thinking about a five-year time Horizon.
Shifting from CO2, shareholder Sif shifting from CO2 to board member or advisor and thinking about it over those time Horizons and I feel like if you can just make that change I wish I could explain to you how much less stress I have because if you know the But it goes up by a little bit or down by a little bit one month over another month.
15:17
It just, it just doesn't affect me like, it doesn't affect my life in any way and I feel like I had my ego.
So this is actually the last point that had in my notes, which is my ego is just so much less impacted by the fluctuations of the business that it's just, it's just phenomenally increased.
15:35
My standard of living.
Like I'm just, I'm just really not that stressed about things, you know, I just can't even express it to you.
And so, anyways, this Has been probably the biggest lesson 2020 for me, and obviously 2020 for us was we are Prophet was cut in half.
15:51
We did I think 13.4 in profit last year and we did.
I think 66 this year, we're getting a final books, but around that this year in profit, which was technically my lowest year of profit in a while.
And but I can truthfully tell you, it's really doesn't affect me because I know it's a momentary business disruption because of a pandemic that disproportionately affected my clients than many, you know, than me.
16:14
Other Industries and I don't think would be unreasonable for me to believe that over the next three years.
Right?
That we would, we would not only recover but grow past where we were before.
And so in thinking about that, anyways, I just it's been, it's just viewing time as an ally and not an ally, or an asset, not a threat, or a liability.
16:34
And once you can, when I can hitch my cart to something that is inevitable, like the past and the passing of time then I feel like you're aligned with forces.
That will grow you without your permission.
And so, anyways, I'll leave you with that.
I'll give an amazing day and keeping awesome catch you on the flip side.
16:52
But








0:00
Hey guys, love that.
You're listening to the podcast.
If you ever want to have the video version of this which usually has more effects, more visuals, more graphs, you know, drawn out stuff.
Sometimes it can help hit the brain centers in different ways.
You can check out my YouTube channel, it's absolutely free.
Go check that out, if that's what you are into.
0:16
And if not keep enjoying the show, your employees are not your customers.
All right, your company is always your customer number one because the company balances the priorities of everyone.
The shareholders, the customers and the employees.
Welcome to the game.
Where we Talk about how to get more customers, how to make more per customer and how to keep them longer in the many failures and lessons.
0:34
We have learned along the way.
I hope you enjoy and subscribe.
What's going on everyone?
I wanted to I'll probably make a couple of podcasts about my day yesterday but it was our quarterly meet up for our leadership and there was kind of you know there's a few kind of I don't know if they teaching moments but moments where I was kind of able to transfer some of my you know more updated beliefs about how a company should run that they were like man I wish we'd record this like that him You could podcast.
1:00
And so I want to try and do my best and kind of cover, some of those points with you here.
So you can almost be like a fly on the wall and some of those meetings.
And so the first one was about the role of HR.
Now, before all of the entrepreneurs were listening to this, you know, have their eyes glaze over.
1:18
This is probably the first podcast I've ever made about, you know, HR and Human Resources.
But I think it's incredibly important and it's not just about If you have an HR department, so for many of you might only have a handful of employees or you are a manager at a company.
1:36
So if you know, entrepreneurs, if you have a manager or series of managers or leaders in the company, I think for them to understand what the role of human resources and investing in employees.
Looks like I think would be valuable so I'm going to start with a story of HR gone wrong and then kind of go from there and kind of dissect it is like a little mini case study or to the best of my Building.
2:00
And so to expound upon the many lessons and failures that I have had in running the business.
A few year or two ago, we had an HR director and they, I'll just tell you what happened.
2:20
So, she had taken upon herself because she didn't have enough work.
I know this, but she doesn't know those.
It was cause she didn't have enough work and she had over hired.
She had six people in her Department.
Six people in h.r.
Can you imagine six?
2:35
We are 100% company.
Like, six people.
Like it's just so many people.
So, she had a lot of people and no one had any work to do, and so she took it upon herself to do a salary analysis, which is basically a study of how much everyone in the company, you know, quote should be getting paid based on, you know, the role, their experience with the markets playing and where they live, right?
3:00
And this took like, 90 days for her to do this for every single person in the company.
And so she used up, you know, a lot of company, resources, three, four, five employees, Etc, Um for this period of time to do the study and the results of the study was that she had determined that, you know, I don't know, 20% or 25% of the company was being, you know, overpaid and then 20 or 25% the company was being underpaid and then about 50%.
3:25
The company was being paid, you know appropriately.
And so the conclusion that she came to was, well, I'm going to email everyone.
And just say if, you know, if they were being overpaid, they were going to stay there because you're not going to give people, you know, take Cuts.
If they're adequately paid.
3:41
They'll stay where they're at and if someone's being underpaid will email them and say hey you just gotta race congratulations.
Right.
And so this may have been the single stupidest thing I've ever seen someone do in my entire life but that was the decision that was made.
4:00
And so this was reported to me at a at a what you call it a At our quarterly and this was actually her accomplishment for the quarter.
And I just I just remember just being so so bewildered befuddled dumbfounded by the fact that this person the human being had thought that this was a good use of company resources and so I'm going to break down the many reasons why this is not a good idea or this was a terrible thing and then kind of outline what I believe the Ideal role of HR is in a company.
4:38
So the reason this was terrible was that.
So she literally used company resources, probably 100,000 hours of payroll resources to create this solution that then just paid out more money from the company, which is just my wallet.
4:56
It's just my bank account, right?
And just paid out more money for no reason.
And did it in a way that anybody who got paid more had no explanation for Or why they were getting paid more and providing a value, so she literally wasted money doing it.
Wasted money for that point going forward in the company because after someone gets an email, I could just be like, oh, by the way, she was wrong.
5:15
Sorry about that.
And then we're just gonna get, keep you back where you were.
And so, I think the whole thing probably cost me like six hundred thousand dollars in profit, right?
Like I mean like more than Chu is going to get paid for years, right?
And it just seemed like just a small thing.
5:30
Like I it's just the company, right?
And so this is where, you know?
If you're a manager in a bigger company, are you?
For, you know, if you report directly to the CEO, the owner, you have to understand this, right?
And so yesterday at our quarterly, our current HR director that drink do drugs is not with us anymore, was bringing up her shoes kind of giving her position on what she believed her value to the company was and and I ended up kind of giving a talk about this in general and this.
6:02
So this is for my current HR Director of this is not about our Ation or anything like that, but this is just in general for everyone.
So I wrote some notes down because I think it was really important and so one of the things that I hear a lot is, my role is to make employees happy.
6:19
Alright, so I'm going to just hit it piece by piece.
Your job is not to make employees happy as an owner.
Your job is not to be completely happy as a manager.
Your job is not to make employees happy as an HR Director.
Your job is not to make employees.
Happy employees job is to make employees.
6:36
Human beings are responsible for make themselves.
Happy, there are people in Auschwitz who wrote books about how they were happy and there are people in America living in the top.
One percent of earners of the whole world who are miserable and depressed.
All right, your job is not to make people.
6:52
Happy people will choose to be happy based on their own beliefs about their circumstances and what their thoughts are independent from the actual things that are happening to them.
So first off it is not your responsibility.
It Is your responsibility to try and find people who are going to have a positive inclination who are going to fit in with the culture.
7:11
So that we can keep an atmosphere that does retain and attract Talent which is the next thing to get to, but your job is not to make people happy.
Alright.
Number two, one of the things I heard is that employees are my customer right.
7:27
If you are a manager or your HR Director like, well really, you know everyone who works here is my customer incorrect that is not who your Summer, is your customer is the company, alright?
And now, I'm going to be clear about this.
The company has three stakeholders, you've got shareholders, the people who own the company, you've got customers, the people who pay the company, and then you've got employees, the people who run the company, all three stakeholders have to be considered.
7:53
Now, the reason this is an important tool.
Any ation is that if you have an HR director who is like employees first, then you have the type of stupid stupid Decision that I just discussed in the very beginning which is literally just paying out profit for no value.
8:13
All right?
And this is an important point that I need to cover which kind of leads naturally to the next thing is that in order for a company to grow, it has to have profit in order for it to weather storms that it does not see that are going to come in the future, it needs to have profit to be able to reinvest in new product.
8:35
Lines in legal defense in whatever could possibly happen.
And when you just choose to buy things for no value, which is essentially what it is.
When you just overpay, then you put your company in a bad position.
So let me explain.
So an investor looks at any kind of asset and IT company the assets of the company are the humans right are the Earth at its human capital.
8:58
It's the actual value that you get from people, especially if you're in a service business, right?
And so you have the value is You get and price is what you pay right in the goal.
I want to be very transparent about this of the company is to pay as little as possible for as the highest amount of value and that may make people uncomfortable, but the point of all businesses is to give to get as much pride.
9:25
They won't have as big of a discrepancy as possible.
So if I'm an investor and I'm buying stocks, I want to buy the most valuable company that I can for the least amount of money, right?
It's a price to value.
Rappin see right in the bigger that discrepancy, the better it is.
Now if it's the reverse you're paying more for Less value.
That is a bad deal.
9:41
It doesn't matter what you're paying.
It's a bad deal.
All right.
And so the reason that that first HR Director made such a terrible decision was because she literally just chose to take it.
Literally take our good deals and just say hey we're going to make bad deals now and all of our bad deals, we're going to keep as bad deals, right?
9:57
It just it just it just it just it made no sense whatsoever.
And so That's that is what we're like that is the goal here, right?
And Finally, when I was talking to our HR Director about this, she pushed back on this, she was not let, sorry not her, but like you might have you might have an HR Director, you might have a major my pushback on this idea.
10:22
And so I just want and the two different, two different scenarios came up that we were walking through and one of them is well, you know, you as the entrepreneur, you know, you always value the marketing, the sales, more than the rest of the company, and I could see that there was, you know, some being at odds with that, right?
10:42
Like, I don't know if I agree with that and I want to be a hundred percent.
Clear, I do value Marketing sales and product, more than operations.
Here's why?
Not that long ago.
There was a period of time where I had mentors who were like you need to put operations first, right?
11:01
This is part of scaling, you have to delegate blah blah.
And so there was a period of time where I put operations on a pedestal and was like, no guys.
We need to just do it operations wants us to do and to be clear for definition operations is everything that is non-core to the value of the company.
All right.
That is ITT, that is HR, that is finance, that's legal, all of those comprised operations.
11:25
All right.
And to be clear about what that means is, it's everything that must happen to keep the company running, but is not a core value driver for top-line revenue, or for customers.
All right?
And so marketing, brings Revenue in product delivers value.
11:40
That is being exchanged for money.
That's fundamentally.
What a company does.
It's got stuff and it sells it, right?
And as long as you're delivering the stuff or your, where your you're selling the stuff that is being delivered, those are core values of the company.
Anything else absolutely must happen.
11:57
But in general, they're not the main value drivers.
Now, that being said, there are ways that those other, those other components can provide value in directly.
And that's what I'm going to cover in this because I think, being an HR Director or being a manager in a company and being in one of those roles, if you're clear on that, you will be more valuable to your owner.
12:15
And if you're interviewing for a position and you talk the way that I'm telling you right now to talk to an owner, you will probably get the job and probably stay there because they will know that you understand.
What you're talking about.
So, the example she said, well, you know, I feel like you care more about, you know, sales and marketing.
12:33
And I said, yes, I do.
And here's why.
And by the way, when I did that operational thing and operations first, the company started going down and we started making less money.
And it was painful and horrible, and I had to basically jump back in to be like, I'm so sorry about that.
That was not a good idea.
12:48
We are keeping the value.
We provide and marketing and sales primary and operations is secondary.
E to that, it is a supporting role.
So if sales says, hey, we need contracts, you know, to be changed because this is the new offer or whatever.
13:04
Then operations has to say, all right, we're going to go figure that out, right?
And that is the point.
The point is that operation should support and always enable sales marketing and product, alright?
So she said, well, I feel like, you know, you value, you know, like a star salesman more than you value, like a front line.
13:25
Because We're service person and so she's like, you know, there was a there was a decision.
That, you know, this is this is come up, you know, zillion times over the years.
It's like, you know, I think you value these positions more and I always have to unequivocally say I do Yes.
13:41
Because people people like and I feel like this is I don't know state employee thing or it's just like they think it feel like it's like a bad word for me to be like no, no, no.
I do care about more about Marketing.
Sales product, period period.
Because they are the major drivers of value in the company.
13:58
All right.
And so for example if you had a chat Holmes wrote about this in his book, if you have a superstar salesperson, this is what I was talking about to the whole company is like, if you have a superstar sales person and that person, you know, is being paid, quote above market, right above market value, there's two ways of seeing market value.
14:19
There's market value, which is like, what is the rest of the market paying for this, right.
And then, what am I getting?
Being in return for this specific person.
So for it, like if you have an All-Star sales person, like you may have gone through 20 sales, people to find an All-Star salesperson for your specific company in your specific product, right?
14:36
Because there are some sales people who excel in let's say B to C transactional sales, all right.
And there's some who excel in, you know, a longer style B2B, consultative sales.
And there are some sales people who excel in account management and kind of upselling and kind of like the farming and continuing to grow an account.
14:55
Those are all sales.
They're just different and so I could find a salesperson right.
But that person might not perfectly fit my company and I might not yield the same outcome.
A Mo's an Asian quick break, just to let you know that we've been starting to post on LinkedIn and want to connect with you.
15:12
All right, so send me a connection request.
A note.
Let him know that you listen to the show and I will accept it.
There's anyone you think that would be should be connected with tag them in one of my or Layla's posts?
And I will give you all the love in the world.
All right, so let's get back to the show.
And so, if I have, for example, somebody who's selling really well and sells three times, you know, sells more than three times, you know, it would take me two or three normal quote, normal sales people to replace their production and this is common in most companies.
15:42
Most people have multiple sales people.
There's one person to oh, you know, one or two people always like lead the pack disproportionately, right?
And that that person right.
If and in many conversations this is one of them is like well if that person came up to you for example and said, well I want a 20 percent, pay raise, or a 10% pay raise just like I disagree with that.
16:04
And I was like, I think that's stupid that you disagree with that.
I was like make the economic argument if we lose that person and then we lose half of our sales.
How can you tell me that was not worth 10% more on their base salary?
So glad not about like that was like right, you need to think like an owner, right?
16:20
You gotta think like an owner.
What am I losing here?
Right into the same degree, the the corollary to that is like, well I feel like you don't value customer service is much like what if we had amazing customer service role?
This is kind of like the counter example, right?
Like well I feel, I feel like you're willing to, you know, pay these people more than you're willing to pay these people.
16:36
And it's like, yes I am because they provide more value, and I was like, okay, I hear where you're coming from.
What if this person doesn't amazing job in customer service?
I was like I get it.
So let's say this.
Person disappears tomorrow.
How much less are we going to make?
So probably not a lot it's like right and so if you wanted to you know come to me with a you know customer service person and say this person you know saves X percent of people per month and that results in this much money and the aggregate of adding a dollar per our example to.
17:09
This person's role, still doesn't compare to what everyone else on the team is saving.
Which would be like what I would consider market, right?
Like if I just brought some in whose average in this person is way above average.
Let's say this person saves, you know, 25% of the whole team saves is from this one person.
17:26
Then I'd be like, okay, well, there's a number value to that and, you know, we can incrementally, add a certain amount that would mean it was worth keeping, right?
And I was like, but in this example, we're talking about if this person stopped and just was gone.
17:41
I was like, how much do you think that the company would make less?
She's like it probably wouldn't change the revenue and I was like, right.
And for that reason, that is how market value is established.
And so, for everyone, it's like, this is the real world, alright?
Like, I don't know what the Harvard Business Review.
17:59
You know, says about making happy employees and like all this, you know, whatever who do in the real world you get, you don't get a trophy.
All right?
Not everyone's first not, everyone makes the most amount of money you get paid based on the value that you provide and a A good owner understands that, right?
18:18
And so when we were, you know, we were having these discussions, I think that it was, it was good for our whole company to understand and see, like, that's the point here, like the point is to make a profit.
The point is to pay as little as possible for as much value as possible, right?
18:37
And assess the value of the individual based on what they contribute to the bottom line, right?
And so, you know, to wrap this up, if you were, you know, So for for, for HR in general Human Resources.
So cool.
Then how do I provide value you provide value by one protecting the company at in always all?
18:57
Right?
And the way that you do that is first, when people come to you and say, hey, I want to hire sound so your first answer should probably be no.
Give me a reason why your team is so overworked that they can't just work more right?
Show me your hour-by-hour utilization that you have like, and I'll tell you right now and I've said it in the past.
19:18
A lot of people don't work that hard.
All right?
And a lot of people say that they are overworked because they literally do not understand what work is.
All the time.
I know this for a fact.
There's some of you listening to this right now who spend your entire day not working, trying to work, spend all day.
19:36
Getting fuck all done, because you're in your head and you literally have an inability to focus.
That is not a company's fault.
That is your lack of ability and being disciplined and learning the skills of learning how to work.
Like, you have to get it, just have to have to get things done, you know, and so many people don't get much done.
19:57
Done in their whole day and then say, hey, I need help when it's really like, they aren't actually overworked.
They actually just don't know how to work.
All right, and mind you.
This is not, this is a lesson that I learned because I was younger once and I was started working at a law firm as an intern and I remember a senior partner jokingly said to me, she was like you don't even know what work is yet.
20:20
She's like, you haven't even learned how to work and I was like offended but then I saw how hard these people worked and He's worked there, you know, in hardcover, law firms.
They work their asses off and I was like, huh?
She's probably right, right.
And I started observing the habits of the people work more in how much more they got done.
20:39
So anyways, point is, is that people will come and try and hire for help when there really isn't, it's not necessary.
And so that does not protect the company.
It also doesn't protect the employees because if the companies that risk everyone's at risk, right?
So you have to put the company first, right?
And so that's thinking like an owner, so that's Number one.
20:58
Number two is that you have are active in recruiting the best talent, all right?
Because everyone knows that the value of the company is going to be based on the value of the people, the who not the what, right a good, who will figure out the what.
And so, really good.
HR is really good recruitment its Talent, right?
21:16
It's finding the talent.
Developing the talent retaining the talent.
Now, obviously not all.
That's going to fall under HR, right?
Recruiting.
Absolutely right.
You know, developing is going to be more underneath of the Departments and retaining is Going to be a function of, really the department heads and then the compensation package is right, but the thing is that I want to be clear here.
21:37
If you and this is, I'm going to wrap this back in the original story.
When, you know, the HR Director, the former HR Director did this big salary analysis and she said, hey, this is our big success.
We're just paying people more and we got nothing back and values at company, right?
21:55
I was like, Why did we do this?
And that's the hard question that, you know, obviously wasn't able to answer.
I was like, why did you chew did it?
Because she had nothing to do right?
But that's actually why she did it but I was like what what problem are we solving here?
22:14
What was the objective of this?
The answer there was not right.
Because the only reason that you would want to move compensation is for one of two things either you cannot attract Talent OR you cannot retain Talent.
22:33
So what I mean by that is like the only reason to really increase.
Someone's pay.
If they are already working for you is because you value them enough, that replacing them with someone else who has a complex skill set would not the marginal difference.
It should not be like, if the margin difference is huge, right?
22:50
Then you'd be incentivized to retain them, right?
And you as a company in this hypothetical example have a problem retaining employees.
We at Jim launch, do not have that problem.
We have incredibly low attrition, we fire people like crazy but people don't quit and that's because we have a really high performance culture, like people, don't last, you know what I mean?
23:12
Like, it's like sorry low performers.
Don't last, it's I heard this from Greg.
But I really liked it it's like Jim which is a dangerous place to work like if you if you come in and you get on the train like you will learn more from me and us and running a company and learning how to grow things than ever before.
23:28
But you got to perform like this is a Winner's environment and if you are a winner, you will love it here.
And if you are not a winner, you will not.
I mean you won't be here very long, right?
Because the thing is, is when you cut, if you've ever played on a high-performance sports team, your whole life at some point or any kind of team was high performing, those are winning team.
23:45
Usually there's a culture that if someone is new and comes in, they either assimilate or rejected and the stronger that core team is is like this is how we do it, right?
We wake up at 5:00 we go over our scripts we roleplay we do game Dave review from the day before on sales calls, blah, blah, blah, blah, we, you know, etcetera and someone new is like, I'm in.
24:05
That's you guys are waking up early like I'm not really about that life.
Like like the team will be like, dude, get this guy out of here.
Like he's going to take the team down and so Having that culture allows you to spit people out quickly, but it also allows you to retain.
24:20
Now, this is my point earlier, which was why did this HR manager director?
Make this call, right?
And obviously was because she wasn't thinking, right?
But there was no problem that she was trying to solve, which is I was like, this is this was a hard time for her.
24:38
I can imagine because it was in front of the entire company.
As like do we have a problem?
Acting Talent.
It's like no, it's like, okay, so the pay that we are currently offering is, we're having no issue finding talented people to work for these positions at these price points.
24:56
It's like, no, it's like, okay.
Do we have a major problem in attrition?
Are we losing employees left and right.
Two competitors.
Who are paying more offering more?
Our that we got Headhunters picking off our people.
It's like, no.
It's like, then why did you just choose to spend six hundred thousand dollars a year?
25:16
More of bottom-line profit.
Why?
In the answer, she had not right?
And so it's making sure that we understand the why we're doing things, right?
25:32
The point of the company is to buy value at the lowest possible price, that is the point.
I don't care what anyone else says.
That is the point, all right?
You're going to try and pay for the value as little as you can, because that discrepancy is where the profit is, right?
Just being real.
That's where the profit is.
25:48
You need to have a discrepancy in order to have a profit so that the company can continue to run, right?
That's what it is.
And so anywho, I share the story the beginning because that is, you know, one of a zillion failures, you know, in lessons that I've learned along the way in this in this game.
26:07
And, you know, if you have a store employee, I think a lot of times it is worth paying them more to keep them because you get, like, everyone knows if you have a star employee, they're usually worth like three or four employees.
Five employees in output.
Right?
I'm probably worth a lot of Louise and output in terms of top-line Revenue, this business so I could disproportionately paid.
26:28
Is it fair?
I think.
Yes, it is fair.
I think you should always be compensated based on the value.
They provide.
I think that's the ultimate fairness.
I don't think it's like, oh he's a human, I'm human.
We should get paid the same thing.
That doesn't make sense to me.
All right, so I want to make sure I hit all my points.
26:44
Make employees happy is not your problem.
It is their problem.
It is their responsibility.
Now, you can equip them with tools and skills about mindset and whatnot, but like, ultimately the accountability of who needs to be, who happy you need to make yourself happy.
A job is not supposed to make you happy because there are people who are endlessly.
27:00
Happy in quote, terrible jobs in there.
People who have amazing jobs and kill themselves, so, it has nothing to do with you.
Number one, number two, your They're not your customers.
All right, your company is always your customer number one because the company balances the priorities of everyone.
The shareholders, the customers, and the employees.
27:17
All right, I'm a quote middleman between the employees and ownership.
That is not true.
You protect the company.
All right, these are false beliefs, these are not true, all right?
You know, undervaluing people who were not value, you know, Top Line value providing right, they're not delivering.
27:38
Whirring on on the value that we're selling or selling the value, right?
That's there's a fundamentally.
What a company does we sell value?
And then we deliver on the promise.
That's it, right?
And if you're not in one of those core things, unless you can make an argument for how you were directly, Providing value, then you will probably get paid less and that's okay.
27:59
And that's okay, right?
Fundamentally thinking about all employees as units of value, and describing a price to them, right?
Which is what you pay them.
And trying to always understand that you're always going to try and pay as little as you can, for the most amount of value, right?
28:17
That is and that's okay.
That's that, that's okay.
That's the point, right?
The only reason that you would pay more is, if you have trouble attracting or retaining people, if you're not having any issues or attracting and retaining people, then you're paying fine, right?
Like, you don't need to change the cop.
28:37
And so finally that is what I will lead you with our and you leave you with in this role of HR and my many many lessons along the way.
I hope you enjoyed this and click subscribe and all of that good stuff, but I have I have some passion with this because it's I've made these mistakes so many times and I've seen these mistakes made on my behalf.
28:59
And so if you are a manager, if you're an HR Director, take this to Heart.
Art, you work for the company.
The company is your only customer and your responsibility is to protect the company just like everyone.
Else's responsibility is to protect the company and if you can think like that, you will think like an owner and you will move up in your company.
29:22
If you live in a la la land of I'm supposed to just by bean bags and have, you know, and and keep employees.
Happy one.
You're going to waste money to you're not going.
You know what actually provides value to business and three if you're in a different company little what may happen if you don't have like a candid owner or whatever he wants to like, talk real with you don't just kind of like put you in a corner, right?
29:46
And then just be like, oh yeah, you bet, yeah.
Go do that little initiative.
But they won't actually see you as valuable because it means because you don't get the game, like you don't get it.
You have to understand it.
And then People like you'll get into the in circle.
30:05
I'm trying to say this the right way.
You've probably.
Had people in your life where you've got, you've got your friends, right?
And you're like, she gets it or he gets it, right?
You talk to your friends like nah.
She gets it right?
30:20
She gets how this how we see the world, right?
The thing is that most business owners see the world, the same way and that's why they are the owners of the business and that's why they started the business.
And that is probably the business has grown.
And so, it is in your best interest to align with the company overall, because a good owner, Put the company first not themselves because ultimately, they the company feeds them.
30:45
The company is the goose.
The company is, the is the is the is the Beast that feeds everyone.
It is the thing that plows the field, it is the mule that everyone is fed off of and so we have to keep the mule healthy and that is by having the discrepancies and making the hard conversations to making the hard calls and being real with you, which is what I'm hopefully trying to do right now which is that is the point.
31:05
All right, so anywho I hope that was value before you hope the Since hopefully, you don't have to pay them any lessons and failures that I have.
And if you have an HR Manager, or a manager who, you know, hires and argues for compensation, things like that.
So in this to him, I think it's valuable.
31:23
So anyways, lots of love to you soon.
Since hopefully, you don't have to pay them any lessons and failures that I have.
And if you have an HR Manager, or a manager who, you know, hires and argues for compensation, things like that.
So in this to him, I think it's valuable.
So anyways, lots of love to you soon.








0:00
Hey guys, real quick.
So Leyland are definitely working on our social media presence.
If you guys haven't noticed and we're just breaking now into LinkedIn.
All right.
It's not as bad as I thought it's actually pretty awesome so far and you guys have been really cool in there and people are sharing our stuff a lot.
So if we aren't connected on LinkedIn, it go ahead and let's connect and let's rock and roll.
0:17
I think that expectations are literally.
The thing that will destroy your life or will make your life.
Welcome to the game where we talk about how to get more customers, how to make more per customer and how to keep them longer in the many failures and lessons.
We have learned along the way.
Way.
I hope you enjoy and subscribe.
What's going on, everyone?
0:34
I hope you're having a phenomenal weekend restful time.
This podcast is dedicated to all of the younger entrepreneurs out there.
So this is a little departure from the normal business owner, but I think that you'll still find Value in it.
If you know, any younger entrepreneurs are, you have you know, teenagers, or kids or, you know, college, you know, college aged people /, maybe even people in their 20s 30s, right?
0:55
We're getting into business and so maybe you left your job and you're getting into business now, whatever, right?
This would apply Apply to you and it's regarding expectations.
And I think that expectations are literally, the thing that will destroy your life or will make your life and many of us, I think many people in general, have figured out in many world religions, have figured this out which is, you know, the secrets of happiness is Halves over once which is let's say you have a you know, have one thing and you want nothing, you will be infinitely.
1:31
Happy.
The problem is where you might have a million things, but you want to million things and you will not be happy, right?
And so, you can simply change how happy you are by expecting less.
And so one of the things that I specifically wanted to address today was the expectations around education and the reason this is a really meaningful topic for me is that I think I've talked you about my neighbor and watching him go through the the crazy expectations that he has.
1:58
As a young person has been really valuable for me, because I've also seen a lot of those characteristics that he has in myself just add zeros to it, but it's still fundamentally the same thing and that's what's been.
It's been meaningful for me.
And so anyways, I have tried to frame things.
2:17
So if you are trying to learn things, which is going to be the first step to any kind of entrepreneurial Endeavor is, I like to liken everything to a bridge because I didn't think it's a simple visual.
So imagine where you are on one side of, you know, this, this Valley right is where you are and where you want to go is on the other side of this big valley, right?
2:37
And you have a bridge that goes across the two sides.
Now, the problem is is that people will buy things, they will buy.
Says they will by mentorship.
So, by workshops by Seminars the by events, they'll buy whatever right in an effort on some level to get over this bridge, right of where they are to where they want to go, and it could be from zero to a hundred thousand dollars a year.
2:58
It could be from a million dollars a month to two million dollars a month.
It could be from a hundred million dollars a year to a billion dollars a year, whatever it is.
There's a bridge, right?
And along that bridge are bricks and I like to liken each skill as a brick on the way.
3:15
Way to where you're trying to go.
And the problem with the expectations of somebody who's trying to learn a skill or achieve, a goal is that they have a binary outcome.
I either achieved it or I did not I either am making a hundred thousand dollars or I am not.
And the problem is, it can be incredibly frustrating because if you have a binary outcome, then it's very easy to get a 0 out of 1, right where the reality is.
3:42
Most things are exists on a Continuum.
And so this The difference between a psychological binary and a and the biological Continuum, which is, I'll give you a couple of examples.
So it's not.
Are you diabetic or you're not diabetic?
It's how diabetic are you, right?
3:59
It's not.
Are you smart, are you dumb?
But it's how smart are you, right?
And so, we like to psychologically bucket things into.
Yes knows, because it's simpler for us, but it misses actual reality, right?
And this can be especially dangerous as we're trying to acquire new skills.
4:15
And so the reason I like in this and I think it's so dangerous in education because that's what we're doing right?
If we're trying to educate ourselves, trying to acquire skills is that we think is we're trying to get across this bridge.
That let's say you buy a course on copywriting, right?
And so, you're on one side of the bridge, you buy a course on copywriting and then you still aren't a millionaire, wow?
4:35
Right.
The problem is, you may have put another brick on your Bridge.
You may be closer to where you were to getting to the other side of the bridge.
Just haven't achieved yet.
And so this is one of the issues that I also see just in general.
4:51
Like it's so funny because in the, in the in the I'll say, quote, Guru world.
You know, people will take on a coach that coach will move them forward, you know, to a certain degree.
And then they'll take another coach and that coach, from of them, for just certain degree and so forth and so on.
And then the thing is is that they're like, I'm working with someone.
5:07
So I used to work with that person, they suck, right?
But the problem and I used to do this, right?
Like in this is why I think it's so ridiculous.
Is that like if you were looking NG at your schooling, right?
And you had a had a third grade math teacher, and then later you had a calculus teacher, you wouldn't be like screw that third grade, you know, Cal math teacher, the stuff that I've learned from this guy so much, you know, more advanced whatever, right.
5:30
And I've had a lot of our clients say that about their franchises that they work with and things like that and I just it drives me nuts because it's, it's stupid, you know, it's for lack of it's stupid because a lot of times you need you need step one to get to To write and you don't have to compete.
5:48
It's because people have psychological issues but like they can't, they can't say I've learned from all of these people, right?
And it doesn't it doesn't decrease your status to say.
I've learned from many teachers, look at all the richest people in the world.
They say, like I've had multiple mentors.
I've had so many people help me out over the years and I think if you can shift that perspective, it will be incredibly valuable for you.
6:06
But one of the other things that's so poisonous about, especially in the Like, the quote, make money world is that if we, if everyone in the world viewed College, because I think About this a lot.
I'm like why is it that people will spend two hundred thousand dollars for years?
Their lives study, you know, Aztec literature of the 1700s and get to the end and not in any way.
6:27
Be upset about the fact that they're not making money.
When they graduated, they can't even get a job.
Like, why is that?
And the only reason that I can come up with is that they didn't expect to write and so that's it.
Like, that's the difference is that people come in and part of that is because the marketing messaging Sales and all that kind of stuff.
6:46
So don't be wrong.
Like the reason that, you know, the big academic Powerhouse has been able to stay there will one is because they got the government to get on board and give away free money.
So that's obviously one part of it.
But the other part of it is that when people are coming in, they expect nothing like nothing.
Literally, they're not expecting anything expect to get a check mark next to.
7:04
The name is says you have a diploma, congratulations?
Right.
And so if my my my request of everyone and I've requested this of myself is that That when I go into trying to learn something that I do not have, give myself a binary outcome of did this worker to do, not the work, but instead give myself the question.
7:26
Am I closer or further away from my goal?
And I think that has been tremendously helpful, I have I've spent I mean recently, I spent fifty thousand dollars on I think eight hours with someone who is different than the the the Grant Cardone one that I did.
That's that was four hours for 120,000 if you're curious and Really.
7:46
I got enough value in the first hour that I was like, I don't know what I'm gonna do with the next three calls with Grant.
It was really good but the point is, you know, with the other one that I did it was actually to have assistance on a higher level project that I was working on and about halfway through.
I realized that it was not a priority for me.
8:03
And so I could either say this got me, you know, I'm not gonna be like, hey, screw this guy right or anything like that.
It was just for me.
If I can get the perspective, that something is not a priority that is valuable in and of itself.
And so is that take me closer or further tomorrow?
Ultimate goal closer.
Most Nation real quick.
8:21
If you are a business owner that has a big old business and wants to get to a much bigger business, going to 50 $100.
Plus, we would love to talk to you and if you like that or like to hear more about it, go to acquisition.com, you can play anywhere on the page and talk to one of our team and see if we can help you get there.
8:40
I would I be satisfied and so shifting our education expectations to is this another brick on the bridge to where I'm trying to go or instead of excuse me, instead of.
Am I at my destination or not?
8:57
And I think that this is probably one of the biggest things that you can do or like that.
That's it's it's been useful for me and this is what I've tried to shift my neighbor's perspective for himself on which is it's kind of a lineman That kind of investor mindset which is if I were to look over a five-year time Horizon and I were to continue to acquire skills like this.
9:17
When I put more and more bricks on my bridge by the end of that period, what I be better or worse off and likely to be better, but you will be worse off if you keep trying to build a new bridge, right?
And that's why you when you jump from opportunity to opportunity on a time, you can never get to where you're trying to go because you take two steps of progress and say, oh, I'm not there.
9:34
Binary outcome.
Therefore, I will start something else and it's only after failing.
Three, four, five, six things that are On the 7th thing, you had enough acquired skills from your first six failures that you are actually able to make it all the way across the bridge.
And that's what's kind of interesting about this is that like, there are plenty of people who, you know, have come to us and immediately start making a lot of money, right?
9:55
And then they, and then they're like, oh my God, Jim Lunch is awesome.
And the thing is that like, we don't honestly deserve all the credit because You probably like, some of these people may have gone through three four, five courses that they believe failed them.
When in reality, there may be 38 skill sets than they need to create their business.
10:14
You know, core skills, and they may have acquired 24 of them from other people, and we just happen to be able to get them the last 14 that gets them all the way across, but because they have a binary outcome expectation.
They then attribute all the credit to us and I don't think that's fair, you know, to themselves in terms of their mental space.
10:34
Also everyone else that they've worked with, right?
And so I think thinking about it, this way has been really helpful and especially in this is again I mentioned the franchisor one earlier, but I'm gonna say it again.
I can't tell you the amount of facility specifically that worked with a franchisor and then said you know started working with us started making more money and we're like I hate my franchisor, you got, you know, like screw them, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
10:55
But the reality is that many times.
They wouldn't have even survives long enough without the fundamental bricks that have been laid by the sighs or with their business model.
There's so many fundamentals that they may not even been aware of and mistakes that they would have made that were avoided because the franchisor got them 70% of the way across the bridge, right?
11:15
And we just got them the last 30, right?
And so another perspective on this as well, is that, let's say you've got two people who all have poo.
Both have all 38 bricks on this bridge right on the path of your opportunity vehicle.
You're trying to pursue to get to the other side right now, let's say both of them have all three. 30:38 bricks, but with your learning style and their teaching style, you're only able to Accurate or you know, absorb 25 of the first guys, right?
11:46
It's kind of the same thing, right?
It's like, for some reason.
I, you know, I may be the first what you worked with Tatiana, somebody like, you didn't absorber wasn't real for you, and then later on in your life, it was able to be real for you and then you tribute your success to the second person.
12:02
When in reality, the first person, You along the way.
And so this is just been really valuable for me from a shift in perspective in My overall happiness, but also just in thinking about outcomes.
And what what what do I believe is reasonable and I think I've been, I've been asking myself this question, much more frequently which is do.
12:22
I believe my expectations are reasonable and is there a way that I can lower them?
And there's there's difference between lowering your expectations of the performance, you want to people, I believe you should be absolutely intolerable.
And if people do not want to be more class at something, or you should be intolerant of any lack of effort, but if you can maintain absolute intolerance to anything but Excellence, but then also decrease your expectations of the outcome, then that is going to be a winning formula.
12:50
So increased expectations on activity and actions, decrease expectations on outcomes and I think that that is a formula for business success.
Just as halves over wants is a A formula for happiness in life.
13:06
And so anyways, I figured I would share that with you just quick, quick recap of takeaways.
Try not to think about things or at least for me this has been valuable.
I have shifted to going from binary.
Is this good?
Is this bad to how good is it?
And instead of thinking this is what needs to happen is is a first is that a reasonable expectation and be, can I lower it and B and C can I raise my expectations of the activities that I would be willing to twit take to make my very low expectation.
13:34
Believably reasonable to achieve that.
I should hopefully surpass it.
And so I think when we go into a expectations, around education, and skill acquisition and thinking about things on the Continuum of Mi closer or further, from my goal, as a result of this decision, many times, we will think much more favorably about our experience and be significantly.
13:56
Less frustrated with what might be perceived as a momentary, quote, setback, which isn't even a setback.
It's only a Backpack because we think it is rather than I am 22 of my 38 steps along the way.
And I just need to continue to identify, which are the bricks that I am missing to get me to my goal, which is ultimately the role, which is why so many, you know, billionaires, Etc.
14:18
Talk about having good mentors, because they can look at your skill set.
They can look at your bridge and say, this is what's missing.
This is what you need.
And the thing is is that when it's sometimes that last brick, it's that one thing that you need that you didn't see and then all of a sudden you treat all your success that person when in reality it was because you spent four years Years building, the other bricks.
14:35
So anyways, hope that was all before you hope that made sense, keeping awesome and having a happy and productive life.
All right.
Let's love say real.
Bye.








0:00
Real quick.
Because you guys already know that, I don't run any ads on this and I don't sell anything.
And so, the only ask that I can ever have you guys that you help me spread the word so we can have more entrepreneurs, make more money, feed their families, make better products, and have better experiences for their employees and customers.
And the only way we do that is if you can rate and review and share this podcast, so the single thing that I have to do is you can just leave review will take you 10 seconds or one type of the thumb, mean, the absolute world to me.
0:25
And more importantly, it may change the world of someone else.
I started getting one-on-one coaching.
NG with Grant Cardone.
And if you're curious thirty thousand, dollars an hour, welcome to the game, where we talk about, how to get more customers, how to make more per customer and how to keep them longer in the many failures and lessons.
We have learned along the way.
0:41
I hope you enjoy and subscribe.
I had a ton of DMS and and questions about a post a video share on Instagram, which is that I started getting one-on-one coaching with Grant Cardone and if you're curious, It's thirty thousand dollars an hour and so I bought four hours so I'll do one hour probably every quarter or so and I just want to share the things that I'm learning with you, so take it for what it is.
1:05
It many.
Many of the things may be your only relevant to me but I'm just going to share what I am learning.
All right, so hopefully you're cool with that.
So the first thing is that the overarching questions that I've gotten from people are you know, Why, you know, why would you pay that much?
It's so expensive expensive etcetera, right?
1:21
And so, one of things that I've learned over time is like, when you in the beginning, right?
You're really just need to acquire skills and skills.
You can learn from courses, you can learn from books, you can learn from seminars you learn from workshops.
But the best way to do it is to in my opinion pay someone more than you normally would who has the skill to teach you.
One on one I have I have gotten almost every every skill that I've acquired, I've spent money to acquire at a faster rate than learning on my own.
1:46
So I've I mean, I just can't even tell you the amount of money that I spent on coaching information and it's because information is the only thing that allows you to buy time back, right?
Like if instead of me taking five years to learn a skill, I can learn it in five weeks and I have to pay to do that, but then I'm going to have the benefit of having that skill for four years and you know, 50 or 40, whatever seven weeks, right?
2:08
So I'm going to have this huge Advantage for a four and a half plus years where the other person wouldn't.
And if you start doing that again, and again you start stacking those advantages and then you get such disproportionate returns.
Rest of your time that you more than make it back.
And I can't even tell you the best Roi of out on anything of any investment is investing in skills, right?
2:27
So anyways, once you have the skills, then you need really the character traits, right?
And those are things that like when you have to do kind of sets off work of not being, you know, not hating yourself and all the other things.
I won't get into that because another time for another another video, but the next piece is going to be the beliefs, right?
2:46
And these are some of the hardest ones.
Has to to recognize because it's hard to recognize the things in yourself because you already believe them, right?
So one of my favorite quotes is in both of the books that I've written, is that we questioned all of our beliefs except for those that we truly believe and those we never think to question and that's been one of the, one of the biggest, you know, biggest blocks for me because it's so hard.
3:12
You can't, you can't look at yourself and know what you believe that is incorrect because you believe it already, right?
Especially if you truly believe, It.
And so having someone from the outside, who's significantly above you or further along in their career, help is just is invaluable, right?
3:27
And so for the first hour that I spent with Grant, he picked out a handful of things that were valuable for me.
And so I told him that, the three main objectives that I had from our conversation, suppose one was a wealth strategy, to was an income strategy and then three what to do about Fame.
3:46
And and kind of like Personal brand because those are the three things that I think he's he's done really well with.
And so the first thing that he identified, when we were talking about these three things was you needed to deal with your wealth first.
And so you know my wife and I have accumulated a lot of money over the last you know, three or four years you know multiple a figures after taxes that we kind of have stockpiled, right?
4:07
And we've probably put, I'm just being transferred with you guys.
I've put about half of that into equities.
So basically meaning stocks I buy indexes, so because Of the most stable, like I take a lot of risk in my normal business, right?
Like every day where entrepreneurs we take risks.
4:23
And so for me, I'm actually very risk-averse when it comes to my investing.
Like I would just want stable returns, I don't want crazy, you know, doublings which is why I don't like invest in Bitcoin and things like that because I think they're speculative and that's another thing I talked about in a different video.
I've nothing wrong nothing against it.
4:39
I think there will be a crypto that'll that'll that'll win out.
It's just I don't mind.
The downside risk of going down to zero, is not something I'm willing to accept.
So anyways, I so pack my stuff is inequities and the other half of my net worth is it in?
Well not net worth but of my cash is just sitting there more or less and so I'm I'm right now, I'm head deep into whole value life, insurance single family, homes, multifamily, and then commercial, which is big apartment buildings, and looking at the different Vehicles there and seeing you know, which one is best.
5:12
And so, his recommendation to me was by one gigantic building And then don't worry about it.
So, basically, he's like, put all your eggs in one basket, pick it really well because then everything is going to be Consolidated and then you can get your attention back.
5:28
And so one of the biggest belief things that he gave me was that until I figure out my wealth strategy, I'm going to have so much attention on that that I won't be able to.
I'm gonna have so much.
I won't it literally becomes a problem, a burden in and of itself and and I can feel it is that I don't have the same drive to make just stack tons and tons of cash because Is now the more cash you keep making the more becomes a, my God, I have to solve this problem, right?
5:52
And so this was something he identified when we were talking.
We said you need to solve this first and so that is what I'm prioritizing right now is what to do with all this money, right, and allocating it.
And I'll share with you guys, whenever you know what, we decide to do, as we do it, but it's, I'm going to be putting half my stuff in hard assets and half of it at equities and between the hard assets, I'll probably Be diversifying.
6:18
And the reason I'm diversifying is because I don't know, very candidly, like I don't know, it's not my game, right?
I'm an income guy.
Like I know how to make tons of money but the wealth game is not a game that I know.
And so then it's the opportunity cost of should I start at zero for learning the wealth game?
6:38
Or should I take all of that time that I would invest in learning the wealth game and just reinvest that in generating more income?
And for me right now, I'm already At the disproportionate level of return on the information and skills that I have an income generation that in my opinion, it makes more sense for me to continue to generate cash flow and provide value to the marketplace and then find someone else who's a partner?
7:01
Who's who's done the same amount of work in that space and then negotiate some sort of favorable deal for myself, get a volume discount.
So to say and and put the money in and then get near nearly the same returns as I would with a partner.
And then still be able to generate the cash.
7:18
That's that's my tentative plan right now, I'll probably be doing some degree of single-family and then also some big apartment buildings as well.
And so that's that was the first big portion of our of our conversation was thinking through, you know, the wealth strategy.
7:34
And what I'm going to do I'm going to do partially of what he recommended.
I'm also just going to do other things as well, but the biggest belief part was, you need to deal with your wealth first.
All right?
Now if you don't have wealth and don't worry about it, you should focus on income.
Right.
And so the next priority after that was not dealing with but talking about income generation and in terms of you know what, which which strategies I was curious about what his thoughts were on on brick and mortar business and you know where he thought, you know, the entire Tire space was going and so he was much more in favor.
8:11
Much more bullish on brick-and-mortar businesses being, okay.
And Then than I am.
And so I took that into consideration I was like, okay, he probably has some decent perspective and so I might I might rain back I might taper my my my doomsday views a little bit.
8:31
I think retail is obviously still hammered, but in terms of like brick and mortar Services, I think those would be okay where you actually have to take your body and get your teeth cleaned or get your back cracked or you know, get your hair cut.
Those are things that you usually have to do.
I mean there's at home versions of those, but I think that those businesses Hey guys, real quick.
8:50
If you're new to the podcast, I have a book on Amazon called 100 million-dollar offers that over eight thousand five star reviews.
It has almost a perfect score.
You can get it for 99 cents on Kindle.
The reason I bring it up is that I put over a thousand hours in the writing that book and it's my biggest gift to our community.
So it's my very Shameless way of trying to get you to like me more and ultimately make more dollars to that later on in your business career, I questioned partner with you so that's my give go check it out Amazon and back to the show.
9:19
They'll be okay.
And so he was like, you know, what do you what are you really good at?
And so I told him the skills that I have and he's like well looking at the opportunities within the marketplace I think this is where you'd fit best and he's a huge, huge proponent of lead generation.
9:37
And so that was kind of the second big one is, you know, he he expanded verticals from doing cars right in selling sales, And he said everybody, when he made the switch to going wider was against everyone said, you're not going to make it, you're not going to you know, you're not going to get enough, all that kind of stuff.
9:57
And I'm kind of at that point right now where I'm probably going to open up the verticals that that we serve from a lead generation standpoint because we're just really good at it.
You know what I mean?
Like we're not good at a lot of things but that is something that I believe that we are.
I mean, I hate saying best in the world but like we're we're Premier, we're top bar, we're very good at it.
10:17
And so that is what that was, what his recommendation was, you've done, you know, 100million plus, in a single Niche.
Now, start, expanding those skill sets to other verticals, so that you can go after a bigger market place.
And so, that is likely and these these concepts are big strategic things, right?
10:34
So they're not like, here's here's how you run a Facebook ad, you know, I'm like he doesn't like anything Grant knows how to run a fat cat.
But the point is, is like the reason I'm paying someone who's further along than me is that he's made mistakes.
And I had a couple of other directions and things that I brought up that he said you know what, I wouldn't do that.
10:50
I did this before and this is why it didn't work or this is what I didn't enjoy about this thing.
And those are really valuable for me.
Those were specific to me.
But when we talked about, you know, specifically specifically acquisition or like this is what we're best at for service businesses, he was like the dude you should do that.
11:08
I don't think lead generation is going to go be going anywhere and so that My big nugget was lead generation as a whole and I agree with that are not is not going anywhere, right?
And so it just as a quick tangent on this, you can buy information from people who are doing the same as you or even less than you.
11:29
And I think that's one of the big myths numbers is like I will buy information or get information from anyone I care about the quality of the information, not as much as the source and so like I've paid people People.
I mean, I paid 50 Grand.
You know.
I paid someone recently for coaching around a specific skill, and I'm pretty sure I make a lot more money than that person.
11:49
But the thing is, is like you.
It doesn't matter where I like if they have something that I do not have, I will pay to acquire it.
And so I made a post history on Instagram about this and I just want to share it with you, which is one of the one of the best beliefs that I've been able to take with me is that if there's any human being on this planet that makes any more money than me.
12:08
It means they're better at something than I am.
Fundamentally like they're better at the game in some way than I am.
And so rather than be envious and cast stones and say how they didn't do it, a legit way or whatever, right?
Whatever your your ego says because you feel bad about how you're not as good as them and then so then you try and justify why you're not as good because it makes you feel bad because you're insecure.
12:27
Instead of doing all that just say just identifying the facts this person makes more than me.
There's a game that that rewards value there is some way that they're providing more value to the marketplace than I am, what is it?
And so what it does Is it turns envy and to Intrigue?
12:42
And so I start looking at them and start peeling a peeling back the layers and thinking there's something here that this person has that I do not have, is it that they're in a better monetization structure, is that they have a better opportunity vehicle?
Are they in a better Market than me?
Are they which which absolutely is an advantage, right?
12:58
They had the decision wherewithal to pick a better Market than I did to go after, right?
And so that's a decision, right?
They did something better than me or is it that they're better in acquisition?
Is there other they better at Market, it better.
Branding, they better at sales, are they?
You know, like there's so many different things, you know, are they better at sticking?
13:15
You know, like keeping clients on the back and like what is the thing that they are superior to me at?
And so I would challenge you that if you see anyone who does any any bit better than you identify.
What it is the skill that they have that you do not have and it's helpful to think about this within the context of sequence.
13:34
All right.
So it's like are they better at generating Demand, right?
So that's lead.
Generation lead.
Nurture.
Sales, are they better at converting?
So that's going to be sales.
Are they better at scaling sales?
The sales team are there, are they have a better conversion mechanism so it could be a webinar via cell or a landing page, right.
13:50
I paid I paid tons of money for just recently around copywriting and Via cells because I think messaging is super important and it's something that I wanted to show up within my own skill set.
And then, you know, after that, after you've made the sale, is it, are they making a ton of profit?
14:05
Are they tax-efficient?
They have a better, legal entity strategy.
And so there's all these things you can always learn from people.
Oh and you can also learn from people who make less than you right as long as you can just like swallow your pride.
And I think that there's something to be said for that in some of us and like so many people in the marketing space and all that stuff to try and posture and like, it doesn't serve anyone like you don't get better being envious and you don't get better, not learning like fundamentally.
14:26
Like if someone makes less than me and they are better at something than I am.
I will pay them to learn it, right?
Like I don't get any better by saying well, they make less than me so I'm not going to pay them like Anyways, and so those are my biggest takeaways that I got from Grant in our in our first and our first chat was that first I needed to focus on wealth.
14:48
Second is that I need to descale lead generation to across all verticals.
Go bigger and third.
And lastly, when I was talking about goals I honestly told him I shared a shared with him, some of the goals that I had and in true 10x fashion.
15:06
He was like well how do we get to 100 million a month and that was honestly, I don't think I've ever had anyone genuinely asked me that question in a serious way and it really, it really impacted me.
It was very helpful for me to hear.
It was just helpful for me to hear.
15:23
Someone say that in genuineness, it really got me to thinking about how I would do it.
And so that was probably one of the biggest gifts that I got from the conversation and so that might not be reasonable or fathomable for wherever you're out right now.
But whatever your current goal is, and this is kind of like true 10x fashion but like it's still different when someone's looking at you and I wish I could give you that that gift, you know, I paid for that gift.
15:48
But like if I can look at you in the camera right now or you're listening, like whatever your goal is for 2021 or whatever year it is that you're watching, that's coming up.
What if that like that?
That's your goal.
So, it's obviously more than what you're doing right now.
But if that go were 10 times bigger.
16:06
What, how then would you approach it?
Right.
And I think that if you think about that, when you, when you 10x your goal, you think differently, right?
You're not trying to, you can't work ten times harder, right?
You can't spend 10 times more time working.
So you actually have to solve the problem in a different way than you would otherwise, and I think that's what really opens up, your creativity into solving bigger problems with bigger markets and bigger opportunities.
16:30
So fundamentally, that was my, that was kind of like my recap of my time with him.
I just want you to know that I had a great experience talking to him.
I had a handful of people be like, man, I don't trust that guy.
By the way, like, stop judging people.
You've never met, like, that's my only advice.
16:47
Like just literally, don't judge people.
You've never met and so I see that he is more famous than I am.
I see that he is a better.
While strategy.
I didn't get it asked a ton about his income stuff because I know that right now wealth is kind of his income and so, but like he's better that than I am at these things currently in my life.
17:05
And so, I will try and learn of him and so that is that's my overarching overarching.
Thought there's are my lessons from my first one-on-one coaching session with Grant.
And so I would pose those things to you is do with your wealth.
If you have it, if you don't focus on income think think wider and broader in terms of your income obviously that's that's counter.
17:26
The whole Niche down concept.
I do think you need a niche in the beginning because you need to develop the skills in a less competitive environment.
But once you win your Niche then you can expand And it and that because you should earn the right, you should earn the right of operational skills.
You should learn the right of acquisition skills, earn the right of scale.
17:43
And once you have that scale, then you can scale Beyond it.
And then finally, simply thinking bigger overall and thinking about your goals and what 10 times, like really sit with it, not just like, I'm gonna just put a 10 times bigger number out there.
But like, really, because, if you just ten times what you're doing is like how you're going to reach it is, probably not the way to do it, like think you'll have to think differently about how you get there and I think that that entire process will be valuable for you.
18:07
Otherwise, hope you have an amazing day.
Hope you found this valuable and like, subscribe, all that kind of stuff, and I'll see you in the next.
Bye.

0:53

Well what was great was bad.
What could have been proved etcetera, and Of the habits that some of our team gets in because our sales team is really knowledgeable week on Business Consultants because they really are, I mean, they really are Business Consultants, you know what I mean?
1:09
And that's why sometimes it's harder to find good sales people because they have to have a really high level of understanding.
If you're going to like the higher the level of the business that you're going to be selling the higher level of expertise, the person talking them must have if they have no context, that's why I like low-level transactional sales.
1:24
Like if you're doing be to see, you know, supplement sales over the phone, you really don't need to have any Exquisitely you know knowledgeable rep.
It's more about a very transactional process that's going to be very highly scripted minimal variability, right?
1:40
Whereas if you're talking about a complex business deal, right?
Then you need to have a very good understanding of their business where there's potential opportunities Etc.
Right?
And so sometimes it can be difficult because you may want to switch and this is especially true when it's if you were the owner of the business or your integrally involved in just a couple of sales people You may get into the mode of trying to teach which is one of the biggest a mistakes, but be one of the biggest hard things to not do, there's some good words as a salesperson, right?
2:14
Because if you're trying to close the deal you want to educate the person.
But the reality is that's not they're not going to listen to you until they buy.
And so there's no actual point in quote teaching, but you do want to coach and that's something that I was talking about.
With my team yesterday is the difference between teaching and coaching and so fundamentally.
2:31
There's only three types of statements that you come out of your mouth when you are selling number one and most likely to be coming out is questions, all right.
So if you don't know what types of questions like for us I prefer question based Frameworks for more complex sales.
2:47
And the reason for that is these are the types of questions that we would need to know the answer to in order to work with someone.
It's also So the only way you can get someone to change their beliefs about something because ultimately the person especially the more complex, the higher-level to sail the the more the person is to come to the conclusion on their own that they should work with you and less feel forced or suggested, hopefully that makes sense.
3:07
And so we should ask leading questions that lead them to the conclusion that they should work with you and you can solve their problems.
The second type of thing is a restatement, which means after they say something, you say it back to them.
Which means that you understand and you are listening.
3:27
All right, so it's like, so what I'm hearing is, this is the primary issue that you've been trying to solve.
This is what you've done so far, and this is why it hasn't worked, is that sound about, right?
So that would be an example of restatement.
Notice, none of these things are declarative.
Statements of fact, I'm not teaching them anything.
3:44
All right, which is the same reason that people get in trouble and they do presentations to try and Pitch, they try and teach the thing is, is person has to have their beliefs broken in order to take action.
Action and you're not providing value in a real way because the reality is they're not going to execute on anything, you teach them they will only execute if they have their beliefs broken and believe you can help them and then that they can trust what you are saying.
4:04
This is like this was so hard for me to learn because in the very beginning when I started in which I just wanted to go in and get on the phone and Jim's.
Oh no, your pricing is all wrong.
You gotta do this, you gotta do this.
Go to this and they were just like take lots of notes and then end up getting off the call, not buying and then be like, well, I don't even know who this guy is, I'm just going to ignore it and so I didn't actually help them.
4:22
I thought I was helping them.
But I was actually helping them and I actually heard this from talking more, a good friend of mine, he said, everyone gets benefits from breaking beliefs, only 10% of people get benefits from tactics and so you actually are providing more value on the call by questioning their beliefs because you're actually servicing 100% of the people providing value compared to trying to give tactical advice that only 1 out of 10 people may or may not use and likely the people who will use it are not buying from you.
4:51
So, either way, you're not eating your business and you're also not benefiting.
There's that was a huge thing that I had break with my own beliefs.
And so then you might be wondering, well, if I'm only asking questions in restating things, how do I close the deal?
Great, great question.
Glad you asked.
All right.
And so what I like are short stories and so the reason we do this is that.
5:12
So we asked a question, ask you serious questions?
Hey, why are you here?
What are you struggling with where you're at right now?
We're trying to go.
What have you tried so far?
How's that working for you?
Why is this important does it matter like within the bigger - of your life and we were trying to do.
Okay great.
This is what I'm hearing.
I think this is why you have been successful.
5:29
Would you agree with that?
Does that make sense fantastic joining here, our program works, right?
So at that, point you'd enter, quote, the pitch, right?
Which is where you can explain how the services work.
This is where most guys, and gals will just blab, right?
They'll just talk and talk and talk and talk and talk and try and teach and about how they have the secret system in the.
5:46
And really I think Russell Brunson calls at technobabble is like you talk about your periodization, you talk about your plane or you talk about your Program just talk about the software's or whatever, right?
The route is, they don't care.
And so all we have to do, realistically is tell a story that illustrates what they're going to experience as a result.
6:04
All right?
And so, if I were trying to sell, you know, I'll just use gym once a simple example.
So if I'm like, listen, fundamentally until you learn, how to Market your business, you're never going to be free.
And earlier, you said that the goal when we asked for context is that you want to, you want to be free, you want this business to be able to Run on its own.
6:25
Does that sound about right?
Yes.
Okay, cool.
Well then then do you see a world in, which you're going to be able to Outsource the most important part of your business, which is acquisition lead, generation leadership and sales?
Do you feel like there's a world where you can just offload that responsibility and then somehow have a reliable business?
6:40
Because what if that business goes out of business, which is likely happens all the time then what?
Right?
You're never actually going to be free until you learn this which means you have to confront this either today, tomorrow or 10 years from now.
But you're going to have to do.
It does that sound fair to use that makes Sense.
Right?
And so here, what I'm doing is I'm trying to I'm telling I'm telling a story to break believe, I'm not saying, let me show you how we're going to teach you how to Market instead.
7:03
I'm saying we have to at least come to an agreement that you need to learn this skill.
Does that sound fair?
Yes.
And then the next kind of mini story, and if I, if they didn't understand it, then it would be like, well, this is difference in given a fish and teaching Amanda fish right now.
You need to learn how to fish for yourself, right?
In order for this business to be sustainable for you, right?
7:21
Right.
And so these are little analogies.
Already prepackaged if I was selling weight loss, I would say something like all right.
Well fundamentally you know, Fitness Nutrition, accountability need these three things fitness-wise.
You're going to have to come and work out here.
We agree that you need to work out.
Right, right.
7:36
Why haven't you been working out so far?
I don't know how fair enough is it?
Also because you're not motivated to do it.
Yes.
What if you actually what something that you like doing why I like doing I like watching TV cool.
What if, what if working out with something that you could look forward to as much as or more than watching TV?
7:52
If you liked working?
At more than watching television, which one would you think you would do?
Well, I'd probably work out, right?
So our goal is not to get you to work out, but learn to like working out more than watching television.
If we can accomplish that, then we're going to solve this problem for good.
Does that make sense?
Yes.
Notice I told them they're going to have to work out.
8:09
I did not talk about the the, the new the exercise selection were going to do the programming how we're going to ramp up their volume, there under leading periodization, the fancy exercises.
Like, none of that stuff we talked about because it doesn't matter.
We have to just come to an agreement that this is What we're going to be doing to solve the problem.
8:25
Does that make sense?
Yes, fantastically move forward, right?
Wheel clockwise you guys already know that I don't run any ads on this and I don't sell anything.
And so the only ask that I can ever have you guys that you help me, spread the words we cannot more entrepreneurs, make more money, feed their families, make better products and have better experiences for their employees and customers.
8:46
The only way we do that is if you can rate and review and share this podcast, so the single thing that I have to do is you can just leave review, but Taking 10 seconds or one type of the thump.
It means the absolute world to me.
And more importantly, it may change the world for someone else.
And so, you'll have these prepackaged ideas.
9:03
Another example is, if I had somebody who wasn't, I'm giving these examples to help the drive the point home.
If someone said, you know, you're gonna have to change the way you eat for example, then I say, okay, what you've probably tried stuff in the past, right?
I'm not going to talk to the fucking meal plan, right?
Does it matter, right?
It does matter, but not in this conversation, it does not matter fundamentally.
9:20
You're going to change the way you eat because what you got like why are you are here?
Is because of something you are currently doing, does that sound fair right?
Okay, cool.
So again with this example, I'd be like well do you like cake?
Do you like cookies?
Yes.
Okay, so then the key.
Do you think you could not let eat cookies for those, your life?
9:36
You think you cannot eat cake or not, eat ice for the rest your life.
You think that's reasonable?
No, I don't think that's reasonable cool.
So then we have to figure out a way for you to eat the things that you enjoy and still lose weight and do it in a way so that you look forward to it.
Because if the end of the day, if you like the food more than you're currently eating, you will stick with it.
9:51
Does that sound fair?
Yes.
Because do you think that you can sustainably give yourself willpower for the rest of your life?
No, okay.
Well then, can we agree that all we have to do?
Do is just simply figure out the foods that you will like and that's an iterative process for us and we'll walk through it.
But the end goal is that you will like this more than you're currently eating.
10:08
And as a result of that will stick with it.
Which means that over the Long Haul, you'll get to where you want to go.
That's unfair.
Yes, notice again, this is an explanation.
This is a, this is a mini story.
This is an analogy that will use and you should have multiple of these.
So you can drive the point home.
If you feel like the prospect does not understand what you are saying, right?
10:25
And so, this is where we are, we are coaching based on beliefs, we are not explained.
Or tactical izing or techno babbling about our program because fundamentally, it does not matter, they don't care.
Nor will they?
10:40
Listen, they're not even paying whenever you have a monotone you can see it in gone recordings.
If you don't, if you don't record this, you can see talk time you can see where engagement goes down and invariably.
It's when a Salesman gets to this part of the pitch and then they talked for five minutes straight.
No one cares.
10:57
I'm sure like I'm sure that when you've been if you've ever been sold something, You feel like the person isn't listening to you, right?
And so what I can say is the best way to sell is to have the person feel like you understand them.
And the best way for someone to feel understood is for you to actually give a shit if you actually give a shit you will know what questions to ask in what order because those are the questions that you would actually ask.
11:23
The reason scripture even invented is to mimic or structure, a conversation between somebody who cares and someone that they can help.
That is what a sale is.
Is we're breaking their beliefs were coaching them to the conclusion that they have not been able to make up to this point, which is that they need to work with us in order to solve their problem.
11:40
And we should be okay with the fact that I would like to provide value to this person so that I can break their beliefs are on this.
Whether they work with me or not, this is still the type of solution that they're going to need.
And if you can approach it like that you stop having your ego tied up in your closing, percentages in your numbers and instead you start helping people on the phone.
And by extension, you will sell more deals.
11:58
All right, and it's not by proving your Expertise and and ego, ego babbling about how smart you are, right?
Instead, it's asking them questions.
Making sure they understand that you're that, you're tracking what they're saying asking more leading questions, restating what they said and then when they ask you about how they could potentially work for you then and only then you give them the stories to explain how it works.
12:23
That's the deal.
And one of the big rules that I was hitting on with our sales.
Team yesterday, is you do not Pitch the program?
Until you believe the person will say yes, lawyers do not ask questions, they do not already already know the answers to no guy.
Most guys don't propose to someone without already know.
12:41
The person's going to say, yes, the, the take rate on proposals is very high, right?
Let's be real, most, you know, girls say yes to a proposal most.
Right.
I'm not saying all, but most do and sales should be the same way.
If you feel like you don't think you're going to close this person, do not Pitch them.
12:58
Continue to stay in this circle Where You Are.
Asking questions and reinstating and clarifying until you can eventually find that that piece that thread that was unexposed that you need to pull to then get them to say that.
Aha, that's the issue, right?
And so from this, the three things that you should be using, when you are closing is you should be asking questions.
13:18
Should be restating what they said and then once you've exhausted these pieces where it becomes obvious that they you need to move on this sale only at that point they'll say well, how do I how do I work with you?
How does the program work they should be asking you or you can at the ERI Lee said, would you like to know the programmers?
Think it might be a good fit for you?
At that point they can give you permission to say.
13:36
Yes.
Now if someone says, yay.
Hey, tell me how the program works.
It's like now, I don't think we're ready for that right now.
I need to understand more about your business, otherwise, it's not going to it's not going to make any sense.
I don't have enough context, right?
And again when you do that you can retake the frame in the conversation.
If someone is committing you around, you're not going to close the deal, right?
13:52
And so a lot of times usually within the first 5 to 10 minutes, you can tell whether you're not going to close a deal.
Most people most experienced salespeople know, bye.
How the first five to ten minutes ago whether this person is really even five minutes, you can tell whether you're gonna be able to close this person or not and if you don't feel like you're going to close the person, it means you need a state shift.
14:11
You need to shift the frame and the only way to do that is to ask questions that are challenging.
One of the things I have, my team say is closures, ask hard questions, right?
Is ask questions that are going to challenge their current Paradigm, if they're in a current Paradigm that they're getting on the phone because they want to prove to themselves.
That nothing is going to work for them.
14:27
Then you need to say, it sounds like it sounds like you're out of luck.
Sounds like your business is kind of, there's no way for you to succeed.
Does that sound about right?
And then they're going to sell you on why you're wrong but by selling you and why they're wrong.
They're taking a contrarian stance which then prove to you that there is a way rather than saying, no, I think you can be successful in there.
14:44
Like no, I can't be successful, right.
And so understanding that before you get into your pitch, the person must already be sold on working with.
You is one of the biggest things I can give you right now.
So if your script has too many paragraphs and too much explanation, and all of that stuff, then it's off.
It just needs to be questions.
15:00
And restating for clarification that you are hearing what they're saying and asking the next natural question, that will lead logically to them working with you.
And asking the question at the end which is, well, how do I do this?
That sounds amazing.
It's exactly what I want.
Like, how do I move forward with the details Etc?
And then at that point you say cool, this is how it works, ready to rock and roll.
15:16
All right, fair enough.
Hope to make sense.
Keeping awesome.
Lots of love and I'll see you guys on foot like that.

On Amazon, the Kindle book is 99 Cents.
The audiobook is Lowe's, they'll let me put it on for it, so I think it's 12 bucks.
So enjoy that and let's start the podcast.
What are the Simplest ways.
0:30
What are the simplest of these levers?
The highest likelihood levers that I have.
And then doing this on a consistent basis and expanding the time prize.
And so that the likelihood that you actually achieve, the result approaches 100%.
Welcome to the game, where we talk about, how to get more customers, how to make more per customer and how to keep them longer in the many failures and lessons.
0:47
We have learned along the way.
I hope you enjoy and subscribe.
What's going on?
Everyone got a very special presentation for you today.
What I want to talk to you about, is something that I've been working on a lot more recently, which is I think business is go from a million dollars a year to million dollars a month and I've now been having, you know, these conversations regularly with the entrepreneurs or doing, you know, between one and five ish.
1:09
And they're trying to get to, you know, one and then two, three million dollars a month and Beyond.
And I wanted to give you kind of an expansion on the framework.
That I think I've talked about before where people come out.
They pay about $50 for a day of Consulting and I walk them through kind of the ways to grow business, right?
1:26
And so, we basically spot, check and figure out where we feel like the biggest lever or She is and we go all in on that, all right?
And so, Fundamentally the ways to grow a business.
There are only two and then within those two there are subsets obviously, right?
1:42
So one is you can increase acquisition Which is getting more customers, right?
Selling more units.
And I've talked about in other videos how to do this, but there are six ways to do this.
One is through paid advertising, which everyone automatically defaults is the only way, right?
2:02
The next is through earned media, which is like right now as you're listening to this, this is earned right?
Third is owned, right?
Which is going to lists that you have fourth is through Partners.
Our affiliates.
That's like if you have another company that serves your types of clients, but in a different way, you might partner together and refer clients.
2:25
Number five is client referrals, as in your own clients sending other business to you. which if we feel like that's an opportunity to maybe we could have really an aggressive referral program and then finally, Manual outbound.
2:44
Okay, so those are the six ways, right?
And then obviously, within those, there's you know, endless amounts of Cup, subcategories?
Right within, you know, manual and value could have cold cold cold, email called messaging and and things of that nature.
And you could do that across different platforms called messenger Grand Instagram, called Mission or Facebook, or must draw on LinkedIn.
3:01
Right.
All of those are tactics but this is the strategy, right?
Referrals would be referral systems like Dropbox head, you know, refer a friend, you could pay them, you could give them a percentage off you Can give them bonuses or give them swag or give that extra services that they wouldn't normally be able to be able to have Partners.
How can you create an incentive program where we can pay you for continuity?
3:19
We can pay you per deal or, you know, how can we integrate ourselves into your business that we're just the second step, or third step of your client Journey owned.
This is the list that you have absolute access to that no one can touch or remove from you, right?
Like if I own an email list or I own a phone number, then that is something that I own that I could always use to get more customers with Earned is the platforms that choose to distribute our content information because we provide value to the users, right?
3:45
So like if you're getting value from this, then the platform says, we're going to displace this to more people and then maybe at some point in the future be like, hey Alex, you know, I'd love to have you help me go from a million a year to a million a month, Etc, right.
And then finally, there's paid, right?
And then within paid, there's obviously a million subcategories, you can go g, DN 2, bullet, you could go, you go, Facebook ads, Instagram ads and YouTube ads and the We roll and you know like search and the million other ways that you can use those but fundamentally these are the categories.
4:14
All right now the back side of the business is increase customer LTV right now.
I'm going to Define this really quickly because everyone kind of understands increasing the number of units that seems straightforward, right?
Like if you get more customers it's just like what's the customers.
4:30
Somebody starts pay you right?
Increasing acquisition people seem to understand increasing LTV seems to be significantly more amorphous, right?
It's something that's less.
That and one of the difficulties is that the term itself is usually poorly.
Defined, all right, and I'll give you an example.
4:46
So if I had a meal prep business, for example, and let's say it cost me $9 to create and deliver a meal to a customer that shipped.
All right, to the door.
And let's say, I charge ten dollars for that meal, right?
And let's say, the average person buys 10 meals week, that's $100 a week.
5:05
And, you know, for per month, that's $400 a month.
Just using rough, man.
Here, right?
And let's say, the average person stays with me for I'll just use 10 weeks because it's 10 times 100 to 1000.
All right, so someone on my marketing department might be like hey dude we're spending $200 to get a thousand dollar customer, this is awesome.
5:23
Let's crank up the ad spend, right?
Because the thousand-dollar LTV when in reality, the LTV of that customer is not $1000.
What is it?
Think about it for yourself for a second.
It's 100 bucks.
Why?
Because my gross margin what, I'm actually making on the sale Minus cost of goods is a dollar on a ten dollar purchase, right?
5:45
Cost me, nine all in and I make a buck, right?
And so, I'm making a hundred dollars over the span of Life times because $100 a week times. 10 weeks is a thousand dollars, so I'm making a hundred bucks in total gross margin per customer.
So if it costs me $200 to make 100, I'm literally just losing $100 an hour.
6:03
Mark wire, that's not a good play.
And so the delineation the thing that needs to be peeled off here is what is the gross margin over the lifespan of the customer.
All right, that is what true lifetime value is.
The problem is that some of the writings on this.
A lot of the writings are on this topic, talk about software companies and typically the gross margins on software are close to 100% which is why there's such some of the biggest companies out there.
6:26
And so they just kind of assumed that the revenue that someone's going to create is going to be close to or basically interchangeable with.
If the gross margin over lifespan, so they use those interchangeably, but it's not true for most of us who don't sell software, right?
Who don't sell are right.
6:43
And so if you have hard costs of goods and has to be the gross margin over the lifespan of the customer, that is what lifetime value is.
I might even redefine it as LT G p-- which is Lifetime gross, gross profit.
All right?
Real quick guys, if you can think about how you found this podcast, somebody probably tweeted it told you about it, should it on Instagram or something like that?
7:03
The only way this grows is through word of mouth and so I don't run ads, I don't do sponsorships, I don't sell anything.
I only ask is that you continue to pay it forward to whoever showed you or however you found out about this podcast that you do the exact same thing.
So if it was a review if it was a post, if you do that would mean the world to me and you throw some good karma out there for another entrepreneur.
7:23
Now, I have talked about this in the past that there are three ways, sorry, two ways.
You can increase the back end, right?
You can, you can get them to buy more times.
You can get them to buy to cross helps.
But after after doing kind of a more Deep dive on this tactically, here are the five ways and each one of these weighs just like the acquisition, you can increase on a business, all right, number one is, you can increase the price.
7:47
Very simply you do the same exact thing.
But you charge more, that increases the lifetime gross profit on a customer.
The second is you can decrease the cost.
So this is one that a lot of people Overlook.
If I can figure out a way either through technology to decrease my cost of goods.
8:03
So let's say, with that meal example, let's say I figure out a new way to ship it and I can decrease the weight or I don't have to put as much ice in the box.
Then my cost goes down.
So my gross margin goes up, right?
That does grow the business.
I make more money.
It allows me to spend more money and acquisition, Etc.
So decreasing cost, or Figure out a way to fulfill the same thing in a lower with a lower cost would be an improvement in the business.
8:28
The next three are related their cousins of one another.
All right, number three would be reselling.
So, that's within the context of like a recurring business, like if you someone buys monthly membership, they're they're basically getting resold over and over and over again.
8:44
So that gets into churn increasing activation all that kind of stuff.
And so that's where you get the increasing LTV based on resale. / retention.
All right.
The fourth is to cross sells.
All right, this Is where you're selling someone something else that they also need.
9:02
All right?
So this can be done in two ways.
One is you can have another business.
Like an example that within the one of our companies is that we have Jim Lord's, right?
Which is our gym company, right?
Jim lunch and our communities doing words and then Prestige Labs is the cell phone companies specifically made for Jim's because a lot of gyms, like, there's a lot of things that normal supplements, don't do that.
9:25
We specifically designed it for Jim's to solve a problem.
And so as a result of that, if they choose to sell our some line that is a kind of a soft cross-selling.
We're not actually selling them, but they're choosing to sell our products.
It's another Revenue stream for the business.
That's a that's it.
That's an example of me.
9:40
Owning another way to increase the lifetime value.
A different way would be, lets say clickfunnels, right?
That's a software that a lot of our gyms use.
And so we're an affiliate of clickfunnels and so in that we get a certain percentage back from clickfunnels for referring customers to them.
9:55
So the flip side is that we are partners of another business and so we have integrated them in our business and then we get paid for that.
I don't want to create, you know, a landing page software.
This is not within my core and so as a result of that, I will find the best one and then I can recommend it and get a commission as a result of that, so that again, increases lifetime value.
10:17
All right.
And then finally, You've got up sells.
All right.
And I like to delineate this because you think differently about each of these things, right?
This is someone's buying the same thing more times.
This one's buying with an upsell, someone's buying a better version of the thing.
10:34
So, this is thing about this as more premium or upgrading, and this is buying again, all right?
And so each of these five ways increases the lifetime value of the customer.
And obviously, there's a, I could write a whole book on pricing, you know, there's a hundred ways to decrease Cost for a product or cost of delivering service entire books on churn activation and onboarding, all that kind of stuff to decrease.
10:59
The likelihood seems going to leave increase like through the continue to stay with you again and again, cross sells looking at all of the different things that a customer who's going to work with you may eventually by as a result of doing business with you and seeing which of these things would.
I potentially want to create which of these things would, I would have potentially want to buy and then what which one of these things when I potential want to just partner with right?
11:20
And if you're earlier on, I would definitely recommend doing more partnering and less building because then, you probably have too many companies and it's a nightmare.
All right?
So and then finally, okay, how do I, how can identify customers who are more likely to want to have a higher level of service and then Ascend them into that.
11:37
And so when I'm looking at a business that we're trying to take from a million dollars a year to a million dollars a month or multiple million dollars a month the this is my framework.
This is what I'm looking at to answer those questions and then figure out where do I feel like Where they're at, if I'm reading these where do I see the biggest opportunity?
11:54
The lowest hanging fruit that has the highest likelihood of success for that business so that we can achieve it.
And typically when we go through this entire process, I might just say, all right, we're just going to do this.
That's it.
Because at the end of the day, if you're trying to grow your business, the point of doing an exercise like this is not to feel overwhelmed, but to feel Clarity.
12:18
You should feel calmer after doing this exercise and focused on exactly what needs to happen in your business in order to grow it.
And so, fundamentally two ways to grow.
Get more customers, make them worth more.
And then within getting more customers, there's six different sources of getting customers and then within each of those sources, zillions of tactics around that and then within lifetime value.
12:38
You can increase the the the price you can decrease the cost for you.
So you increase your margin, you can resell these people over and over again or retain them longer, you can cross sell them or have some affiliations with businesses that they are going to do business with as a result of working with you.
And then finally figuring out ways that you can Ascend them into higher levels of service, all right?
12:58
And so looking at the entire business to think, what are the simplest ways?
What are the simplest of these levers?
The highest likelihood levers that I have.
And then doing this on a consistent basis and expanding the time, Prize.
And so that the likelihood that you actually achieve, the result approaches 100% And that is the process that I am now, doing with the companies that were working with that are doing, you know, a million two million three million.
13:18
Sometimes five million a year that are trying to get to a million a month, to million a month, for million a month, Etc.
So anyways, hope that was right before I hope that made sense and ya, Keepin it, awesome.
Lots of love.
Subscribe.
Like all that stuff.
All right, bye.








0:00
Real quick.
Because you guys already know that, I don't run any ads on this and I don't sell anything.
And so, the only ask that I can ever have you guys that you help me spread the word so we can have more entrepreneurs, make more money, feed their families, make better products, and have better experiences for their employees and customers.
And the only way we do that is if you can rate and review and share this podcast, so the single thing that I have to do is you can just leave review will take you 10 seconds or one type of the thumb, mean, the absolute world to me.
0:25
And more importantly, it may change the world of someone else.
The only reason for you to have a partner is because they either have money or skills that you do not have.
Welcome to the game, where we talk about a get more customers how to make more per customer and how to keep them longer in the many failures and lessons.
We have learned along the way.
I hope you enjoy and subscribe.
0:42
What's going on?
Everyone, I have been known as the partnership killer.
And so what I want to share to you with you today is something that comes up on.
I mean, every week on coaching calls with, you know, younger entrepreneurs, younger business owners, not even younger, just other business owners who aren't doing as much in More.
1:01
And the question is usually, one of two things first is, you know, what, should our roles be within our partnership?
And then to what do you think of Partnerships in general?
And so what I want to do is share with you a couple hard hard hard-earned lessons that I have.
And so first right off the bat I hate I think I counted I have nine failed Partnerships and so I just want to say, right?
1:23
Right before you even get going, I could be the problem of the Partnerships, right?
If you have that many failed Partnerships, then it's probably Probably you, you were the common theme.
So, I will say that first and foremost upfront.
That being said, I think the reason that many of those Partnerships fail, and they all happen, you know, almost concurrently, I just it partnership a partnership a partnership because I heard it's like, you gotta find good partners but what I didn't understand was how it actually needed to be structured and how it worked.
1:48
And so there's a, there's there's a few pieces of that.
The first is if you're just starting out, I think that for the most part, it's better to not have partners and that is because Usually it's like you want a buddy and you're like hey we like hanging out we should go into business together when really you're doing that.
2:05
For the emotional need to be satisfied to have somebody to talk to and share the experience with but not because it's a good business decision and the only reason for you to have a partner is because they either have money or skills that you do not have that.
Is it the only reason money or skills?
That's it.
2:21
And so, if you both are entrepreneurial people on your both, you know, love selling love marketing.
Your very promotion oriented which many entrepreneurs are right, if that's you Then if they're that way to then one of you is not required and you have to really face that.
And so that's the first one.
2:36
The second thing is that those jump into bed of the other Partnerships, don't have step.
Number two, which is you don't have a contract, you don't have terms, you don't have an agreement and the reason is because you're so afraid of like, messing up the vibe, we don't operate that way.
You will, when it gets fucked up at the end, but I'm telling you right now.
I now even when I have somebody who approaches me and says, hey, like, will you take a percentage of my company?
2:56
Can you coach me through this blah, blah blah?
I say let's go through the lawyers.
First, all right, because the thing is, you get to see how this person acts under stress, because it is stressful because inherently, you're going to disagree on things.
And so this is a perfect experience.
Like perfect time for you to go.
3:13
Kind of get a simulation of that.
Will take what happens if you don't want to work and I want to work.
What happens if you leave, what happens if I don't want to do this anymore?
What like you have to go through all the scenarios and get a good lawyer and you should really have to that represent you if you don't have the money for that, then get somebody to just counsel you.
3:30
You can Google a standard partnership agreement, their templates for free online, and you can pay one lawyer for one hour of time.
To, at least say these are the things you should look for now, you know, decide amongst yourselves.
And so you can represent yourself in your partnership, you know, agreement, but you have to have the agreement and you have to spell it out in clear terms.
3:49
Because if you don't have that, it's like it's the Bedrock of good communication and expectations, right?
Like otherwise usually like most relationships build Partnerships and because of unmet, It and unspoken expectations like Oh, I thought you're going to do.
This is like well I didn't know but no one even says that because it can communicate.
4:06
So first is you probably should just jump together with someone because they they're just like you if you are going to do that, then you should make sure that you have contracts in place.
And then finally, what I want to do is kind of explain to you.
What the three main rules roles that exist in a business are okay, three, the three pillars.
4:25
All right, I want to have see if I have a tripod here.
All right, here we go.
Here's my tripod.
All right.
So so there's three pillars to every business.
All right, the first is acquisition, which is The Rainmaker somebody who's going to bring in business, so that's marketing and sales.
4:41
All right, acquisition the money better.
All right.
The second of these is the product, which is what you are actually selling.
It's the Fulfillment is the service is the widget, it's the whatever, somebody who knows, how to deliver it, all right?
And then third, You have the operations, which is everything else that has to happen in the company, paying payroll paying taxes, making sure legal and contracts and it and, you know, finance and all like, you know, your accounting.
5:10
All of that stuff HR has to happen, right?
And so these are the three legs of every business.
Now, they're not necessarily equally weighted and that's an important point, right?
Like a lot of times there are good operators that you can get for significantly less and many times not even equity Because there are more of them right now, rainmaking being able to bring in business, is a very highly valued skill in the marketplace.
5:34
The flipside, having the thing, the product that you're going to sell is also very valuable.
Now this is why skill stacking is so important.
If you can have multiple of these skills then you have two or all three of the legs right now.
Your these are the roles that have to exist.
5:50
It doesn't mean you have to be partners with these people, but you have to have all three of these things for your business to stand up.
And so, for example, within the come, I'll walk through my roles within each of the companies that I own.
And so, the first is Jim Lunch, right?
6:06
So in Jim watch, I am both the, the acquisition and the product, right?
Or that was my founding role within the company.
Leila my wife runs ran all the operation, so, everything else.
So, like I said, it billing, legal, Finance, HR, all of that stuff that had happened.
6:24
She took care of, right?
Right, super important but because of that, we had all three legs of the stool and were able to build a business, right?
If you're missing one of the legs, it's not going to work, right?
If and with this is where, this is really dangerous.
Is like a lot of the marketing people that are in this world are really good promoters.
6:40
They can get people in, they can sell them.
But then they have no fulfillment, they have nothing, right?
And then they have no one who's organized.
And so everything like you send emails in you, try and get help and they don't respond.
It's because they just don't have the other piece.
I don't think it's because they're bad intention.
I think just don't have the skill.
Hey guys, love that you're listening to the podcast.
6:59
If you ever want to have the video version of this which usually has more effects more visuals, more graphs, you don't drawn out stuff, sometimes it can help hit the brain centers in different ways.
You can check out my YouTube channel.
It's absolutely free.
So check that out if that's what you are into and if not keep enjoying the show, And so you have to have all three.
7:19
And so if you're going to bring someone in, you need them to have one of those things.
Right now, you can start a business and own all of it, and just make sure that you fill the roles of those people.
But as you're thinking through it, there's the role.
So if you're going to bring Partners in, in the beginning, you want to be clear about what it is that they bring to the table.
7:36
Now, if they're, if they're one of those three, right?
Then that's a clearly defined role.
And then at that point, that's what you can lay out in your agreement and then you can argue about are, you know, negotiate Whatever Equity if you're doing this in the beginning.
But if you've already started at that point, then you can look at the three legs of the stool.
7:54
And see where, where am I lacking, right?
And so, for most of you guys who are listening, most people following me are on the are like the promotion side.
So they like the acquisition side.
Then what you need to do is find a strong operator, all right?
And depending on what you're selling, if you know the thing that you're selling, then you can basically be product and acquisition and have a strong second to help you fulfill on those things.
8:17
And basically, Got a Jet, right?
And you know, get file your taxes and all the other stuff.
And so when I'm thinking about Partnerships and when I have, you know, young guys for coming in many many times after having discussions with me, and then talking them each other, they realize that they had the exact same role.
8:32
They like the same things.
And one of them is not necessary and so they often times split and that's not a bad thing, right?
It's better to recognize an error early than a recognize an error late, all right?
And so, you may be in one of these Partnerships where you're like we got to both do the same thing.
We kind of just overlap on everything.
It's like yeah, that's Just two people working the same thing.
8:50
And so it's not like, you don't just be like, oh they're here's all this work.
I'll do half you, do you have?
That's not a good partnership.
You have to figure out what are the things we're.
I am good at what are things, you are good at.
And then we draw a line on the board and everything on that side, you own and everything.
On this side I own and I'm responsible for because everyone's responsible for everything.
9:05
No one's responsible for anything, right?
And then nothing's gonna get done.
And then you can never know who to blame and someday you're like, well, he takes out the trash or awesome, try to take out the trash.
We just kind of, we're just like, kind of get it done, type stupid.
There's no, there's no big Is that works away, all right?
And so, if you even if you are small, you need to start thinking big to become big, right?
9:22
So, you got to do the actions before you get the results, you have to have the police before you get the outcomes of a bigger business to become a bigger business and the reason most businesses, stay small is because they think small and they act small.
So they stay that way because the outcome of what they're doing is the result of the actions.
They're making, which are small, right?
9:37
And so right now, if you're in a partnership, if you don't have a partnership, you think about starting a business, I would definitely try and just acquire the skills myself get going and then The first higher I'm going to have is going to be a strong operational second.
Alright, so first thing to do, if you are in a partnership, you need to put all the activities that you do on a board.
9:57
I do this when I do consulting stuff, but all the activities that happen in the business on a board, if you don't know what it is, you do a Time study, which means you write down every 15 minutes.
What you do in a week, right?
Cause you probably don't know, it's just got it all over the place.
So if you write it all down and you both bring it to each other and you put it on a whiteboard or put it on a board.
Then when you can do is say okay these are all the things.
10:14
These are all the activities that happen in our business.
Let's divide.
These out and say, who owns these.
All right.
And that's the very beginning of an organization because you were becoming organized, you're creating roles and responsibilities, you're creating specialization of skills, which is what moved Humanity forward, specialization is a good thing, right?
10:31
And so the very beginning, you get all of it on there and you can divide it out and you can divide it based on the skills of the person.
If you both have the same skills then either need to decide.
Okay, well I'm going to become a specialist in this and you're going to become a specialist in this or we shouldn't be doing this business together and you should do a business that's just like minor or something else.
10:47
And you should become and you should be that role for that company and you should find a second just like I will.
All right.
And oftentimes, if you can eat at least think that way, then you don't lose you, don't liquidate the most valuable thing in the whole world which is your Equity, all right?
Because if you're thinking actually does grow your business, actually does grow, then the biggest dilution of how much money you're going to make.
11:06
Is that first decision when you started, when you decide to just right off the bat to give half of everything away.
All right, and I've made this mistake nine times and it took me and I've even had it a partner in four years and I've made all of the money in my life, post partners.
11:25
And so there's also other factors going to look at two like what kind of, you know, what kind of working schedule do you have?
How much vacation time do you want to have?
Are you going to work weekends?
Do you work late at night?
You work in the mornings?
Do you expect each other to be responsive?
Like there's all these little things that you need to make sure you dial in because if you don't it's just going to cause trouble later and it may be hard conversations for you now but believe me, it'll be much harder later when the Nations are not being met and now you have money involved.
11:50
Alright?
So anyways, these are the things I think through when I'm looking at Partners or Partnerships and why, often times, I do break up many partners because they don't start them for the same for the right reasons.
And so I hope you found this valuable.
If you have partner talk to them about it, show them this video and keeping amazing, and lots of love.
12:06
Oh, total bonus.
I have noticed that works really well.
So many times is married couples.
Married couples doing business together.
They already have usually differences in skills.
Different Dynamics and so that usually works well usually one of them is the more go-getter hunter-killer, right?
12:23
You know the acquisition side and the other person's usually the more organized more stable you know more even headed like does all the Ops in the back the back end stuff, right?
And so even just think about front-end and back-end is a good way to start and that's why I love having married couples in general because they almost always are successful.
12:39
If they can just only need those skills in the usually already have even.
Even without speaking the already unknown, we have made a lot of these.
Specializations is why a lot of times they're more successful.
They also have The interpersonal emotional sounding board to bounce things off of and also the relieve, some of the stress that inevitably comes, when you're when you're running a business.
12:56
So anyways, hope you enjoy the video.
Hope you found this valuable you know share with your partner or potential partners and see the next video.
Bye.








0:00
Real quick guys.
If you can think about how you found this podcast, somebody probably tweeted it told you about it.
Should it on Instagram or something like that?
The only way this grows is through word of mouth and so I don't run ads, I don't do sponsorships, I don't sell anything.
I only ask is that you continue to pay it forward to whoever showed you or however you found out about this Pockets that you do the exact same thing.
0:19
So if it was a review if it was a post, if you do that would mean the world to me and you throw some good karma out there for another entrepreneur.
We realized that obviously it was over and then we ended up having to cut 20 people Which was horrible.
Welcome to the game where we talk about how to get more customers, how to make more per customer and how to keep them longer in the many failures and lessons.
0:37
We have learned along the way.
I hope you enjoy and subscribe.
The next video in my million-dollar mistake series because I've made so many mistakes in my life comes from a different period in our business career.
When we were, we were launching our our supplement company and so this is two years or two and a half years in And so, at this point, we just in 20 million a year before it's, we're launching our supplement company.
1:04
And we expected to do, you know, decent amount of money.
The first month we did 1.7 million, next method. 11.5, the next one.
And we want it.
We did 16, I think next month.
And so you like, it was, it was just to give you perspective in terms of the business size.
And so we took one of our heads who had worked up from the bottom.
1:24
She was a front of front line, customer service rep who had been a Frontline customer service about it.
A different big company.
So again, you know, we hired for experience at that point they had experienced main customer service customer service, improving customer service manager and this became director of customer service, so shoes, you know, great cultural fit, great, great Vibe, you know, really good, you know, nice person.
1:44
And so we were starting this physical product line which is prestige labs.
And so we obviously the high-value service, you know, consulting company with Jim launch and so we're like women.
We did such a good job with that.
Do you think you can handle physical products?
You said sure it's going to be awesome.
1:59
No worries.
And so she was like, we're going to do the same thing with you.
Jim launch, totally over-deliver have you know, white glove service.
It's going to be amazing, right?
So like sounds great.
And so what we did was in anticipation of the volume that was going to happen.
We heart 25 customer service reps and and we actually had done a little bit of a beta launch before that.
2:20
So I think we'd like 600,000 in like December, just to like get things going but it was like, oh man, we're like these people are super overworked, they really need Five times that amount and there's a bunch of lessons that I learned from this.
And so I'll give you the the long story short right now, the company does about the same amount of money and we have four full-time people there and she had 25.
2:43
Those thing about that the same amount of work that currently is done by for people is being done by 25 and by being done.
I mean not doing anything and the thing is especially in a remote setting, you don't like you have to trust people to a certain degree, right?
And we didn't have transparency into the amount of work that people were doing, we just took them.
3:00
For it, and they just kept saying like, we're overworked overworked, we've worked and reality, is that like they were doing anything.
Like truly like theft, like day.
We're doing nothing.
And, you know, that's really hard for you as a human being.
But let me just show you the lessons that I learned from that.
3:15
The first one was this, you know, individual had never grown it.
Never built a department, right?
So they were, they had no experience doing it.
Number one.
Number two, the expense that they had in our service business was not relevant to a physical product.
Ducks b2c company.
3:31
So we were able to be serviced and then we had a b2c product line, those are two very different companies.
You know, one is, you know, people are saying you thousand dollars a month so that you can make them hundred thousand dollars a year and that's going to require a different level of service than somebody who's paying you know forty dollars for for a supplement, right?
3:49
Like you can't deliver the same level of service.
Like, it just doesn't make sense.
And so, but, you know, we like to delegate Authority like to delegate decision-making so that we can trust people to make good calls.
It was a bad one and it was because of me.
It was my fault.
I should have recognized that but I didn't.
And so anyways, built this huge department and then we then start a real over like I don't I don't like we're looking at the ticket volume like can't take that long to do these tickets.
4:14
Like there's only six main things that have to happen, right?
Hey guys real quick for those of you guys who are 100 million-dollar offers fans I love you.
I added in a lost chapter that has never been released.
I'm releasing it now transparently.
4:30
I'm doing that to build hype 400 dollar leads but you will have the unreleased chapter it talks about your first Avatar and how to segment customers to make more money.
You can get it by going to acquisition.com forward slash leads.
Its fo free in exchange for your email so that I can email you when we launched under Miller leads.
4:47
And so that you Can not miss out on it because last time I sold out for like eight straight weeks really fast.
So that is my way of making sure that y'all get first dibs.
This we started peeling back and coming back and then you know finally you know one person comes forward as like hey like I'm really doing nothing like all day.
5:02
Like you is my job safe you know it was like huh peel back a little more like hey like I responded like one email a day and I'm getting paid full-time.
I was like huh.
Interesting and so We realized that obviously was over and then we ended up having to cut 20 people, which was horrible.
5:21
It's horrible.
I mean, our glass door got slammed as a result of that, you know, you ruined my life and I'm like, weren't working, you know, it's hard.
It was my fault, you know, was 100% my fault.
And so we got a new director in there who had experienced and what she did to fix the department.
5:37
Was, she went into time studies, so she asked people to just tell me what you're doing with your time, and you can usually see very transparently when people are like Be icing.
And so she was the one who realized, where all the inefficiency was she downsize the team to the best people and then she created utilization tracking.
5:55
And so, we can now in real time always see what percentage of utilization of our Force there is.
And so the way that that worked was, she looked at how much time how much time it took to do each task.
So, how much time does it take to respond to an email on average?
How much time does respond to a support ticket on average?
How much time does it take to change your credit card or change the flavor or change your address or cancel subscription or change the solution?
6:13
Whatever, right.
Look tall.
Those tasks, and then, seeing how many of those things were coming in per day, so you can make a time estimate of what a reasonable person would be doing right with their time.
And then once we had that, we could see what the inflow of activity was supposed or inflow of actions that needed to happen.
6:30
We could allocate the amount of time that was supposed to happen and we knew the amount of a lot of time we were paying for in terms of Labor.
And so with that like every week I get a report says we're at 72 percent.
Utilization were 88 percent utilization.
We had over 90 were like okay we're getting close to.
We need another person.
We usually try to stay in the high 80s because then you're not burning people.
6:45
But it's just well utilized.
And so, the lesson that I had from that, there were many.
Right one is, make sure that the experience that a make sure someone's experienced be, make sure that they're experiencing the exact same industry.
See, sometimes you have to investigate and not take people's work and it sucks, but it's part of business and that's called QA quality assurance.
7:06
It's making sure that the data you're getting is validated right.
You know, we a lot of people unfortunately, who weren't as honest and again, that's our, that's our fault.
Everything's your fault.
As an entrepreneur is a my fault.
We should have looked closer.
We had a lot of people who didn't say anything who just literally clocked in and just tried, just not not not ruffle any feathers and just get paid.
7:26
And so that was horrible.
It was terrible.
And it was, it was horrible to get our last door slam with that.
And just, it just felt like a failure, you know what I mean?
But you learn these things.
And so we lad, you know, we had let those people go and we put somebody who was really metrics driven in place and then you quantify all the tests.
7:42
The thing is, once you quantify everything.
There's no, there's no There's no there's no fluff, right?
It's just transparent.
How many activities are coming in.
How much time does it take to do activities?
How many hours do we have?
In terms of Labor, that's available to us to complete these tasks?
That's it, right?
7:59
And it just makes everything transparent.
Everyone feels they don't feel like they're at risk, because on some level teammates can know if they're like jobs at risk, right?
Like they're not doing anything they get stressed, right?
And so like if you want to keep the culture, good and you also don't have a culture of people who don't do anything, right?
8:14
Because that's just that's It's horrible.
It's the biggest cancer you can possibly have in your company.
If you put those, put those layers in place, you put the tracking in place and you hire somebody who already has the experience to have built a team, not just been on one, but built a team for the specific type of business that you are in.
You will be so much further ahead and hopefully you avoid another million dollar mistake that I have made in my life.
8:36
So hopefully that's how I before you.
Hopefully you can avoid that land mine in otherwise have an amazing amazing day and keeping awesome.
You the next terrible mistake.
I made in my life.
See you next video.

Hey guys, love that.
You're listening to the podcast.
If you ever want to have the video version of this which usually has more effects, more visuals, more graphs, you know, drawn out stuff.
Sometimes it can help hit the brain centers in different ways.
You can check out my YouTube channel, it's absolutely free.
Go check that out, if that's what you are into and if not keep enjoying the show, hey, what's going on everyone?
0:19
This is Alex, I will be your host and you are on the gym Secrets podcast.
So if you were looking for different, I guess you might be my place but if you are a homeowner or a business owner, you were trying to look for Some secrets we will be dropping bombs today and what we're going to be talking about, probably should say bomb actually on a plane right now.
0:39
What we're going to be talking about today is competition, okay?
And kind of the things that have really helped us do a competition or a tactical level and just kind of a mindset thing.
So, a lot of times we get, you know, gym owners who come to us and who say, you know, I've got a I've got this car, Editor is my competitor and, you know, we could be for trainers and clients and like he copies on my ads and blah blah blah, right?
1:09
And and I and I totally feel you because I have competitors you copy my ads.
I had to pit early copy.
All my e-mails work for working, so, like I get it.
But the reality is this is that like I keep whenever someone talks about competition, the only thing I like immediately.
1:25
The thing that pops into my mind is that picture of Michael Phelps.
And How do you remember the other kids name?
But like the other swimmer who's Arthur.
I think this Ian Thorpe the torpedo.
I don't know.
Everybody was is the other swimmer who was like talking smack about how he's going to be Phelps and how it was like Phelps touching the the winning the wind you know the end of the race.
1:46
Repeat this guy and Phelps is looking straight at the finish line and that guy's looking at Phelps and it was like, losers focus on the competition, winners focus on winning.
Right?
And that's and that's kind of been That's something that took me a while.
To like kind of to we call it, you know, internalized.
2:06
Like you will always crush your competition.
If you obsess over your clients like like over client results like it, like in the experience that they're having in the service that they're having at your facility, like you will always be able to crush them and within the context of a local business or especially a local gym like I've had people who are like oh, there's two gyms and in in our city like we're working with you, like that's not fair, and it's like Miami and I'm like, dude, there's like three million people there.
2:43
Like, you can have two gyms using my system, you'll be fine.
You turn it mean.
And the reason I say that is like it's really kind of a shift from scarcity to abundance and like just always look at your bottom line.
Look at like it really high lost your customers.
2:59
Then it's like okay but think about Other customers are out there.
And if you're in the gym business, like many people need to lose weight, get any customers you already have who like you're not leveraging your underutilizing, you're not trying to get to their families and to their friends who are trying to provide exceptional service, you can get referrals, you're not holding events, you know, that's going to allow them to bring friends to you.
3:20
Like you're not giving compelling offers, you're not giving rewards.
You're not, you're not writing a handwritten Parts, not calling them up every week.
You're not texting them, you know?
I mean, it's like and you're looking out the window and spending hours of your day.
Day.
And really, what's more important?
A lot of attention units.
Like, literally, like we only have so much bandwidth, right?
3:37
That you can have a lot to certain tasks.
And if like 20% of your bandwidth is being put towards mentally complaining, yourself about how you have competition, how?
It's not fair, how you hate those guys?
How they all they do is copy, you were blah blah blah, whatever it is all that bad with is literally like you're losing to them by every moment you think about them you're losing to them, right?
3:58
And if you can just take that bandwidth and It too.
How can I better serve my customers.
What can I do right now?
Like start calling customers up messages and Facebook message said personal videos like handwritten cards.
Make the events that you're going to schedule, like the best time to be crazy.
Just like have events that people bring their friends to tell them to bring like are you making announcements before?
4:17
And after every session to promote your offers like simple stuff?
Maybe in like are you making a poster putting aside of your job of the clipboard next to it?
You know, like these are the fundamentals of people neglect them because they're so thinking about like, Marketing in the competition.
But it's like do.
Dude, like there's so many people like what would happen if we intend gyms in one market that ran all of our systems?
4:38
Then it means that we should have 10 gyms that are doing well, like how many restaurants are doing?
Well, right.
Like, there's so many people that need to lose weight in any given Market Place.
How hard is it for us to capture 240 of them?
Not that hard, right?
4:53
Not too hard.
Is it have to be?
So anyways, this was kind of an aside, but I hope it's valuable for you because like, I'm telling you and like so there's probably somebody in your life who's listening this be like, well, yeah, but like well how am I going to get customers?
Just like, you know how many other ways there are to get customers besides running Facebook ads a lot, right?
5:13
A lot like we as Jim launched as a business.
Like I try practice what I preach here.
We're still over fifty percent now, so we did the numbers for 50%.
For more on referrals.
Like, can you all say that?
50% of your new customers East one-third of coming in here from referral.
5:30
Like, I always keep my eye on that because if I know that that number is keeps continually.
Increasing means, I'm getting viral, I'm getting word of mouth and providing a separate results and I'm asking a way that is compelling enough and I'm providing an opportunity for my customers to bring their friends.
And so all this to say, don't worry about your competition, focus on you, winners focus on winning losers.
5:51
Is on everyone else.
Keep your eyes on the prize and you'll win.
So hope that was useful for you.
If you're a gym owner, need to fill up your gym or one of your competitors is working with us, ironically what your competitors are working with us.
Then you should definitely Center because otherwise you all about the stomped of skidding sort of.
6:10
Anyways, hope you have an awesome day and I will catch you guys on the flip side.
Is on everyone else.
Keep your eyes on the prize and you'll win.
So hope that was useful for you.
If you're a gym owner, need to fill up your gym or one of your competitors is working with us, ironically what your competitors are working with us.

And if not keep enjoying the show, we were pulling up in a Prius that had a crack across the windshield and a dent in the side door.
Alright.
And this car was probably a six thousand dollar car tops, right?
And the thing is, is at that moment.
Moment, I was a millionaire like I had a million dollars in cash, right?
0:33
Sitting my bank account after taxes.
And yet I was driving a 6000 or car.
Welcome to the game, where we talk about it, get more customers how to make more per customer and how to keep them longer in the many failures and lessons.
We have learned along the way.
I hope you enjoy and subscribe.
What's going on?
Are going to got a special presentation for you guys today.
0:49
This has been on my mind for probably about half a week now, and it's going to be about money.
All right.
Everybody's favorite topic and it's probably not going to be what you think.
It's going to be but it's going to be really good promise.
So one of the things that is top of mind is that I get a lot of conversations from entrepreneurs, who are like I want to be in the top 1% and I want to end.
1:08
The thing is The people who are in the top 1% live a different way and they also don't live.
Now, the way they did to get here, all right?
And so I'll tell you a quick story, and then I'm going to show you what I mean with this beautiful pyramid.
And if you're listening, then I'll try and explain it visually or audio-wise.
1:26
So, when I was very early on in my career or earlier to the now, right?
I was showing up to a mastermind event that I had was the first Mastermind event.
I think we had 28 people.
Who who are showing up and all these people were paying forty thousand dollars a year, and I remember pulling up to our event.
1:47
It was in Albuquerque, New Mexico and they were walking the hotel.
As I was pulling up right now.
I was like nervous and excited and all that stuff.
And one of the, one of the girls Margaret, our was like as we're getting out of the car she was like, I thought you guys were supposed to be rich, and she later said that, and I still remember to this day because it was like, such a It for me, I don't even know if she remembers it, but we were pulling up in a Prius that had a crack across the windshield and a dent in the side door.
2:19
All right?
And this car was probably a six thousand dollar car tops, right?
And the thing is, is at that moment I was a millionaire, like I had a million dollars in cash, right?
Sitting my bank account after taxes.
And yet I was driving a 6000 or car.
And so, one of the things that I consistently see is people outliving, their means.
2:38
And this that's not a new Sad.
But for some reason, it still doesn't resonate with people.
And so I'm going to level up this conversation a little bit because you're like, wait Alex, I thought you now have a Bentley, which I totally regret by the way.
But I do have a Bentley and we have a very nice home.
The thing is, is a Bentley for me, relative to my income is less than one week's income for me ink.
3:03
And so, one of the important things to understand is the relative cost of any of anything that you have.
And so, I have always used his back of napkin math to justify expenses, all right?
And so as a result of that I always have lived on less than 5%.
3:20
Once I started making money less than 5% of what I made, which pretty much meant that until I was making a million dollars a year or more.
I lived on thirty thousand dollars a year, right?
Which is if you've heard my other story about once Leyland, I made our first hundred thousand dollars.
I told her this is awesome.
That means that we have three years of living if we make no more money, right?
3:39
Because we knew that a tan on $1500 a month.
We could live, right?
Decently comfortably and I'll tell you this Comforts nice, but there's not that much more enjoyment you get out of like, driving a Bentley, versus a normal car.
And I'm sure there's car people who were, like, whatever.
But I'll tell you that the incremental gain that I have in my life is not worth the money.
3:57
This is probably the last expensive car all over half is also the first really expensive car that we ever got.
But what I wanted to do though and kind of shift the conversation is not just talk about, you know, making are spending a lot less than you make.
I saw somebody recently, who was one of our clients, they graduated the program and then they went on to start an online business.
4:16
They were gym owner and I saw the expenses that they were incurring and I was like, man.
Like that worries me, you know what I mean?
It just it just worries me because I see a lack of judgment because you don't know how things are going to change.
4:32
I mean, I think of the last year, for anyone can say that things can change quickly and I want to have tons of dry powder, tons of reserves to pull on if I need them.
And so for me I get more anxiety by having expenses and so for me to actually lower my anxieties, I lower how much I spend.
And so if that's something that you can associate for yourself as in the less money, I spend the more relaxed I am.
4:53
Then I would encourage you to do it because for me, it's been one of my kind of secret sauces of success is just like just don't spend a ton of money especially relative to what you make.
And so, what I want to do for the rest of, this is kind of first, talk about what it looks like to get in the top 1% and then how to get there.
5:09
All right, so right here, you've got a pyramid and if you're listening, then you can listen along, but there's four layers to this pyramid.
Alright.
And this is kind of the top 1% pyramid, the bottom layer of this is people who have these are It had high net worth individuals, all right?
5:24
That means you have 125 million dollars in assets.
All right, now, this may surprise you, but the people at this level and I've got my notes here.
So I'm going along with this, in the United States, it's one in 69.
So one in 69 people is as between one and five million dollars.
5:45
So being over a million is not even top 1% anymore.
I mean, it sort of is, but like it technically, it's a little like if you actually had 1 million dollars, you wouldn't be in the 1%.
But I find that.
But that's an assets not income, right?
That's an assets.
Not income.
6:01
You don't need to make a million dollars a year to be in the top 1%, right?
And what's crazy to me is that the top 1% income Is four hundred thousand a year, but the top one percent in assets is only a million or a million and a half bucks.
How nuts is that?
6:17
It means people spend all their money.
That's what that means.
So, if you have a top 1% income, you should be way above the top 1% in assets.
But it doesn't work that way because people always want to show off.
And people can't think long-term.
And the only thing that I've been continually reading about cousins, really, pouring a lot into really reading a lot about monger.
6:38
And and Buffett so Warren, Buffett.
And Charlie Munger who are founders and whatnot of Berkshire.
Hathaway is how they live and how they think in terms of long-term.
And so I'm going to transition to talk about how to get there.
But I'm going to finish this little chart for you.
So this is the top one point five percent roughly of the u.s. is 125 million in assets and that's one in 69.
7:01
So if I for me, I like the one in personally and makes it more real for me.
So one in 69 people, all right, now in the US, The next level is very high, net worth.
So you go high-net-worth to very high.
Net worth individual for this.
It's point three percent.
7:17
Alright, of people, that's crazy.
Now here's what it is in math.
That's one in 338.
So one in three hundred and thirty eight, people is worth between 5 and 30 million dollars.
That's what they have, an investable assets, five and thirty million dollars.
7:36
I'm purposely putting this out there to hopefully counter the Instagram culture of flexing in front of a Lamborghini or Bentley right, whatever because most people are broke.
Like most people are poor and I think that I'm gonna I'm gonna I'm gonna lay out a plan for you.
7:54
That's very simple to get you above this to really just be in the top 1%.
And the thing is is like I said the top 1% income earners are only earned over four hundred and twenty thousand four hundred forty thousand a year depending on where you're looking.
That's per year.
8:09
So for you to get over 5 million, like you just need to live on a lot less than you make.
If you are in the top 1% income earners, you should be in this five to Thirty million dollars within, not a ton of time, right?
And then the the level above that is ultra high net worth individuals which is 1 in 13. 83 and that's what is that, that's point zero seven percent, alright point zero seven percent, right?
8:41
And then finally I'll just finish this little chart out.
Billionaires is one in 468,000 all right?
And in the percentage there is .000 40's 30s 30s, 2%.
8:59
All right now the reason that The jump between the third stage in the fourth stage is so large that the range is between 30 and a billion.
So everyone that's good.
We got between 30 and 2 billion.
Isn't that next level?
And then billionaires, that is the fourth category.
So, these are the kind of like the four layers above the 1%.
9:17
The very first layer kind of gets you into the top one percent more or less, right?
And then above that, you have the varying categories.
The thing is, is that in order for you to get to above five million dollars.
So not even top, It.
But top point three percent.
9:33
All right, one in three hundred and thirty eight.
So you walk into a room there soon, 238 people, you're probably the richest person in the room.
All right.
A Mossad agent quick break.
Just to let you know, we've been starting to post on LinkedIn and want to connect with you.
Alright.
So send me a connection request.
9:49
A note letting me know that you listen to the show and I will accept it.
There's anyone you think that would be should be connected with tag them in one of my or Layla's posts?
And I will give you all the love in the world.
All right, so let's get back to the show.
For you to do that.
10:05
You gotta save like 15 grand a year.
For 30 years, that's it.
And that's assuming just nine percent returns, which is just the stock market.
I just put in the S&P 500 and don't do anything with it, right?
That's not doing crypto that's not that's not that's not learning how to like.
10:23
It's literally just save a you know, $1200 a month and and put it into the SP and do it every month that's it.
If you make four hundred thousand dollars a year, she making 35,000 dollars month, right?
If you live on Five.
10:39
You can put ten thousand dollars and you'll be at the, you'll be at the top end of this, right?
But everyone just spend so much money and so I I just when I see this, it's both incredibly encouraging to me and it also incredibly saddening.
10:55
It's encouraging to me because I feel like genuinely everyone can get to the top one percent which doesn't make math.
Mathematical sense, but it makes it makes realistic sense and you feel like but Alex, how do I how do I save $1200 a month?
Right?
So it's two things, it's income and time, right?
11:12
Net income being like minus your expenses.
So it means it's make more money, spend less money.
The easiest thing, most people do is they just spent too much money, right?
And I know that sometimes you can like it sometimes a parent, depending, if you likes, follow my Instagram or whatever.
But like Waylon I think I was asking for her to give me the numbers from last year but we live on less than 5% of what we make.
11:33
All right and you're like well surely that's because you make a lot.
Yeah but I lived on that when I made nothing right and so I think most people like you should live on 30 grand 40 Grand a year and the thing is is that you already know in your heart that spent making that spending more of the money is not going to make you happier.
11:50
I'll tell you right now, it's not.
And if the point of spending money is to make you happier, I'm telling you, it's not sure like I have this studio.
I can justify it as a business expense, but I did this mostly, because I enjoy it and to me, from a, from a percentage of income, it's negligible, right?
12:08
And so, I got this fancy setup.
Only after I had already crossed three of these levels, right?
I'm saying this because it just frustrates me because I really believe anyone can do it.
I really do.
12:24
You should have to live on a lot less than you make.
And so Anyways, to finish this out, right?
What do you do?
Most times you're going to have to sell something right, either.
You're selling someone else's product or you're selling your own products, either way by say product name, product service, whatever, right?
But either one of those categories and if you make a hundred thousand dollars a year, a hundred thousand dollars a year and you live on 30.
12:44
You can do this, not only can you get into this bot?
Quote bottom level the top 1%, but you can do the top point three percent right now.
If part of you is like, well you know that, then what's the The point of living, it really depends on what you value.
13:01
If like, and this is kind of backwards because it's like the type of person who wants to have more money wants to spend the money they have, then I can understand it.
But then, at that point, just don't yearn for more, that makes sense.
So like don't be dissatisfied that you haven't achieved your goal for me.
What I'm looking at is like how can I get into this category by the time I die and use that to impact Humanity like in a way that's meaningful?
13:25
That's what I'm that's what I'm trying to do, right?
And so anyways I told you the Prius story to illustrate it.
Which is I was a millionaire and living on less than three thousand dollars a month.
Right.
I owns my car, our rent was 1,200 bucks and Layla and I lived on, we bought food at the grocery store.
13:42
You know what I mean?
Like we did, we went out once a week, like it wasn't it?
Like you can do that and live a normal life, like a comfortable life and that was when we were making a lot of money.
And that's because I always have a fear or had a fear that I wouldn't.
I was like, what happens if we start making money?
I don't, I just don't want to lose everything.
13:58
And so I think if you can be satisfied and decrease your Xiety, or make the amount that you spend decrease your anxiety, you will be happier.
So I'm going to leave you with this one piece as a final note on this which is the simple.
Retirement calculator.
14:14
Alright world's simplest retirement calculator so If you live, let's say, let's say that you are currently 30 years old.
All right?
So you're currently 30 and you want to retire.
14:31
All right, so let's say you want to retire soon.
Let's say you want to retire by the time, you're 40.
All right, crazy shit, you're gonna try and retirement Tire 40?
Okay, cool.
I dig it.
So if you retire break for MC retire, but realistically, you're going to work because you like working.
But let's just say that you want, you don't want to have to where you want to work on the stuff you like working on after your 40.
14:48
Cool.
Problem.
The percentage of your income that you spend is going to be the thing that dictates how quickly you can retire.
Not how much you make.
So for example if you make four hundred thousand dollars a year like I said right?
15:05
And you save 10% right versus making a hundred thousand dollars a year and you saving, let's say 80% is what you save, then what your way.
15:22
What you every year, you're adding four years of retirement because it means that you are spending 20.
And saving 80k.
Whoo, that's great.
That means for every year you're getting four years back, which means, if in ten years at this point, you'd have 40 more years, right?
15:41
Once you hit 40, because you had 10 years of stockpiling for each year, right?
You'd have 40 Years of Living.
Now mind.
You, that's assuming that your current level and that the money, that you now have saved up at this point, because you should have 800,000, right?
And that's assuming that none of the money, you had made any money, so probably be closer to like 1.2 right?
15:59
Millie.
The end of that decade that's really conservative style, maybe even two million, right?
At that point that this money isn't even making you money.
That's just literally, assuming a straight decrease in.
How much you spend, right?
That every year which is go down which isn't even realistic, right.
But if you did that, then you get there and that's on a hundred grand a year.
16:17
All right.
That's it on the flip side.
If you're at this 10% guy, then every year he gets one tenth of a year, Right, because you saving 40 and cost him 400 to do a year, which means that this guy is never really going to be able to retire, right?
And he's always going to be stressed or she's always going to be stressed and so I say that only to illustrate one point which is you have to spend less than you make.
16:40
Sometimes the simple shit people don't want to do and it means that you can either have your ego and how you look to everyone or you can have your ego based on the freedom that you feel.
And I know that the vast majority of people will never do that, I get messages every day from people who are like, you know, they've been trying for 10 years to make a million dollars a year rather than maybe trying to make a hundred thousand dollars first, right?
17:02
And the thing is, is to be in the top 1% you don't need to make a million dollars a year, not even clutch, you're not even close new.
You don't even need to make clothes too.
And I was here to be in the top 1%, right?
If you just add a little bit of time, you can get in the top 1% just being reasonable, right?
17:18
You can get in the top point three percent by also being, you know, unreasonable, because compared to everyone else, right?
Just because the thing is, most people are insane in terms of their irrational with their behavior.
And their expenditures, they are stressed about the amount of money they spend in.
17:35
Yet, they are the complete in complete control of how much they spend just spend less and you'll be less.
Stressed.
So anyways, that is my money money message for everyone.
Today, we still continue to Less on live on, you know, 5% maybe 10% of what we make.
17:52
I don't think we live in 10%.
We live on five percent of what we make in.
The thing is is like at that point if you live on if you live in 5 percent or 10 percent of what you make, then it means that literally one year if you are like walk walk with me for a second if you live on ten percent of what you make, And your money grows at 10%.
18:09
Then in one year, you could retire.
Assuming you have a stable income from the savings that you had on the other 90, right?
Figuratively, 115 months, whatever but you get the idea right some accessory buddy.
Like if you live on ten percent of what you make or you live not like you're like, man.
18:25
That's like poverty levels.
It's like yes.
But it's poverty levels in your mind based on your perception, not based on reality of the fact that you're going to be stockpiling money, that will continue to feed you forever.
Along you what, right?
And so the the moral of the story Ori is spend less than you make the the the greater you can create that disparity.
18:47
The faster you can retire or get to a point where you choose to work on the things that only you want to work on, right and getting into the top. 1% is literally a matter of saving 1,000, 1,500 bucks a month in putting in the S&P 500.
It's about it.
19:03
It's all our.
I mean like that's that's it.
That's all there is to it and the thing is, it's so simple.
No one will do it.
That's okay.
But you're a smart cookie and you're going to do it because you think that simple things are usually the keys to the universe, which I agree with you.
19:20
So keeping awesome.
Lots of love you guys.








0:00
Hey guys, real quick.
So Leyland are definitely working on our social media presence.
If you guys haven't noticed and we're just breaking now into LinkedIn.
All right.
It's not as bad as I thought it's actually pretty awesome so far and you guys have been really cool in there and people are sharing our stuff a lot.
So if we aren't connected on LinkedIn, it go ahead and let's connect and let's rock and roll.
0:17
Everything is always our fault as entrepreneurs.
Welcome to the game where we talk about how to get more customers, how to make more per customer and how to keep them longer in the many failures and lessons.
We have learned along the way.
I hope you enjoy and subscribe.
What is going on?
Everyone happy happy Thursday, want to make this video to continue the series on the stakes.
0:37
I have many, many of them.
And this one is it's a hard one and because it's you know, there's everything is always our fault as entrepreneurs because we're the ones who make the decisions and honestly, you know, and ultimately the buck stylist.
Stops with us, right?
Like if you make a bad hiring decision that person, you know, sexually.
0:55
Harassing someone, it's ultimately your fault.
You're the one who's liable, right?
Because you should have done more background checks, or you should have seen it in the way the person acted or whatever, right?
But it is your fault.
And so this mistake was 100% my own.
They are all 100% my own but this one is especially mine and this was because in the gym space, I continue to have, you know, Huge proponent of Data Tracking, which maybe I'll marry these two things together, maybe I won't, I don't know, we'll see how it goes.
1:27
One of the biggest issues is that gym owners don't have good tracking for their data, right?
They don't know what their turn is, they don't know what their revenues.
They don't on the net profit is they have no way of organizing the customers and thing, the messages and organizing between trainers and providing accountability, and all these other things that they have to do.
So they live between except you know, Google Docs, right?
1:44
There's Google Sheets, Google Docs and taping things together and having a process or somewhere else.
And it's just this huge mess, right?
And there are Some serums that are out there but they're usually partial Solutions.
And so I was like, you know what, I'm going to build the best CRM for Jim's.
That's what I'm gonna do.
And I made so many mistakes with this and so I spent the next nine months building out a CRM and I spent about a million dollars in development and way more than that in time and labor on my own team and really my own time because it's this is what I put all my time and effort into is because this was gonna be the next thing.
2:21
And I built the CRM and we realize that at that point, we now had our supplement company and we had our our service company and I realized that I could not open another company.
I was like, I can't do this.
Like, I've already got too much stuff on my plate and so I I didn't make the mistake of opening a third one, but I did make the mistake of making the investment in it.
2:43
And so to this day I have a fully functioning Jim CRM, that's about nine weeks from being done in development and It cost me a million dollars and the lesson that I learned from that is don't bite off more.
You can chew don't get into a space that you don't understand.
So like I'm not a software developer.
2:59
I should have had a software partner not a third-party developer making these things because that person like you need somebody who owns it.
You know what I mean?
You someone who's who's really vested and not just billing by hours and that was a huge mistake for me like massive.
And so anyway, and if you are going to ever start a software company, you need to have a CTO who's a fat like a, you need to somebody has an equity Equity stake.
3:19
Who knows a ton about software.
I'm just telling you That's what you need to do.
You could take that to the bank, but I spent a spent, I think 1.1, 1.2 million dollars on this software.
And that was, I mean, that's a profit money, right?
That's, that's, that's money.
That was, you know, money that would have gone in my pocket and I spent it there, right?
3:35
And I don't have anything to show for it except for this one lesson, right?
Which is don't bite off more than you can chew.
Don't start multiple business at the same time and it also ended up being a huge structure for my team, right.
There were so excited and they're like, they're, you know, not paying attention their name normal responsibilities because they're so excited about this new thing.
3:51
And that was all me and Layla actually advised against it.
She was like, we don't know what that is and I was like, no, it's gonna be awesome.
And so I overpowered and I blew through it and it was 100% on me.
So that was another million dollar mistake that I made in my career.
4:08
And so if you're looking at, if you have something that's working, don't just take that and try and start another business.
Like, take that and figure out what you're going to do with your money, that's not business-related, right?
Like have to create your second game, which is beyond the scope of this video.
Most Nation real quick.
4:24
If you are a business owner that has a big old business and wants to get to a much bigger business, going to 50 $100.
Plus, we would love to talk to you and if you like that would like to hear more about it, go to acquisition.com, you can fly anywhere on the page and talk to one of our team and see if we can help you get there.
4:44
You have to have a game beyond your game, right?
You have the game that's making you money and then you have to have the game that makes your money money, right?
Mate uses your money to make more money.
There's something to be said for reinvesting in your business, but you want to be reinvesting in the things that are already.
What you're currently doing.
You doing more of them rather than doing another thing, another business, another build out another whatever that just adds complexity your business and I've said it before but I'll say it again like scale zero, simple scales and you have to make you have to keep the business stupidly simple in order for it to get Get as big as you want it to be.
5:15
So most of that is saying no and the harder in the bigger you get, the more money you have the harder, it gets to say no, because the things you can do with the more money you have become cooler, and cooler and cooler.
I use the the story, The Woman in the red dress from Matrix.
If you guys seen the movie, you know, the one in the red dress walks by and you know like, you know, turns his head or whatever.
5:34
And the thing is is like at every level of Entrepreneurship, you have to learn how to say, no to a hotter and hotter woman in the red dress, a hotter, shiny object.
You know, if you're making a hundred thousand, A year then, you know pursuing, a 10,000 opportunity.
Isn't nearly as attractive, right?
So you've learned how to say no to that.
5:50
But if someone comes to you with another hundred thousand are your opportunity, you might be like man, that sounds pretty cool too, but by doing that, you'll end up destroying your main thing and so and it literally never stops at every level.
If you're doing 10 million a year and have another ten million dollar opportunity, you have to just say no and it's the hardest thing the world because we're entrepreneurs would love new things, we love excitement and and all of that, but I'll leave you with just even another quote that I like.
6:11
Which is I want to be energized, not excited if I'm excited.
It means I'm emotional which means I'm about to make a bad decision.
So you don't to be excited, you want to be energized, going to be stimulated by whatever you're going to do and most of the times new things are exciting.
And so I automatically try and show those off and this has been a lesson that I have to.
6:27
It has taken me so long, so long to try and learn this because it's I've made this mistake so many times and so yeah, I'm giving you the advice.
I would give myself when I was younger is like find the game, pick the game, do more of the game, take the money that Out of the game and put it into something that you trust and, and just continue to play what you're playing and keep getting better at that rather than trying to start yet another thing in another thing.
6:55
So hope you found that valuable take that to the bank.
Save yourself a million dollars of headaches and I hope to see in the next video.
Bye.
0:00
Real quick.
Because you guys already know that, I don't run any ads on this and I don't sell anything.
And so, the only ask that I can ever have you guys that you help me spread the word so we can have more entrepreneurs, make more money, feed their families, make better products, and have better experiences for their employees and customers.
And the only way we do that is if you can rate and review and share this podcast, so the single thing that I have to do is you can just leave review will take you 10 seconds or one type of the thumb, mean, the absolute world to me.
0:25
And more importantly, it may change the world of someone else unique.
Expensive.
Sticky, air.
Welcome to the game where we talk about it, get more customers how to make more per customer and how to keep them longer in the many failures and lessons.
0:41
We have learned along the way.
I hope you enjoy and subscribe, what's going over?
What?
Happy Tuesday.
Hope you guys are pumped for today's podcast.
Such video I've been looking forward to this for a little bit and if I sound a little bit stuffed up, it's because I have two massive tubes that are like four which is log in each of my nostrils but that was no reason to not give you guys some sick stuff for business stuff and this is mostly just for me too.
1:04
So Always buckle up.
Hope you enjoy.
So today what I want to talk about is the perfect business and so believe it or not, this is actually something I talked a lot about not as much publicly but what I like if we were to ever talk in person and talk shop about business, I love talking about business models.
I love talking about just monetization structures.
1:22
In general bread, Eagle books, specifically about to say structures.
So really excited about it but I just recently finished Berkshire Hathaway University, which is basically the consolidated Add 30 years of shareholder, that Warren Buffett and Charlie bugger the, you know, the co-founders co-chair, birds, Etc of Berkshire Hathaway, they do these yearly shareholder events and you guys are both billionaires.
1:50
The other both of their hide IDs, which is crazy, they've been investing, for 50-plus years, investing for 50-plus years and they've built a, you know, kajillion Dollar Empire, I think, as of today, it's worth half a trillion which is just nuts their return on Capital was Two billion percent.
2:07
So they started where they where they acquired Berkshire.
Hathaway was a publicly traded company at the time was textile company.
They the stock was $19, I believe actually know they offer to buy War buff it out at $11.30 are like 50 anyway.
2:23
It doesn't work point is is that it was between 11 and 20 dollars, right?
And at this point that same stock is worth three hundred seventy seven thousand dollars.
All right?
So that's a that's a 20,000 He's returned.
So if you so his odd put ten thousand dollars in, it's not worth 200 million.
2:40
All right, that's how crazy this is.
And over, you know, 30 years of shareholder things, there's many times where he gives little nuggets of wisdom of what he's looking at, what he's buying a business, or what he, what he believes to be valuable businesses.
And I was really, it was cool for me because I have always had three made things that I look for businesses and in reading his book or the book that was about his Shareholder meetings, I added to to, to that list.
3:08
That's why I wanted to share those with you today.
All right?
And the moniker that I have had for this is but I'm going to share with you is unique.
Expensive.
Sticky.
3:27
Err.
And I said there's five, there's four words here.
That's okay because I'm going to show the last one as but unique expensive sticky are.
So what I'm looking for like in my mind of what a perfect business is its unique expensive, stickier, and I've explained each one of these.
3:44
So unique is something at all, I'll even tell you what.
I think you said it is shareholder.
Be that I found really just it was just so so short and so like packed that I loved it.
He said in response to what is it ideal business.
And one of the one of the meetings he said something that costs a petty Sells for a buck, it is habit forming.
4:03
It was so succinct, it's so great and reading some of other stuff.
He's got other other things but that one was three of the five in three sentences, right?
Some of the cost of heady sells for a dollar and his habit for me and I just like, it's just so great.
4:19
All right, so let's let's break this out.
So something that costs a petty so that would be like are something that cost you almost nothing to make.
All right.
It's expensive.
Meaning you could sell it for a dollar so cost you a petty, could sell it for a dollar and it's sticky.
4:37
It's habit for me.
People come back and keep buying it again and again and again, right?
Which means very long lifetime values, all right?
That's that's what he's looking at initially.
Now the the unique part is something that if you listen to some of his other stuff is he likes to have big competitive modes.
4:53
All right?
So what's something that's, you know, what's, how can I find are for a Eddie sell it for a dollar that people come back.
You want to keep breathing and no one else could sell it.
So it's Unique, are, right?
Acai are that anyone could sell its specific to the to?
It has a brand behind in that node could copy.
5:11
It has share of mind, he talks about that a lot like Geico and we were in here probably does.
Like, you could say 50% or more by switching to Geico.
You've heard that because he tedx to their advertising budget, as soon as he bought the whole thing and just had them go on a bass of ripe age, then they could take over my chair.
5:28
Go as grow proportionally and so this is four of those features right?
Unique expensive sticky are something you could make for a petty sells for a dollar is habit for week that no one else can replicate.
And for me this is just so cool.
5:47
I'll talk about a couple of the features of this in a second.
You know what?
I'll talk about it now.
So one thing that you'll notice that this is for all the newer entrepreneurs or you know really fuck it.
Eddie entrepreneur Who's interested in this kind of thing, notice the gross margins.
6:02
He's talking about right?
A lot of people quote feel bad for charging for things that don't cost that much, which is a terrible mindset to have you charged with the market will give you, right?
So if for example, you know you find this these widgets like these Peds and you know that you get them from someplace to try to they cost you a dollar if someone's willing to give you $100 for it.
6:25
Do you feel bad?
Take it.
Like well, if only they do markets are built on information advantages information and efficiencies meeting one person.
The seller knows more than the buyer.
That's that's how these things work a lot, right?
6:42
And so I noticed this because, you know, you're you listening to one of the best investors of all time, if not the best investor of all time and he looks for like 100 to 1, right?
Cost of petty, sells for about 100 to what it costs.
One penny, one percent cost of goods compared to what is being sold for.
6:58
So 99% gross margins that for me was actually very very interesting is that he doesn't go for like an 80% or 90%.
He goes for 99% and for perspective.
The difference between selling something for a dollar that cost you ten cents versus selling something for a dollar that cost you petty is that that you know it's just I'd percent more profitable to sell something you know so dollar that costs a petty versus a dollar, the cost a dime, it's actually 10 times more profitable.
7:30
It here's here's why a bit of explain this is that for one unit of cost The petty one kid sell 10 times the about for that would cost.
So does that make sense?
So if I were to sell 10 pennies worth of my cost, it means I make ten dollars.
7:47
Whereas ten pennies worth of the other example of a dive is only one dollar and that's where the things that people don't understand about margins, right?
The gross margin of the product that you have like every increment where you go from.
When you go for a 90 to 95 percent, gross margins in a business, you double the profitability of the business.
8:06
That's what's crazy.
Hey guys, real quick.
If you're new to the podcast, I have a book on Amazon called 100 million-dollar offers that over eight thousand five star reviews.
It has almost a perfect score.
You can get it for 99 cents on Kindle.
The reason I bring it up is that I put over a thousand hours in the writing that book and it's my biggest gift to our community.
8:25
So it's my very Shameless way of trying to get you to like me more and ultimately make more dollars to that later on in your business career I push the partner with you so that's my give go check it out Amazon and back to the show.
Right?
It's so that's why this is so important right now.
8:43
If you try for examples, look at your prices right now.
Let's say, I want to get to if you're at 90 and you say I want to get to 95 percent gross margins.
Now let's say costs you.
Right.
Let's say it costs you $10, right?
For your for your thing, right?
8:59
And you sell for 100, that's 90 percent, gross margin.
So $90 is, is margin for you. $10 is cost, you sell 400, all right, so if you wanted to get to 95%, Gross margins.
What do you think you do?
Would you add $5 to be 105?
No, that's not bad to get to 95 percent gross margins.
9:17
You'd have to sell the same ten dollar think for $200.
That's what people don't get about margins, right?
It's so what I like, what I would we would, we would turn gyms around it.
What and what not, I don't have guys who are at 66 percent margins, that's usually where most people are.
And that's horrible by the way, and I would say we need to get you to a tee, and they would see 66 to 80 only 14% only, Present.
9:39
You just saw me double the price from 100 to 200 get 5, right?
And so that's, that's how important these margins are.
And so, to hear this man say, I want something that I could create for petty sell for a dollar that's habit.
For, we get people keep buying over and over again for the rest of their lives and that no one else can buy because it's Unique, right?
9:58
That was pretty cool.
And so, these are the four head of components of the business itself.
But the last thing that Buffett talks about, and he talks about this a lot.
So, we'll draw a little dotted line here, dude.
Dudu Dudu is the person who is running it.
All right.
And he has three characteristics that I saw him repeat over and over again for the management or The Operators.
10:20
All right.
And they have such a brilliant model of managing, right?
Because Berkshire only has like 19 employees or something like that.
So it's stupid to.
They have a gazillion.
They did eighty eight billion in profits last year, think about that idiot.
Billy the second most profit, the entire world, like a 20-person company because they're so good at abdicating were supposed to just basically delegating out.
10:39
Buddy them to the businesses that they bought.
Now, he turns out a lot of deals, but what he looks for it operators, this is why, I think this is cool.
Is that what he looks for?
It operators, we can look for it ourselves.
We could create that in ourselves as entrepreneurs, right?
We could think, how can I embody these characteristics?
10:56
Alright, and so, the first of these characteristics is he says what somebody's risk-averse?
All right, because he said many times, Any things times 0 is 0.
He's like you can have 30 years of a great track record and make one bet that goes to zero and lose it all.
11:14
And that is why he's so risk, averse.
And I had a mentor.
Who told me something, what's that?
I just loved.
He said Alex, you should only have to get rich once.
And for some reason that just like that hit different, only have to get rich once and so at the smartest best of the world feels that way too.
11:32
You should be risk, averse.
He's like, I give I give up bigger opportunities all day long to cover my doubts.
I'd all right, the richest people in the world.
I'm telling you this right now, if you don't have access to people who are worth 100 million a billion, I do and I will tell you how they think.
All right.
It's all about downside risk.
11:50
Mitigation they will give up, they will give up huge returns to not risk losing money.
And the funny thing is, that poor people think the exact opposite, they go for the lottery, they've basically 100% guaranteed downside, right?
What did 300 million of winning?
12:06
And they do it all the time, right?
And one of the things that Buffett says it's like if you if you if you bet poorly small, you'll bet poorly big which I love that too.
Right so anyways, number one Management's, So we think about ourselves, how can I be more risk-averse?
How can I make sure that I can't lose, right?
12:22
It's much more important to not lose than it is to win.
And what's interesting is that if you don't lose long enough, you kind of win by default, which is kind of interesting, which brings me to the second point, which is Long-term thinking.
So the reason that they like family-owned business specifically, is that families, think about Generations.
12:43
They think about passing it down between, you know, Father and Son, parents and kids, right?
And they like those businesses because they don't cut quarters, they think about quality.
They think about long-term investment long-term competitive strategy, they're not thinking about quarterly earnings and, you know, it basically a short-term gratification, which is what most of the stock market.
13:04
Companies are forced to do because they have to Pander to to stock stock holders, right?
And so if you can't, I've talked about this, some by other podcasts shifting from CO2 investor.
But one of the most beneficial things that I have done for my mental health, and for the success of my business is thinking in a long-term time Horizon.
13:22
And I can't tell you that, I'll tell you that of the people that I encounter the longer, their time Horizon that they talk it.
The wealthier more successful.
They are invariably.
So what I talk to somebody at all, they're thinking about is this week at the next two weeks, payroll and what they're going to be this about the last.
13:37
But I already know that they don't make a ton, right?
And it's because that's all they thinking, right?
And then then they get from there, you get to a slightly higher level entrepreneurs, they're thinking in quarters.
Okay this quarter this will we can't focus.
I think this court is all we got is that we get it right?
13:53
And that's fine because the smaller you are the less stable yours more volatile, right?
But over time as you expand those Horizons, right?
You'll be able to make better better decisions because you'll start thinking, well, if I did this for five straight years, would it be reasonable that I would with probably right?
If I do this consistently for five years, do I think that I will?
14:11
It would be unreasonable, that I will be able to be far past.
Bye-bye goal, probably, right.
But most people still think of these tiny chunks of time.
It can never get ahead.
And they sped month after month after month, for 30 years, trying to become millionaires, rather than just set a goal of like, well, let me just see if I can increase by it by income by twenty thousand dollars in the next.
14:29
Year, right.
And then next year, after that I'll try and increase it by another twenty thousand dollars and they do that by you know and in five years you have a top 1% income but only 99% of people don't think that way which is why only 1% do.
So anyways number one for the baddest bitch that their risk averse, they will take, they will take the loss.
14:49
They will not take the opportunity to avoid the loss.
Number two, they think it long-term arises, right?
And number three, They've unimpeachable character.
Which I just really like that as a word unimpeachable.
15:06
Character.
And if you, if you listen to or talk about, About about about losing buddy.
He said, if you lose money that will be forgiven, he said, but if you lose me a shred of reputation, I will be ruthless and he's, he's so so big on this.
15:25
And I think that's, you know, these, these these kind of three things come together, people who have unimpeachable character are not trying to get rich quick right there.
Trying to build something of value.
The try to build something that's a during something, that's the long-term, and they're honest.
15:41
And so what happens though is that when you have on a peach, Will character.
It's actually an intangible that has compounding returns and I'll explode either the, he talks about it for his own business.
He's like the fact that our checks always clear that we do what we say we're going to do allow us to get access to more deals because more people want to work with us, right.
16:00
And we did we close deals faster and so the thing is is that your reputation over time becomes a competitive advantage and that's what's a unique.
That's a sustainable and compounding competitive Advantage because someone Stuck with the word for 10 years compared to somebody stuck with there were 30 years whose word is worth more the 30-year guy.
16:19
So once you stuck with you know who's done everything had but unimpeachable character, 30 years compared to guys did it for 60 years who has the stronger word, the 60 or guy.
It's something that if you could develop it literally compounds with time and it's and it's his opinion Priceless and I think he's a very good value were of things.
16:36
And so anyways, the perfect business model, I'll give you a quick recap.
Its unique expensive sticky year, That's managed by somebody whose risk-averse long-term thinking at has unimpeachable character, all right?
So something that you could create for a petty sell for a buck, that's habit-forming that no one else could do and you do it in such a way that you don't take short term risks, you think long term in terms of how you're going to invest in the business in the Legacy at building something of value and not not obsessed with short-term volatility, but for long-term learning, and finally that you do it in such a way that people will think Think everything that this matter has done has been fairly earned and wisely used.
17:18
And so with that, I will leave you with the perfect business.
Hope you enjoy.
This will be of how this valuable.
This is one of my favorite things to talk about and keep being awesome.
And if you're in the arena, keep getting up.
I promise.
You will get better over.
Time.
Lots of love, I'll catch you guys soon, but

What's going on?
Everyone really pumped to tell you one of my strongest and most powerful tactics in Persuasion that allows you to use Integrity, to increase the trust in your prospects, by owning all of your deficiencies with a single statement.
0:55
All right?
So, So many times, if you think about how you're selling someone the degree to, which they will buy is directly correlated with how much they trust you especially in a B2B scenario where, if I said, hey for every dollar you give me you'll make 10 back.
If I, if someone truly believe that that every single person would buy from me, right?
1:14
Because there's no logical reason not to.
So underpinning that is whether they believe me or not and that can be within the context, whether they believe in themselves versus the system, versus the world, there's other sub beliefs there, but fundamentally.
If those three things Line and they truly believed in their core then they're going to buy, which is the same reason that when you have a referral that gets on the phone with you, it's so easy to close them because the person who referred them has already imbued you with trust, they've already vouched for you.
1:40
And so the person comes in the Sky High trust and really just you just need to get out of their way so they can make the purchase.
And so I learned this tactic from Eminem in 8 Mile and you can see it at work and I'll give you a couple of prominent examples but it's using the word.
1:56
But all right, and this is the concept of damaging admission, which is probably my single favorite technique to use in Persuasion because it allows me to be even more honest than I.
Otherwise would be in a world of, like, Charlie decisions where people are always making huge promises and making huge claims, and never kind of being real and authentic.
2:18
With people, you stick out like a sore thumb in a good way, right?
And so let me give you a statement really quickly and then we're going to, I'm going to show you how to you.
To reverse it in order to make it more persuasive.
So let's say, I said I'm going to make you, you're going to make a ton of money if you work with me, but it's going to be a ton of work.
2:38
There's gonna be hundreds of hours of videos.
You're going to have to go through.
There's five hours a day that you're going to have to spend, you know, to to execute each of the things that I'm going to tell you to do, right?
What happens is in that statement, I directed your attention to all of the Things that you're going to have to do right now.
2:58
If you noticed, it was positive statement but - statement.
Now if you reverse these things and go - statement but positive statement the but acts as an amplifier for the second half.
Let's try it on.
Listen, if you sign up for Jim launcher, you sign up to work with me, you're going to have to go through hundreds of hours of videos.
3:19
You can have to take five hours a day, you know, to work and do these things but you're going to make more money than you've ever met in your life.
Life.
The thing is that but and then the statement, when I say something - I was on a date for example, and I was trying to persuade a young lady, you know, back in the day before I was married I might say something like listen, you know, I sometimes I have a temper.
3:42
I can be, I can be short at times.
I don't have a ton of time to get dedicate to a relationship right now because my business is taking up the majority of my time.
But I'm absolutely fantastic bad, right?
If I said something like that, the thing is the more negatives.
3:59
I can say in the beginning, the more believable.
The thing that I say, right afterwards is right?
And so if I own all of my negatives, which is why I love this because be truthful in the things that you were saying that are negative in the more true, they are and the more damaging they are the more believable the thing that comes after the sentence wheel clockwise.
4:22
You guys already know that I don't run any ads on this and I don't sell anything.
And so, the only ask that I can ever have you guys that you help me, spread the words we cannot more entrepreneurs, make more money, feed their families, make better products and have better experiences for their employees and customers.
The only way we do that is if you can rate and review and share this podcast, so the single thing that I have to do is you can just leave review but they can 10 seconds or one type of the thumb.
4:45
It means the absolute world to me.
And more importantly, it may change the world for someone else.
All right, and so the way to use but because everything that happens here after the word but is Amplified, all right, and everything.
5:04
That is before the word but is diminished.
So you had.
So the good thing is you can actually control where your prospects attention is going.
So this is where we're we're we're directing them is after the word but and so yeah I do this sometimes you know the word because actually really similar to to this in a different way.
5:25
I'll use it in another video but if I say something really horrible trying to Something else, let's see here, I'm really hard to live with.
I absolutely do know house chores whatsoever, but whatever I say right now is something that you're going to believe, right?
5:48
And so, when you use this to your advantage and you weave this into your copy, especially as you get closer to your call to actions, people will believe you.
And fundamentally this is what will make your copy so much more persuasive right?
Like For example, Jim watch has tons of one star reviews.
6:06
We also have but we also have thousands of 5 Stars, right?
And so the question is, whether you want to eat at a restaurant that has 4.7, you know, stars with 3,000 ratings or you would eat at a place that has five stars with 19, right.
6:22
I would rather eat the 4.0 4.7 star.
Same thing with you about Amazon, right?
Because the damaging admissions, the reviews that are - give Credence to the things that are positive.
So let me give you a really famous example.
That Viagra had in some of you guys may know this commercial but it's literally it crushed for them, right?
6:40
Some of you guys may remember that they had a warning label at the end of their advertisements that said if an erection lasts longer than four hours you know must contact a medical, you know, professional right?
And so the beauty is there was a genuine risk, right?
6:57
But in making the risk, they amplify the power of the product.
Every single guy, I heard that warning and was like, I I have an erection for four hours like sign me up, right?
And so would be like the same thing as saying like, you know, warning, you know, when you sign up and start working with Jim, like, you're going to massively increase your tax burden.
7:16
All right.
So like, like we are not liable for the amount of taxes that you're going to have to pay his resolve.
The amount of money we're going to make, right?
So it's the negative consequence of the positive that amplifies the believability of the statement.
If we're warning people that the extreme adverse effects of the of the, of the That were promising in an extreme fashion than it makes the the underlying believability of whether or not they're going to achieve it seemed assumed right?
7:43
And it makes the entire set of sentences or the preceding argument more persuasive right in a believable.
And so ultimately, this is one of my favorite persuasion tactics and I love it because it's so based in Integrity, right?
8:00
You're just saying all of the things that someone is going to to find out.
Eventually you might as well use those things to increase the persuasiveness of your argument, right?
And so I wanted to leave this with you.
I hope you found it valuable keeping awesome.
Try it in your copy.
Try it, when you're presenting something in a sales presentation and I guarantee you, you will have a prospect to believes you.
8:20
Much more is more likely likely to buy.
So lots of love and I'll catch you on the flip side.
But








0:00
What's going on, everybody?
I'm bringing some more books, but I wanted to say that, if you haven't checked out Hunter million-dollar offers, I would definitely suggest that you start there.

I think it's so valuable to to pay for mentorships and pay for, you know, people who are ahead of you two to give you perspective that you lack because a lot of times its beliefs, it's the things that you don't see that kill you, right?
0:42
And that and that prevent you from succeeding.
Welcome to the game where we talk about how to get more customers, how to make more per customer and how to keep them longer in the many failures and lessons.
We have learned along the way.
I hope you enjoy and subscribe.
What's going on everyone?
I want to tell you a story that was really impactful for me earlier on in my life and my business.
1:00
Your and it was when Layla and I went to the Pirates, have Mastermind.
Now if you've ever listened to my podcast or been on this channel, I've talked about this before, but it was one of the most impactful experiences of my life.
And it was because I had multiple mentors, who made more than me, speak belief in to me, and also maitre that I capitalized on the fat pitch.
1:20
Alright.
And so I'll tell you how this one.
So I was Leyland, I just got married.
This is 2017.
May, we had just gone from, you know, me almost losing everything.
Thing to this business that we just shifted from a done-for-you flying out, doing Jim turnarounds to a Consulting service teaching, other people, how to do our model and we were doing we would like in our second month and doing three hundred fifty thousand a month.
1:45
It was insane, and it was just Layla me and an assistant over the selling over the kitchen table, it was absolutely bananas.
I didn't even know if we made more money than, I know what to even do with it was it was crazy.
You know, I mean, we're living on $1200 a month.
And taking home 340 of 350,000 was it was crazy it.
2:05
So anyways I got invited to an eight-figure Mastermind and clearly if you're doing the math there I'm not making any figures and I felt like really out of place.
I was like, are you sure you want me to come?
And he was like yeah, dude, you're going to like he's like you're gonna blow past a figures know like really.
And so first person has spoken to me was Russell which is why I'm always grateful for that.
2:22
And so he saw something in me that I couldn't see for myself, which is why I think it's so valuable to to pay for mentorships and pay for You know, people who are ahead of you to to to give you perspective that you lack because a lot of times its beliefs, it's the things that you don't see that kill you, right?
2:38
And that and that prevent you from succeeding.
And so anyways, we get to this event.
I'm super nervous is because all these guys are like Titan and they're all doing, you know, 10 million, 20 million, 30 million.
And I think Russell the time they think they're doing 35, to show you how long ago it was.
Because I think they're doing 150.
2:54
And I got up there was finally my turn and I you know, I wrote on the board I told Our whole process worked at how much money Origins are making on average and Jason flat lien.
Actually, I'll start with Al Sharpton says, I'll sharpen was in the room.
3:10
He's like you have 100 million dollar business right now and you don't even know it.
And I remember feeling like the air was sucked out of the room because I felt all of a sudden.
I was like really proud of what I've accomplished, but all these guys make so much more money than me that they were.
3:25
They were like, dude, you need to like, you need to step on the gas.
It was like, why there?
Like you got a huge thing in front of you.
If you, if you like like you need to take advantage of this and at the time I was saying how I was like, okay, we're making 350 a month and I'm going to start a supplement company and they're like, why would you want to start something company?
3:41
Just double your ad spend because you're not paying spending anything on house right now.
And I was like, okay, I guess I'll do that because I listen to these guys because it made more money than it was like, all right.
And so that wasn't my end.
Also, rather than starting another business, I just kept doing the thing that I was doing, which ended up being amazing piece of advice for them to give me.
3:57
And I probably would have sabotaged myself.
I had not For that.
So it's like, if you ever have the opportunity to spend more than you probably comfortable with, to be surrounded by people who make a lot more money than you, you will almost always disproportionally.
And every time in my life, I have always disproportionately moved up faster when I can surround myself and figure out, I want them to speak into me and tell me what I cannot see right?
4:16
I'm like, tell me what I'm missing.
What am I not seeing that?
You can see, right, because for whatever your business is right, or whatever your skill set is, I'm sure that there's if someone who's, who's doing something that you are very good at, you can immediately see what's going on.
It does it takes you 2 seconds, right?
You're like, oh, this is what's wrong.
This is Runs strong.
When I look at a business.
Now, I can be like, oh this is, he's right?
4:33
It's immediate but I did when you don't have the context, you just run your head in the wall.
Wondering what's going on, right?
So anyways, after the my little presentation was over Jason, Flatline came up to me and he had done a hundred million dollars on webinars and I was like, man, this guy's super smart.
He was, you know, he's really aggressive and bright and I was like, man, we gotta figure something out or I don't want to say anything stupid and so he was, he comes up to me and he said, You need to 10x overnight.
4:59
It was like what he said, if you what you're saying is true and you're making Jim's this much money, he's like someone bigger than you, who already has all your customer base is going to take everything you have and distribute it.
Like what?
He's like, they're going to take everything you have and just destroy you before you even have a chance.
5:17
And I just felt even worse after this rifle, this pit in my stomach and then he leaned into me and he said, when it, when it gets easy, as when you go hard, and I remember how much I was shaken by that Layla was right next to me, and I was like, when it gets easy, as when I go hard, when it gets easy, as when you go hard and the biggest gift I got from those guys, there was that this was my fat pitch.
5:42
Real quick guys.
If you can think about how you found this podcast, somebody probably tweeted it told you about it.
Should it on Instagram or something like that?
The only way this grows is through word of mouth and so I don't run ads, I don't do sponsorships, I don't sell anything.
I only ask is that you continue to pay it forward to whoever showed you or however you found out about this podcast that you do the exact same thing.
6:01
So if it was a review if it was a post, if you do that would mean the world to me and you throw some good karma out there for another entrepreneur.
Right.
There are only a handful of opportunities that present themselves in the course of you know, entrepreneurs career where you have the opportunity, you have the skill and like basically the Stars aligned right now that being said, you have to develop the skills.
6:24
So that, when the opportunity presents itself, you can knock it out of the park and step up to the plate.
But when I listen to, you know, Warren Buffett, and he talks about the Investments, right?
They choose very sparingly, what things are going to invest in, but when they do, they backed the Load the truck up.
6:40
They go all in, you know, you find your sphere of confidence and you just get pitches all day long, right?
Just like a baseball analogy, you get pitched over and over, but you have no strikeouts, right?
There's no way to strike out.
You do have to wait and wait and wait until you get the perfect pitch.
That fat pitch that's in your sweet spot and then you step up and you knock it out of the park.
6:57
And if you look at the people who are the wealthiest in the world, invariably the vast majority, Made their money with one vehicle.
They made all of their wealth or the vast majority of wealth with one vehicle and then after they made their wealth, then they Diversified right?
7:13
And so this is one of the big issues that I feel like I see in the internet culture and Instagram culture.
Is there like you got to like they you know, billionaires have seven, you know, revenue streams.
Yes but they didn't have that to get there right now.
I have lots of revenue streams but I didn't have that building this, right?
7:31
And so the idea is that looks much more like an umbrella.
You have got one Straight path.
All the way up on one vehicle where you're all-in invested, which is your business most of the time or your career and then it balloons out, then it umbrellas out.
And then you sprinkle those investments in other thing because you're overly leveraged in one business, but every single one of the, most of the guys that you see all of them came from one, one thing that made their money and then they sprinkled it out on top of the other vehicles.
7:58
And so if you listen to Gary Vee, even he talked about one of his biggest regrets was, how when Google ads for really cheap that he should have spent more for one library and all of these things, kind of the collided at the same time, in my life where I had, you know, I'm listening to Gary.
He was saying, you know, I wish I had spent more right?
8:15
And I had Jason saying, hey when it gets easier, as we need to go hard, all these guys are going to take all your stuff and then you know, sharp and saying, hey you've got a hundred dollar company and you don't even know it.
And then, you know, Russell's like you're going to blow past a figures and all of this stuff was spoken in to me, when I was just a kid, like, you got to understand, like, I didn't do anything.
Like, I knew nothing, we're doing 30 thousand months and I was like, holy crap, like What is going on?
8:35
Is this legal?
I don't want to mess it up, like it was just like holy you know and and so but because of their encouragement rather than a distract myself and start another business, right?
All we did Is We I followed what they said, I 5 x Mi Mente and and then it just took off like a frickin rocket.
8:56
You know, I mean, we went from, you know, 352 1.5 million in the next like five months as in per month and so it was just bonkers And I just listened to what they had said.
And so my my takeaway from this and me sharing this story is that I don't know what pitches you have in front of you.
9:14
There are only a certain amount of times where we're going to get that fat pitch.
And I think we might the point of this video is that if it is easy for you right now, this is the time to step up.
I was talking to some entrepreneurs that were younger and not that long ago and they went from, you know, next to nothing.
9:32
I think not next enough.
I think they were doing.
That sounds horrible.
What about to say so they were doing like one or two million dollars a year.
I didn't mean it like that but their last month they made like 20 or 30 thousand dollars in the last month of the year and then the next month, they'd hit this offer out of the freaking Park and they they did three million and they did five million the next month in Revenue.
9:51
I mean, that's its sanity.
I mean I've never heard of anything growing that fast with alligator JV, you know, like some sort of joint venture thing like, never in my life.
I've heard something go that fast.
And they were like yeah you know we're trying to like enjoy the fruits of our labor and you know kind of like not spend a ton of time on the business, you know what on the business and I want it and I got to have the opportunity to be the older person the situation because I could see in them.
10:17
What I imagine people saw on me which is like you've got a hot one right now.
Like you need a ride, it hard.
Like, when like strike, when the iron is hot, right?
When the fat pitch comes, you step up and you put everything.
You've got into it and Like this is not the time to try and figure out work-life balance, because you're going to have this finite window, we're going to make disproportionate amounts of money.
10:38
We're going to make your generational wealth in this short Gap.
And we just have to hope that when that opportunity presents itself, we take full advantage, right?
If you're going to California and during the gold rush in 18-49 and you start panning for gold.
You start getting gold.
That's not the time to say, you know what, I've made it, I'm going to stay home.
10:55
I'm only going to pan, you know, for gold, an hour or two a day, of course.
Not right.
Because you'd be like, I gotta pee, It.
I got to take its time, it takes much gold out of this.
River is humanly possible.
It seems obvious to us from the outside but when you're in it you have all these other things that are going on in your mind, right?
And the thing is that opportunity like many are finite right?
11:13
There's defined period of time where it you're gonna be able to ride that wave and be early on it and crush it.
And so most people who are very wealthy had one big pitch that they swung hard on and and then after they've made it then they sprinkle the other investments just don't try and reverse engineer the wrong sequence and so anyways, I hope this is valuable for you.
11:33
It was a huge moment in my life.
I don't know where you're at.
I don't know if you're fat pitch is coming.
I don't know if it already came and you wish it's one harder or you're on the plate right now in the balls right.
In front of you, I don't know where you're at, but hopefully this this story that changed my life, can help someone else.
11:48
So anyways, lots of love keeping awesome.
I'll catch you outside but








Company0:00
Real quick.
Because you guys already know that, I don't run any ads on this and I don't sell anything.
And so, the only ask that I can ever have you guys that you help me spread the word so we can have more entrepreneurs, make more money, feed their families, make better products, and have better experiences for their employees and customers.
And the only way we do that is if you can rate and review and share this podcast, so the single thing that I have to do is you can just leave review will take you 10 seconds or one type of the thumb mean, the absolute world to me.
0:25
And more importantly, it may change the world of someone else.
Here's for reasons that I like, I like affiliate relationships a lot, welcome to the game, where we talked about it, get more customers how to make more per customer and how to keep them longer in the many failures and lessons.
We have learned along the way.
I hope you enjoy and subscribe.
0:41
What's going on, everyone?
Happy Thursday, wanted to rock and roll with you and give you a little breakdown of one of the, one of the hard decisions they have to make early on in business, which is, when do I start referring business out for services and products that my clients want from me?
And so this is difficult because obviously, it's Huge amount of time and money to start another business, which is different than having another product line.
1:04
So I'll differentiate that first.
Then I'll give you the for kind of reasons that I do like affiliate relationships instead of starting a new business.
So a product line is serving an existing customer at a higher or lower level, right to solve a this a similar need the same need in a different way many times, right?
1:22
And so this like an upsell which is different than a cross on upsells, they hire very higher version of the same thing, right?
So if somebody was doing Group Training and then we I sold them personal training that would be a higher version that's an upsell right across.
So, would be going from, you know, Group Training to nutrition coaching, right?
1:37
That's a cross-sell.
It's a, it's a, the same person solving the same need of getting in shape.
It's just another vehicle, right?
So, those are, that's the difference in upsells and cross-sells.
Right now, let's say I wanted to really get into, I don't know.
Food prepping, right?
1:55
Or apparel, something like that.
Whatever.
That's like that's like a couple because one is a, like, both of those.
The first examples I gave our service-based businesses that use the same resources, right?
And this is key, is that if I'm creating a new product line, right?
I'm using the same resources, they already have.
Now when it becomes a new business is when you have to have new new people, right?
2:13
New resources and new product lines were Capital expenditures, meaning you spend money to start the new business because I mean fundamentally, Like a business becomes over time, the bigger it gets a business within many smaller businesses within it, right?
2:29
That's how it becomes bigger right now that I'm talking more once, you're once you cross 10 million plus, but that is ultimately how it becomes.
But the point of this is actually not about the product lines, but when should you do that versus when should you find a partner when I say partner?
I mean, like somebody already has a business not getting into business together and becoming a refer, or of business and affiliate.
2:49
And so, here's for reasons that I like affiliate relationships a lot.
One many times.
The opportunity cost of starting that thing might be very high, right?
As in like, I might be making more money from my existing thing.
Then I might make from building out, you know, some new solution, right?
3:08
And I've made mistakes with this in my life.
Like, for example, we have a meals company and its really not that profitable.
Like I mean, it's it's we make basically nothing.
I mean it's almost a non-profit for us and so, you know, Happy that we can provide that, you know, service to our gyms and their clients, which is great.
3:28
But if I could do it all over again, I would have just said, go find somebody local and just not try to solve that problem, right?
Or instead I would have partnered with a national company and said you know give us a discount or referral Commission in order to make this introduction, right?
And so, the first one, the first reason that I like affiliate stuff is that I have no cost of providing the value.
3:48
All right, number one.
Number two is that I can benefit from the value.
By stacking a ton of offers of other people's businesses just for me, introducing them into my core offer.
So let me give you a different example.
Let's say I was a chiropractor and I had a you know, two thousand dollar pain pain.
4:05
You know release thing that I sold people in the came in for you know, 12 weeks, or 18 weeks or whatever, right?
Now let's say I think to myself well what other things that someone actually need while they might need, let's say food prep stuff, they might want massage therapy, they might want the Orthotics, they might want a better mattress, they met all of these different things that they would that they would naturally.
4:23
By as a consequence of starting to work with me, right?
So what I do being the enterprising, you know, chiropractor that I am I go to each of this business isn't I need to go.
She ate a favorable deal because then I take a group discount of all my customers and negotiator all their their behalf.
So and so by doing that I can guarantee get them a better deal than they would get on their own, right?
4:42
Because like most businesses would give something away just to get a customer.
But I'm going to give a lot of customers.
I want something even more than that, right?
And so there's two things that we can do here one is I could say I'm just gonna use a simple example.
Let's say I got a massage therapist to give me two free massages for every you know just so that I can send someone over with an attractive deal, right or half off for massages, who gives it, you know, whatever.
5:04
Right thing is is I can bundle that thing and say that that's a real true hundred and fifty dollar value, right?
150 bucks that no one is going to question that it's worth that, right?
And then if I take the, you know, a free pillow from The Mattress Place to guess to get people to go in because they probably give something like That away then I'll have this orthotic pill that I get for free, right?
5:25
And on top of that, I have the shoe company that gives me the insoles that are moldable, but then they have better ones that are customized, whatever, right?
Each of these things is.
So now when I'm presenting, my final offer to my customer, I have all of these things lined up that cost me nothing, right?
And not only that I can negotiate with them.
5:40
Not only to get the discounts but to also get paid for every person that I send their way using this promotion, right?
So not only do my customers benefit, I can sell my entire package is more expensive because of value.
Right.
My customer.
I then get paid from the business, right?
5:56
And my customer gets a discount, so it's literally just like everyone wins, right?
And so that is the second reason that I like affiliate relationships.
You guys love that you're listening to the podcast.
If you ever want to have the video version of this which usually has more effects, more visuals, more graphs, you know, drawn out stuff.
6:16
Sometimes it can help hit the brain centers in different ways.
You can check out my YouTube channel.
It's absolutely free.
So check that out if that's what you are into and if not keep enjoying the show, The third reason is that it's all profit, all right?
And so if you think about how much you make from your business, right?
6:33
Some businesses run at 10% or 20% margins.
Many times you can negotiate far more than that for an affiliate relationship.
A lot of times, you can get 30, 40, sometimes, even 50% of total revenue, depends on the type of product and you cost of fulfillment.
But for many times you can get that and when you think about how much you make from your own business, sometimes it makes more sense to just be an affiliate and get that Revenue.
6:53
Like for us we make about a million dollars a year.
Pretty much passively just in Reducing businesses to Partners that we would do anyways, right?
We think they have the best product.
And so we just reach out and say, hey before I go send all these people because I think you could product like what kind of deal can I get them?
And what kind of deal can you get me, right?
7:09
And so I like meeting in the middle.
I like saying, let's say if we get 20% off all my customers, get 10 and I get 10 to and so everyone wins, right?
And this is very common, you know, practice, if you look at influence from working, when they say, give 10% off, they also get Kickbacks on that.
And so that's the third reason that I like affiliate relationships.
7:27
The Fourth reason is that?
It's incredibly flexible and so what I mean by that is If for some reason, something changes, let's say I was with a massage, the massage person or they give me for massages for my clients.
And I find another massage person who's better, right?
7:44
Because I'm going to Philly, I can just switch where I'm pushing my clients and there's no problem and I keep my clients needs first.
And so it makes it really easy for me right now counter that with an imaginary situation, where I owned a massage, you know, sub Clinic underneath of my chiropractor.
7:59
I use one of the offices for that right there.
Just as an example.
Now, if I didn't have the best product, which happens sometimes because maybe the massage therapist, that you hired isn't, that good or whatever, right.
You then have this kind of like moral conflict and this cognitive dissonance where you want to believe, that what you provide is always the best but you have tangible proof that there's so many better down the street and you're not allowing your customers to do that.
8:23
And I think about how much I'm paying the massage therapist and I've got cost and got insurance on that stuff compared to what I could just get from getting from referring the business, down the street and getting paid on that.
Sometimes it just makes more sense to have the flexibility on top of having the best product because it ensures that no matter what you're always serving their clients the best way.
8:40
And so those are the four reasons that I really like having affiliate relationships.
I can provide more value, it gives me more flexibility.
It's all profit.
And ultimately, I can see, I can provide more to my customer than I otherwise could at no cost to me.
8:57
And that's the beauty of this, right?
And so anywho I say all that to say don't stop.
Under the business, make a relationship still solve your clients problems while still being able to focus on your core game and more times than not, that will be to your benefit.
9:13
I'll give you the one, you know, quick exception.
Which is like, if you are sending a disproportion amount of Revenue building, a huge amount of Enterprise Value where the amount of Enterprise Value from the new thing that you are sending surpasses, your existing vehicle, that it makes sense.
At that point, that you would want to swallow up that Revenue stream, but many times that is not the case.
9:29
And it just would benefit you to just simply take the the small Kickbacks and commissions that they send your way for making the introduction.
So otherwise hope that made sense.
Lots of love, keep being awesome.
And I'll catch you guys on the flip side but the small Kickbacks and commissions that they send your way for making the introduction.
So otherwise hope that made sense.
Lots of love, keep being awesome.
And I'll catch you guys on the flip side but








0:00
Real quick guys.
If you can think about how you found this podcast, somebody probably tweeted it told you about it.
Should it on Instagram or something like that?
The only way this grows is through word of mouth and so I don't run ads, I don't do sponsorships, I don't sell anything.
I only ask is that you continue to pay it forward to whoever showed you or however you found out about this Pockets that you do the exact same thing.
0:19
So if it was a review if it was a post, if you do that would mean the world to me and you throw some good karma out there for another entrepreneur.
So just imagine lose everything you have in a week.
It was horrible and this is just after I had kind of come I'm out of my barely getting out of bankruptcy situation.
Welcome to the game.
Where we talk about it, get more customers how to make more per customer and how to keep them longer in the many failures and lessons.
0:38
We have learned along the way.
I hope you enjoy and subscribe.
What's going on, everyone?
I have an exciting topic for today.
It is how and I guarantee that anyone who makes the shift will make significantly more money for the rest of their lives.
All right, so this is a good one worth listening to when I was doing Jim launch, which is when I started the original, Jim altricial my company.
1:00
This after I had my chain, I would fly out to facilities and fill them up, right?
And then we scaled up to a team and then we'd fly out to those facilities and scale them up.
And what's interesting is when I had my chain of gyms and I built them not to make money, I built them to build a business, right?
1:19
That was kind of the mindset.
I was like, I want to build a business.
And so what's interesting is, I continue to grow the business, but I didn't make much money.
I mean, I made it enough, but I didn't make a ton of money.
I will say this is that whenever I got into a hard spot, right?
And this may, you may identify with this one, we're going to do a hard place was like, I didn't have enough money in there, was payroll coming up.
1:38
I always found a way to make money, right?
And like, never failed and never missed payroll.
I never miss Trent, you know what I mean?
Like I always found a way and the same thing happened with Jim Lunch when we were flying out, we always found a way.
1:54
And what's interesting is When Jim wants was growing, I got into this horrible position and so, what ended up happening was I, you know, when I was selling, you know, we'd fly out.
I talked to the gym owners and we'd kind of help them with their business shift, everything around it cetera, right?
But then as I skilled up in, then I had sales guys, you know, flying out and doing the sales of these facilities, right?
2:13
For 30 days.
We'd fill their gym up.
And the thing is, they didn't really have the same, you know, rapport with the gym owners, they weren't gym owners.
They're like, hey, I'm here to close deals and which is fine.
That's, that's, that's okay, you know, I mean, it happens.
But the problem was what would happen is they would sell people on, you know, a challenger or program and the gym owners would after they left after I've done, you know, we'd already fronted the cost of the marketing, the hotels, the commission's, everything and sold all these people in their gym.
2:43
Some of the gym owners told all of the clients that we had sold to refund and then and then buy it again through them which you might be thinking that sounds dishonest and the answer is you are right.
It is dishonest.
And so So I think in a matter of a week I had like two gyms do that and I think I'd like 100 or 150 thousand dollars in refunds and mind you like I think I had a total of 150,000 or saved up and so this is like everything I had it happen in a week, so just imagine losing everything you have in a week.
3:09
It was horrible.
And this is just after I had kind of come out of my barely barely getting out of bankruptcy situation.
So I got her the gyms I'd started the new Enterprise that money had disappeared because a partner had taken it out.
And then I was basically left with 1100 dollars in I started Jim launch the way.
3:27
This company had grown, I was able to grow it back up at 150,000 and savings and then boom, it's all gone again, right?
And so I share this with you because I know what it's like to lose everything.
But what's interesting though, is that when that happened the reason this got worse and worse, is that even before I had those two gyms that told everyone to refund, there was still a high percentage of people that were refunding like an egregious amount.
3:50
We were at like 25 percent and the reason was Because we'd a satisfaction guarantee with the program, but I had no control over the foam.
It so I had, you know, gym owners who were coming to us who were struggling, so they probably weren't that good of fulfillment, and then we would sell people under their gyms and then they weren't that good at fulfillment.
4:07
And so, people would just say, like just give me a refund, I don't want to do this, right?
And the thing is, they had no skin in the game because it was all my money.
Not, there's right?
And so they were like, yeah, whatever.
Refund.
And so we start a huge refund rate and what ended up happening was the refund rate basically surpassed the margin of the business.
4:23
And so let's say I had it Twenty-five percent refund rate in the margin of the business was 12 and a half, right?
And so, all of my margin was gone based on these refunds.
And so, in order for me to make up the additional 12 and a half percent, I had to sell more in advance to cover the deficit and if you're thinking ahead here, you know where this is going basically.
4:41
Every month I had to sell more to cover the refunds from the last month and so this is what is called a death spiral, right?
I didn't know how to get out of this trap that I had woven for myself.
And it was horrible, it was horrible.
I could.
I mean it was I could I had I was stressed sleeping.
It was, it was really not fun.
4:58
And honestly, I just was like, I was like I went from having nothing to now having less than nothing and not knowing how to get out of.
It was just an unbelievable feeling of being trapped.
And so anyways, I thought I was like, I just have to make money.
Let's say I just have to make money to get myself out of this.
And so what was interesting is I made the shift and I said, you know, and this is where Layla she had a little side business, selling Fitness online.
5:21
And I said, why don't we why don't I put all my, my, my Getting in sales efforts towards your business.
Instead of this business because we can, you know, basically cut the middleman out of it will just sell direct to Consumer and it'll be fine and so believe it or not, we ended up doing about 1,000 a day within 14.
Days directing all that attention to her business.
5:38
Sounds like this is awesome.
We've got these, you know eight guys.
We can shift them over and we'll do a thousand a day.
And this could work.
We can make this pivot and so but I still needed to cover this huge deficit which at this point was probably like a hundred thousand dollars that I was gonna have to come up with and I had nothing because I discovered the last one.
I'd A couple hundred thousand dollars of profit, right?
5:56
Not Revenue.
I'd have a hundred thousand dollars of extra juice to be able to put towards this, you know, throwing the logs of this fire right?
Of refund monster that was growing.
And so the thing is that when I thought from that perspective I ended up coming up with a solution really quickly.
6:12
Which is like well, you know what, I'll just bundle all the stuff.
I'll call those gyms back up and say hey remember how I put all those people in your gym, want me to show you how to do it and then you can just buy the information for me and I did this as like I'm getting out of the Jim industry concept because we were doing well with the online thing and what was crazy was when I thought from the perspective and this is the entire point of this podcast, all right?
6:34
When I thought from the perspective, man, I really just need to make money I made the money.
Hey guys, real quick for those of you guys who are 100 million-dollar offers fans I love you.
I added in a lost chapter that has never been released.
6:51
I'm releasing it now transparently.
I'm doing that to build hype 400 leads but you will have the unreleased chapter, it talks about your first Avatar and how to segment customers to make more money.
You can get it by going to acquisition.com forward slash leads its hope free in exchange for email so that can email you when we launched under Miller, All Leads and so that you can not miss out on it.
7:12
Because last time I sold out for like 8, Weeks really fast.
So that is my way of making sure that y'all get first dibs.
And it was one of the most profound lessons that I've that I've learned as an entrepreneur is that most entrepreneurs don't think about it like that.
And so what I mean by that is like, I'm sure there's been times like I said earlier that like, you needed to make payroll or you need to make rent or you needed to, you needed to buy something and you had to go generate cash, right?
7:37
And then you boom, you want in generated the cash.
What I can tell you between the people who I think, who I've who have observed were very successful, we have lots of money and people who have businesses, but don't make that much money.
Is that the people who are really successful always are in that mindset.
7:56
There are always trying to think about how they can make more right from the business.
And I'm not saying that from a, from a, from a selfish standpoint, a thing like that, obviously, you have to do that provide value, you know, etcetera.
Like that's that's a that's a foregone conclusion in this conversation, all right.
But Plea making the extra effort, right?
8:13
So this is, this is like when you're, you know, if you have a business and you know, you run a, you run a flash sale or something like that and it works.
Well well why aren't we doing this?
Once a quarter rise in this systematize diff we know that doing this extra little promotion and we do this on a 12-week Caden's, we can get four times these amount of pops and we can do this on a regular you know, like a Cadence then then we're going to be a lot more money and so it's it's like think about the thing and this is a good exercise that I do a lot which is like if I really needed to make Money, like I had to make money.
8:43
What would I do think about it?
Like if you can think about that within your own business like right now if you had to go pay for something that's that's a lot of money relative to whatever your income is.
Let's say let's say it's three times.
What your normal monthly owner cash flow is like, what you take out of the business area with whatever that number is think about if you had to double it or triple it right, what would you actually do?
9:05
And what's interesting is that for me, I think very differently when I'm posed that question rather than how would you grow the business, right?
And what's interesting is that they shouldn't really be separate questions, but they are because growing a business versus making more money are for some reason at least for me, separate Concepts, right?
9:23
But the thing is, is that it's takes money to grow a business, right?
And so when I start from that perspective, and what I lead with, like, okay, I if I had to make money, I had to because my Life depended on it.
What would I do?
Oftentimes that focus and Clarity cuts through all the noise of all the extra doodads and and be asked and productivity stuff that we just put on our calendars to just get straight to the gold, right?
9:51
That you cut, straight to the middle and grab what you need and then it's that mindset.
At least repeated systematize over the span of a business will make you significantly more money.
And so, ultimately, Obviously, we made that shift and we made a tremendous amount of money.
10:08
What was ironic to me?
Was that when I started Jim watch, I had learned the lessons from my gym business, and from the gym.
And, and from the first version, the gym launch business, what size?
Building a business does not make you wealthy.
Now sure I had Enterprise Value, but what I had forgotten about was the massive, operational risk that I was taking on, right?
10:29
So whenever you're running a business, you are always exposed to operational risk, which is I mean every gym owner and every small business owner has brick and mortar in covid experience.
This right?
Is that there are risks that are unforeseen that you are exposed to unknowingly that you take on while you perform business which means that next month, something might happen.
10:46
That could that could cost you everything you have, right?
And so this is where I transition from.
I'm going to spend everything I have to Invest in the business to I'm going to pay myself and I'm going to make money while this wall this grows because if I don't, it could end and I could be left with nothing, right?
11:02
And that's exactly what happened after I had, you know, my chain of gyms.
I mean, I wasn't left with nothing.
I had some money, but like, it wasn't, it wasn't a lot.
And then I ended up making a poor decision and then losing it, right?
And so at that moment, I had I had built, I'd put all my energy and my sweat, and my tears, my time and sleeping on the floor and all of these memories, right?
11:20
For nothing.
But it wasn't for nothing because I got the experience.
And so this is why I'm telling you this is that hopefully you don't have to do that for four years and have nothing right to show for it except for one lesson, right?
And that's what I'm trying to explain right now.
It's like if you can keep this lesson of like I should pay myself, right?
11:39
And I should think from that perspective, how can I actually make money from this thing rather than just building this thing?
Then I think you'll be much better off and so I didn't even learn it the first time, right?
I had to learn it.
Learn it after to really we big failed businesses failed.
You know what I'm saying?
11:54
Like, oh, I didn't make the independently wealthy and it was when I started the this business that I that I came into it.
With the perspective of, okay, I'm going to grow this thing, but this thing has to feed me to write, I'm not just going to take on all the risk for everyone for everything and have no upside for me because hoping and dreaming that you're going to sell your business as your way of profiting.
12:19
Less than one percent of businesses sell.
It's just, it's such a small percentage, it's laughable, right?
And so, if you think that you're going to bet everything on the 1% chance that you're going to, you're going to be that 1% that sells your business.
And I don't even know the metrics are to be fair.
I'm quoting a quote that I was given, but I would bet.
12:37
Like, if it's that one percent, then I would say it's the one percent that like the sail is Meaningful.
You know what I mean?
Not just like an asset sale or a garage sale.
So if you're betting your entire business or your bet your entire future, Your income on this one percent shot.
12:53
I don't think it's the right mindset to take and so you should get paid while you grow.
And this is a concept that Warren Buffett talks about a lot, which he calls it owner earnings, which is how much money after reinvesting in the business to keep its competitive Advantage.
13:10
Can I take home as profit, right?
And that is what he values a business off of, which is how much owner earnings from now until Infinity.
Right?
Until the end of time.
Will this business produce?
Right, because it's not fair to just say well this business produced a million dollars in profit but I have to reinvest a million dollars into new R&D, you know, research and development to keep us competitive.
13:31
Well, if that's the case, then you're not really make anything besides your salary, right?
And so then that business doesn't have really much value and and Charlie Munger and Buffett talked about this extensively, and I think it's like you have to experience it firsthand or for these things to be real for you, but I'm trying to, hopefully, give you the experience via this story so that you don't have.
13:49
To but if the best investors in the world think about owner earnings and when you need to make money and actually take cash out, you know, how to do it, you have the ability, you just don't have the belief.
And if you can make that shift, like it wasn't like I became more skilled, you know?
14:05
I mean, it literally, I started women from from launching gyms in person to showing gym owners how to launch their gyms within within a week or two.
Wasn't like, I got that much smarter.
It was simply because I had a shift in beliefs and as soon as my belief shifted, I was able to make A thousand dollars something you know in that in profit in that next like a couple weeks to cover all these refunds and then I was like holy cow wait I can have a business and make money and that was that was kind of the light bulb moment for me and I was like, oh, I'm never doing business the other way again.
14:35
And so I tell the story to hopefully you know share that experience with you so that you don't have to go through it like I did.
But anyways, if you, if you are a business owner you have it within you.
You already know how to make the money because every time you You need it.
You always do.
And so simply think, like that every month and I guarantee you'll be significant more profitable because the dream exit, you have a 1% chance of doing it.
14:59
But you taken a profit this month, you can absolutely do it because you already know how to do it because you already have.
Alright.
So anyways, lots of keeping awesome.
I'll catch you guys soon.
Bat.

Hey guys, love that.
You're listening to the podcast.
If you ever want to have the video version of this which usually has more effects, more visuals, more graphs, you know, drawn out stuff.
Sometimes it can help hit the brain centers in different ways.
You can check out my YouTube channel, it's absolutely free.
Go check that out, if that's what you are into.
0:16
And if not keep enjoying the show, my conclusion was, I wouldn't read a book unless I executed everything in the book, welcome to the game, where we talk about a get more customers how to make more per customer and how to keep them longer in the many failures and lessons, we have learned And along the way.
I hope you enjoy and subscribe.
0:32
What's going on?
Everyone happy whatever it is that you were watching this.
I get messages all the time, all the time and comments about what are your favorite books and maybe in another video or podcast.
I will do do an exploratory, you know, I mean of the books that have been most influential.
0:50
But if I'm being honest, I didn't really start reading a ton until after I had made a lot, a lot of, you know, a relatively high amount of money, right?
And, and I started reading when I had more time, right?
So it would be kind of backwards for me to say, hey, these are the things that create My Success.
1:07
When in reality, I feel like I started reading when I have the time and be like, oh, this is really interesting.
And so I think that to kind of make this story full circle.
Before I even started my first business, I was definitely a Seeker which is like you're just looking for something, you're searching for something.
1:25
That's because you just realized it's something's wrong with your life, right?
And that's kind of how I felt when I had My job my consulting job which is what I took after college and during that time period, I read all the time.
And I remember realizing after six or 12 months of just reading book after book after book of self-help and, you know, personal development and like all that kind of stuff that my life was literally the same.
1:48
And I remember this is like kind of like a jarring moment for me because I just sat there, I finished the book and then I thought to myself and it was like, the Happiness Advantage or some, you know, whatever.
Right.
And I was like, my life is not Different than it was before I started reading these books.
So I thought about it for a while and I also realized that half the books, contradict each other.
2:07
And I was like, man, this is really difficult.
And so what I ended up my conclusion was, I wouldn't read a book unless I executed everything in the book.
And so, what ended up happening next was I became very, very selective about what books I would read, because I would, I wouldn't get another book until I have felt like I had executed that, and so the result of that was, instead of reading lots of books, I started reading a handful of Books, A lot of times.
2:31
And so that was really transformational for me.
I think the first book that I read a lot of times was how to make friends and influence people and I still think to this day, if you just did nothing else in business but just practice what is in that book you would be phenomenally successful.
Like you did me like if you just did the things that are in that book, you'd be phenomenally successful but that's kind of more like personal.
2:50
You know, personal traits and character traits and whatnot which I think are very important for you know growing developing but In terms of skills.
Right now, I'd say the number one, you know, number one.
And number two things that I get asked about are like, hey, how did you develop your skill of marketing and how to develop your skill of sales.
And truth be told, I never did a single sales training, I never read a single sales book before I started selling and so that's I wish.
3:15
I had like a really sexy answer for you but I don't I just started selling and I didn't even know that what I was doing was selling.
I was just like, how do I get people to sign up for my gym and give me money like I don't even know that.
I'm with sales at the time I was just like I have to get them to give me money.
And so I think a lot of people spend way too much time in the like deliberation stage and like the trying to their, you spent all your effort in that I would say like productive procrastination space of just like thinking you're getting better but you would get so much better.
3:43
Just doing it, right?
And so I only like and people now respect what I have to say about sales because I've sold so much.
Not because of how many books I've read on sales, right?
And so, I think that once I was considered very Very good at sales.
I had, you know, I was managing multiple sales teams and we were doing, you know, a few hundred thousand dollars a month.
4:02
That is the first time I bought a sales product, like, think about that.
And I went through and I was like, oh, this is good stuff, you know?
Like there's there's stuff in here that way we can use like neat, but like, I don't think it fundamentally changed how good I was at selling.
And I think that that's because so much of selling is about convictions about how much you believe in the product more so than like the the Judo chops, right?
4:22
So, how much you care about the Prospect and how much you care about the product and convinced that the Of them.
Because if you truly talk from a space of genuine care like genuine care about a prospect you won't convince them to do something that they shouldn't do.
And if you genuinely believe that your product or service is going to help people, then making the sales, very easy because it's like I really care about you.
4:41
And I really know that this product works and so let me just like, help you connect these two dots.
And so that's like, ultimately like that is what selling is and should be.
The problem is most people don't believe in their product and they don't care about their prospects, right?
And so because of that, they come into all this cognitive dissonance meaning like Like they believe themselves to be good people, but at the same time, they need to make money and then those two things become at odds and that becomes really difficult to sell.
5:03
Because now you're you're faced with a moral obligation to like your family, you know, to try and provide and then against yourself to be ethical, right?
And that becomes really hard for people.
That's why a lot of sales guys get burned out when they find out more about whatever they're selling.
A Mossad agent quick break, just to let you know that we've been starting to post on LinkedIn and want to connect with you.
5:23
Alright.
So send me a connection request.
A note letting me know that you listen to the show and I will accept it.
There's anyone you think that would be should be connected with tag them in one of my or laila's posts?
And I will give you all the love in the world.
All right, so let's get back to the show.
And so that's why a lot of times sales, guys will start start out hot and then crashed just because they find out that they were selling with the what they were sold to sell is actually not what it really is cracked up to be.
5:47
And then once they find that out then all of a sudden that's that's why in my belief, there's way more churn and sales people than would otherwise be necessary if they were all selling something they believed in.
Right?
So back to the main point, which is, what do I do if I don't like if I have no way of, you know, practicing, well, I mean, honestly, when I when I want to do I think what I do is I buy a course about how to do something and then I follow the course and do it.
6:13
So if I wanted to make a webinar, then I bought a course on making webinar and then I followed the course to make the webinar.
And so I learned the skill while I was going through the course.
I don't think there's a lot of productive time and usage in learning stuff for the sake of learning like it's and I don't even I don't even make the argument that you don't even truly learn it until you've applied it.
6:34
And so like, how do you know if you read six books on sales and they have different Oh geez.
Which one is is the right one?
Because you've never tested it in the battlefield, right?
It doesn't make any sense.
And so, like the same thing with marketing, I never, I never bought a copywriting course.
I never bought any courses on how to build landing pages.
6:52
Never bought any courses on how to run ads.
The only thing I did was I spent, I spent money one-on-one to get someone a trainee, literally how to click to run ads for my gym.
But I learned a little bit, I learned enough on my own and so, that's the thing is, like, I think there's definitely a space for one-on-one training.
7:08
I think the biggest gains I've made have been from investing in people who are above me to break my beliefs, about what was possible because the people were above you most the times are not going to like, not gonna hold your hand and teach you how to write copy.
This is not going to have, you know what I mean?
Like they might edit, you know, copy you have if you have like a one on one relationship, something like that.
7:26
But for the most part, like it's going to be up to you to go acquire the skills and most of the time acquiring the skills comes from doing them, which means you're going to suck for a while.
And I think just most people aren't willing to try because they think that if they are perfect they'll somehow Fail the first time which is stupid because even when you're really good, you're going to fail.
7:41
So it's just people like procrastinating and reading books about something that they haven't done is a productive way of feeling accomplished without actually doing anything.
And so, I say all this to say, for the many people who ask me, what are my favorite books on sales and marketing?
7:57
My favorite book on sales is to get out there and start selling, right?
Because if you start selling and then read a book on sales, it will make for more sense to you than trying to read a book on sales before you start selling because you won't even know what Are talking about, all right, same thing with marketing, right?
Like if you, if you want to go and learn about marketing, the best thing to do is start, you know, learn how to run an ad, you run it, add to a landing page and then start getting some people who give you their contact information and then pick up the phone and call them like, you know what I mean?
8:24
And the easiest thing to do in my opinion is the advice that I got from Ezra Firestone years ago which is give yourself a slush fund, right?
Give yourself a learning budget which is how much am I willing, to quote, blow this month on failure.
So I can learn the skills faster and whatever that percentage is might Ten percent of what you make every month, maybe 5% of might be 25%.
8:41
It just depends on who you are and how stable your income is.
But if you just say I'm willing to give $500 a month to learning the skill, then you don't have this like emotional attachment to whether or not you crush it your first time because you're seeing this $500, a month investment is truly that an investment in your education, your investment in trial, and error, rather than, you know, like I bought this course for copywriting.
9:03
I'm not a millionaire.
What's wrong, right?
When in reality, you just have to get out there.
Start doing it so anywho.
That's my, that is my two cents I made.
Most of my money before I started reading a lot of books.
I would say Jay like seriously, I read maybe 30 bucks before we, you know, we're Deca millionaires, you know what I mean?
9:20
And so I wish I had something better for you, but I, I focus most of my time on doing and applying and when I start applying, then I will go read for specific solutions to a bottleneck that I have rather than trying to learn in a more focused topic by reading words for multiple books and trying to get perspectives different.
9:38
Eagles on problems.
I've never even encountered yet, right.
I think it's much better to encounter the problems.
Then start seeking the solutions and trying to cover every solution to every problem before you've even started the race.
So anyways, hope you found it valuable for the made sense, lots of keeping awesome, and I catch you guys soon.
But








0:00
Hey guys, real quick.
So Leyland are definitely working on our social media presence.
If you guys haven't noticed and we're just breaking now into LinkedIn.
All right.
It's not as bad as I thought it's actually pretty awesome so far and you guys have been really cool in there and people are sharing our stuff a lot.
So if we aren't connected on LinkedIn, it go ahead and let's connect and let's rock and roll.
0:17
These people actually spend less money.
They have, they have less desire to spend money.
Welcome to the game, where we talk about, how to get more customers, how to make more per customer, and how to keep them longer and the many failures.
And lessons, we have learned And along the way, I hope you enjoy and subscribe.
What is going on everyone?
0:34
Today, we're going to talk about a fun topic, which is, I got a message yesterday from somebody who said, you know, who's dead broke and was like, what do I do?
All that kind of stuff.
And so I think I've talked in the past, I'll probably do another one about when I, when I've lost everything.
What I did step by step to I think the after I lost everything, the next month I did a hundred ten thousand dollars in sales and that's are not sales.
0:59
I was Collected in the next in the next 30 days.
So, like you absolutely just need skills, you can have nothing else in your life and a beautiful thing is that no, government can take it from you.
No person can take your skills from you in a divorce.
Those are always your own, which is something that I don't know.
1:16
For some reason, feels magical to me.
And so one of the things that I've seen, as I've kind of, you know, moved moved up, I'm not saying that arrogantly just, you know, it's just developed progressed.
Whatever is that the people who I surround myself with now have More money than the people that I surround myself when I was early on in my career and what's ironic is that these people actually spend less money.
1:38
They have, they have less desire to spend money and they find ways to acquire things for less money out of pocket.
And that's always really interesting to me.
And so, right now, I think there's, you know, if you were to, if you were to look at quote investment opportunities, right?
1:56
You could, you could, you know, invest in buying So let's say, let's say you've got, I'll do two scenarios.
All right, let's say you've got fifty thousand dollars, all right?
And you're like, okay, I'm thinking about buying a house, right?
And I think, for first house, you might only have to put 10% down, I'm not sure it's 10 or 20.
2:16
Yeah, I do remember.
But anyways, let's just say 10 for sake of whatever.
So, five hundred thousand dollar house.
All right, you put 10% down and then you get the mortgage, right?
You get the liability of the mortgage payment every month, yippee.
Now if you were to, if you were to and let's say that in order for you to save that you've been making, I don't know, 60 Grand a year and you've been saving that for you know five years, something like that.
2:39
Now let's look at an alternative scenario where you are still making that same amount of money 60 and you saved up 50 and instead of buying a house you have a long conversation with your spouse and you say, or maybe you don't have a spouse, whatever with yourself and you say, I wonder how much money I could get for this money, interesting, right.
3:02
And so you've you Leaf through the businesses that are in your area.
And by the way, the best way to do that is one you should contact Brokers not necessarily to buy a business, but to get an idea of some of the businesses that are in the area and what price range is look like.
But if you buy from a broker, you're going to pay retail, you could definitely negotiate a deal and I'll tell you one of the deals that I did that was really good at the end of this.
3:25
But Anyways, so let's say, you know, you reach out to some businesses things that you like or enjoy your feel like you have some specialized knowledge in and you find out that there's a business that's doing, let's say I don't know, two hundred and fifty thousand dollars a year in in profit right and because it's a small local own business and you're not going to pay retail for it.
3:52
You get it for two and a half you know, times earnings, right?
Which Could be, what's two and a half times its 5:25.
Hopefully, I think two-and-a-half know that 625, excuse me, six hundred twenty-five thousand dollars is what a business you might pay for businesses doing. 250 thousand dollars a year in profit.
4:09
All right.
Now here's where it here's where it's interesting, right?
So I had an early Mentor, who taught me this negotiation tactic that I've used pretty much from throughout my entire life since this moment and I used it in the deal that I'll tell you about in a second, which is agree on price than agree on terms, right?
4:26
And so when you, when you would go to quote, talk to this business, right?
There's there's the price which you might say cool, you know, this business 625 and then there's terms, right?
And so the term side once you've agreed on the price, you negotiate down whatever.
And then you say, okay well I'm going to need you to seller financed.
4:45
Meaning you're not going to pay anything, you're paying overtime, right?
I need you to seller finance you know, three quarters of the deal, all right?
And so 3/4 of the deal, man.
Doing some math today but like 400 and you know 30-ish 437 whatever thousand dollars.
5:04
And you're going to finance that for, you know, three years, right?
And then on top of that or five years you can do whatever you want here.
I think I mean you could probably I mean you try and push it out as far as you can, right?
And then what you have remaining which would be like in this instance two hundred thousand dollars, then you get a note from the bank right?
5:25
Or SBA loan, which you have a two hundred thousand dollar loan for and you put your your fifty thousand dollars down, right?
So then that would be 250.
Which would be 25% of 200,000.
So I'm going to recap this 625 is the cost of the business, you know. 437 you get seller financed meaning you can pay that over time and then you've got two hundred thousand dollars that you get a loan from the bank.
5:48
So what you put fifty thousand dollars for.
So if you're thinking about this, the guy who's selling the business he sells for 625 but he's only getting two hundred thousand up front.
You're only putting 50 of that 200 in you're taking a loan for the rest of it, right?
And so when you're looking at this, you've now acquired this business that makes two hundred and fifty thousand dollars a year, right?
6:11
So you upgraded your income from 60 to 250,000, right?
And within, you know, 24 months, all of that, you know, income will be yours and maybe hopefully, you'll grow it.
Or you'll probably try and work extra hard and take over some of the some of the other positions or cut out some of the waste etcetera and the business.
6:31
And and and so that Massively speeds you up in life, right?
And if you compare that to what it would cost you to start your own business in terms of investment and like existing book of business, client lists all the knickknacks, you have to buy that you don't even think of zoning permits and all the feasts and licenses, it's actually pretty decent deal.
6:56
Most Nation real quick.
If you are a business owner that has a big old business and wants to get to a much bigger business, going to 50 $100.
Plus, we would love to talk to you and if you like that like to hear more about it, go to acquisition.com, you planning on the page and talk to one of our team and see if we can help you get there. so, I'll tell you one of the deals that I did.
7:21
That was pretty good.
So I had four locations at this point.
This is one of the gyms and I opened a fifth location.
So the first two locations I opened.
I open the first one I think for forty thousand dollars.
I mean I put I didn't I put as little as I possibly could in this thing and it happened to have been old gym.
7:38
So there was like Turf already in the flooring was already in.
It was painted like there's a bunch of things I didn't have to pay for.
So I lucked out there and but the second one because I thought I was smarter, I put 200.
We put 250,000 into the second location and here's the fun thing.
7:54
It made no more money than the first location dead, which I always think is hilarious.
So, like to the undisciplined, everything looks like a spending opportunity.
It's I pretty much an empty my bank account.
And, and so on my fifth location, my next two locations were corporate locations tracks.
8:10
You pretty cheap, which is pretty cool.
Those are, those are good deals but the fifth location that I did, I had a gym that went out of business or he's not out of business.
He wanted to Uproot because is it got divorced or had some, some family crisis and so he's looking for someone to buy his gym and so it was beautiful.
8:29
It had all this equipment that was really expensive in it.
I was like, man, this is like a dream come true.
And so I agreed on price because I had my mentor, talk me through this agreed on price but I think was 40,000.
I think it was 40 greatest 40 or 50 think it was about.
So that's what I agreed.
And then I was like cool.
I'll pay you over the next year.
8:46
And he was like, fair enough.
And so, I mean, you didn't say it like that, we negotiated and then 12 months is what we, what we came to.
And so, I mean, I try to go for 24 months but he agreed on 12.
And so the beautiful thing with that was I didn't I didn't put any money out of pocket.
9:03
So, you know, my first year, I put 50 Grand in second gym I put two hundred fifty thousand dollars in fifth gym.
Smarter more experienced me puts no money in, right?
And in the first 30 days, we'd have 51,000 in sales.
So this gym in the first 30 days, literally paid for itself period, right?
9:19
And so this thing that is now kicking off profit, right?
Every month during this during this whole period of time.
And then 12 months later, I ended up meeting Russell and telling him how I was doing this stuff and he's like, you should be teaching other people how to do what you're doing now.
And so I ended up selling the gym for one and a half times more than I quote bought it for right, which I then had the gym pay for it on its own.
9:42
And so I basically acquired a cash flowing asset for Nothing and then had just acquired a cash flowing asset for for no money.
And so I think about that in light of the original thing that I mentioned was just like, I get, I get people who mess with me all the time.
Like, what happens if I don't have any money?
9:58
I don't know what to do.
You always have to just get skills?
Or this is just my opinion is that?
Because there's no one who can take them from you, there's no divorce, there's no government, there's no Revolution.
There's no financial crisis that can ever take your skills from you.
And that's why, when entrepreneurs hit zero, they can usually bounce back.
10:13
I've done it.
Eleven hundred dollars in my bank account at one point at my, at my lowest point, after I had six gems right after this.
So even when I had this experience, and it sounds cool.
Like, I messed up and, you know, that's why I think I love the saying, you only should only have to get rich wants and and that's why people who are wealthy, are more risk-averse.
10:35
Because the downside risk of losing everything is always bigger, right?
Like you can reverse 30 years of great decisions with any number multiplied by 0.
Any number multiplied by 0, you have a billion dollars if you make a bad investment goes to 0, right?
And so that's why when people are like, I don't know why you're motivated and I don't know why they're like, it's just there's, there's just always things that can happen, you know what I mean?
10:59
And so, just being risk, averse is what I have noticed from the people who have the most money is that they actually have way lower risk tolerances than the people who have no money, which is hilarious, because it's like, the people with the least amount of money then go buy lottery tickets, which are Literally the worst investment you can possibly make and and, and they consistently invest their money in a terrible investment.
11:23
That has all the downside risk of going to 0, whereas the richest people in the world find things that could never go to zero and they buy them 40.
So think about that for a second, people are using their money.
Poor people use their money to buy things that have virtually guaranteed, you know, risk of going to 0, right?
11:42
With tiny risk of upside.
Right, right?
Whereas rich people buy stuff for zero dollars that have upside potential but that doesn't, that doesn't have a billion-dollar upside potential.
They would rather have a guaranteed small return with no risk.
11:59
Then a potential for huge return with guaranteed risk.
Think about that.
So anywho, I think, if over time and it's not like you can shift your perspective on this overnight, it took me a long time and I still am doing it now in shifting, how like I still get excited about You know I see these you know, these these these cryptocurrencies 20 texting and stuff you know in like a month and I'm like man that's crazy.
12:23
But then I also think like well the downside risk of me going to 0 is far more upsetting to me than me getting 20 times more on some tiny investment that I would make and so I don't do it, right?
And so anyways, I say all this to say agree on price, agree, on terms, try and get something for nothing.
12:44
Saying see if you're going to, if you're going to make an investment and any kind or you're trying to start a business, there's usually a business that's already for sale or has a motivated seller an owner who doesn't want to do it anymore.
Who almost give it to you for free, right.
And that's the thing is, when you're new, you're getting so excited, but you're not patient, right?
13:01
That's why you have to have the character traits of being successful before, you will see the success.
Because if you, if you have that character trait, you'll look, and you'll say, I can take six months because in the, in the decade of mine, the next decade of my life, there's no rush.
At me making a good deal or a bad deal of like, should I put all my investment in this thing?
13:19
Or should I be able to get something that makes four times more money for free?
You can do that, you can do and I'm telling you, I talk to business owners every day.
I mean guys, making a million two million, four million dollars a year, who literally have told me.
They're like, dude, if someone came today and offered me, like guys were making a million dollars, a million dollars a year in profit.
13:38
Like, if someone had offered me, 200 Grand right now, I would take it.
I just am so tired of this business.
So like there are Two knees, they're just not listed anywhere.
Just got to look for, right?
And that's the thing, no one will do it because it's work.
So, but the good news is that, if you have a little bit of work ethic, you can make a tremendous amount of money with very little risk and do it the way the rich people that I know, do it.
14:00
So otherwise have an amazing day, keeping awesome because she has looks like but








0:00
Real quick.
Because you guys already know that, I don't run any ads on this and I don't sell anything.
And so, the only ask that I can ever have you guys that you help me spread the word so we can have more entrepreneurs, make more money, feed their families, make better products, and have better experiences for their employees and customers.
And the only way we do that is if you can rate and review and share this podcast, so the single thing that I have to do is you can just leave review will take you 10 seconds or one type of the thumb, mean, the absolute world to me.
0:25
And more importantly, it may change the world of someone else.
What's going on, everyone?
One super excited, it's break down what we've talked about today, which is the kind of for big you know chapters in the growth of a business.
So zero to a million dollars a year, 1 to 10 million dollars a year, 10 to 30 million dollars a year, and then 3,200 dollars plus, welcome to the game.
0:44
Where we talk about it, get more customers how to make more per customer and how to keep them longer in the many failures and lessons.
We have learned along the way.
I hope you enjoy and subscribe.
This was this is doubt taking me a long time to figure out painstakingly so hopefully this will be a value to you.
It's kind of interesting though, because when I learn About this.
1:00
It's hard to even learn things without having the context and our framework to apply them on, right?
Like, unless you have a business it's hard to understand all the bottlenecks because none of its real for you.
So this will probably be more for the people who have businesses, but if you don't have a business then, you know, please enjoy that, being said, zero to a million.
1:17
Really, really simple.
It's just one product.
One channel.
Very simple.
All right.
That means you learn how to figure out how to sell one thing on one channel.
Alright, a channel would be like, cold email, Facebook ads, Instagram ads, YouTube ads, referral Partners, you know what I mean?
1:39
All off of organic, you know, I mean earned media.
So all of these are different channels that you can use to acquire customers and the reason people get stuck in like hundred three hundred ish, like range is usually because they stop it really nailed this.
It's still haphazard they get clients from here and there but they don't have any reliable.
1:55
System for acquire customers, right?
Literally that's it.
Zero to a million, it's a reliable system to acquire customers and doing it.
And most people also get stuck here because they have personal problems like they're they're, they're super angry and they hate themselves and they're not good with people.
That's that type of thing.
Like they a lot of times they have the right system, they execute it and then they crash themselves because they have their, you know, sleeping with their customers or sitting with their employees.
2:17
Just like it's just crazy interpersonal.
Drama is in this range but the business from the business standpoint, it's very simple.
It's just one product on one channel and then just make the math I work so it's not a thousand.
Other thing.
Got a hundred a month that's it.
It's all days at this point though.
Right?
Million.
Ash, two million issue here.
2:33
Now mind you, these are rough.
You know sometimes it might be one to three inches the range here, but once you're in that kind of one to three range, getting to 10 is an entirely different thing.
All right, getting to 10.
Is multi products, right?
Now, an important note here is that you're not starting multiple businesses, right?
2:52
It's going to be cross sells and upsells, all right.
So, that's another way is creating a value ladder.
It's creating a creating a back-end, right?
It's what's the what's the next level of service that we can provide these people?
What's the next thing?
The naturally going to want to need or want and need after buying our initial product, right?
3:10
And so thinking through this, like it's in most people who are in this million-dollar Ranger, like, man, what else should I sell them?
Like, you're asking the right question, exactly.
The right question, that's what you need to do to get from one to ten.
All right, now, from 10 to 30 in mind, you, it's multiple products.
And And depending, sometimes it's multiple channels.
3:30
All right?
You can, you can kind of do it either way.
Either, single product, or more channels, you can do multiple products on single Channel or you can do multiple.
Like that's a little bit wiggle e.
But I would say the easiest for most people is just focusing on their back end, which is the cross sells enough cells.
3:46
What are the things that this person is actually going to need next which is going to increase our LTV.
So basically what happens is you're selling the same same number of units as before.
Like I was saying, let's say you sold 100 people at that at that 1 TV.
But then you you you 4X your LTV and all of a sudden or 5x real TV, right?
4:02
This is how it happens.
You 5x relative unit becomes 5K over the lifespan and I got 500 thousand a month and then because you're a five hundred thousand a month, you can start going to another Channel because you can afford to do it because you're all TV's higher.
So basically, what ends up happening is you learn how to cheaply acquire customers.
With one channel, that you're very well suited for right, then you extend and expand the LTV of that customer by introducing a back-end.
4:23
And then, once you have that back in and now opens up other traffic platforms, or Channels that you wouldn't otherwise be able to afford but now that you have a superior back and you can now go broader, right?
That's kind of how it works from a, from business day to day standpoint.
So zero to a million 1210 mine.
Alright, next line, here is 10 to 30 million.
This is another one where people, you know, massively screw-up, which is professional.
4:42
Is that professionalizing?
The business?
All right, and this is honestly really painful and it's hard to do.
And I'm thankful that I had mentors early on there.
Like this is what you need to do now because I probably wouldn't have said, this is the next thing.
But what ends up happening with?
Like 10 million million a month type, you know, ranges, then like the thing that made you special your special sauce here which may have been a lot of you as the founder is it starts to get diluted out, right?
5:06
And then you have customer complain and customer support issues.
And then, you know, thinks it's just like, you're basically a still a really big small business at that 10 million.
Like, you don't have the systems the infrastructure to build more on top of because it's still like Google Sheets and you know, Trello boards.
5:22
You know, it's just like it's just craziness to try and manage this.
And so this is where You have to hire some more corporate people and this is, you know what, every entrepreneur fears more than anything right?
Is that we fear bringing in these corporate suits?
You know, who just going to suck the life out of your.
Like I started this business to not have to do that but you know what, every massive business in the world was started by a Founder, right?
5:42
Who probably didn't like that.
And the reason big businesses run like businesses big businesses is because it's the only way to run big businesses.
I like you have to, you have to have corporate structure, you have to have structure, you have to have hierarchy, you have to have, you have to have HR, you have to have, you have to have these things.
In place.
So that employees feel more comfortable.
6:00
But also so that you're protected from a liability standpoint, right?
Because honestly, once you get into this range, you become a Target, right?
This is where lawsuit start coming in.
This is where lawyers and contract start mattering and all of this stuff, right?
And so professionalizing, the business especially from HR legal and accounting standpoint comes here and then the it systems.
6:19
All right?
So this is really like, really strengthening the Ops of the business, the operational infrastructure because what this does, Is that it makes all of these things that we learned how to upsell before, it really makes them more methodical.
Write it because they can people get the same product every time.
6:34
Same product, every time.
And so then client happiness goes back up and things are good.
Now, the problem is the people who come in at this 30 million dollar a year, you know what, we're getting from 10 to 30 is that they're not Innovative at all.
If anything, they stifle Innovation because they want things to go through the certain way, and then they just that, you know, you want to choke them to death, but you have to do it, right?
6:54
But the thing is that, if you go, these are all like pendulums, right?
If you go too far in that direction, then you lose the Creative Energy in the drive of the business because you kind of have these suits that are trying to control everything.
All right?
And so this is the gap that I have struggled to make is going from 30 million plus 2 to a hundred million dollars a year.
7:11
And so I'll share what the mentors that have shared this with me.
Hopefully, it'll be useful for you, but yeah, I mean we've been we did 2837 32, I think the last three years.
So, I've just really been stuck at this level and it's because of this last piece, right?
Because the thing that made us, Right?
7:27
Which frankly was me and the entrepreneurial, like, drive.
And I'm not saying I'm the sole responsibility, obviously, our team's amazing, and they're, the reason this works.
But it's saying like, what's the, what's the soul, right?
And so, what ends up having to happen is that at this level, you actually have to have more souls, you have to have more people with the juju, right?
7:48
More people who can drive growth, who can take initiative and seize opportunities, right?
And so this is kind of the Versus The intrapreneur Dilemma and I'll break this down for you.
So an intrapreneur is somebody who wants has entrepreneurial Tendencies within within a corporate structure, right?
8:08
An entrepreneur wants to own their own thing, and I have made a horrible mistakes.
So many times hiring entrepreneurs and treating them like intrapreneurs.
When in reality, I should have just never hired them, right?
Because they're going to tell, you know, I you know, I had a business before.
8:23
I don't have any interest in doing that and so you really have to kind of of two outcomes that happen here.
Hey guys, real quick.
If you're new to the podcast, I have a book on Amazon called 100 million-dollar offers that over eight thousand five star reviews.
It has almost a perfect score.
8:38
You can get it for 99 cents on Kindle.
The reason I bring it up is that I put over a thousand hours in the writing that book and it's my biggest gift to our community.
So it's my very Shameless way of trying to get you to like me more and ultimately make more dollars to that later on in your business career I push the partner with you so that's my give go check it out Amazon and back to the show.
9:00
Either have the entrepreneur who comes into your business lost their Juju.
Right?
And now just sits on your business and continue complains about how they're not getting paid as much as they could make on their own.
But they can't make it on their own, which is why they're with your business, right?
Or the person is right and can make more on their own.
9:15
And so they come in your business, basically regain their confidence, start doing well.
And then take as much of that business with you as they possibly can.
And so either way the outcomes poor and so I had to learn that one the hard way multiple times in our business, which is don't hire.
Our entrepreneurs.
All right.
9:31
What you want to do is find intrapreneurs.
All right, these are people who really prefer the love, the entrepreneurial Drive of like driving growth.
Driving change taking initiatives building out new things innovating, right?
But they don't have the same appetite for risk, right?
9:47
And so because of that, they like having this kind of safe place to go experiment into all the stuff, but they still know they're going to get a paycheck every month now that paychecks variable but even if they, you know, suck they're still gonna get paid, you're paid well, right?
And so this is what Have I've been trying to, you know, imbue into our business right now and it is working is putting on intrapreneurs in places where they can drive change.
10:09
Because if you really think about it, what ends up happening is that your business becomes a conglomeration of smaller sub businesses, right?
If you listen to Jeff Bezos, talk about his director, she actually calls them CEOs because like, oh, that's Co that business that's see of that business but they're all within Amazon, right?
10:26
But they're kind of sub CEOs.
And this is the thing is like, you need You can only provide so much willpower and spirit to a business once it gets to the size because there's just so many people that you just get diluted like your spirit, your care, your drive, your vision, just get diluted throughout an organization.
10:45
And so, you need you need heads that can kind of reinvigorate, the business and drive new Innovations.
And so what ends up happening is the way the the structure looks like in the way it shifts, too.
Show you real quick.
Is it shifted something like this?
11:06
All right, so you've got your, your core here, right?
Which is the, the operational infrastructure that we put in place from 10 to 30 million?
So, this is your, this is your HR, right?
Legal it Finance, right?
11:24
That's your that's your core.
All right, that's the core apis of the business that has to happen.
Everyone goes to jail, right?
People need to get paid.
You need to pay taxes, contracts need to be signed, you know, crms it all, I kinda stuff, right?
And then what ends up happening?
Is that off of that spoke, right?
11:41
You have profit centers, right?
And inside of a profit Center, you're going to have product.
And you're going to have acquisition, all right, so Acquisitions Marketing sales and then product, right?
And so inside of these, these are all identical, right, product acquisition, right?
11:59
Product acquisition, you get the idea, right?
And so each of these become profit centers right for the business.
And so, these things can all roll into you.
Well, this all rolls into someone else write from a, from an operational standpoint.
But this is really how the business would function, right?
And so this is where you might have, you know, product line, you know, number one.
12:18
Product line, number 2, product line, number three, right?
And each of these are going to satisfy needs for the customer.
Ideally, when you're animating these product lines, is you want to use the existing resources that you have and capital and infrastructure to create products that are similar but different, right?
12:33
So, for example, if I were, if I were like because obviously, we have a coaching business for Jim's.
So if I were, you know, expanding like Services, then what's one of the things that we've added, so we added in, We call it Boiler Room so this is something like a lot of a lot of our gyms were asking for more help with sales and so we're like well how about we just train you guys.
12:55
Like we trained our team like our team drills every morning and we do Boiler Room.
That's how that's how all of our guys start our day.
So why don't all of you just if you want this additional service because not everyone wants it, you can pay a little extra for it and then you can bring all your sales team and we can drill your sales team.
And so they get pumped up and the nice thing is something like that.
Just shows such clear Roi to a business that it's like, oh my God, I would never stop paying for this, so it's really sticky, right?
13:18
It's high margin so it works.
It literally works for everyone, right?
And so it's like we have our core like let's fix your business service and with the existing resources we have which is these are the skill sets and the individuals that we have that work for us, we know that we could create this product line and I'm calling a product limit service line with little investment right?
13:37
We do have to do a ton of stuff there, right?
Whereas when I started the supplement company, that was a huge undertaking that probably wasn't the wisest decision.
I was fortunate that we were able to maneuver it and now It's a very, very healthy business, but it took, I mean, but it was very hard and I probably shouldn't have done it in that order, right?
13:53
I should have thought like, okay, well they also want someone to run their ads for them, so that's going to be our done for your agency side.
So we're going to add that in, right?
And again each of these like this, hopefully this makes sense to you delineating these things.
It's like these are all types of services that a customer who comes in would naturally also want in addition.
14:08
And these can be upsells, that will increase the LCB, the customer while also making your own your own service stickier and helping them.
Basically, you want to, you want to envelope the All the things that they want that being said, you have to have the operational know how to do this and this is where people get screwed up, all right, is that when they create these product lines, they start trying to manage both and then they start trying to manage all three and then and then they start another business and then it gets even crazier, right?
14:32
And so this is where people massively screw-up and so on until you have a true leader and I'm saying a true leader, this person has to be as smart as you are.
All right, running a new product Division.
I would not recommend doing it which is why business growth is slow.
14:48
Oh, because it's all about the people.
Like that's the Harper.
Every entrepreneurs.
Biggest problem is they can't find good people.
So hardest part of the world and it's also because we need to be better people to attract better people, and also made us better people.
Because if you think about it, if I were an omnipotent being if I were God, right?
I could probably perfectly manage everyone to become an a player.
15:06
So, that's a belief that I try and use is like, if I were a perfect leader in a perfect manager.
I could get everyone to yep.
Surged forward, and be the best, right?
But I'm an imperfect leader, and I'm an imperfect manager and so I have to find people that have a little bit of battery.
15:23
It to get the result that we're looking for.
So hopefully this makes sense in terms of how you structure the business and how it scales, you know, at this point this would be like your 02:02 a million would be here you go zero to ten million maybe with product line 1 or product line to added in, right?
15:39
Which then allows you to scale your acquisition.
So acquisition goes up on each of these things because the total LTB is higher.
And so this is ultimately how the business scales.
All right.
So who crap for everyone?
If your zero to a million you don't worry about anything you guys.
So one product or one channel, that's it.
15:55
You got a good enough out of that.
You can do it, repeatedly in your sleep.
Once you have that, then you're like, okay we got this on lock now we can set up multiple products these people.
So I need to find someone who's good put them in charge of this, help them build out a product line.
That is an intrapreneur, not an entrepreneur and and then we'll cross all them into this additional service or product line.
16:12
That doesn't require a ton of capital investment.
What else could we provide these people that they've been asking for, right from 10 to 30 million?
It's like, all right.
Now we need.
I see, we need legal.
We need a We need compliance.
We need all of this other crap because you become a Target, straight up you become a Target in the business, all right?
And so you professionalize the business, but you can't lose the entrepreneurial spirit and to not lose the entrepreneurial spirit is when you hire intrapreneurs and then you put them in charge of product lines, all put around the central spoke of The infrastructure for operations.
16:40
So hopefully that makes sense.
Hopefully that valuable if you were in the 0 to 1 million dollar range than just don't get distracted with shiny objects focus on one product on one channel.
It's all you need to do.
Keep the gossip, could you go sir, but The infrastructure for operations.
So hopefully that makes sense.
Hopefully that valuable if you were in the 0 to 1 million dollar range than just don't get distracted with shiny objects focus on one product on one channel.
It's all you need to do.
Keep the gossip, could you go sir, but








0:00
Hey guys, real quick.
So Leyland are definitely working on our social media presence.
If you guys haven't noticed and we're just breaking now into LinkedIn.
All right.
It's not as bad as I thought it's actually a pretty awesome so far and you guys have been really cool in there and people are sharing our stuff a lot.
So if we aren't connected on LinkedIn, it go ahead and let's connect.
0:15
And let's rock and roll.
Hey, what's going on?
Everyone, and welcome to the gym Secrets podcast.
This is Alex and it has been at least a week since the last podcast.
So I we've been crazy busy and we had a hurricane and Puerto Rico.
If you heard about that, it was nuts.
But anyways, so I'm here with my lovely wife, Leila.
0:33
We just had our dinner and date night, and today, we're going to be talking about an awesome topic about increasing your EFT is because that's what we talk about, when we're at our romantic night dinners, put on day night.
But she was like, you should record this because, like, this is, this is useful.
0:48
So, I hope that you guys find this useful.
So I have a lot of gyms that that we work with obviously.
And what happens is, we give them an acquisition system, that makes the money, and then all of a sudden they've got You know, half their members at a price that we tell them to put, which is usually, you know, fifty to a hundred dollars higher than what their old prices and then their Jim gets to full capacity and they're like, I want to be making more but my gyms at full capacity and so we have to raise their prices, right?
1:16
And so they're like, but I have all these people who are grandfathered in there, you know, they've got a lifetime thing, I told them I did a pre-sale that was like, lifetime low rate and now these people and these people mean a lot to you and they should because there are a lot of these people been the core of your gym.
And hopefully this is resonating with you as a gym owner because I mean virtually every demo to that I talk to you has some core people that they sign up at the beginning and they've been there forever.
1:37
So it's like you don't want to disenfranchise these people.
You also don't want to go back on your word because you said, hey, I was going to give you this lifetime rate.
But what you have to kind of confront is, there's really just one basic choice because once the gym is at full capacity or close to capacity, you have only x amount of space and x amount of sessions that you can fit it, that's like period, that's it, right?
1:57
And so you have to say, okay, either, Oh, I am okay at this, you know, level of Revenue because you're full now or you have to basically go back to people and say I made a mistake, right?
2:12
Like I made a mistake because I didn't have all of the information that was necessary to make the decision that I'd like the correct decision for the business when I started it.
And I've learned, you know, Leaps and Bounds about this business from the day that I started it to till today and I can no longer Provide the services that I could before at that rate and so you have to kind of like if if and when you are going to raise your EFT prices and you want to confront raising the FC prices for some of these Legacy members because, you know, I got off the phone with a guy yesterday and since he's been working with us, you know, we signed up 100 people on our front end offer and he's just any starting to transition them over.
2:52
And he's got the first 24 over, and he's starting to met a hundred and fifty dollars a month for his large group base, right?
Right.
But he had another hundred members that were at 67 or 97 for unlimited boot camp and I was like, dude, like we're going to have to confront this, you know, a people talk.
3:09
But be like $67.
Like, we'd like this needs to get fixed.
Right.
And so, you know, he had the same concerns, everyone else is just fear that everyone's going to like, get really upset.
So the nice thing.
Benefit number one is if you fired if or if people leave who are paying not much, you don't lose much because there weren't many much anyways, right?
3:27
Second benefit is that if you have an acquisition system, that allows you to You're Jim up, you can always replace the spots very easily, right?
So you don't have to as much fear a lot of it's just emotional, right?
The third thing is that when you are going to have that conversation, what you want to do is you want to say, Hey listen, agreements to ways you agree to pay this price.
I agreed to pay the service, I can no longer like.
3:45
I like I don't, I'm releasing you from this contract.
I am not like I'm no longer able to fulfill those services at that price, right?
And so at that point, that person, even if they signed up for a year, you need to let them out of that contract because then you need to Enter a new agreement that is amenable to both of you, right?
4:04
And that's where you say listen because one of the core core values of my business.
Now I've been working with someone, they be coaching you through.
This is that we need to be profitable.
We need to have profit at the end of the month and we can't fulfill services and give you unlimited training sessions for a 67 dollars a month and we can't do it.
4:23
It's impossible.
Now, some people might be like, oh my gosh, that's so like it, leave it in some people may like that's me, you know. 87 and 99 virtually the same like it's too cheap.
Like I it's very rare that I'll find a business who has the capacity to service enough.
4:38
Customers were like a $99 a month EFT can work.
It can if you can service 40 people a session, right?
Thank you.
Can if you can do that if you can't then we have then you have to raise your prices.
Otherwise there's no profit left over right and then there's nothing to reinvest in the business and then ultimately you're just a slave to it and it never gives you the freedom that you wanted it to give you.
4:59
So so, if you don't have a lot of members at your gym, but I wouldn't do is I would have just sent a mess email that I would put the elbow grease in and I would call all my customers.
5:16
And I know that sounds like, you know, the Big W word like work.
But like if you had the opportunity to sit down with 67 customers, who were the most qualified customers of all time, because they already bought with, you already have a relationship with you.
5:32
To sign them up for E FTS.
Wouldn't you make the time to meet with a customer?
That was like that of course you would, right?
Most Nation real quick.
If you are a business owner that has a big old business and wants to get to a much bigger business, going to 50 $100.
5:49
Plus, we would love to talk to you and if you like that or like to hear more about it, go to acquisition.com, you planning on the page and talk to one of our team and see if we can help you get there.
And so like you have to see these customers as like the most qualified prospects of all time.
6:06
And so I would eat at the very least, close it over the phone, if not do as many of them as I could in person throughout the week.
Like, as an unofficial start like that whole week.
And then anyone I didn't touch base with, I would pound the phone over the weekend and then really, just end.
6:24
The easiest thing to do is just be honest, it's just a, like, I did not know what I know now, when I came I'm into this space, you know, there's as much as it may seem like, you know, we're crushing it.
It's like, there's not a lot left over at the end of the month.
6:39
And the, for my first job, as owner of this business is to make sure that this business continues to exist.
And so as such, I've been working with a couple people who have, you know, been able to advise me on pricing and fulfillment so that we can ultimately provide you a better service because then we'll have profit that we can reinvest back in the business so that we can continue to grow and improve the The facility itself, the equipment, how much training I can provide my trainers, all of that kind of stuff and it all comes down to making sure that our prices make sense, right?
7:10
And so I hope that you know, the value that would be able to provide you Susan since you've lost, you know, 50 pounds since you've been with us for two years we love you.
I want you to know that it's just that because I didn't know then what I know now, like I can no longer fulfill it that rate that being said, I want you to stay and this is what the new rate.
7:31
Is going to be now, and I want to give you like I want to, I want to honor You by talking to you about it.
I didn't want this to be behind an email and if you say something like that to someone like most, like you have this fear that you're going to be upset and are there going to be some people who are like?
7:46
Well, I can't afford that anymore and it's like I totally understand.
It's just, I can't afford to train you for sixty seven dollars a month for unlimited sessions.
I can't, I can't afford it as a business owner.
And then that one and then what you can do is once you have the price, you can't negotiate on the price.
8:04
If you stick into a price, you doing a price increase, it has to stay there.
All right, so then you can see if you can change the terms up.
Like, could you do bi-weekly?
Would that work?
If you go, if we go in your pay cycle, could you do weekly?
Is that?
Is that easier for you, that way?
It seems like, you know, like you're trying to make it work for them, you're like, listen, I can't change the price.
8:22
You'd like, I can train to the terms upon which that, you know, that you're giving me this money.
So hopefully that's helpful for you guys.
If any of you guys are in that spot. like, You can usually, like, if you have, let's say, 120 customers paying you $99 a month as your Blended average, a lot of people have their prices and I'm using Mike like quotations right now.
8:42
They say like these are my prices but if you look at your EFT every month, divide how much money you make going to give to you by?
How many people you have that are paying you?
That's what you're really of T is right, that's what your Blended average is.
And so look at that number.
And a lot of the gyms that I work with, probably like 70% Plus, have a not have about a hundred bucks, a month as they're Blended average, and it just doesn't work, it just doesn't work.
9:01
I could sit down and give you all the math behind. and it, maybe I will do a video on that, but it just doesn't work and so, She just you just got a raise them and if you got a hundred people there, if you raise the, your Blended, average by $60, right?
9:18
First of all, when you do raise it, don't say $60 a month.
Say it's 15 bucks a week.
It sounds like nothing.
It sounds like a lot less at least.
So hey, we're raising by 15 bucks a week.
Okay, that's one.
The next thing is though, after you've raised the price, I'm just telling you.
I guarantee you if you, if you do it in this way, you talk to me.
9:35
So I want to honor you.
I wanted to like, communicate this with you.
I didn't want this to be behind this computer screen.
I wanted to like, be face-to-face.
Tell you how much I appreciate you.
And just tell you that, like, this is why we're doing this, right?
If you do all that, you'll probably only lose, maybe, like 10, 20 percent of your customers and if you can lose 20% of your customers, right?
9:55
So let's do the math, you have 100 people, pay you a hundred bucks a month or 20 people, pay you a hundred, a hundred bucks, a month.
You making 12,000 a month in the ftes and you lose 20%, right?
That's 24 people.
Okay, so now you're at 96 customers but you have 96 customers now, at 160.
10:15
So we want from 12,000 to 15,000 teen for and now we have capacity to fill up those other 24 spots that this group we're taking.
We're making more money servicing less people.
So now you just gave yourself a Forty thousand dollar a year.
10:34
Pay raise, just by being willing to confront the fact that the model that you had before the price that you had before it just doesn't work and that's why I crossfit's and boot camps and large group and all these, you know, micro gyms are going out of business.
All the time is because when I ask someone like where'd you get your pricing from they say I just looked around and saw what everyone else was doing but everyone else is broke, don't copy them.
10:57
So I will leave you with that.
Take on that mull.
It over.
Hope you guys are having an amazing day evening weekend, Etc.
If you were a gym owner and like to see how we get Jim's from zero to full capacity, in 30 days, go to, I do not hate money or it's actually I don't hate money.com and download the case study and you can apply on the next page to see a bunch of awesome gym owners that we've worked with to get them to full capacity, within, 30 days.
11:20
So lots of love, guys.
Hope this was useful for you and I will catch you guys on the flip side.









0:00
Most Nation real quick.
If you are a business owner that has a big old business and wants to get to a much bigger business, going to 50 $100.
Plus, we would love to talk to you and if you like that or would like to hear more about it, go to acquisition.com, you can play anywhere on the page and talk to one of our team and see if we can help you get there.
0:18
Now, if you're thinking about from a marketing perspective, would you think 18% of gyms that we work with are seven-figure gems?
Maybe I don't think that sounds as compelling as one in five point five, like really one-in-five.
Like, that's not that bad.
Welcome to the game, where we talked about it, get more customers how to make more per customer and how to keep them longer in the many failures and lessons.
0:35
We have learned along the way.
I hope you enjoy and subscribe.
What's going on, everyone?
I've got a special presentation for you today.
This is me a little bit more advanced stuff and it's because I'm partially making this for my team on the marketing side.
So, one of the things that I have found has been a consistent source of new marketing for us is understanding data.
0:54
And so, I think some people are much better at telling stories than I am, but I'm pretty decent at slicing data.
And so, the nice thing is that there's always new inferences that you can derive from data, you can make the same thing in different things.
And so, for example, I'll give you some statistics that we have that we've based entire campaigns around.
1:13
So one campaign that was our most successful campaign that we've ever run was a one year later campaign.
And so, what that was was, we took all of our clients have been with us for over a year and measured all of their stats and measured their status from before they were with us.
Until now a year later and showed the difference, right?
And the differences were crazy.
1:28
You know, 250 thousand. 100,000 a year million dollars a year extra like they're just massive differences.
And so from that, from that one, you know, measuring example, there are so many different subdivisions of data that you can use, right?
You can just say, hey, when you're later, average client is up this, right?
That would be one way to do the data.
1:45
Another way to do that would be like one year later.
Our top twenty percent of clients have added over four hundred thousand dollars a year to their yearly Revenue.
Another one would be the bottom, you know, 80% rat this, right?
And so there's there's all these are One in, here's another way of doing it.
2:02
One in five.
Jim's always been with us over a year, is at is over Z, right?
And so, there's different variables you can play with right one is the percentage of people.
Right.
The next is the goal and then the next is the duration piece.
So you have these kind of three wheels that you can spin together to make really interesting statistics and you can and you can, you can base so many campaigns around like another campaign that we have this launching soon.
2:27
Is we just, we just Measured one in 5.5.
Jim's is over a million dollars a year, run rate for us.
Right?
And so all these, you know, so for me it's easy because like, you know, other people are like seven-figure jimbob a ball and so for me I'm like well, they're talking about it, we're doing it right?
2:44
And so, I can always position myself because most people don't even capture their own data anyway.
So they don't even know and it's usually cause it's not good right there.
You know, they don't have any money.
No gyms.
They don't need to go measure that, right?
We do know.
It's a one in five point five.
So that's 18%.
Now, if you're thinking about for marketing perspective, what do you think 18% of Jim's?
3:00
We work with our seven-figure, Jim's.
Maybe.
I don't think that sounds as compelling as one in five point five, like really one-in-five.
Like, that's not that bad, right?
And the thing is, you can also invert that and say, all right, but 4.5 out of 5 .5, Jim's hit this, right?
3:15
So, it's like, I can play on the, on the, on the, the desire that people have to win the lottery, it's survivorship bias like that.
People think they're going to be the one, right?
But I can also play on the inverse which is something that I like doing a lot which is I love playing on averages, I love playing on medians.
With data because it's like, hey, this is just what the normal person does, right?
3:33
Like, and here's what's cool.
You can always say, after you say an average, that also means half of people are above this.
We're like, wow, well, I consider myself above average.
So I'm going to be above that because everyone thinks they're above average, right?
And so when you're clumping data together, you can use those three wheels, right?
Wheel one is over, what duration will to is, what is the, what is the outcome?
3:54
And then I literally can't remember what the oh, and the percentage of clients that achieve that, right?
So it's percentage of clients, the Come in the time duration.
And so you have these wheels that you can mix and match and we even use a percentage of clients, you can say, percentage of clients you can say the top percentage, the bottom percentage, the median, the average, right?
4:11
And you can also say one in, right?
So there's different different ways.
You can also say the fractional version like one-fifth of, right?
So all of these that's just like that was just on the one-wheel of what percentage of clients, right?
What percentage?
When fifth one in however, many the fractional amount, the top percentage, the Item percentage so you can invert either one of those.
4:32
So one in five or four out of five, right?
That would be the inversion the same stack.
And so when I'm using all of that, like this is what I'm running through and this is what I've had a really hard time teaching my team which is why I'm making this right now is that like this is what I'm running through what I'm thinking when I'm looking at like, the, the data they get back from customer support, excuse me.
4:50
Customer success is like this.
They're like, here's here's all the gyms that we have from like, okay, how can we say this differently?
How can we say this in a compelling way and make it a hook for our marketing?
Right.
And so that was that was all the examples.
I had four percentage of clients right now if we're talking time duration, right?
5:08
So a Time duration, I'm, I'm going to be thinking super long, long, long time away.
And here's what's cool about when you use long longer durations way, if someone's been with you for a year, the likely that they've succeeded is very high especially in education, based business.
So I love pulling out the one year to year later pieces because one it shows that people stay with me for a long time which means that I continually provide value, right?
5:29
So it's social Have continued value creation, which I like a lot.
So, boom.
When you have the long term duration, it's great.
And that's an advantage especially if you're an older player in the space, having those one year to year later, testimonials is something that no one else can show that you can show to also demonstrate your long-standing Us in the space, right?
5:45
But on top of that, somebody's been with you for that long I was going to usually have a very good outcome and so if I just say hey the people have been with me for over a year average.
This That it's like, wow, that's crazy, right?
And so the data will give a very positive impression of what your marketing, right?
6:02
Flipside is that you can cut it at different different times, right?
You can look at first, we can look at first 30 days, you can.
Look at first two months, right?
And so the thing is this, if you have this data on a regular basis, you can you can time stamp this stuff and really you can slice it and find that the slice that you're like, oh this is really good.
6:19
Like for us like our average gym in the first Thanks for 15 days, 15 days.
He's the first two weeks is 15,500.
All right, in addition reminisce, the average which means half people get better than that.
Right crazy.
And so and I give you the other said earlier, 15.5, Jim's is a million-dollar Jim Wright.
6:37
And so I'm, I can play with these, you know, with these numbers because I could have said, 18% or I could have said with the percent of the the 15,500 I could say that's a what's the outcome, right?
The outcome wheel could be.
What's the increase, right?
If it's the increase in.
Might be like the average person, you know, doubles what they do in Revenue in the first 14 days.
6:57
That's a different way of saying it, right?
I don't know what, I don't know the actual number is because I don't have that one offhand, but like, that would be something that I'd be.
That's something I would ask my team.
I'd be like, hey, figure out what the fraction is here.
Is it a doubling?
Is it a 1.5 x?
Is it a 30% increase?
While 30% increase doesn't sound as good as 15500, right?
7:14
So I'm going to say that one instead, and so, when we're talking about increases, There's four ways you can show it.
You quite, as you guys already know that, I don't run any ads on this and I don't sell anything.
And so, the only ask that I can ever have you guys that you help me, spread the words we cannot more entrepreneurs, make more money, feed their families, make better products and have better experiences for their employees and customers.
7:37
The only way we do that is if you can rate and review and share this podcast, so the single thing that I have to do is you can just leave review but they can 10 seconds or one type of the thumb.
It means the absolute world to me.
And more importantly, it may change the world for someone else.
One is a percent increase which is this went up by X percent, right?
7:57
The next is an absolute increase which is additional 15,500, right?
The next would be the actual total number made, which would be their revenue plus the increase.
Boom, right.
Which would be different but similar, right?
8:14
So you've got the the just the increase.
You've got the total amount made you've got the percentage increase, you've got a relative increase, which is one that I like which Which is what is 15,500 by you, right?
So 15,500 might be like, I would have to look up industry averages, but I'd say the average, you know, maybe industry average for micro Jim.
8:33
Rent might be, let's say, two thousand dollars a month.
So, I would say in the first 30 days, the average gym in our program, pays off, three-quarters are nine months of rent.
Wow, that sounds kind of interesting, right?
Like that's, that's compelling.
That's Unique, right?
8:49
So, hopefully, you're following along with me or like, the three big wheels, right?
Will number one, you've got is what's the outcome?
We will number two is the time duration.
And we'll number three is what percentage of clients, you know, achieve this outcome.
And so when you're playing with these three wheels and you're slicing the data, all of these wheels have variables which is why you can slice data in so many different directions.
9:08
But for me this is usually what I will search for like this is what I will hunt for.
I will look for the piece of data that tells the story that that that the copy can't tell or it can really Reinforce the story that the copy tells makes it far more compelling, right now.
9:26
Mind you, you have to be absolutely compliant when you use numbers, right?
Which is one of the things I also like doing it because we track our stuff and most of our, you know, most people in our space don't because they're still figuring out how to, you know, Mark it and figure out their business.
But the thing is, most people try to stuff and so I have a huge amount of energy that we track this stuff for years, right?
9:43
And on top of that, we have, we have pretty decent metrics around this stuff, especially when a client success.
And so, with that, I can hunt Say, okay, let's look at new clients, you know, first first eight weeks, right?
What's, how much was the increase in Revenue?
10:00
Okay, and the thing is, is everything I just talked about was one stat, right?
I just talked about Revenue, I could use the same three wheels with time, the customer outcome and then what percentage of them achieved it?
I could use those same three wheels with any of the stats.
10:15
I could use it with profit.
I could use the revenue.
I can use with turn.
I can use it with, I could even use it with growth.
Percentage, right?
I could use it with like there's there's so many different ways I can I can use those three wheels in my marketing, but usually, this will be the central core concept that I will make an entire campaign around, right?
10:34
Because at the end of the day, there's only so many ways for me to say we make just for money, right?
Like I mean the thing is, at the end of the day, everyone promises that.
So the question is, how can I make a different more unique promise and how can I make it more compelling and believable that they will achieve it, right?
10:50
And so that's kind of why I Data is most of the times, the central selling point that I have for any program that is out.
Now, the good thing is, is that and I've always done it that way, because I'm usually my way of convicted because it's easy to have conviction in stats because those are what they are.
11:07
So I can have absolute conviction.
That this is what it is.
So take it or leave it.
These are the stats, right?
Like, you can choose to, you know, if I said my, you know, my weight loss program has an 87 percent success rate of people hitting, you know, over 15 pounds, then then like, even like how about this I'll say differently.
11:24
Let's say, let's say I had a, let's say my success rate of people hitting over.
I've a 70% success rate of people hitting over 12 pounds lost their first six weeks with me, right?
There's two variables that I'm playing actually three again, which is what percentage of customers achieve X result, right?
11:43
And I can change actors are because that's what percentage customers achieve over over 30 pounds lost, it'd be much smaller.
It won't be like 10 percent, right?
And sometimes it's worth saying Top ten percent of our clients at X.
I think it works better with this and stuff, but like, you know, weight loss scenario, that would be, that would be an example.
It's like I have this percentage of customers who achieve this person and I can move these right until I find a sweet spot where I look in the data.
12:04
And I'm like, huh, 70% of our clients, hit over 16, pounds lost.
That's pretty good right in this period of time.
And so now I can start marketing that because I have the data to support and substantiate it, right?
And so when I'm thinking about new hooks, right?
12:20
Here's a different one that I ran that.
Shit for us, which is, I told you earlier about the 5.5 Jim's.
When, if I point five gems is a million-dollar Jim.
Here's another way you can do it with the time.
I didn't even get to the time duration, one yet is that I can say, 1 in every excuse me, every X days.
12:37
X minutes x, h x weeks, X months, we achieve.
A why?
Right?
And so, I found out because I looked at our stats and I think the last year we had done, gosh, I don't know.
It's like, I honestly can't remember, but I do remember the outcome.
It was I think we'd created like, 50-something, seven-figure gyms in 2019 or 2020, something.
13:00
That anyways, point is, we created that many and I was like, well, there's 52 weeks in a year.
That means that one in every seven point seven days, we create another seven-figure gym, So that means every basically every week we're cranking out another seven-figure gym.
13:16
So it takes the idea of like this is how many of these outcomes we've had, right.
So again in that weight loss example, I could say how many people have we had lose, you know, 20 pounds, right over, you know, over the last year and they might say, you know, we've had shit, we've had, we've had 200 people.
13:31
Hit that, I be like, cool.
So we can say every two days another person who crosses 20 pounds lost at my facility?
Wow.
Is it a different way of Saying X percent of people hit this goal in expert.
It's not right.
So there's there's these different ways of slicing it and so I would implore you.
13:47
And this is also for my team that when we're looking at, what are our main hook?
Our main messaging that we're going to wrap the whole campaign around is let's look at the data right?
And the think about the three wheels, what's the outcome?
What percentage people hit it over?
What?
Time duration and then play with all of them right?
14:05
With the time variation.
It's one in every how many days every how many minutes.
Okay honey whatever is it is it over one year?
As in the first 30 days in the first 6 weeks, you know, whatever like is that, that's the time duration.
The customer already said, all the million ways of slicing the outcome and the percentage, right?
14:22
And so hopefully that makes sense for you.
Hope you found this valuable that probably give you unlimited ways of slicing your own data, but I'm telling you it's one of the most compelling things in the world because it's just true.
So, I'll leave you with that.
Keep being awesome.
That was a huge Marketing Act that has made me a tremendous amount of money, so use it and be fruitful.

What's going on, everybody?
I'm bringing some more books, but I wanted to say that, if you haven't checked out Hunter million-dollar offers, I would definitely suggest that you start there.
I've gotten some solid feedback and it couldn't be happier with its.

So, thank you guys so much for that.

It's 164 pages.
I really can help you out.
It takes about four hours to get through, check it out.
On Amazon, the Kindle book is 99 Cents.
The audiobook is Lowe's, they'll let me put it on for it, so I think it's 12 bucks.
So enjoy that and let's start the podcast.
It's easier to just over deliver like crazy for a client rather than trying to think about.
0:33
Like how do I make the scalable?
So you don't need to worry about that yet.
Like you need to start making money.
Welcome to the game, where we talk about how to get more customers, how to make more per customer and how to keep them longer in the many failures and lessons.
We have learned along the way.
I hope you enjoy and subscribe.
What's going on, everyone?
I've got a fun topic today how to make a million dollars.
0:50
And so I know this is almost clickbait e, but I want to go over it mostly because it's like one of the number one questions, I get all the time.
I'm and so we might as well actually break down the math for you.
And so the number one way that I know that someone has no chance and actually doing this, they don't even know that math behind how to accomplish their goals, right?
1:09
And so that's what we're going to break down today.
Alright, so the first thing is you have to know how many units of whatever it is you're selling to get to your goal.
Right?
And the question is, do you want two million dollars in revenue or you want to make a million dollars in take-home income mind you to be in the top 1% in America?
It's four hundred thousand dollars a year, all right?
And so let's say you have a business that run 40 percent net margins, which mind you is very good. 40% margins.
1:30
That means if you made a million dollars in Revenue you would make four hundred thousand dollars a year in net profit, will you get to take owner pay right from your business?
Which is why by the way, I think that having a job that pays well is very underrated.
I think it's just from being realistic.
1:46
If you look at the odds, I think it's far, far, far more likely that you can achieve a six-figure, or multi six-figure income fast by having a really high-paying job because you've acquired a skill then.
Dying to learn basically all the skills and own your own business.
2:02
I'm just being candid, and I think that if I knew the amount of risk that I was taking on when I start a business, I don't know if I would have done it again and I think that I had an atypical entrepreneurial Journey because I wasn't really an entrepreneur personality type.
I just really hated my job enough that I was going to do anything but that, and so that's what started it, but let's get to that.
2:21
Let's get to the meat, the potatoes.
All right?
So a lot of times people haven't even figured out their price points on things yet, and so the easiest way to understand this, That if you have a million dollars a year, which is what you want to make, then you want to break this down, right?
So million dollars a year is going to be 83k per month.
2:36
All right, roughly, right?
It's a t-33 whatever.
You could say, 84k, but 83k per month, all right.
That's what you have to make in Revenue right now.
If you break it down per day, I think it's 33333, I think per day, but if you do it per week, so let's just break this into weekly, it would be like, let's just say 21k.
2:55
Okay.
So 21k per week and you'll notice I'm to keep breaking this down because it's really difficult to hit fuzzy targets, right?
I heard this from Jason flatland, fuzzy targets, don't get hit, right?
So we need to make this a very precise clean pristine Target.
All right, so we got a million dollars, a year, breaks down to 83 K per month. 21k per week, excuse me 21k per week.
3:15
And then from there, you know, 77 days would be about 3K plus per day, right?
So so that's that's how we know how we can get to that number.
Now, I like weeks because weeks are like normal Cycles.
Daily can be a little bit too, volatile until you get to like 10 feet.
You know, 10 million plus per year and so if we're if we're talking starting out right 21k per week.
3:35
All right, so the thing is, is we just have to know what the lifetime value of our customers.
And so, let's say you're selling a single product that has no upsells, I, which is pretty common, a single product that has no up sells.
Let's say your LTV is a thousand dollars.
Okay?
Now I want to be really clear about this.
3:52
You don't have to sell a thousand dollar widget for this for the method about to share with you to make sense.
All right?
It just means that your total lifetime value of a customer is a thousand dollars, like Starbucks.
I think they're all TV's like, eight thousand dollars and you're like, holy cow.
Well, think about how many times you purchase a Starbucks over the last, you know, 10 years, right?
4:08
It adds up.
And so for me, I'll give you a couple different examples of what a thousand or LTV might be if I sold a course for a thousand dollars and I sold nothing else.
That would be 1000 oil TV.
If I sold a hundred dollar-a-month gym membership and the person on average stays 10 months that would be $1000.
LTV if I sold, let's say, crap, if I sold skin care products, right?
4:29
In the average order value was, you know, $250 and the average amount of time that someone stayed on my cream products was four months. $1000 is male TV.
Okay?
So these are all different ways of achieving 1000 R, El T v-- which makes this hopefully a little bit simpler.
Now, if I have to get to a million dollars, that I need to sell 21 units per week, right?
4:49
And so that would be 21 divided by 1000, which is 21.
Right units per week to hit our goal and so if I know that I only really sell five days a week Monday through Friday, right?
Then it means I got to sell four or maybe five, I'd probably make five my goal.
So I overshoot it a little bit so I got a self Five deals a day, right?
5:07
If I five deals a day and the nice thing is, with this process that I'm walking you through right now, like you can add as many zeros as you want, it works the same way, right?
You can add zeros to your product, zeros to your goal, like everything works the same way.
So it's five deals a day is what I have to close.
Now, the thing is, is I may know my math, right?
5:22
And know that five deals a day.
We closed.
Let's say, one out of three deal, one out of three phone calls, which means I'm going to be 15 phone calls a day who show up, right?
Real quick guys.
If you can think about how you found this podcast, somebody probably tweeted it told you about it.
5:38
Should it on Instagram or something like that?
The only way this grows is through word of mouth and so I don't run ads, I don't do sponsorships, I don't sell anything.
I only ask is that you continue to pay it forward to whoever showed you or however you found out about this podcast that you do the exact same thing.
So if it was a review if it was a post, if you do that would mean the world to me and you throw some good karma out there for another entrepreneur.
6:01
And now if I'm selling products and it might be based on site conversion.
So if I have like, you know, one percent conversion on my store, an e-commerce store.
For example that I would need 100 times the amount of sales, I need, right?
So if I need five, quote sales per day, with a lifetime value of 1000, and I know that it takes 100 clicks to get one purchase.
6:21
Then I need 500 clicks a day.
Hopefully, that makes sense here.
But I'm just walking through a more, a more service-based sale because it was top of mind.
All right?
So, 15 calls right?
Day.
And let's say that I know my shop right on.
These calls is, you know, 66% side, have 22, set appointments per day, right?
6:39
And the thing is, is I know that based on my either Outreach efforts.
It takes, let's say I don't know, 50 Outreach efforts to get one appointment.
I need a thousand average efforts a day right now.
Mind you a thousand dollar deal would not be worth any kind of effort like that.
So I because this is way too low to have kind of like a hand-to-hand combat sale type type system.
6:59
This would probably need to be closer like ten thousand dollars and then there you go, you get your 10 million.
But but I'm using this just to illustrate like the different ways to get there, right?
And so a nice thing to think about this is that if you if you take out, if you take this little number here, your deal size, right?
7:17
And you put that as the main variable for this process, right?
You could either sell, you know, 9, 10 K deals, Per month and have a million dollar business.
Wow?
Right.
You could sell 100 K deal per month to have a million dollar business.
7:37
That sounds pretty chill.
You could also sell 100, will roughly, you know, 83 right?
1K deals per month.
That sounds a little harder, right?
Or if you have hundred dollar, widgets you got to sell God, 830?
7:53
Right?
Or 33, whatever it is times.
Dollars per per month, to hit that 83k, right?
It's, you can kind of see how much harder it gets the lower the prices.
Like, it's, it's hard to sell 833 things every month.
I mean, that's, that's a lot of work, right?
8:08
And honestly, it's hard to sell 83 things a month selling nine easier, right?
And so it's been in, this is just the conclusion that I've made throughout my life is that, especially when you're starting out, I think it's easier to start with premium things as in like it's easier to just over deliver like crazy for a client rather than trying to to think about like how do I think the scalable?
8:27
So you don't need to worry about that yet.
Like you need to start making money right?
And so it's like, how can I just how can I, how can I find a sweet spot in here, right?
This like, 5,000 10,000 15,000 dollar, Mark.
How can I find a sweet spot in here where I can just provide tremendous value to someone that they will want to continue to do services with me?
8:42
And I don't have to have a tremendous amount of operational scale because the reason that this is so hard for people this hundred dollar month or even ten dollar a month, range is, it's the operations behind it.
You have to be able to support so much volume that you're very good with people.
Well, that's a totally different skill to learn how to Market and sell an acquire customers.
8:59
And so, this is where I think most people kind of run into trouble.
And why a lot of people who end up making more money earlier kind of focus on this, on this upper side of the ladder.
There's a very, very, very few exceptions of people who make a lot of money like super super rare.
Make a lot of money below, this thousand dollar, you know, per unit price tag.
9:17
I like you have to find a way to get your LTV higher because it's just too hard.
Like why our customers is too difficult to not have a high LTV and like I said Starbucks right 8,000 LTV so it doesn't have to be your ticket price that has to be low.
It's just like you have to find ways to make customers worth more right unique expensive.
9:35
Sticky air, if you remember that from before habit-forming, something that they're going to continue to come back again and again and again.
So any of you how to make a million dollars, I think most people do not do this math on this, which is you got to make twenty one thousand dollars a week.
And then there's a zillion ways to make twenty one thousand dollars a week, right?
You can sell 100 all units.
9:50
You can sell thousand all units, can sell 10,000 units, 100,000 or units.
But at the end of the day, How you do it.
And if you're thinking about this from a sales, professional standpoint, so I'll break this down for you guys as a bonus.
Because I know a lot of sales, people follow our stuff, make this, whatever your product is your commission, right?
10:07
So if you want to make a million dollars you as a salesperson, right then you're going to sell like and let's say you get a thousand or commission then you need to sell 83 units a month of your thing, right?
And that may sound crazy and that it is because that's why you know that's why the top 1% is, you know, half of that in terms of income, right?
10:25
And so, So, but if you can, if you can figure out that a thousand dollars, you know, if you can get your like you should be able to think in your mind, like, this is my end goal as a salesperson.
This is what I would like to make is the amount of calls, you know, or calls take in required to hit this goal reasonable, right?
Because on some level, every every position has a cap based on time, right?
10:44
How much, how much time you could allocate, right?
There's only 24 hours in a day and so anywho reverse the math on your own business and your own products that you're selling.
And a lot of times, this will help you Get your clothes off faster.
So keeping awesome.
Lots of love and I'll catch you soon.
Bye.








0:00
Real quick.
Cause you guys already know that, I don't run any ads on this and I don't sell anything.
And so, the only ask that I can ever have you guys that you help me spread the word so we can have more entrepreneurs, make more money, feed their families, make better products, and have better experiences for their employees and customers.
And the only way we do that is if you can rate and review and share this podcast, so the single thing that I have to do is you can just leave review will take you 10 seconds or one type of the thumb, mean, the absolute world to me.
0:25
And more importantly, it may change the world of someone else.
Net Free cash flow.
All right, say it and then imprint it into your minds.
Welcome to the game.
Where we talk about it, get more customers how to make more per customer and how to keep them longer in the many failures and lessons.
0:40
We have learned along the way.
I hope you, enjoy, and subscribe, what's going everyone in this video, I'm gonna show you the number one mistake that I made in that.
I see a lot of entrepreneurs making in terms of how to make money from more money from their business.
So the number one metric that I track for our businesses.
0:57
Is this one and you may not even have heard this one.
I think it is the most important and Warren Buffett agrees with me.
Alright, it's net free cash flow.
All right, say it and then imprint it into your minds, all right.
And obviously this depends on what type of business you're running.
1:15
But what net free cash flow is is the amount of money that an owner of a business can take out of the business after the business reinvests in staying ahead of the competition and maintaining its competitive Advantage, right?
And so So the problem with the vast majority of businesses and or business owners, is that what they do is at some level.
1:36
I mean, the first problem is that many of them don't make any profit, right?
So that's probably like problem number one.
And when you say I'm reinvesting, the business and the reality is that you're not making a profit, you need to be real with yourself.
That's probably what's happening.
Category 2 is a type of businesses that are making a profit, but then they take that profit and they reinvest it back into the business.
1:56
Now, I'm not saying that this is necessarily a bad idea.
I'm saying that for me in my entrepreneurial experience, I like to take money out of businesses.
I like to make money while I'm growing businesses and this comes hard learned because in my first five years, when I started my business has at the time, I was starting gyms and online fitness coaching business to, whenever I would make money from my gym, I would open up another location, which sucked, right?
2:27
I mean it sounds great and but I was Is asset rich, and cash, poor.
All right, and that may appear in problem that you are suffering from to.
I had equipment, I had Lisa's, I had flooring, I had signage, I had lobbies, I'd front desk Side, Glass Walls, I had all of the things except for money in my bank account.
2:44
And when it up happening is I actually at after, after three, four five, whatever years, it was.
When I sold those companies, I ended up getting out of them relatively quickly, and I took all the money I got from those sales, which I would Sister like short sale.
3:00
They were kind of garage sales are pretty much a sold them as assets, rather than as businesses because I wanted to do this new thing, which is Jim lunch, but wouldn't have happening those.
I took all that money and I went into a new Venture, so Jim, what happened after this.
But there's a little period of time there where I did something new with a partner that I thought was gonna be partnered with.
3:18
And I'll just say, in short terms, it didn't work out.
And so, what ended up happening is, I didn't get a ton of money for the gyms that I sold and then all that money disappeared and At that moment, I promised myself I'm never making the mistake mistake again because we're going to happen.
3:34
Is that after all those years and all that, you know, all that time in the money that I had made all of it was gone.
It's like I've made Millions at that point dollars in Revenue right?
And I had I had nothing, you know what I mean?
And so I see this a lot.
3:50
And the thing is is that a lot of us entrepreneurs have this dream that someday we're going to sell the reality is this the chips are stacked against you?
All right. 99 percent of businesses don't get sold ever.
So this idea that we're going to have this mythical exit someday, right?
For most businesses isn't true and of the of the businesses that it is true.
4:09
Many of those exits aren't as sexy as they may sound like right.
Like I technically exited those businesses but it wasn't like, you know, I wasn't set for life.
All right, you know what I mean?
I think it was like multiple.
It was like 200 Grand 300.
It wasn't a lot of money that I made from those.
4:24
I think I sold all in all covering Partnerships and all that stuff.
I think I all in.
Got 200 Grand, I think for selling six locations.
Like, it was just not a lot, right?
And if you've been doing this for years then that exit.
4:40
If you'd like, I'd been doing this for at that time.
I think for 45 years, like that's like 40 Grand a year, right?
If I had been just ripping cash out of the business and stacking it, the whole time I would have had a lot more money than that, at that point, right?
And so this is a mistake that I see a lot of entrepreneurs make is that they're not focused on this net free cash flow, right?
4:59
They're not thinking how can I take money out of this business every single year how can this business pump out profits while I still continue to grow it?
And some of that also come from the expiration of how quickly I want to grow.
So a lot of times you want to go really fast for no reason.
Only the arbitrary reasons that we set for ourselves and the expectations of others that we project right?
5:18
But there's really no reason to do it but we end up just growing irresponsibly and then in so doing do it wastefully and expose ourselves to higher risk and more mistakes and in the process.
Also lose the one thing that we get along the way, if you do it the right way, which is never free cash flow as in like, getting paid to grow your business.
5:37
I try remember, I sat down with some of my employees, probably eight years ago is actually at the gyms and I think they had said they wanted to get a raise or something.
Like I can't remember.
It was.
And I was like, do you understand the difference between like imagine working for an entire month, right?
Working your ass off every hour of the day, right?
5:54
And then, at the end of the month, not only did I not pay you, I just cleaned out your savings.
For working that hard they're like yeah that would suck and I'm like that happens to me all the time, right?
And so that's the thing is we take on so much risk and you start to get used to the risk because you're just been doing it for such a long time but you have to reward yourself for the risk that you were taking all right.
6:17
Now the reason that I like net free cash flow is that it focuses the entire company on not just making a profit but making a profit in excess of what is required to continue to run and grow the business.
All right, So this is the number one step that I look at.
6:34
This is what I have my finance team report on for all of our entities, because this is the real real.
This is owner earnings, this is what Warren Buffett and Charlie Munger calculate with the companies that they want to buy because they're like, we hate companies where we buy them and then we take all the profit have to reinvest all that money back into the same business right there, like that sucks.
6:53
There.
That's why they said they don't like manufacturing and they don't like a lot of types of companies where you have to have all these Capital expenses, meaning money.
To the by big stuff that you know, depreciate over time.
They're like that sucks, right?
And so, net free cash flow is the staff that I track.
7:09
And if you're interested at all, I was reading a book recently called the little book that beats the market really good book.
You can read in one sitting, really fascinating actually, and he posits that there are only two metrics that are really important for tracking for really getting above average returns, all right?
7:27
The first is the PE Ratio which is the Us to earnings ratio.
And if you think about what Warren Buffett talks about in terms of buying businesses, he says, you want to buy good businesses for cheap prices, right?
So, the figuring out whether it's a cheap price is going to be the price to earnings ratio.
How much, how much net free cash flow.
How much, how much earnings is this company?
7:44
Creating that?
Those are the same thing.
But I'm just saying, generally, right?
How much what's the earnings of this company and what's the price for those earnings?
All right, Hey guys, love that you're listening to the podcast.
If you ever want to have the video version of this which usually has more effects more visuals, more graphs, you don't drawn out stuff, sometimes it can help hit the brain centers in different ways.
8:06
You can check out my YouTube channel.
It's absolutely free.
So check that out if that's what you are into and if not keep enjoying the show, This is number one.
So ideally you want a really low price for really high earnings.
Now, the second thing is return on Capital and so, what that means is, now imagine a company that has, I'll give you two scenarios.
8:27
Let's say we've got a company that, you know, let's say they make a million dollars in profit and when they reinvest a million dollars in profit into their company, let's say it's opening locations, just for whatever reason, right?
So they open a new location and front cost a million dollars, open location.
And then that location gets them, a hundred thousand dollars a year in additional earnings.
8:46
All right, that's a 10% return on Capital, right?
That's what that means.
Now let's take an alternative scenario.
Let's say that Another company for a million dollars can open 10 locations.
In each of those locations can do a hundred thousand dollars a year, right?
9:02
That would be a 100% return on Capital and so the beauty of these two metrics is the PE the price to earnings ratio.
Tells you.
This is a, is the price of the business were buying.
This is a cheaper business, right?
The return on Capital tells us the quality of the business that were buying, which is how good is this business?
9:21
A great business is a business that can take a small amount of money.
Generate lots of cash from it, right?
And so by combining these two things, finding the companies that have the lowest PE ratio with the highest return on Capital, you can consistently beat the market.
That's kind of the premise of the book, which actually really interesting.
They, they use this algorithm that did these two things and they beat the S&P 500, which is basically, I want to say impossible.
9:42
It's very difficult to do for most people and they beat it for.
I think, like, 25 years, which is nuts by a big percentage, which was crazy.
The thing is that the companies that are usually in this bucket are usually companies that are going through issues.
And so you're basically buying mispriced bets, right and half, the companies that you buy that meet these qualifications end up taking, but the other half that might have had some bad press because of something are disproportionately discounted in pricing.
10:09
And as a result in the future, they outperformed the price that you're paying for them, right?
And so to bring the wagon back around here as business owners.
Net free cash flow is my home base.
This is what I care about.
This is the money that Deposit at the end of every month because tomorrow may never come.
10:28
We may get outlawed, our business may be outlawed.
There may be there may be some horrendous thing that happens that blows your business up.
You may have to move locations and stop everything that you're doing and you just don't know.
And so what we are all exposed to that we discount on a regular basis, is something called operational risk, we are all exposed, right?
10:47
And so, if you're doing this for one year to year, five years solely with the hope that someday you're going to sell, Well well, I just want to break the news to you that you have a 99 to 1 chance of not actually succeeding doing that.
And so you might as well take some money out of out of the business every month.
11:04
So, you know, you make money along the way and I can promise you having done it both ways taking money out of the business.
Every month is way more fun.
It's also way less stressful, all right?
Because this is going to be the stuff that allows you to know every month how we're really doing.
When you always leave it in the business account.
11:20
You'll always leave it in there.
You just don't have a feeling for it, but you should be able to Deposit money in your account this month and be like this is better than last month or this is worse than last month.
And you got to feel that.
Not just the numbers but literally what you put into your account.
All right.
And so I'll give you one easy tactic that I was working with one of the, one of the companies that I have an equity interest in.
11:42
Let's, let's imagine you've got a big bucket of money, all right?
This is your bank account for your business every month, you know, after a certain amount of months, what your projected fixed costs are going to be.
All right, now, What I asked this entrepreneur to do because he wasn't taking profit of the business, so I was like, Hey we're going to fix this right now.
11:59
Is you need to come up with a line and you say this is our line.
This is our non-negotiable, everything over this We take out every month.
All right, so everything over 100 Grand everything over 500 Grand.
We're going to take out of the business.
Every single one, where they clear?
This bitch, right?
12:15
All the way down to the bottom.
And by doing this you hold yourself accountable to this level, all right?
And so to wrap this puppy up, if you're not taking profit out of the business, I'd highly recommend doing it number one, number two, if you're not measuring net free cash flow.
You absolutely should because you're losing out on one of the most important metrics.
12:33
This is what Charlie Munger looks at.
This is what Warren Buffett looks at.
This is what I look at not that I'm In the same categories, those guys.
But once I switch to this in terms of my finance and Reporting it really clarified it for everything just not just for me but also for my team, all right?
And when you're looking at businesses in general, if you're thinking about reinvesting in the business, make sure that the dollars that you're choosing to reinvest, you're getting the best return on Capital you possibly can.
12:57
All right so if you're reinvesting the business and you think you're going to get 10% back, we might as well just put it in the S&P and get that right.
And not even have to deal with all the mess and that's okay.
If you make a million bucks a year, you make 500,000 a year and you just put it in the SP every single year.
You're going to be really, really wealthy, right?
13:14
And that's okay.
And so sometimes your wealth doesn't necessarily have to be generated all entirely from your business or from a sale that you some, they hope to achieve that may not actually happen.
Okay.
That's all I got for you.
So that's my moment for the day now.
13:29
Free cash flow track.
It stack it.
And make sure that you empty your bank account every single month and stack.
The right account, which is your personal bank account.
Lots of love.
Could you soon bye?








Company0:00
Real quick guys.
If you can think about how you found this podcast, somebody probably tweeted it told you about it.
Should it on Instagram or something like that?
The only way this grows is through word of mouth and so I don't run ads, I don't do sponsorships, I don't sell anything.
I only ask is that you continue to pay it forward to whoever showed you or however you found out about this Pockets that you do the exact same thing.
0:19
So if it was a review if it was a post, if you do that would mean the world to me and you throw some good karma out there for another entrepreneur.
Every single entrepreneur has one problem, they think they have multiple problems but they have one problem.
And it's a people problem, welcome to the game, where we talk about it, get more customers how to make more per customer and how to keep them longer in the many failures and lessons.
0:37
We have learned along the way.
I hope you, enjoy and subscribe.
Alright, in this video, what I want to talk about is I just finished our strategic meeting, and it was so apparent.
Some of the new talent that we brought in, how much they really driving growth in in some of our companies.
And I want to talk about this because I think it's a single hardest thing that entrepreneurs face like every single entrepreneur has one problem.
0:58
They think they have Problems.
But they have one problem and it's a people problem, they don't know where to find good.
People number one, number two, they don't know how to hire and recruit those people number three.
If they don't know how to manage those people, number four, they know how to grow and cultivate the talent, right?
1:15
And so that entire process embodies what really growing a business becomes after, you get to probably about 10, 10 to 30 million a year is when Ops really it's really start taking over, especially at 30, it's all about talent.
And I think I've said this before, This is probably the biggest has been the biggest bottleneck for me, Crossing 30 to 100 is was really understanding that I was understanding that it was all about the talent.
1:38
It's actually not about you and that can be really hard for your ego because you love being needed and that's like an interpersonal need that we you know, have from childhood or whatever it is.
We didn't get hugged enough but like that need is something that is outside of the business.
The business doesn't require you.
The business should be able to run on its own, and this is something that I've shifted over time, that being said, it doesn't mean that you can't have Strategic vision for the business, you know, besos just step down for the first time after, you know, 30 years or whatever.
2:05
But, but you're the actual doing the leading all that stuff over time.
The company becomes a company of companies, right, it becomes a conglomerate as you grow.
And so, what I want to talk about specifically today is how to find and know the difference between a player and a be player or really a player and everyone else.
2:24
And I can't really stress how unbelievably important this is and the thing is, is that we talk too much.
Owners.
They're always like my team's awesome and you talk the same, entrepreneur your later.
And that like my that team was horrible, this team's awesome.
And that's because we're Eternal optimists, right?
That's, that's just the reality of it.
2:39
If you can't look at someone on your team and be like, I think this person is kind of weak or I think this person could be better.
Then you really have rose-colored glasses on, right?
And that's the hard part and I honestly this isn't this wasn't real for me until I actually saw teammates of mine, growing divisions of our companies.
2:56
Without me doing it in ways that I had never thought of Once that happened, it became real for me.
I think there's these there, these different steps in your entrepreneurial journey.
I mean the first one was on I remember the first person who did a sale for me.
I cry.
I remember I cried because I heard about on the phone and they're like yeah I sold to people today and I had done every single sale for my business for like a year and a half.
3:17
It's just I was just no one could bring it in, right?
And in the answers other people can bring it in.
You're not special.
But I wasn't real for me.
And as soon as this this girl did this.
I was like, oh my God.
God.
Like I don't have to I don't have to literally make the money, someone else can do this, and I can actually start running the business.
3:37
And so as a huge breakthrough and there's obviously levels to this, right?
And I think the the level that I just recently had a breakthrough on was watching teammates actually grow the business without me right and it's really special.
It's really awesome.
So you're like that's awesome for you.
3:53
Alex, why are you talking to me?
Great question, a players and B players.
So what I want to do is tell you a quick story because I think it's Perfect for illustration.
So we just recently promoted a brand manager, one of our companies And she was given the task of like, hey why don't you think about other revenue streams that we could possibly bring into the company?
4:13
And so, she said, I thought we should start an apparel line because I'm getting lots of messages on social media about how we should have a Peril.
I think that'd be a good opportunity and so her her supervisor said, I think it's a good idea.
Go for it, right?
And so what she did was she emailed, you know, 20 different, you know manufacturing companies for for apparel she got samples from all of them.
4:35
She tried them all on.
She felt them and she showed up to the Strategic meeting and she was like, they were crap.
She was like, I'm not sending that to my customers.
She said those exact words and I can't tell you what it felt like for me as an owner to hear that.
She said, I'm not sending that to my customers and it was because it showed so much ownership, and one of our core tenets is Bureau and Bostitch.
4:56
I'm switching to act like an owner, but that's exactly what she did.
And to push it even further.
She didn't just stop there and say, all this stuff sucks because I would just be presenting a problem.
Instead, she was like, but I did find some manufacturers that don't do manufacturing and fulfillment cuz some Senators do both, which is much more can be done for me as a business, but he's like, but their stuff is legit.
5:16
It's awesome.
Just like so I just need help figuring out.
How many pieces do you want to order as a baseline?
I'll figure out the logistics to get to a third-party fulfillment center so that we can do this apparel Lodge.
And so we ended up coming a solution for it and she felt great about it.
We look too different, you know, designs and and with, with the great quality we were able to come up with Solution.
5:36
But here's here's what I want to bring up break up our for you.
Imagine a normal person, a beep be level employee.
Nothing wrong with them.
There's lots of them right, but they show up they do their job.
They go, right?
They don't take ownership because what an alternative story of what would have happened.
5:54
Is the director says, Hey I want you to look for new Revenue opportunities and that person may or may not have done at level one, right?
Level to.
They actually do it.
And they say, I think apparel.
She says, okay, go check out a Errol now what that person probably would have done was.
Look at three companies from a Google search, maybe or maybe not even sample the product.
6:14
Just look at the pricing and say, hey, I found an apparel company.
We can print our logo on it.
We can ship it out.
That is what Abby player would have done.
And honestly, unless you have an a supervisor, the a supervisor probably would have, let it go.
And what and I'll tell you the difference.
6:32
Hey guys, real quick for those of you guys who are 100 million-dollar offers fans I love you.
I added in a lost chapter that has never been released.
I'm releasing it now transparently.
I'm doing that to build hype 400 dollar leads but you will have the unreleased chapter, it talks about your first Avatar and how to segment customers, make more money.
6:50
You can get it by going to acquisition.com forward slash leads.
Its fo free in exchange for email so that I can email you when we launched under million All Leads and so that you can not miss out on it.
Because last time I sold out for like eight straight weeks really fast, so that is my way of making sure that y'all get first dibs.
7:09
The difference is with the a scenario, you have a high quality product that people buy enjoy and bye again.
And that massively increases the LTV the customer and on top of that, that brand manager cares deeply about the customers and their experience, and she's going to be thinking top of Mind, how do I make this easier?
7:27
How to make this faster, how can I improve their experience, right?
Whereas the be player, You already lost them at like, they don't like the t-shirts, I mean, what do they expect, right?
I mean, like there are 30 dollar t-shirts, I mean they're not going to be, you know, x y z and so, That difference is the game and finding people who think like that a player compared to people who think like the be player is the difference between companies that grow and companies, that die companies that barely competed make it, and companies that Thrive and none of what I just described was earth-shattering.
8:06
It was just a willingness to do more work and raising the bar.
It was having a level of intolerance for anything but But excellence.
And it is my belief that within a company, hierarchy, every person, the higher, the person who runs the division, or the department, or the company, should always have the lowest amount of tolerance for anything, but Excellence, which means you should be intolerant of anything.
8:32
That is not amazing, right?
And that trickles down, it gets diluted right at every level.
It's diluted a little bit more, a little bit more, a little bit more.
And if there comes a day where you see two people and you see a supervisor and you see someone underneath, That supervisor and the person underneath has a has a lower tolerance for anything, but Excellence, then their supervisor, those roles should reverse the person, who cares?
8:56
The most should be the one in charge.
And so if there comes a day where someone cares more about my customers in the experience, in the business that we have than I do, they should rightfully run the company not me and sometimes, entrepreneurs, get to that point.
They have a CEO and they elect them is, they're like, I think that you're better equipped for this.
9:12
And I think that you care more deeply and that's okay, that happens, right?
Phil Knight doesn't run Nike anymore.
But I mean, shoot if basis is it and you obviously stepped out for other reasons, it would not.
But the big picture here is having a level of intolerance, for what an, A versus Abby.
9:28
Looks like starts with us and the thing is, is whoever you hire most people only hire people worse than them.
And so if you're if you're one level removed or two levels removed, dear God, imagine what your what's being hired on the front line, right?
And so you have to carry this torch.
9:45
You have to raise this bar, you have to set Standard.
So that a players will be attracted to you and also so that you can have a team of a players.
And then the entire culture arises, right?
If you've ever been on a winning team on a championship team, you know, the difference between the vibe how people come to practice, how they play the expectations of one another, right, the speed of response, the team were all of that that's culture.
10:10
And that's only created through having the right players on the field, the right people on the bus and kicking off the wrong people.
And I'll end with this quote, from the head of people for Chick-fil-A, which is a company, I admire a lot.
She said, a lot of companies want to compete against us in the championship, but the reality is they lost in the draft and that one really resonated with me because and I'm paraphrasing here that might not have a title, but that was what she said in general.
10:38
And that really struck me.
Because so many of us are also trying to develop offshore, develop Talent, all trying to do, all these things management styles, Etc.
But some people just come with batteries included.
There are some people who are just winners, right?
And you just need to get out of their way and I think that it's worth the extra five interviews.
10:56
It's worth the extra 20 interviews to find the a player.
Because once that person is in place, they will grow, right?
They will grow whatever they touch.
And this has been a deep lesson for me, which is what People are like it's all about people and it is it's just boring and unsexy for most entrepreneurs because we love the promotion.
11:14
We love the sales, we love the marketing, we live all that stuff, right?
We love the product, but the people is what runs it and I think that this has been this has been a deep lesson for me and I hope I hope if you look at your team right now, you don't think oh, they're all amazing right?
Because the reality is they're probably not, right?
11:32
And every single entrepreneur says that I can tell you right now, some people that are weak on our team, right?
But you have to be honest.
About it.
And you have to think not just what are they doing?
What would I be doing in their position?
What initiative would I be taking that?
They're not taking what questions would I be asking that?
11:48
They are not asking and ideally you want someone who's asking questions that you haven't thought of and that's when you know you've got an A player.
So anyways, this comes with time, it comes with experience, it comes with once you've seen an a player you can never unsee them and then you start to use that template to apply to other people, all right?
12:05
And so and then you repeat it over and over again and I think that's why I'm here.
Our subjects time, like you grow, you grow in, Louisville's you grow intolerance, you grow an inner person, understanding you, grown awareness of other people and by as you grow in that awareness, so too, will your selection of talent so too?
Will your recruitment of talent, your management and growth of those people.
12:24
So anyways, hope that made sense, hope that was valid before you.
If you're hiring people only look for a players put in the extra time to get the a player because it will pay, you dividends Beyond Your Wildest Dreams.
And it was a Harvard study that showed that they players were five times more than me players.
And with that, I'll get you soon.
12:39
Bye.
And it was a Harvard study that showed that they players were five times more than me players.
And with that, I'll get you soon.
Bye.

It's Alex from was here.
If you're new to the channel, built three companies that did 110 million dollars in sales and continue to do so.
Now we invest in other companies as well and one of the talks I want to talk about today is the money ladder and so this was actually came up during conversation.
I was having with Layla my wife and she was like you should make a podcast about this just like is you know a lot of people don't know how this works.
0:40
Welcome to the game, we talked about it, get more customers how to make more per customer and how to keep them longer in the many failures and lessons.
We have learned along the way.
I hope you enjoy and subscribe.
So right now I'm writing a handful of books around a.
One of them is kind of wealth beliefs that that changed my life and then I've got a bunch of books on acquisition stuff that's coming out.
0:59
So what's the money ladder?
That's what I'm calling it.
But basically it's the order in which people get paid and a lot of times like one of the biggest beliefs in my life that changed, as I got wealthier and that change before.
I got wealthy, that caused me to become more wealthy was how I viewed the flow of money.
1:14
All right, so what I mean by that is if you look at who gets paid when, right?
When Flows.
You can see typically where where and who is making, who has the most control and who's making the money.
Alright?
So think about it, from a concept of work and payment.
1:30
All right, so at the bottom here, you have an employee in general, all right?
And there's nothing wrong with this, right, ever.
Like I was an employee to so like it's not that there's anything wrong.
It's more so that like this you have to understand how it works from a hierarchy standpoint what happens with an employee's that they work first, right?
1:49
They work first and then they get paid two weeks later so they front their labor.
They front their time and then they get paid two weeks later, right?
Or four weeks later depending on what the job is, right?
So that is if you look at the money flow they have cost of time cost of effort that goes out and then delay and then they get paid right now.
2:10
If you have got somebody who's self-employed This is kind of like a lot of contractors vendors gig economy, Etc.
These people typically there's they're trying to chew scenarios here one is and, and you can see because these people are a little bit more flexible, you'll see them kind of move on this money ladder.
2:27
So on one on the total I'd say we're side of the equation lowest out of the equation.
They basically model the same thing that an employee would that a normal employee would set up, which is different.
The work and they get paid later right later, you know, if they get better and better in the become truly Independent contractor type things.
2:45
Then they might get paid half up front and then Half Upon delivery rights.
It's kind of like 50/50, right.
And then later right, then they start moving up this ladder some of them will get paid upfront or as they as they work etc, right?
So the next one is, Paid first, right?
3:07
So think about this.
If you, if you go to a doctor, right?
They don't do the surgery and then they get paid, they get paid and then they do the surgery, right?
And so if you think about your work like that or your business like that, you get paid first right now.
3:24
This is where like pain and plants and things like that.
Like the more someone pays up front.
And then I would say like in full, right?
That's another kind of mini variable here, right?
They paying somewhat a front are they paying all upfront or whatever getting paid first is another level of kind of wealth and and kind of control and power.
3:44
All right.
Now, but notice, if you're looking at this from the video, we're still got, we can still got a little bit of ways to go up here, right?
So, the above above this, right?
This is kind of like, this is kind of where I see.
People ending, and then you kind of get into like the business side of it, right?
4:02
So Above This, you'd have like Banks, right?
So what it Banks get so banks have something called a capital stack, so this is what I mean by that is when you, when you buy your house, right?
4:18
You're actually the bank's really buying your house and then you're paying the bank back, the bank is a preferred creditor.
What that means is if you know, shit, Hits the fan, they get paid first.
And then whatever is left over is yours, right?
That's how it works.
That's how you repay your mortgage when you sell your house and then whatever is left over.
4:37
The scraps, go to you, right Banks, get paid first, their preferred creditors and so when you're thinking about like money in general, look at where the exchange flows, right?
Is who's fronting time and then getting paid or who splitting it up a front or who gets paid in full, right?
4:55
And then if shit goes, Who's bad.
Who's the one who gets paid out first and who's left with the scraps?
Now I'd say that there's one one thing above Banks here.
Which I would say is insurance.
It's really interesting.
I've learned a lot about in terms of the last year, so insurance.
5:14
Is fascinating, Insurance gets paid far before they ever have to do anything.
Think about that.
A Mossad agent quick break, just to let you know.
We've been starting to post on LinkedIn and want to connect with you.
5:31
Alright so send me a connection request.
A note letting me know that you listen to the show and I will accept it.
There's anyone you think that would be should be connected with tag them in one of my or laila's posts?
And I will give you all the love in the world.
All right, so let's get back to the show.
You pay your insurance for 20 years before they have to fulfill what they are due and they also can not end up having to fulfill anything and you just get paid, they just get paid for 20 years for truly doing nothing, right?
5:59
If you really think about how the money flows, like, really think about it for a second.
Imagine you have a business.
Imagine I started signing people up for insurance business, you know, Alex hormones, you know, insurance.
And I just start going around saying, hey, I'll ensure your life.
Hey, I'll internal your life.
Hey, I'm sure your life, right?
6:15
And people just start saying I'll sign up and they start paying me a thousand dollars a month, and I've got 100 families 500 families.
Who start paying me a thousand dollars, two thousand dollars a month.
I'm doing a million dollars a month and I do that for decades, right?
And then as people, you know, come to term because of how I wrote the contracts or whatever this is, obviously a shitty way of doing it, but candidly it, it does happen.
6:40
You know, they might not qualify or they can no longer afford the fees because I increase the fees as they become higher and higher risk, right?
I've actually me needing to fulfill this stuff.
So the point is is that if you look at insurance it's basically the opposite of a depreciating asset.
6:56
So when you, when you depreciate a building so you buy something and then you depreciate in your tax, a lot of people see that as a good thing.
So yeah, we can depreciate it that it's only a quote, good thing because in your mind because the tax code not because it's actually good that things get old and become outdated, right?
Think about it.
7:12
So insurance is the reverse of that.
So instead of putting all your Capital up front and then having being depreciate, something over time, insurance companies get all the money up front and then they get to appreciate the money over time and then pay you off of that, right?
And there's a reason that insurance company is the oldest companies in the world.
7:29
The oldest ones are 180 200 300 years old and it's because that is a business model that is unreal.
Even I mean they predate the tax code didn't have to pay taxes.
So interesting.
So when I think about this stuff this was a this is hopefully this is valid to be valuable for you when you think about and you know, actually I'll put up one level above this on the top level.
7:57
I'll say God and franchisors.
Obviously, I'm not saying franchisors were God, it's kind of just being funny, don't get personal.
All right?
And so the last little Above This is that God gets 10% off the top. .
8:13
For life.
And so, that's where you can see the money ladder, right?
All the way at the bottom, people front their time front, their effort, friends of Labor, they delay.
And then they get paid, they move up to self-employed they front.
8:29
They your time where they split, you know, they get half now half later, and as they move up this ladder, they can pay more upfront, right?
A lot of, that's because of demand, because of how good you are, right?
You're a doctor.
You get paid first before you do your surgery, right?
If you're if you're a professional your great consultant, something that you get paid up front.
8:45
Right beyond that.
You've got Banks who they get paid first and they leave people the scraps afterwards.
That's when there's a defined pot of money above that, you've got insurance companies who get paid the whole time and then may or may not ever have to fulfill on their their work, right?
9:02
So then there they get money guaranteed, but the work that they have to fulfill on is not guaranteed think about that, right?
And then above that, you've got God who gets 10% off top line of what you make So I hope this was valuable for you.
This is the money ladder as I see wealth and as I thought of these things, as time has gone on, I shifted My Views around it, I changed the way we did agreements, all that kind of stuff and so hopefully you find some value in it.
9:29
So this is one of the beliefs that changed my life that that made me LOL.
Here is watching where the money flows watching where it goes watching.
Who gets paid one.
Keeping awesome.
Bye.
So I hope this was valuable for you.

Hey guys, real quick.
So Leyland are definitely working on our social media presence.
If you guys haven't noticed and we're just breaking now into LinkedIn.
All right.
It's not as bad as I thought it's actually a pretty awesome so far and you guys have been really cool in there and people are sharing our stuff a lot.
So if we aren't connected on LinkedIn, it go ahead and let's connect and let's rock and roll.
0:17
And so the reason and the psychology behind this is that people feel safer saying, no, welcome to the game where we talk about how to get more customers, how to make more per customer and how to keep them longer in the many failures and lessons.
We have learned along the way.
I hope you enjoyed And subscribe.
What's going on, everyone?
Alex Rosie here founder of gym, launch Alan Prestige labs, and owner of a couple other companies.
0:39
And today, I'm going to talk to you about How to sell some stuff.
All right.
So there's there's there's three types of questions.
I think I've talked to other videos about how, how to structure your sales conversations.
But I haven't talked as much about the nature of the questions in the types of responses that you're getting, right?
0:56
And so in a sales process, right?
Your you have some questions that are going to be mining questions.
That's trying to extract information from the Prospect and the remainder of the questions are questions to get agreement, right?
So you're going to put a proposition out there and ask for agreement, right?
And if you get enough agreements, it's going to be natural.
1:12
They're going to want to move forward working with you.
Now the way that you structure these questions, all right I'd say that you have yes, based questions you have neutral questions and then you have negatively inclined questions.
All right, first time I heard about this from Chris Voss, he's the guy who does the you wrote the book?
1:29
Never split the difference, really interesting stuff and so yes base question would be like sound great.
Yes that sounds great, right?
Neutral type of question would be like, fair enough?
Does that sound fair?
Are it's unreasonable to you, right?
1:44
Maybe like.
Well, that sounds reasonable.
That's still technically.
Yes.
Base question.
But the question that we're asking, has a neutral tone to it.
All right.
Because we're not saying, hey, is this the most amazing thing you've ever heard of?
Like, do you think this is the most amazing program?
The Amazing product like, blah, blah, blah.
That's asking a lot of someone, right?
2:02
For them to agree to that.
So, that would be a harder.
Yes, to get, it's easier to get something, like a reciprocal.
Yes, which I would say, someone says, you know, that's a lot.
We say no worries.
What if we did this fair enough?
They say, well, he made a concession, that sounds fair.
2:18
Or if we did, this, does that sound reasonable?
That's not like a fair expectation.
Yes, it does.
Great.
And then you can go to close the sale.
And if you've heard any of my past sales stuff, one of my favorite closes, which I got from Jordan Belfort.
Is fair enough, right?
I just love this close so much, because it's, like, fair enough, right?
2:35
You make a concession, fair enough.
And so many times, we were like, well, they made a concession, and I'm a reciprocal human being.
It's very hard for me to deny.
Why this request?
And so yes, I do believe it's fair.
And then you say, boom, then let's move forward, right?
But this is one that I learned very recently that I really liked and I when I look back through my actual conversations, I do this.
2:54
And that's why I think it's so interesting because I'm going to I'm going to be I'm going to level with you really quickly.
All the people that I know who teach sales are natural-born salesman.
Which is interesting, right, they're natural-born salesman, I don't know a lot of people who teach sales who weren't naturally very good at it quickly, right.
3:18
And so, there are some things that people naturally do because they've had a lot of experience doing it and usually, you get a lot of experience doing it because when you start doing it, you get enough success that you can you can steamroll right?
And grow and get a lot of volume.
And then once you do lots of volume, then you come Master at it.
But yet some sort of inclination or proclivity towards the skill.
3:37
That being said, is mean that anyone else can't become a great salesman, it just means you might have to have more reps to get there.
Now that being said no base statements.
This is actually where you you go in opposition, right?
And so, the reason and the psychology behind this per my understanding and it makes complete sense to me.
3:54
At least is that people feel safer saying, no people feel like they retain their autonomy.
They feel like they're there at ease, it's harder, especially like you think about decision fatigue at the end of the day, people don't want to be responsible.
Anything, they don't feel vulnerable to saying yes and agreeing to something right.
4:10
Instead, they prefer to say no and stay safe, right?
But if you phrase your questions properly, you can get people to say, yes by saying, no, which is one of the most powerful sales taxes.
I shouldn't a different video where Richard?
Schwartz taught me how to get someone to say yes.
By saying, hey you don't want anything else.
4:25
Do you know, I don't want anything else and by doing that they got 95% of people to take an upsell.
All right now, no bass question.
This is something like.
Would you be opposed to moving forward today?
Would it be completely unreasonable for us to get started?
At the end of this conversation?
Would it be a completely?
4:42
I wouldn't would be completely out of left field for me to say that we should start, you know, start start working together today.
So it's all of these, would you be opposed to would you be against?
Would it be unreasonable, right?
All of those things are no base kind of antecedents or start proceedings that that that lead into a no base question.
5:02
And so think about this, if I said I'm going to give you the same same And of scenario here, if I'm trying to get my wife to go, where I want to go to dinner, right?
So I want to go to Cheesecake Factory, the finest establishment in the land.
All right, count it get the Cajun Chicken Little.
So you can get up, half grilled in half, half a fright and get the, get the sauces from the Thai, lettuce wraps, anyways.
5:23
If I say, hey babe, you want to go to Cheesecake Factory?
She might be like, well, no, I don't want to go to to see a factory, right?
Or like, I'm not really sure right now, if I switch that, I said, they would you be against going to cheat a fact.
Hurry, I'm not against going to Tri-C effect and I'm like great, let's go most Nation real quick.
5:45
If you are a business owner that has a big old business and wants to get to a much bigger business, going to fifteen hundred dollars.
Plus, we would love to talk to you and if you like that or like to hear more about it, go to acquisition.com, you planning on the page and talk to one of our team and see if we can help you get there.
6:04
And so that's the beauty of a no base question.
See how different it for it's phrased, right?
If I say hey you excited to move forward today.
That's a yes, right?
It's harder to get someone.
Say yes, I'm excited before today would you be opposed to moving forward the end of the conversation?
No, I'm not opposed to moving forward.
Great.
6:20
And we get the sale.
And so this is really interesting because what I find because there's there's lots of literature on, you know, getting people to say lots of yeses and trial closes and things like that throughout the sales process.
But in My mind.
These are all still ways of getting agreement, which is the goal.
6:39
So it's simply using psychology in terms of how people like to respond to things how they feel in the moment of, you know, saying yes, makes them feel vulnerable saying, no makes them feel safe and leveraging.
That now that being said, it doesn't mean every single question you have to ask.
It has to be a no base question, but I think if you, if you can rephrase a couple of the key Milestone questions that you have in your sales conversations or if you feel like you're kind of closer to the edge with someone Leaning towards a new base question.
7:05
I think is something that natural salesman do well automatically, like, is it unreasonable for us to move forward today, right?
Would you be opposed to moving forward?
Today, would you be opposed to knocking out the paperwork?
Should be opposed to.
Are you against XYZ, right?
Oh no, I'm not against.
All right, let's rock and roll right?
All of these are still ways to get questions and so I think that in some of my sales scripts, right now we're going to be shifting from fair enough.
7:28
Clothes dive is so wired in my brain from doing it so many times to some no based phrasing.
Because it's easier to get agreement with prospects, especially even if there are kind of fatigued at the end of the day or which is when people are less likely to want to say, yes to things counter example.
7:47
There could be decision fatigue, and they just want to say yes, to to get done with it, right?
Depends on the size of the purchase.
But anyways, I hope this was valuable for you in terms of phrasing behind the questions.
Obviously, this is not for mining based questions where you're trying to extract information from someone and to better understand this is really we're trying to get agreements towards Milestones to work together.
8:07
Alright, so I hope this makes sense.
Keeping awesome.
Lots of love and I'll catch you guys soon.
Bye. we're trying to get agreements towards Milestones to work together.
Alright, so I hope this makes sense.
Keeping awesome.
Lots of love and I'll catch you guys soon.
Bye.








0:00
Real quick.
Because you guys already know that, I don't run any ads on this and I don't sell anything.
And so, the only ask that I can ever have you guys that you help me spread the word so we can have more entrepreneurs, make more money, feed their families, make better products, and have better experiences for their employees and customers.
And the only way we do that is if you can rate and review and share this podcast, so the single thing that I have to do is you can just leave review will take you 10 seconds or one type of the thumb, mean, the absolute world to me.
0:25
And more importantly, it may change the world of someone else.
The reason entrepreneurship is so difficult.
Just because it forces you to change who you are your identity, the values that you supposedly have as you continue to grow.
And I'm not saying you are, you know, honesty etcetera, those types of values.
But the the way that you see the world and how you operate, welcome to the game, where we talk about it, get more customers how to make more per customer and how to keep them longer in the many failures and lessons.
0:47
We have learned along the way.
I hope you enjoy and subscribe, what's going on, everyone alexandros here three companies who now have done over 110 million dollars in sales.
And this video, I want to talk about the entrepreneurial Journey as it relates to control.
And the reason I think this is so important and this is probably the biggest reason that people get stuck.
1:06
Alright, and so at the end, so what I'm going to do here is I'm going to explain kind of how control shifts throughout the entrepreneurial Journey where people get stuck and at the very end of the video, I'll tell you basically the most valuable rule of thumb that I've learned in scaling our company's.
All right, so first thing is, the reason entrepreneurship is so difficult is because it forces you to change who you are your identity, the values that you supposedly have as you continue to grow and I'm not Saying you're, you know, honesty etcetera, those types of values.
1:32
But the the way that you see the world and how you operate, because in the very beginning you, most of us at some point have to transition from a lack of control to complete control.
Right?
And what I mean by that is either you, you know, went straight in entrepreneurship where you shifted control from your parents to yourself, right.
1:50
Or if in many other instances you started you had a job.
Someone else was kind of responsible for your income for the most part because they're paying you you weren't generating yourself.
And then and so you're very limited, right?
And then you jump to taking complete ownership over all of your outcomes, right?
2:07
And so you have complete control.
The difficult thing is that the thing that takes you, the first step that huge leap of saying I'm going to be completely in control is usually the thing that will stifle most entrepreneurs who are trying to grow, right?
Because if you have complete control and complete ownership, that's great.
2:23
But there's only one of you, right?
And so, what would that leads to is kind of this this by back?
And I think the first time I heard this Recently was dim.
We're talking about buyback principle and I just like the terminology but basically you just continue to buy back your time as you continue to grow the company.
2:40
And so, in the very beginning, most people are buying back support time.
So it's just kind of like, you know, lower skilled support tasks that they're doing in their business, so it's like them and then they've got maybe an assistant, right?
And then after that, there might be higher level support or administrative tasks that might be like billing collection.
3:00
Contracts.
All that kind of stuff that might happen in the business.
After you have like your kind of support role taken care of from there.
The next level of control that people have to give up is selling, right?
No one can sell like me.
No one gets it.
Like I get it.
People just don't relate to my customers, right?
3:15
And the issue is control, you're trying to control the whole thing.
And the thing is that every time you add someone in Need by back more of your time, you relinquish control.
And so the thing is that every level of Entrepreneurship, I'm owing you right now.
It is always uncomfortable because the thing that you are now holding onto is the thing that you have to give up.
3:35
And this has been one of the hardest things for me.
And a lot of part, a lot of this is because we identify with being the thing right in the beginning.
I'll give you a simple example, because we work so many gems in the gym, which company people be like, no one treat trains a class like I do, right?
3:53
So, the first level of fulfillment, right.
First level of of delivery is, is training, right?
It's also the first Thing they need outsourced and the reason for that is because the market will pay someone $15 an hour.
Somebody will come in for $15 an hour to do that work.
Well, if you have work, that pays you 100 dollars narrow, then you should be doing 100 an hour, and not the 15, our work, but they think, because they like to feel special, they like to feel unique, no one can train, like I can train.
4:19
Well, I mean obviously there's probably some people trained a lot better than you so maybe you should let them do the training right?
And then after that usually the business owner will do contracts billing, you know, and they're usually not that good at it anyways because they're entrepreneurs.
And so, that's the next thing that happens, right?
And so, then the next piece might be some sort of assistant of some kind or some sort of right hand operator that would help you out, right?
4:39
And then again there it's like one, no, I don't trust anyone with the money if I'm not looking at the money then then we're going to we're going to lose.
Well I used to say the same thing until I had someone who Who's better at tracking the money than I am?
Huh crazy, right?
It's hard to give up control of the money.
Not today, it'll look at it, right?
4:56
But I had to give up control of it.
And so, then I'm just selling, right?
Because that's the highest value thing I could do at the time.
Was I could just talk to people and get them to give us money, right?
But then eventually, there's too many too many consultations that have to happen.
I still have to run the business, right?
And so, I have to give that control over to someone else, which is probably one of the biggest and most difficult people.
5:13
This is usually either thing that gets in the way people going, I'd say from a million over So we're doing over a million so up to a million dollars, a year, you can just sell yourself, right?
Like you yourself can sell and you can have these other people who are assisting you, but once you cross a million, it's usually difficult to be doing the selling yourself.
5:29
And that's where we have to start scaling sales.
Hey guys, real quick.
If you're new to the podcast, I have a book on Amazon called 100 million-dollar offers that over eight thousand five star reviews.
It has almost a perfect score.
You can get it for 99 cents on Kindle.
The reason I bring it up is that I put over 1,000 hours in the writing that book and it's my biggest gift to our community.
5:48
So it's my very Shameless way of trying to get you to like me more and ultimately make more dollars to that later on in your business career I push the bargain with you so that's my give go check it out Amazon and back to the show.
You have to give that control up, right?
6:05
The next level, after control of doing control of the sales is now you have to teach other people in a group, not just one person, but a group of people had a sales, you have to manage system, you have to recruit, you have to hire you, train compensate, etcetera, and again, this levels of control.
But again, here here, even with the sales team, you're talking maybe three, maybe 10 million.
6:25
When you get to 10 million, trying to go to 30 the level of control that you're giving up, here is leadership.
Weird, right, because there's too many departments, too many people you can't lead everyone, right?
So you have to lead a small group of people and get them to lead the people who are underneath of them, right?
6:42
And so again that's a level of control its control over your, your cultured obviously, you want to lead it.
You want to lead.
By example.
You want to be the most could distill down version of that thing so that it permeates, right?
But as you continue to buy back, I think the question that I like to ask myself, is what am I?
6:57
What am I trying to control?
Well, I try to control and I think, if you think about that and then rather, what part of my identity, my giving up, by giving up this control, I used to think I was that, you know, such a great salesman, right?
Known can sell, like, I can sell But you know what, I can't outsell 12, guys.
7:20
Right.
I literally can't you know I'm I can't do it and so and if the business model requires, you know, only a soup, like your level of sales to to make it work, then the model is broken, right?
You should be able to have people close half as many as you and still make the model work right now.
7:36
Obviously every time you want to get myself better than you because all they're doing is selling right where as you were, when you were selling the way you did, you were running the business.
And so with each each of this kind of cycle, is you have to give up control.
And so I told you to begin the video that I will give you the rule of thumb that has been served me very well and running my companies which is how far we do you get, right.
7:59
How far away do you get when you when you relinquish control?
Because the thing is is you relinquish control.
But you still take full accountability and responsibility for the results.
That's what's Wild is that you have to say I'm going to give this over to you, I'm losing control and yet I'm still responsible.
8:16
I don't trip you up, but the rule of thumb that I use is know where the bodies are buried, know where the bodies are buried.
And so, what I mean by that is, If I don't know where the flaws are in a department, I'm too far away.
8:31
So if I'm, if you know, if I talk to, let's say a marketing director, I talked to a sales director, I talk to, you know, customer support our talk to, you know, finance and I don't know where the bodies are buried.
Like, I don't know what the issues are because every department has issues every department has problems.
It's a business, it's made of humans and humans are imperfect, right?
8:49
Which means that there are always imperfections, there are things that are not working as well as they could, if I can't, Name problems.
If I don't know, where the bodies are buried in the department that I'm too far away, right.
Now, when I say that is, I mean I have given up too much control.
9:05
That's not the issue.
It's just, I need more transparency.
I need to be paying more attention to that area and this rule of thumb has served me well.
So if I start hearing only good news from a department and I don't hear anything - I'm too far away.
And this has been my managerial leadership rule of thumb that has really helped me a ton is I know where the bodies are buried.
9:26
And so this is the entrepreneurial journey in a nutshell.
I got a lot of feedback from the 0 to 100 million dollar video that I made of kind of the steps from a business model perspective.
But from the personal perspective, the issue is control and that's why most people can't get stuck.
Because they have all these personal issues that prevent them from controlling.
9:43
I'm sorry, I just don't trust, people have trust issues as well.
Get over it because you're not going to build something great without trusting other people.
So if you want your mom or your dad, or the thing that, you know, you have your trust issues with to be the reason that you're not successful, the give them more power go, you know power to you right?
9:58
Just get just keep giving them control over your life because you have these issues, right?
Or you can decide.
I think this person is done enough damage to me in my life.
I'm not going to let them stop me from accomplishing.
What I want to I want to accomplish and so I'm going to take back that power.
10:14
I'm going to take back the control over my outcomes take responsibility which may feel shitty in the moment because of me.
As I suck but at least I suck and I don't point it them saying they suck because I can control what I do and as a result, I can go through this process and continue to buy back and relinquish control by back and relinquish control by back and really cruise control first of the doing then of the admin, then of the, the Ops, then of the sales.
10:37
And then if having a sales team, and then of the leadership and then continuing on and on, as we relinquish more and more control, right?
How can you be free if you control everything, interesting?
Anyways, lots of love.
Being awesome.
I'll catch you guys on the flip side, we found this valuable.

If you are a business owner that has a big old business and wants to get to a much bigger business, going to 50 $100.
Plus, we would love to talk to you and if you like that or would like to hear more about it, go to acquisition.com, you can play anywhere on the page and talk to one of our team and see if we can help you get there.
0:17
Welcome to the game where we talk about, how to get more customers, how to make more per customer and how to keep them longer and the many failures and lessons.
We have learned along the way.
Hope you enjoy and subscribe.
March of 2019.
My wife and I were walking In together after just having finished a 4.4 million dollar month and she turned to me and she said, Alex, let's just shut it all down.
0:38
She's like, I'm so tired of this.
I'm so burnt out.
I just don't want to do this anymore, and it was at that moment that I realized that in order to progress in the entrepreneurial game, we had to change the way we operate at the way we thought.
And so, if you're an entrepreneur and you're you're a business owner.
0:55
The number one thing that I've seen that creates success is longevity me That you can continue to play the game because the end of the day, none of us is going to quit business or hopefully not quit business.
And so in order to decrease the likelihood that we quit, which is the only way to fail.
We have to think through our problems with a defined framework.
1:15
And so, rather than focus on the actual framework of the decision-making, what I want to do is focus in around the state in which you can manage your own thoughts, all right?
And so I've had to do with plenty of stressors as you can imagine.
So if you're stressed in your own business right now, like you Add a zero to whatever your revenue is, and you'll have ten times the potential for stress.
1:33
If you were 10 times bigger or 100 times, this is the stress.
If you're a hundred times bigger which depends on who's listening, we may be that for you and so I can tell you truthfully that the way that I've been able to eliminate pressure, which is created a longevity in the game for me has been through four strategies that actually work in the real world for me.
1:53
So, the first that I do, whenever I have any kind of negative situation is I go 1000x - alright.
And then I reevaluate.
So let me explain what that means.
So if for example there's something that's bad that happens we get a bad review or we get, you know, a client subset.
2:12
Or I have an employee who says something bad to another employer employee, that's key leaves or someone tries to, you know, a competitor, steal stuff and then starts back whatever it is, right?
There's a million problems and go business or if cash flow issues are you can't make payroll whatever it is.
Right?
I like to think of this one, is my first, this is my like, my first line of defense.
2:31
The first thing I think about is, If this were to happen a thousand times more, right?
And this works really well with what I would consider like minor to medium-sized grievances.
So things that happen that are kind of everyday business that can, you know, bother you for a day or two days or a week, right?
2:47
Well, if you can just shorten that Loop of that cycle of you being disturbed, because thing is lots of those things are going to happen every single week.
A lot of times you just don't know about them, right?
Depending on the size of your business.
And so I just happen to know about it.
Now, it's so, first off, I like to think about that but second is all.
3:02
This right?
Which is all imagine that every day in my life, this happens whatever that thing is, Right, customers upset.
Now obviously, if it's a core issue, you have to resolve it.
But in terms of like, it happening in my effective or my emotional reaction to it, then I think to myself, well, if this happened every single day and this happened every hour of every day.
3:22
At some point, I would become desensitized to it, right?
Because I had so much stimulus of this.
I would not be able to have an emotional response and so when I think and I imagine myself experiencing this - thing over and over and over and over.
Over again, it's called - visualization.
Then what ends up happening is, I become immune to it.
And so I think to myself, well, if I can become immune to it, after a thousand tries, I can become immune to it on the first try because means nothing is actually changed only by perspective on the occurrence and in so doing you can short while yourself to that end outcome and then fast forward it to the present.
3:52
So you can live the rest of your day or less if you're weak without being emotionally disturbed and when you do that, at least for me, I feel like I make better decisions.
And so I think for most of us as entrepreneurs and business owners, We are judged by the marketplace by the quality of our decisions.
That's ultimately what it is, right?
It's just how good are the quality of the decisions that we make.
4:09
And so if I can decrease the likelihood that I make bad decisions and I can do that on a regular basis, then this is something that protects my mind and candidly it's what makes life worth living.
The second thing that I'll do is that when I'm preparing for something that that I need to start doing right?
4:26
Because there might be habits or things that you need to start doing and not this is a, this is a slightly different example but it's giving you the Four different strategies that have worked really well.
For me.
The second one is, let's say you wanted to start working out because you're like, you know what, I've been neglecting my health or, you know, you don't start eating healthy or whatever it is, right?
4:42
Those are Fitness examples but just go with me.
What I will do is I will expect the worst circumstance.
All right.
So rather than saying, okay, I'm going to go work out and feel excited right?
To go workout.
I'm super pumped.
What I want to do is I want to plan and prepare my mental state for when it times to work out when it Time to work out.
5:03
I'm going to be exhausted.
I'm not going to slept well and have a lot of business dress.
And so I have to expect that going into every workout.
Now, if I don't have that happen, then it's a bonus rather than expecting nothing to be my mental state.
And then when something bad does happen, then I have this reason, right?
5:21
And so it, it really does go into truly expecting the worst case scenario and making the preform decision to act.
Anyways, despite that because you have planned for it.
So, Most people, most humans have really good psychological resilience if we brace for it.
5:37
So if you're about to give someone bad news, for example, you actually have to let them.
Hey, this is bad news.
How you might want to sit down for this because people actually are very resilient if you give them a moment to emotionally brace themselves.
And so what we're doing here is using this bracing technique on ourselves in advance of a situation that is likely to occur at sometime.
5:53
Between now, and when we die, especially if it's a habit that has to be ongoing.
Right?
And so what I do is I emotionally brace For the worst scenario.
All right, that's number two.
Because you guys already know that, I don't run any ads on this and I don't sell anything.
6:13
And so, the only ask that I can ever have you guys that you help me, spread the words we cannot more entrepreneurs, make more money, feed their families, make better products and have better experiences for their employees and customers.
The only way we do that is if you can rate and review and share this podcast, so the single thing that I have to do is you can just leave review but they can 10 seconds or one type of the thump.
6:33
It means the absolute world to me.
And more importantly, it may change the world for someone else.
The third thing that I do and this is probably the one that I use the most.
It's really the one that I use the most, actually, I'll say that one for last a different version of this.
6:51
The emotional brace is an extreme version, right?
So kind of this is, imagine the thing that you just said happened, that bothered you for a thousand times, then it stops affecting you.
The second one, is you emotionally brace yourself?
The third one.
Is you imagine worst case.
7:08
All right now the point here is kind of like a pain anchor.
Okay.
And so what I mean by a painting Kerr, is it gives you perspective on your current issues?
Right?
So for this, for example, whenever you've had a family member died or someone close to you die or some of you even have a pet died, depends on where you're at in your life, right?
7:26
If you have something that was painful for you, right?
All of us benefit, we get the gift of perspective from those who died.
That's the, like, the one of the final gifts at any death occurs, that's in your proximity will give you right?
And so for me, I think about that - situation.
7:42
I really like, trying soak myself in it right.
Really try and like, put it on and walk around and what that painful state would be whatever, whatever.
Worst case scenario can imagine might be death of a spouse, might be death of a parent, whatever, right?
Or child, something horrific, right?
But if I can, truly allow myself to go there, Then what happens is, I get so much context and perspective on the little thing.
8:06
Like, somebody bashing a piece of content, or someone saying that they hate your ad or whatever, it might be, the thing that is deriding it.
And all of a sudden that problem becomes massively minimized, right?
It becomes almost inconsequential.
And what I found is that over my life in the business, There are so many there's an infinite amount of problems.
8:25
Truly, there's an unlimited amount of problems.
I could think of so many things, we should be doing, or we could be doing better or should not have happened, right?
But it's only because we put the word should in front of it.
That we have an expectation.
That is different than reality, which creates the friction in our minds.
Chris, the dissonance, it creates the unhappiness that we have.
8:42
And so, if I can imagine the worst case scenario and then actively minimize my current situation, then I usually can get right through it and most times.
What I found is that most problems shrink into a relevance within broader context, they actually never get solved, we just realized that we just don't care and that they are no longer meaningful to us and so that has been something that's been very useful for me as we've grown.
9:06
Because frankly, the bigger your company gets the more ability and potential you have to become stressed.
And I think most of us are here for freedom and so if you want freedom, then you have to or least for me, I have found that I have to manage my mental state in order to continue to make high-quality decisions.
And so, that leads me to the last one, which is probably my my Favorite and most used one that I use on on on anything and this may this may bother some of you and that's okay.
9:29
This is intense re universe is that this is a this is a worldview that I have.
So if you are if you are, you know, don't don't be trigger, you know, it's a don't take offense to this, but I'm telling you what is works for me.
And so I believe that the universe will continue to expand until eventually everything becomes a fine Mist over a long enough time Horizon.
9:52
The sun will give out all stars will extinguish and then everything will just become a fine mist and as silly as that may sound it means that anything that we do this video anything that I accomplished in this world will eventually disappear and be meaningless.
And so some people find that incredibly depressing.
10:11
I don't I find that to be incredibly meaningful because it means to me that I'm allowed to I am the only person that ascribes meaning to anything Because it means that nothing has inherent meaning.
And so, that means that when I have any stressors in my life, I'm saying that I'm choosing my brain is choosing to make meaning out of this, when there was no meaning to be made to begin with.
10:34
And so by doing that, I can play the notes of the piano of meaning that happened across the occurrences and circumstances in my life.
And so, when I think about it in this context, everything shrinks into a relevance.
And so, a lot of the concepts around, like I want to build a legacy.
10:49
I want.
I want to make an impact.
I want to leave a dent.
In the universe you're not you're probably not going to leave a dent in the universe and even if you made some big advancement within 500 years like it'll probably be forgotten and that would be like if you're the top point zero zero zero zero one percent right?
11:05
It's unlikely.
But it is 100% likely that over a long enough time Horizon everything will disappear right?
And by doing that for me, it decreases.
The pressure that I put on myself for having to I must I should I have to, like, I can't live without those.
11:22
Thoughts.
That strangle me, right?
There's other things that destroy my ability to make decisions because I come way more emotional as a result of them.
And so whenever I have any kind of negative occurrence or a stressors that come up in my life which are inevitable, I use this as my ultimate frame of reference, this is my ultimate trump card that I use to keep my my emotions at Bay and ultimately say I am the master of my own Universe.
11:50
I get to decide what has meaning.
And for me, I'll tell you what, what, what I have found most meaningful for me, is that my purpose in life to my knowledge at this point is to learn.
I love learning.
And so, that is, that is why I make these videos, because I feel like I'm able to better learn how to think, I'm better learns, how to run businesses?
12:13
I'm better, learn.
I can better learn all of the aspects of everything by teaching it, right?
And I'm sure if you ever ever did a book report when you were in high school, you learn the one chapter you had to do your book report.
Owner.
Give a presentation on way better than any of the other chapters because when you have to teach something you have to learn it better, you have to learn the nuances of what make something work.
12:30
And so, for me, even cataloging, these things has been useful for me because I think these are all the things that I do, huh?
But now I have a process that I can continue to use rather than use haphazardly just because I've just trained myself over time doing this.
And so I don't know where you're at in your business career, if you're, you know, yet seven figures ready figures or multi figures your multiple companies, whatever it is, right?
12:52
Right, this has been so personally impactful for me that it has helped me be in this for the Long Haul, because if nothing has meaning, except for what I choose to give, meaning that, it means I can choose to only play games that I find meaningful.
13:10
And by extension, I will not fall out of the game or quit because the thing that I'm doing is the thing that that I derive the most meaning from and so I will be able to outlast longer players in that purse.
And what happened is for me, my life becomes a glorification to an ideal that I create.
13:31
And so, for me, like, the content I will, I will do everything I can to continue to improve on this.
I'm bumping, coaches, I'm going through courses to try and make the lessons that I have more engaging more entertaining.
More educational have more stories woven into them, so that hopefully, I can transfer these things to someone else because that is what I find meaningful not because it is eternally any meaningful.
13:51
But just because that ideal lie to me, has meaning.
And so, that is something that I believe is eternal values are Eternal and values will exist, even when everything disappears in the universe.
And so, for me, I choose to dedicate my content to those ideals. lie to me, has meaning.
And so, that is something that I believe is eternal values are Eternal and values will exist, even when everything disappears in the universe.
And so, for me, I choose to dedicate my content to those ideals.

That we have an expectation.

And so, that leads me to the last one, which is probably my my Favorite and most used one that I use on on on anything and this may this may bother some of you and that's okay.
9:29
This is intense re universe is that this is a this is a worldview that I have.
So if you are if you are, you know, don't don't be trigger, you know, it's a don't take offense to this, but I'm telling you what is works for me.
And so I believe that the universe will continue to expand until eventually everything becomes a fine Mist over a long enough time Horizon.
9:52
The sun will give out all stars will extinguish and then everything will just become a fine mist and as silly as that may sound it means that anything that we do this video anything that I accomplished in this world will eventually disappear and be meaningless.
And so some people find that incredibly depressing.
10:11
I don't I find that to be incredibly meaningful because it means to me that I'm allowed to I am the only person that ascribes meaning to anything Because it means that nothing has inherent meaning.
And so, that means that when I have any stressors in my life, I'm saying that I'm choosing my brain is choosing to make meaning out of this, when there was no meaning to be made to begin with.
10:34
And so by doing that, I can play the notes of the piano of meaning that happened across the occurrences and circumstances in my life.
And so, when I think about it in this context, everything shrinks into a relevance.
And so, a lot of the concepts around, like I want to build a legacy.
10:49
I want.
I want to make an impact.
I want to leave a dent.
In the universe you're not you're probably not going to leave a dent in the universe and even if you made some big advancement within 500 years like it'll probably be forgotten and that would be like if you're the top point zero zero zero zero one percent right?
11:05
It's unlikely.
But it is 100% likely that over a long enough time Horizon everything will disappear right?
And by doing that for me, it decreases.
The pressure that I put on myself for having to I must I should I have to, like, I can't live without those.
11:22
Thoughts.
That strangle me, right?
There's other things that destroy my ability to make decisions because I come way more emotional as a result of them.
And so whenever I have any kind of negative occurrence or a stressors that come up in my life which are inevitable, I use this as my ultimate frame of reference, this is my ultimate trump card that I use to keep my my emotions at Bay and ultimately say I am the master of my own Universe.
11:50
I get to decide what has meaning.
And for me, I'll tell you what, what, what I have found most meaningful for me, is that my purpose in life to my knowledge at this point is to learn.
I love learning.
And so, that is, that is why I make these videos, because I feel like I'm able to better learn how to think, I'm better learns, how to run businesses?
12:13
I'm better, learn.
I can better learn all of the aspects of everything by teaching it, right?
And I'm sure if you ever ever did a book report when you were in high school, you learn the one chapter you had to do your book report.
Owner.
Give a presentation on way better than any of the other chapters because when you have to teach something you have to learn it better, you have to learn the nuances of what make something work.
12:30
And so, for me, even cataloging, these things has been useful for me because I think these are all the things that I do, huh?
But now I have a process that I can continue to use rather than use haphazardly just because I've just trained myself over time doing this.
And so I don't know where you're at in your business career, if you're, you know, yet seven figures ready figures or multi figures your multiple companies, whatever it is, right?
12:52
Right, this has been so personally impactful for me that it has helped me be in this for the Long Haul, because if nothing has meaning, except for what I choose to give, meaning that, it means I can choose to only play games that I find meaningful.
13:10
And by extension, I will not fall out of the game or quit because the thing that I'm doing is the thing that that I derive the most meaning from and so I will be able to outlast longer players in that purse.
And what happened is for me, my life becomes a glorification to an ideal that I create.
13:31
And so, for me, like, the content I will, I will do everything I can to continue to improve on this.
I'm bumping, coaches, I'm going through courses to try and make the lessons that I have more engaging more entertaining.
More educational have more stories woven into them, so that hopefully, I can transfer these things to someone else because that is what I find meaningful not because it is eternally any meaningful.
13:51
But just because that ideal lie to me, has meaning.
And so, that is something that I believe is eternal values are Eternal and values will exist, even when everything disappears in the universe.
And so, for me, I choose to dedicate my content to those ideals. lie to me, has meaning.
And so, that is something that I believe is eternal values are Eternal and values will exist, even when everything disappears in the universe.
And so, for me, I choose to dedicate my content to those ideals.








Company0:00
What's going on, everybody?
I'm bringing some more books, but I wanted to say that, if you haven't checked out Hunter million-dollar offers, I would definitely suggest that you start there.
I've gotten some solid feedback and it couldn't be happier with its.
Number one ranking on Amazon for direct marketing and over 5,000, five star reviews.
So, thank you guys so much for that.
0:15
It's 164 pages.
I really can help you out.
It takes about four hours to get through, check it out.
On Amazon, the Kindle book is 99 Cents.
The audiobook is Lowe's, they'll let me put it on for it, so I think it's 12 bucks.
So enjoy that and let's start the podcast.
Business owners.
0:31
I think we can.
All agree that one of the most important things that happens as we grow is that we learn Frameworks.
And that's why when you look back at what used to accomplish, you know, years ago, it seems like you could fix this problem so easily because you have Frameworks with which you've learned to think, welcome to the game where we talk about, how to get more customers, how to make more per customer and how to keep them longer and the many failures and lessons, we have learned along the way.
0:52
Hope you enjoy and subscribe.
Business owners.
I think we can.
All agree that one of the most important things that happens as we grow is that we learn Frameworks.
And that's why when you look back at what used to accomplish, you know, years ago, it seems like you could fix this problem so easily because you have Frameworks with which you've learned to think, right?
1:10
And so, it took me six years to build my first eight figure company six and a half to build my first eight and a half figure.
Sorry, multiple a figure company because that was the same company.
The next company that I did that was multiplied figures, was it took A year to build.
1:27
And the one after that took me six months and so we've gotten faster and faster and faster doing this.
And I've done over 120 million in sales across different Industries.
And one of the key Frameworks that I've developed or helps me think through things is something to share with you today.
All right, so there's kind of three levels.
1:45
Of employees or Talent, right?
And this really applies to you or your, your team itself because at the beginning, it's you, right?
And so depending on where you're at, you may, you may be at one of these levels or you may have to recognize it in others and I'm going to say in three different ways.
2:06
So I have a nice little 99 grid here.
The simplest way to think about this is in the beginning, you have to learn what to do.
All right, this, these are the skills, right?
And that's because what you are in the beginning, is an individual contributor.
2:21
All right, that means you actually have to get things done in order for them to, you know happen, right?
And so what you're doing at this point is you're doing right.
All of your time is spent doing the things right learning?
What to do.
Etc.
Now, the reason it's really important to be able to recognize where you're at is because then you'll be able to look through this framework and immediately see what you need to do next to the same degree.
2:44
You may have gone through this but not Recognize the shifts and you can look at an employee and say, I think they are in this book.
I think they're in this bucket.
I think they have the potential to get this bug etcetera.
Many times people will stick at one level because of their own beliefs that they have about themselves, which is why we know Layla and I believe that identity is very fluid if you want to be successful because you have to be able to change what you think about yourself in order to become the thing that's going to D bottleneck the business because ultimately it's costing every single human on earth, a billion.
3:15
Dollars a year, not knowing how to create a billion dollars a year in Revenue, right?
And that's how I always think about this.
It's like it is costing me so much money.
My ignorance is costing me so much money and so hopefully, with this video, I'll break down some of the other things that you won't be in your to.
So you can recognize them other people.
So, level one is understanding what to do, right, which means you're an individual contributor and what your time is spent, is doing all right, the second level here is, is understanding how, all right?
3:42
So you started to do it, right?
The what you figure this out Out.
But then you have to figure out the how you're actually doing it, right.
And the reason for that is because the next level You become a manager.
All right?
And that's making sure that other people can do that thing.
And they're consistently executing at a level that works, right?
4:00
And so here, what you're doing is you're teaching, right, you're teaching other people to do the thing, right?
And so at the beginning you're doing right?
As an individual contributor, you have to focus on what it is, right?
The next level you're doing, you're doing all the doing, you're like, you know, I feel like I understand this better, right?
4:17
Ian, feel like I understand the sequence of how this works, right?
And then you can can teach other people how to replicate that skill and the very end.
I'll show you how to apply this to departments in a second.
All right, so stay tuned for that.
But this is level one, right?
As you're looking at yourself or an employee, right?
4:34
Level 2 is 0.
I think this person could teach other people think they could manage them.
And as a quick caveat here like not every like managers don't necessarily need to know how to do something better than an individual contributor.
There's always going to be Niche, expertise etcetera, but they should understand how it works, right?
And so this is just Important like just Nuance to note there, right?
4:55
The third level is what I look at is the who write.
And I know, this may sound odd.
It's like what and then how then?
Who?
But it is kind of what it devolves to overtime.
All right, the title here is a leader, all right?
5:10
And these are very different than managers, which is something that I had to, I had to realize as I was scaling the business.
And, you know, usually at this level, this is where you're at.
You're, you know, three-ish million, dollar-a-year level, And this is what allows you to you know, crack crack open to the million plus per month.
5:27
Level, so 10, 10 million plus is you have to have leaders that are engaged, right?
And the thing that you're doing here is you're systematizing.
Alright, and so what I'm going to say this a different way to because I think it's worth noting is building the machine that builds the machine.
5:46
All right?
And the reason that's important is because First, you're doing it then, you're teaching it, and then you need something that can teach it for you.
That's kind of how this works, right?
So, it's always, it's, it's, it's not delegating it, it's systematizing.
6:02
So it's really us trying to be thoughtful about what order I was going to use there because it's like, is it delegating?
It is, it is, it is it handing off its systematizing it and there's a lot of different ways you can system, you know, build a machine that builds the machine.
But if you think through this in terms of your own Frameworks, the way, the reason that I like this is that you can actually grade yourself in terms of where you're at, You can grade yourself in terms of where a team members at and you can even grade departments, right?
6:27
Within your within your business, which depending on what your size is, your departments might just be, might be things that you were doing, right?
If there's, if you're a solopreneur for example, then like you were all the hats, your Finance, your HR, your legal, your, it, your marketing, or sales, your product, or fulfillment, your all of those things, right?
6:43
But as you grow, you know, in the beginning, you'll have your first core team is probably five people and they'll fulfill each one of those functions.
You have somebody who helps you with, you know, delivery, I'll have somebody who helps you with you know, Finance you just bookkeeping maybe somebody helps with marking.
Maybe that's you.
Somebody helps you with sales Etc, right?
6:58
And so what you can do is you can look at it apartment and say what level am I involved here, right?
Real quick.
I see if you can think about how you found this podcast.
Somebody probably tweeted it told you about it, should it on Instagram or something like that?
7:14
The only way this grows is through word of mouth and so I don't run ads, I don't do sponsorships, I don't sell anything.
I only ask is that you continue to pay it forward to whoever showed you or however you found out about this podcast that you do the exact same thing.
So if it was a review if it was a post, if you do that would mean the world to me and you throw some good karma out there for another entrepreneur.
7:34
And eventually the goal is that you can move right?
Move above, right?
Me equals, you know, CEO and so you have a team of leaders who are building the machine that builds the machine for you, so that the actual whole thing works without you are without you being there, besides providing the vision and strategic insight for making decisions, right?
7:55
And so for me, I Define this within a business where I'm no longer on the slack channel.
So in our portfolio companies, if I am Longer on the slack for that company, meaning no one can reach me besides, the one person who's in charge for that company.
That is what I believe is a truly delegated business acts as a portfolio where you are actually an owner.
8:17
Right?
I can't see the amount of times that's like, I talked about your burners and they're like, oh yeah I could totally take this new project on like my business is totally systematize and I'm like dude like no, it's not like your phones blowing up twice since we've been on like, what since we've been sitting here talking like like, yeah, I mean, just because you don't have to Onto something in the moment doesn't mean that you don't have to eventually respond to it or make a decision or etcetera, right?
8:41
Like those are things that are still levels of involvement that require Your Existence and presence.
And so for me, it's if I'm not in the slack Channel, I have one meeting a week with with the owner of the sorry owner.
The with one of our portfolio companies, the manager operator center of a portfolio company and between that time, the next time, the company can continue to grow without my direct involvement.
9:05
That is what I would say is checking all the boxes for me, and if something's not checking all the boxes, you can check all the boxes at a business level, but you can also just look at this as a department level.
And the reason I think is so important is that it can give you a grade that you can look at to improve.
So you might have, you know, marketing and you might have sales and then you might have, you know, product and then you might have, you know, shared services, which would be like it legal HR.
9:30
All that kind of stuff, right?
And you can look at yourself and think, okay?
Do I have Have in sales for example, drive people who get like am I the one doing the sales?
Okay, well maybe I'm not doing the sales.
Well, I'm the one who's teaching people how to sell.
Okay, we'll have.
I built a machine that teaches people how to sell so that I don't have to do the teaching of selling.
9:49
So I can actually just bring people in on a consistent basis and get them up to speed, right?
That's where you start looking at like hiring one, two, three sales people a month, right?
And then you put them through the machine that build sales people, right?
And so you can look at these levels within each of the Department's.
Oh, so maybe maybe that's what.
You're that's where your sales.
10:04
That right?
You've got a machine that builds the machine awesome but is your marketing their right?
Do you have a machine that builds the machine there or are you still doing?
Are you still teaching people, right?
And here's, here's one of the things that I think, for me, it took a long time to realize is that it's actually your strengths oftentimes, which become almost always the bottleneck in the business because the things that you don't know, you're far more comfortable giving away to people, so that they can build these things right?
10:34
Because they better Expertise because they know how to do teach Etc.
And that's where you as a CEO or entrepreneur is you actually have to walk them through these things.
So it's like, okay, great.
So, you know, you know, how to do some, whatever it is the the delivery of your of your product you toss want to do, that is a great now.
I need you to teach someone else how to do that.
10:51
So you can build a team of people who are doing that so we can scale, right?
And then finally, at a certain point, it's like man I'm spending all my time teaching.
It's okay, well, we need to build the machine that does the teaching for you.
And so, I think if you can think through this framework for each of the Department's, you have in your company, you'll figure out where your Looks are and it'll at least give you a grade.
11:07
And so every quarter you can look at your your business on a little little sheet like this and think okay do people know what to do we have the base skill okay do we have this sequence that how to do it right teaching people step-by-step how to do this process, right?
And hold them accountable and then finally can I find somebody who can help systematized and build the machine that builds a machine that recreates the skill over and over and over again, another people, right?
11:32
And so that's kind of the process and what's interesting if you listen to read Hoffman founder of LinkedIn, he talks about the difficulty for most employees, most people to jump these levels.
It's very difficult for most people, which is why I especially like rapid rapid growth companies.
11:50
They'll often have to, you know, change out.
I'll say leadership with quotes here.
Just anyone who's in charge, because in the beginning, there's probably more managers.
And over time, they need to be leaders.
And a lot of times the managers despite their tenure aren't actually leaders, right?
And so when I'm looking at Talent within our own business, I'm thinking okay, who's a good individual contributor and Sometimes good, sometimes, amazing leaders are terrible, individual contributors and sometimes a lot Oftentimes, get individual.
12:14
Contributors are terrible leaders, right?
And so it takes a very unique person which is why being offer so hard, is it you have to really master all of these levels so that you can recognize it and teach it to other people.
Because, ultimately, what we're doing is we have to walk the path that every person who's behind us must walk, which is why entrepreneurship is such a, such a growth-oriented, you know, occupation.
12:34
Like you have to grow yourself in order to attract people who have who are, who are at a certain level, right?
Like imagine if you were, if you, if you were to start working for somebody, Buddy and you feel like you know way more than them and that they're just have no idea what they're doing right then it's unlikely that you're going to be very influenced by that person.
12:50
Or that person is not going to inspire you to do anything on the flip side.
If you, if you were to start working for somebody and you aspire to be like them, you like their character traits, you love the way they operate in their personal life and how they do business Etc.
Then that is somebody that you were being led by, right?
And so for us as entrepreneurs, like a lot of times we have to think like how can I improve my character?
13:09
What are the traits of mine that are deficient so that I can Lee inspire people that I can bring people in at this higher level and then actually be able to execute because I can't tell you the amount of times I can't even like most entrepreneurs.
I talked about say, 95% of my team is amazing.
13:24
I love my team, they're awesome.
And at the same time they've all these horror stories about teammates and I can't say like amount of times I've talked to so many, they said, their team was awesome and I talked to anonymously to the oh no, that's him was an awesome.
This team is awesome, right?
I'm like dude your perspective which you make judgments is flawed and I don't believe anything you say because every time you've said this, it has been wrong.
13:42
So why would I believe Only now.
And so these are the levels that I think it for myself, my employees departments.
And then ultimately the business, this is just a different way of thinking through it.
Hopefully is valuable for you.
If you have these Frameworks, you can look at your own businesses, apply things faster, and break through the bottleneck.
13:58
So you have so you can get to where you wanna go.
Only now.
And so these are the levels that I think it for myself, my employees departments.
And then ultimately the business, this is just a different way of thinking through it.
Hopefully is valuable for you.
If you have these Frameworks, you can look at your own businesses, apply things faster, and break through the bottleneck.
So you have so you can get to where you wanna go.

0:17
What's up, everyone?
Welcome to the gym Secrets podcast.
I'm here with my wife Layla for Mosey.
Welcome Layla, hello.
And we're going to be talking about the difference between Innovation and copying which seemed relevant given our conversation at dinner after a glass of wine.
0:35
So I would Leila preface the conversation we had at dinner and then I will follow up with basically how we've always been able to stay ahead of the Curve.
So, basically, this topic came about because somebody asked me today when I was talking to them and they were interested in one of our programs.
0:54
And they were like, what, what makes you guys different?
I don't understand how you have all these testimonies and how you're able to hit these numbers and Etc.
And like I mean if you look at the fitness industry, it's like if anyone seen our stuff versus somebody else's there like either they're lying or they've got something that just not everybody knows about yet.
1:13
And so this kind of Like spit out of my mouth, and I didn't even realize and then afterwards, I was like, dang, that's good.
But what I said was I was like because Alex isn't just a coach like the rest of the people that you've worked with or that you've heard of he's an innovator and that's what he is first.
1:30
First and foremost, Alex is an innovator and he invents.
He's literally innovating the marketplace as we speak and he's taking his clients Along on that ride and on that journey.
And so they're the first ones in the marketplace with these things.
And when I said that, I was like Wow, that's it like that like you know anybody at their point in business it's like your unique selling point or whatever and that's what his is.
1:55
There's so many gurus out there in the fitness industry and it's right now, it's Beast a game of like who can copy who better and like when it comes to Alex, it's like there's no copying like it's all completely organic like.
2:11
I mean, I live with the man and he reads a book, learns a concept and then applies it to the fitness industry into a gym, and it's a completely new, you know, whatever Innovation project play, tactics strategy that nobody's ever done before.
2:26
And so, that's why people see the numbers that they see with our clients because it hasn't been done.
And so I kind of told him that story and then he Up with something like this.
What's up, everyone?
Okay, so we were, well, I guess the gosh, there's so many things, I mean, like right now it's what it's it's July like second, I think and like we just started running Instagram story ads and just like we're just always experimenting with stuff and like our Gym Legacy Group which is our top and group was like, dude, I just saw your first ads, like those are sick.
3:03
How do we get in on that?
And the thing is, I I like it sounds horrible to say this, but like I've seen every single piece of every program that I've ever ridden on another Jim's wall, being sold in some way or another.
I've seen my meal plans with another Jim's logo on them.
3:22
I've seen my contracts at another gym.
I've seen, I've seen literally the offers the ad copy like literally every single piece that you can imagine.
What was that?
Yeah, a little is recipe book.
We've seen literally every single piece.
Us of everything that we've ever made taken, and I used to get really, really offended by you to get super angry about it and really emotional about it.
3:43
But like, as time is going on, like what I realized and what I've seen with our clients is that the reason that we've been will say, the head of the market is that like it's really just that.
So we stay ahead of the market.
Like we like I'm I'm add AF and I can't I can't stop myself from reading books.
4:02
I can't stop myself from taking courses.
Like I spent like legitimately Been 100 Grand last week, going to a mastermind with Russell.
That was only for people who did like eight figures in above and like it's like I spend probably a quarter million a year plus on like courses and events seminars and courses and like our basic courses twice.
4:20
But you get the point and and it's just so that we can always know exactly what's working and a lot of times isn't other industry.
So I see you guys who are crushing it in like the real estate space and I'm like, what are they doing there?
And then we see what they're doing.
Like, haha, what if we could model that use that in this aspect?
4:36
Fitness and we do it and then we try it once it doesn't work, we'll try to get, it doesn't work.
You try the third time, I like boom and it blows up.
I'm like that's what it was.
And then like seven months later or a year later, like the rest of the coaches, adopt our quote system and then call it their three step blueprint to seven-figure Fitness business, whatever it is, right.
4:55
And so I mean, I used to get really frustrated about it.
But the reality is that, like all we have is the testimony is that we have and and like the just that.
Yeah, the culture of the people that we worked with and the reality is, this is that whenever you have change, you have the first adopters, you have the like the normal adopters and you have the late adopters, and the first adopters usually get like two thirds of the spoils.
5:19
And then the normal adopters get like, I want to say the last third and then the people who are late basically get nothing and they just spent all their money.
Trying to do something that people to two standard deviations of time ago, which in the marketplace that we live in now is like maybe a year like Max, the people who start something from the people who start adopting it, six months later from the people who have copied it to death and are trying to compete over a tiny, very small sliver of the marketplace.
5:46
Hey, if you're a return listener and you have not rated or reviewed the show, I want you to know that you should feel absolutely terrible about yourself and everything else in the world.
I'm kidding.
But it would mean the absolute world to me.
If you guys would go ahead and do that, you don't have to pause the show, you keep listening and you can just do it with your thumb right now will take you less than 60 seconds.
6:02
And like I said, the only way that podcast arose through word of mouth and this is you joining hands with me and helping as many isomers of possibly can because no one is coming to save us, it's just us.
All right, so please go do that now.
Then let's get back to the show.
And then sit and like we enjoy, like, I love this stuff.
6:22
Like I enjoy the crap out of it and I think it's a lot of fun, which is why, which is why we stay ahead.
It's not like I'm some Superstar.
It's just like I think it's fun.
Like I read a lot.
I always read a lot and just applying it to an industry that I know really well.
I mean like I had six gems.
Like I know how this stuff works and I know how to make it work with a fifteen dollar an hour employee and and and that's and that's really the name of the game with it.

So if you're if you're Ramona.
If you're a fitness, facility owner, like you have to read, you have to stay ahead because if you don't stay abreast on the issues you don't stay on Snapchat and Instagram and YouTube and like you don't see like Instagram stories come out and like realize that there's a whole bunch of attention that's just being like very, very, very undervalued.
7:06
Like right now, we're getting like Instagram story applications for like nothing like just literally just cents on the dollar and it's because we're always first-movers, like most people like, you know, messenger Bots like all that stuff.
Like we were always the first one to the market because like we see in Rio.
Boom, we have people's eyeballs, we can find a way to exploit that and like we try once and doesn't work.
7:25
We tried again, doesn't work and try to third time or like huh, that one worked and so like a lot of people just give up too early.
They try once, they don't even have a fully formulated in August, that doesn't work.
God doesn't work for our industry.
Everything works for every industry, this from Green, from Dean graciosa, he said Airplanes always fly.
7:44
You just have to figure out what do you say?
What was the exact quote?
He said hmm marketing always works like planes always fly right?
Which is like once you get the equation, right?
They will fly.
And so it's like a lot of people like TV doesn't work.
8:00
A radio doesn't work or direct mail doesn't work or Facebook doesn't work.
Instagram doesn't work like like like there's so many different traffic platforms and ultimately at the same like, no matter what it is, it's a human being with eyeballs on the other side of it and you have a small sliver of their attention that you're trying to grasp.
8:19
And so, as long as you understand that concept, all you have to do is make very small tweaks.
The offer very small speech to the formatting and all Of a sudden, you have a winner and that's how you can conquer your Marketplace.
That's how you can conquer multiple traffic sources.
And that's how we hit the numbers that we do.
8:34
Like there's a reason that every time that we work with goes into the marketplace and conquers it, dominates the marketplace, within a 30-day period, they're completely completely like devastating their composition there at full capacity.
Like there's a reason for that is because they understand the concept of traffic and attention.
8:50
So I think that was the main, the main story that we had from dinner, Layla's nodding her head up and down.
So, I'm guessing that that she's good with that, too.
So, anyways, this is the gym Secrets podcast.
I hope you found this valuable.
If you are thinking about, Starting a gym or getting your gym to the next level.
9:10
Hit us up go to gym, secrets are Jim Lunch, secrets.com forward slash quiz and you'll be able to get a case study of actually four different case, studies of Jim's that we've taken from zero to full capacity, within 30 days.
And we look forward to talking to you guys soon.
9:29
I hope you have an amazing evening. / morning, / mid-afternoon, /, workout /drive, whatever it is that you're listening to right now and we will catch you.
You on the flip side, juicier.0:00
Real quick.
Because you guys already know that, I don't run any ads on this and I don't sell anything.
And so, the only ask that I can ever have you guys that you help me spread the word so we can have more entrepreneurs, make more money, feed their families, make better products, and have better experiences for their employees and customers.
And the only way we do that is if you can rate and review and share this podcast, so the single thing that I have to do is you can just leave review will take you 10 seconds or one type of the thumb, mean, the absolute world to me.
0:25
And more importantly, it may change the world of someone else.
What's going on, everyone?
One day I wanted to go over something that comes up all the time on our calls and I wanted to give you some value bombs.
So how elegantly respond to how much is your program, right?
0:42
So you got a leader you got to qualify customer or some kind of referral that's that's interested.
They've raised their hand but you get on the phone with them talking a little bit.
They're like, okay.
Okay, okay.
So how much, how much is the program, right?
And so, how do you elegantly respond?
To this question, right?
0:57
It's a good.
It's a good question.
And how do you do it without it sounding like wall?
I can't tell you the price over the phone because then it just sounds really.
Just doesn't sound as sexy as it probably could sound.
So how do you answer this?
So this guy is looking in ground noise.
1:14
Villain in the phone.
Seems a little bit aggressive, but he says, how much the program first thing you do is get agree with me.
Say that that's a great question.
I'm glad you asked, right?
I might have to add that to it.
I'm glad you asked.
No, they feel like they didn't catch you off guard.
1:32
They're like, oh, they're glad.
I asked, right, little things, right?
And then you say, honestly, I can't say bison because we haven't gone, giving you a needs assessment yet or I haven't, we actually haven't seen you in person yet.
Another way of saying it it'd be kind of like asking a mechanic for a quote on your car.
Before you've taken in the shower, we just don't know until we see it, right?
1:51
It's a great way to smoothly overcome that question, and gives them an epiphany bridge for so they understand it.
And so most people are like, oh, it's like a mechanic shop.
So I Don't know until I go in and most people are like, they get that.
So that'll that'll that'll deal with the question e 5% time.
2:09
The other way.
And the say this is an especially Annoying customer.
They're like, what can you give me a Range?
Now most of the times these people are going to suck anyways.
But you know, like you can honestly I can't I just don't know, it'd be unfair to you to give you a price, you know, in fact if you've ever if you ever do call Fitness Center and they give you a price on the phone run the other way because it means that they haven't got any idea what you're trying to do.
2:33
We're trying to go where you're at and they're just giving you an arbitrary number, so, it's unfair to you and like, we just don't do it that way.
We have to see where, you know, we have to have you come in, we have to see where you're at, where you're trying to go.
And then we can We can give you exactly what you need.
Right, so it's a really elegant way to overcome this works super, super well and then obviously you.
2:53
Hey, we're here till 8:00 tonight.
What time works best for you.
Stop by off at 6:00, so I can be there at 6:30.
Awesome.
See how he's nice and happy now.
Big smile.
And then you're like great.
Give us all your money.
It's like, sure thing.
Can I watch you right now?
Get it doesn't say that, but just use this little Epiphany Bridge Works, awesome, and will help you get you get people in the door without them being offended.
3:15
And what if I've noticed if you're if you're feeling Advanced today, what we did we're here is we actually aligned ourselves ethically with not telling them with the prices.
So when you say, if you ever do call a fitness facility and they tell you, the pressure of her run over the running the other way, so it's like not only should like, are we not going to pay the price but you should never get the price over the phone from anyone.
3:39
And now we're like in the ethical like, ethical good area and they're asking us to do something, that's ethically wrong, see?
It's like really A slight but it's really really significant in terms of the perception of the customer for you.
So now they're like wow they're actually trying to take care of me by not telling the price of the phone.
4:00
Yeah, Furlow so use that it works.
Awesome and look some more songs.









0:00
Real quick.
Because you guys already know that, I don't run any ads on this and I don't sell anything.
And so, the only ask that I can ever have you guys that you help me spread the word so we can have more entrepreneurs, make more money, feed their families, make better products, and have better experiences for their employees and customers.
And the only way we do that is if you can rate and review and share this podcast, so the single thing that I have to do is you can just leave review will take you 10 seconds or one type of the thumb, mean, the absolute world to me and more importantly, it may change the world of someone else and hopefully in this presentation, I will I will put some of those fears to rest of like what if I'm not, what if I never make it would have never turn this corner and become the salesperson I want.
0:35
If I never hit the 100 hundred grand a year, what if I never hit the hundred grand a month or whatever, I don't hit the million, a month goal that I have and then what does that mean?
Does that mean about me right?
If you've ever thought those things?
Like I can tell you, I did too welcome to the game where we talk about how to get more customers, how to make more per customer and how to keep them longer and the many failures and lessons, we have learned along the way.
0:54
Hope you enjoy and subscribe.
My wife and I own three companies.
We own Jim watch, which is done, I think 60 or 70 million in sales and last three years we own Prestige Labs which is done 30, 30, 30, or 35 million in sales in that period of time.
1:12
And we own Allen which is a software company that we started accidentally.
And within the first six months, I went from zero to one point seven million a month and the process, there's obviously a lot more to it than sales on its Own.
1:30
But sales is obviously a component of that and I think one of the advantages that we've had, are you guys familiar with hi Rose?
Anyone here, like, hi Rose, the ad tracking platform either way, Alex, Becker, who's the?
Who's the founder of that?
Clued, me in recently to something, he's like, dude, your row is is insane because you can see everyone's revenue and their husband.
1:51
And I was like, what do you mean?
He's like, you have the highest return on adspend of everyone in the entire platform by like a mile.
And I didn't really ever think about it but our lifetime return on Advertising is 36 to 1.
So to do over, you know, 100 and now if you know 5 or 10 million whatever right now we've spent just under three million dollars in advertising and so there's a lot of other pieces to you know making more but just for everyone on this call.
2:21
We're talking specifically about sales correct.
Yeah, these guys are closers and there are getting closing positions.
A couple people are sort of like a closer agency when they partner with the not like you.
And they're like, hey let's do like Little J.
2:38
Big deal.
I slam your deals.
Okay, sweet.
Well then why don't I?
So what I'm going to do is because I do have a presentation which is just how I think about sales and I have the third part of the presentation about scaling sales teams, does anyone here have multiple closures?
2:53
You work for Them, or is most people just closing on your own right now?
You guys got to talk with Alex, you don't buy it, you can't see.
I can't see the chat, I can't see the chat.
We're working towards that Alex.
3:09
Okay, so how about this?
I'll give you the things that.
So we're also when I first met him was like dude how did you learn how to sell so?
Well and it was because I looked at my CRM and I done four thousand sales one-on-one in Fitness.
And so That's a lot of reps.
3:27
You know, I was taking 20 consults a day for like four years and so that's in person face-to-face.
My team would double a triple book me every 30 minutes and I just sold the same thing over and over again.
And because I was really good at sales.
I ended up not hiring a ton of sales people and I would actually have my manager set appointments for me all at one location.
3:45
So I had six gyms.
And so I would go there they'd stack up an entire day.
I mow down a whole day, go to a different gym and they've been stacking all the appointments and I'd mow down.
And so, usually I do 22. 85, consults a day and you just get, you know, you just get these reps in of reading people, gauging, tonality and seeing where you need to lean in and where you need to lean back.
4:04
And so, you know, over time and then started training salespeople and sales.
Managers, I had a remote sales team.
We fly we'd fly out and do turnarounds like in person.
So I date guys, we'd fly out to a facilities every month and we turn these facilities around because I know Mike you're in the Fitness World before this and then I brought that sales team in house and they started doing phone sales for high ticket.
4:25
So, I've had, I've had in person phone, High ticket, low ticket, we've kind of done a lot of those things.
I trained mortgage leads teams.
So, kind of the whole Gambit and there's definitely some things that I've seen, you know, I brought every sales product on the market about Grant stuff but Beaufort stuff and I think there's a lot of Merit in, there's a lot of good stuff out there, but in my experience, Simplicity is what scales.
4:48
And so I'll give you, if you're okay with it, I'll give you the few things that I have implemented consistently within my company.
Knees, that have generated outsized returns.
Is that cool?
All right, I'll give you the full story.
All right.
Is that cool with everybody?
I'll give you the full before the full Jam.
5:04
It's all right, full Jam.
So as I said Simplicity, right, I'm the world's best graphic designer as you can see here.
So I'm trying to show the real keys to the kingdom.
5:21
So, everybody, here is already here.
So many expensive stuff, is that most This call.
Yes.
Everything's high-tech.
Alex fan, tastic.
All right.
Everyone still see me and the screen.
Yep.
All right, Rock and Roll.
All right, so I'm guessing this guy's in your first rodeo, not your first presentation sexy headliner, big promise.
5:42
And so if you have failed for you guys to grow your thing, that pass a promise you, it's not your fault.
Lots of information, very confusing and you can sometimes be inundated with lots of different.
Salespeople information.
You've got Mike here who's a He's a gem and knows his shit.
And you guys are lucky to have him, but in the hopefully this presentation, I will put some of those fears to rest of like, what if I'm not, what if I never make it, whatever turn this corner and become the salesperson I want.
6:06
What I've never hit the 100 hundred grand a year.
What have I never hit the hundred grand a month or whatever.
They'll hit the million a month goal that I have and then what does that mean?
Does that mean about me right?
If you've ever thought those things?
Like I can tell you I did too right after the instance that I had Mike would that individual and individual drained my entire bank account and then sent it to their girlfriends.
6:25
Didn't and then filed bankruptcy after that happened.
I had twelve hundred dollars because I had sold all my gyms and put my money into that account.
So I started at zero which I'm very grateful for because it gave me the experience that I have now.
And so what I'm going to show you is that you can have a simple sales process that can yield outsides returns.
6:42
A lot of people like to make this fancy because it makes it easier to sell stuff to people about selling.
But these are the things that I have seen that of unlock the growth for us, because I don't think I'm the best marketer out there.
I think we've simply attach the phone to a funnel Oh, and we've been very efficient at it.
6:57
And so as a result of that, I've always been able to make more per customer that anyone else because of how efficient we are at the conversion process, all right?
And so, that's what we're here for.
So, I want to show you exactly step-by-step our process for selling.
All right?
And so there should be two types of people here.
Some of you guys who are under a hundred thousand dollars a month, and I'll show you how to never compete on price again, right?
7:17
And if you guys are over a hundred thousand dollars a month, I'll show you exactly what we did a skill, a team to get to a million a month and beyond that cool.
Because if you're under 100, it's just you right?
You're over 100, you need people.
All right, so it's going to kind of be like the actual selling itself and then the scaling of the sales, all right?
7:32
So that's kind of the goal for the 60 minutes.
I'll probably be able to get it done in 40.
Yes, I'll talk fast so we can have some time.
All right, everyone just listen fast, then, all right.
All right.
Yeah, I'm really fortunate.
Yeah.
Now we're at 105 or 110 or whatever it is in selling stuff, which has been cool.
7:50
What's been coolers?
We've been able to donate to causes you guys.
Don't know my story, but I had a gym teacher after school, who stayed with me?
He didn't have to didn't know me from anybody and he worked out with me for an entire year and taught me how to work out because I was like really insecure kid.
And as a result of that, I got into fitness.
8:07
And so I feel like it's all of our opportunity because a lot of you guys are on here, like we're already in the top 1% in the world.
You know what I mean?
Like, we're bitching about not making 100 Grand a month, like, fuck you, you know what I mean, really?
And so, it's been a great privilege to be able to give back and we've donated 1.4 million just in the last three years, actually 1.7.
8:25
It's update that but anyways, just to causes that we that we care about and so for us it's it's kids being able to have the opportunity that we had, all right?
And you guys are in the fitness industry Arnold was my heroes.
The reason I quit my job and I've been able to, you know, grow friendship with him which has been awesome.
And we've had over 1,000 clients had a hundred thousand dollars a year.
8:43
Using the sales framework, I'm going to show you.
All right.
So like you can imagine that these people are not maybe as good as you are.
You can imagine that somebody in that thousand is probably not as naturally talented, right?
So the Process works.
Okay, and we've got a lot of people over seven figures now but it wasn't that way, right?
9:00
So this is me when I started my first gym, I slept on the floor, I'd five thousand dollars total, my rent was $5000 and so I had one month that I had to learn how to make money and I built a funnel because I learn this from the internet and I was actually I sent this picture to my dad because I was so excited.
9:16
I was so proud of this picture because I sold that many people in the first in the first two weeks for free and things started to grow right eye.
That was my one of my Jam's.
I had nine employees.
I felt like a badass.
You know, my dad finally told me thought I'd, you know, wasn't a schmuck for, you know, being an idiot and getting into fitness.
9:34
I thought I felt like I was figuring things out and all of a sudden Facebook slap happened.
This is years ago.
There's been many slaps face which is kind of how it has its bitch.
Hand proverbially swinging back and forth but you know, we got slapped and overnight, my lead costs went up 5 x right and so my money, my money making rain, turn into desert.
9:51
And thing was my marketing was losing money every day.
And all I could think about about was letting my dad down more realistically, having my dad be right?
I'm gonna, I'm gonna all right, cool.
And so, the question I asked myself was like, how can I for get more leads, right?
And so I call them my friends up and he had he was a brick-and-mortar gym owner and he told me that things are going great for him.
10:11
And I was like, what the hell, dude?
What do you want?
What are you doing?
He's like, dude, we just we just attach the phone to the funnel and I was like, no shit.
He's like we're selling expensive stuff on the front end now instead of sewing trials, I was like.
Well, that's cool.
I'll do that.
And so we went from losing two and a half to two, one.
Two.
Intend to one return on the front end, right?
10:27
What that meant for?
My business is I went from being able to break even at $10 a lead to be able to spend up 100 $100 lead and still make money which is crazy, right?
And so then things started to grow again for me.
And then we you know open location after location and things grow.
And I met this guy and I was I was I met I joined as Mastermind.
10:45
I was trying to, I told him I wanted to create a nationwide jim-jim chain and he said, you should teach other people how you do what you do, and not grow that chain.
And I was like, well you make more money than me.
So, okay, I'll listen.
So and so, then I started making are doing our Marketing System, Mike?
This is, by the way, at that.
Guy's Jim 191 signups in 19 days and that was the stack of contracts.
11:05
Some of you guys may have seen this.
It was like the most run ad for like a year and a half but we did a hundred thousand dollars in 19 days and sales like in the ghetto and like our counter start filling up which is pretty cool.
It's repeated this process to generate 100 to 1 return on ad spend at the time which was while still being three As expensive as our closest competitor, right?
11:27
And right now we've got a 36 to 1 return Lifetime.
And so the sales firm is going to show you is has kind of built those things and kind of in the Consolidated distilled version of that.
All right?
And so it's on the niches.
So we've used this framework and each of these niches physical therapist, dentist, real estate's Home Services, floating centers and obviously anyone selling education or coaching like we do, right?
11:51
And you might be like, that's, that's cool for those guys.
But what about me?
And so that's what we're going to hit.
Right.
So these are the three Frameworks so I sped through that because we already covered a little bit of my story early so I want to get through it.
And these are the free from worries that I kind of discovered to skill High, take it.
All right.
And it'll take, if you're if you're partnering some with someone, then it'll help take their losing funnels and turn them into cash machines and I mean that genuinely all right.
12:13
So the freeform works that I do is what is the closure framework are.
These are the questions that get prospects to say.
Yes.
All right, so adding this to any kind of any funnel process is going to instantly make it more profitable, all right, I'm going to walk.
Walk through the questions that we ask and specifically what, only three things that you can say, on a sales call period.
12:30
It's the number one mistake.
That all the sales guys, that even my guys make and I have to remind them up.
All right, the second thing is the conviction framework.
So anyone who believes can outperform a seasoned sales rep.
I simply went to control their tone.
Alright, so some of you guys right now.
Can I get a hand?
I'm going to ensure my Skrill quick can I get hands on the screen of who here is newer to this.
12:49
You're too high ticket sales?
Okay.
Great.
Perfect.
Then this is for you.
I'm going to show you how you can beat the best sales reps.
Alright.
And this is how I never ever hire, seasoned closers.
Just FYI.
No, no, it's not, like, we're going to train the train exhaust people's?
I don't know, but I'm going to show you how you can beat season crack seasoned Pros.
13:09
All right, which if I can find my presentation, there we go.
By learning control your tone and the last one is scaling.
So, for all you guys, Are over a hundred thousand dollars a month and need to scale a team.
I'm going to show you how to duplicate the skill and other people.
All right, because it's one level of the skill is learning to sell.
13:26
Another level of the skill is teaching to sell, and it's a more valuable skill.
So if you can duplicate your skill and someone else, that is how you can make 10 times 100 times more money because it's no longer, you're no longer constrained by your time.
All right, so let's rock and roll close your framework.
13:43
So after poring over like hundreds of scripts like I mean it hundreds of scripts are real.
Said there was always like these minor differences in wording, but I've hit these kind of main Milestones along the way.
I ended up closing the sale, right?
And the nice thing is that this process works for b2c and B2B.
13:59
So I don't know what stuff you're selling, but it works for both and it work for $500 tickets as much as hundred thousand dollars.
Think it's the process is the same.
All right, and the way I teach my sales teams and now if thousands of clients is This Acronym and then like, even when I'm thinking through sales calls, we use were like closer.
14:15
See, right, l.
So, the sea is clarify, why the person is On the phone with you, right?
That's the objective.
Why are you here?
Why did you take the time to take the call?
What's the problem, right?
What are we trying to solve here after that?
There were like, got it.
So, what I'm hearing is you're struggling with this, does that sound about, right?
14:33
I'm going to label you with a problem after that.
We overview their past paint.
So it's like, okay.
So you have this problem.
I can't be the first person to talk to about this.
Tell me a little bit about what you've done so far to try and try and get past this right?
Tell me more about that.
How'd that work out for you?
Okay.
Understood after that.
14:49
It's like, okay, so I'm here in all these things.
This is why you hear this.
We can try to get this is Trident has it worked.
Okay.
What can I tell you about?
How?
I think we might be able to solve your problem.
This is where we saw the vacation, right?
And then finally step before finally, we explain away their concerns.
So this is where we tell about the program and they were like, do you want to do it?
15:08
They say yes or no.
If they say no, then we explain away their concerns that they say.
Yes.
And then, once they say yes, we reinforce the decision.
And this last are here is a point that I added years later, because we realize that the sale The sale just continues throughout the entire customer relationship, right?
15:26
And so for you guys, if you're dealing with clients who you're selling for, you have to also sell them on continuously selling, right.
You might have closed the car door, closed the first payment but their onboarding experience they got a close them again and then after that when they have their first week check and call, they got to get closed again because we have to consistently sell them on, why they should do anything.
15:45
Why should they not just watch Netflix?
Why should they, why should they take action?
Why should they have the discomfort of getting you know smacked on the phone by a stranger, right?
Why should they why should they feel the sting of failure?
We have to sell them, consistently to help them overcome their pains, right?
It's all show you some of these more closely.
16:01
So clarifying, whether they're right, it's like what made you come in today, what made you reach out?
What's your goal right now?
Why is that important to you, right?
Okay, helping me understand, what would you what are we doing here, right?
This is one where someone in the beginning like you have to hit this because if someone says like I just wanted to find out more information.
16:17
You're like cool.
But why like what did you want the information to solve?
What was the like?
I'm sure you do.
Go around collecting information on that, right?
Like, there's something you're trying to get out of this, what's the problem and then they and then you get what you need.
You're like, got it.
Okay, so just so I'm hearing you right.
16:32
It sounds like this is your goal correct.
Then they acknowledge, they have a problem.
This is important because they have to say it.
They have to own it.
I can't cure cancer until you admit that you have it, right?
We got to give it to you before.
We can carry after that, we overview the past, right?
So it's like, what have you tried so far to accomplish this?
16:48
How long did you do it?
For how long ago?
How did that work for you?
What else have you tried?
We call this the pain cycle, right?
We consistently do this over and over again until we've exhausted all options, right?
At that point we have tons of animal that we can use later in the closed system.
Sure you're aware of right.
And the big piece here is we explain how it's not their fault because if they had this missing piece or two of the equation, they were halfway there.
17:10
There were three quarters of the way there.
They were just missing this one piece which we're going to provide for them.
Right?
And the nice thing is it's for most of you hopefully you're selling a holistic solution, right?
So for example I'm going to use a fitness example because Mike's from Background to if someone came in and said they had workouts in the past and be like, I'm not telling you, don't they, you need to work out.
17:28
It's great.
But you also need the nutrition, the accountability, right?
You need nutrition.
Make sure they stop eating shit, cause you just start working out eating, doughnuts is not going to work, right?
Of course.
Now if I make you the best plan in the world, but you don't follow.
It's not going to work either.
That's why you need the accountability.
That's what I'm here for, right?
So, we're explaining and if someone came in and said, hey, I did Jenny Jenny Craig.
17:43
I did Weight Watchers, and I lost the weight and gained it back, we're like, yeah, because you didn't have the you'd have the muscle, right?
Got to have the muscle so you can keep the weight off, right?
So everyone comes in with partial Solutions and we try and fill in the puzzles.
That's why understanding your products important because you're really becoming a problem solver for them, but consultant There we go.
18:02
And so from that point, that's kind of how you can naturally transition.
So it's like I'm hearing these things.
This is what you're missing, will do any how the program works, because I think we might be able to solve that for you, they'll say yes.
All right.
So what we've seen is that there's three things that make clients successful, right?
And at this point, this is my belief, is that three things has been you know, unequivocal in most pitches is that I think it's human brain is that you can't take more than three but typically it's like three pillars to the to the stool or three, you know, finish your should accountability.
18:29
If I was selling I want them to be, you know, timely, you know qualified and you know, exclusive right.
It'll be three elements to make with what makes a good lead, right?
There's there's always three that you can usually find when you're selling a solution and most times not most times every time.
18:48
If you're on the phone at the prospect, you always have the upper hand because they have admitted at the beginning of this phone call that they have a problem, they have not solved it and so inherently they're going to be missing one of the keys.
They cannot have them all or they would not be on the phone.
So you have a you you you weren't in an unlosable situation unless you choose to lose it, right?
19:06
Unless you choose to lose the frame.
And so, in this instance, it has been my experience that we use stories, short anecdotal stories to break the belief of the prospect around a topic.
What's important here is that we don't get into jargon, right, we don't get into technobabble and talking about the program and the modules and the the things they're going to do because all of that, Sounds like work, and that's not what they're there for there for result, right?
19:36
And so instead I would say something like, with the finishers accountability, like I said earlier.
So if I was trying to explain accountability be like, listen, you don't have accountability when you were a kid you ever like have your parents tell you to brush your teeth.
They were like, yeah.
Like, you know, you're like, I don't want to, I don't want to, and they would tell you, I know you gotta go brush your teeth and you can eat.
19:52
Go you brush your teeth.
You talk back to that next night.
You did same thing, they say brush to you go.
First you go back to bed, but you're an adult now, right?
You brush your teeth.
Teeth.
They're like yeah.
And that's because you had external accountability that turned into an internal habit, right?
And that's what we're going to do for you here, right?
20:08
So I didn't tell them about fucking the coaching call that they're going to have in the post that they're going to have in the blah blah blah.
We told them.
As the result of that would give them an anecdotal story that made sense to them.
Right.
The more things you explain about the tactics of the program, the more details are gonna be able to use to pull the strings of an argument right or find details that they don't like.
20:27
Well I don't like Zoom.
Can you guys just call me, right?
Then, all of a sudden you get into these situations.
You're like, no, no.
Like, this is an important.
That's not the point of the point is that you suck at sales and let's figure this out, right?
Like, or whatever it is, right?
That's the point here.
And so, that is for, that's probably a really key point.
20:44
I want to drive home ears up.
When you have your pitch part, it shouldn't be longer than three minutes like tops because no one really gives a shit.
And at the end of the day, the reason they're going to buy is going to be because of how understood they feel.
So how much when you went through that overview of the pain you were able to restate back to them accurately.
21:05
Exactly how they felt and the struggles they are experiencing which is why you need to shut the fuck up when they're talking right.
You guys love that you're listening to the podcast.
If you ever want to have the video version of this which usually has more effects, more visuals, more graphs, you know, drawn out stuff.
21:24
Sometimes it can help hit the brain centers in different ways.
You can check out my YouTube channel Channel.
It's absolutely free.
So check that out if that's what you are into.
And if not keep enjoying the show, It's so there's only three things that are ever set on a sales call.
Do you guys know what they are?
21:40
There's only three things that ever come out of your mouth.
Questions, restatements and anecdotal stories, which is the story that I just referenced.
The three stories that we usually use to break a belief.
That's it.
Notice I didn't talk about the program at all.
So I'm asking questions the whole time.
21:59
They say stuff, I restate what they said back to them, they love you because people pay other human beings hundreds of dollars an hour to listen.
Therapist get paid hundreds of dollars an hour to Simply shut the fuck up.
And sit there.
22:15
Be like huh?
Tell me more about that.
Interesting how they make you feel?
Huh, that must have been really hard for you.
Interesting restatement and clarifications questions, right?
And then when it comes time to break the belief, you say, well, what if we thought about it, like this anecdotal story that you have practice and, you know, cold because those are the only things that you need to memorize two things.
22:40
One is the three stories that you're going to tell.
They're going to break the three, most common beliefs that are that are going to be presented by the prospect.
All right, so typically it can be one is just a vehicle for how it works and then the other two are going to be the top two obstacles that they are usually going to bring up.
22:57
And you should know that what they are when you normally sell it, right?
The gym is going to be is not going to work on my market and I don't know how, you know, Facebook ads and Technology works are, those are the big things, right?
If you're selling Whatever the fuck it's going to be around the same thing for any local business, right?
This is making sense for everybody.
Is this cool just wait.
23:12
Okay.
Okay, absolutely.
Oh, yeah, sweet.
All right.
So this so that's how you solve in the vacations.
You have these little sound bites right?
23:28
I'll give you another example.
So if I was doing was doing food, right?
I'm like listen three parts.
The program finisher How about a so nutrition-wise?
You've got to eat stuff that's going to make you lose weight.
Can we agree on that?
Yes.
Okay cool.
23:44
But the problem is you don't want to do that, right?
That's what we're here, right?
Right.
Okay.
So let me ask you a question.
When do you feel like what's your favorite TV show?
They're going to be like Whatever Game of Thrones, you're like, okay, Game of Thrones, do you feel like you need to get like motivated to watch Game of Thrones?
24:02
Like, man, I was trying to watch it tonight but I just couldn't, you know?
I just, I just I got really busy and I just couldn't sit down on the couch and turn the TV on.
I couldn't do it, right?
Of course not because you look forward to it because you wanted to do it in the key that we're going to do here is we're going to get you to look forward to the foods that you're eating if you look forward.
24:17
So you don't need to be motivated because you do it on your own because you like it.
So make sense, right?
So what I didn't talk about the macros, And the carb cycling and the intermittent fasting and the calorie counting and the blah blah, blah blah.
Because the end of the day that does not matter what they want is for them to solve the problem and have it be pain-free, right?
24:39
And that's where explain to them.
So that's selling the vacation, right?
And this is saying that I've used for a long time, which is syllabication, not the plane fright, right?
So, this is what everyone else talks about.
Their like, sir for us to get you, these results, you're gonna have to take your pants off.
You're gonna have to jump through this Loop.
You're gonna have to go through the TSA, the airport line is pack your suitcases.
24:55
Take your shoes off.
Do the layovers Ha flights have a person farting.
Next, you don't worry.
They don't have covid.
You'll have turbines probably on the plane.
Then as soon as you're out, you think you're done.
You still have to wait at baggage claim.
They probably lost your bag, right?
And in our world, it's your modules, your meal plan, your backers, your workout, your support team, your URLs, your domains, your funnels, you're targeting your ads and the other shit that doesn't matter, right?
25:15
But instead that they want you some Maui Final Destination.
You always tell the same thing because the difference is only the level of service that how they want to get their right if you have multiple levels of service.
So they want Swim to Maui to where they're trying to go there sharks and you can drown or get robbed, right?
25:31
Like this chick crazy, didn't take a boat to Maui, it'll take a little longer but there's no shark attacks but there's still no Wi-Fi and your kind of you know the sun, do you wanna take a normal flight to Maui, get there, a little faster, still smells bad as security bad food but you're going to get there or doing, take a private jet to Maui, right?
25:47
Direct non-stop shipping the plane suitcases packed.
When you arrive, right?
Everyone gets to Maui, though.
The variables are simply the speed in the quite a journey, the likelihood of Rival is assumed since it's a sale, you're not going to sell something, that's not going to get them to solve the problem.
All right.
It's just a question of how we're going to solve it, thus the problem will be solved regardless, all right?
26:08
And so we're always saying the same thing.
Cool.
And so, that's the selling piece, she is explaining, why, their concerns and so these are the questions that sound like.
So there's, I'm sure Mike has already taught you a lot of the the obstacle overcome Concepts, right?
26:25
So, Ali.
There's there's three big ones, right?
Price.
And rather than teach you like, the drilling of the obstacles.
I told you, there's two things you need to memorize.
One of them are the stories, the second, or the obstacle overcomes, all right?
Because those are the things that you're in the Red Zone.
Like, that's not where you start thinking about, what you're going to say, alright?
26:43
So the two things that you need to memorize, the salesperson are the stories about what you sell.
And the obstacles that you're going to encounter when you're in the Red Zone, the questions on the front end, you need to know the Milestones.
You need to hit in order to move forward and this is one of the big mistakes.
26:58
I'm sure Mike talks about a lot which is you need to sit in the pain.
If someone does not clarify why they need a solution, you do not ask for the sale.
Closers don't ask questions.
They don't already know the answers to Lawyers, don't ask questions in court, they don't know the answers to don't ask for a sale.
27:17
Unless you know, they're going to say yes, you stay on the phone and if you feel like you're going to run out of time, then you booked another call, but there's no point in jumping, the gun when you know they're going to say no, because you have five minutes left on the clock, right?
Then make sense everybody.
Yeah, big, it's a big mess up.
27:34
I see all the time is like, you have and this is why being efficient with your words and being targeted in your questions and checking the boxes.
So you can move along the sale is Don't so that you do have time to go to those things.
But while we're in the conversation like we have to be tunnel vision and making sure that we get our, we get our party favor at each checkpoint, right?
27:55
If they're, if we just say, hey, you know what brought you here today?
I was just want to find out more information.
Okay, cool.
So you know let me tell you about the program like that's not.
We didn't get the fuck it.
Like we don't know why they're there.
We don't know what their goals are.
Like one of the things drives me nuts about my team sometimes I'm like, dude were a menace in the conversation was like I don't know how many clients they have.
28:13
I don't know what the revenue is.
I don't know what the profit is.
I don't know what their biggest pain and struggle was right now.
Mike, what are you doing?
I'm like, you just told them they're like Jim wants a honeymoon dollar company.
Like they don't give a shit but they do my sales guys because they get their you guys popped up, right?
But has nothing to do with the prospect.
28:29
They do not care, right?
They only care about them.
So If someone comes back at you and says, you know what, it sounds great but it's too expensive.
All I can tell you is that you did a poor job of explaining the value and value in.
A prospects mind is how well articulated their problem was back to them because if you can name, if I were to psychically, tell you everything about your life right now, like, Mike, if I all of a sudden told you like, what you dream last night which you ate and like the biggest fears that you have of the things that you've done in your life that you've never told anyone and what you really Think is going on the business?
29:03
That's stopping you.
I wouldn't have to even tell you what I'm going to sell you.
I would just say, like, I'm going to solve that problem for you, and you would believe me based on how accurate I was in, assessing your problem.
Right.
29:20
Yeah, the issue right.
Everyone talks way too much about the product and so when you're training salespeople, you don't train them on the product, you train them on the prospect.
The product doesn't matter.
29:35
I mean it matters obviously from like how you're going to make money because you have to do a good job because I'm going to get that in the second point.
But in terms of when you are selling and training someone, if you guys know someone or know a specific Niche really well, then you will know their pains.
And if you have a new salesperson, you hear them say shit.
29:52
And you're like, that's not what he thinks.
What are you doing?
He might know the product perfectly but he just said that the guy's problem was not the problem.
And so then it doesn't matter what the product is because he doesn't feel like it's for him, even though it's totally free.
Him, but you just miss articulated, the problem.
That's where the clarity has to happen.
30:07
If you nail that the rest of the pitches easy.
All right.
So when we're explaining away, concerns value, comes down to the fact that you didn't do that well.
And I'm just going to give you a quick example, which is if I said, right now, I'll give you the keys to my belly, right?
45 Grand.
30:25
Would everyone here give me five grand.
If you knew beyond a shadow of a doubt that I was going to give you the billing, would you do?
Yes.
You would find five grand because it's a great deal.
30:46
Because the value is there and so fundamentally if someone believes, there's a disproportionate amount of value for between what you're offering and the price, they will go find a way to buy it.
If they believe it, they will take a personal loan out because they are convicted based on how well you articulated their problem to them.
31:06
All right, so that is how you overcome price, there's a million lines.
I'm sure Mike's already given you for that but fundamentally when you fuck up on price, it's because they did not understand the You based on how you communicated it?
All right, the second one is decision-maker.
Right?
I, you know, I have to have to talk to my husband.
31:24
I got stuck my business partner.
All right, we have a three step process for this.
And honestly, I only know one.
That works.
Mike might know a lot more, but this is the one that I've used consistently, which is first, you say, well, what if they say, no, right?
And if you're using a, with a male business owner, sometimes you can use an ego pool on this, and they're like, like what if they don't give you permission and they're going to like what?
31:45
I mean?
I don't need.
Mission.
It's like, all right.
So let's rock and roll, right?
And they Lean Forward because you can pull in their ego.
If they say well if they say no that I wouldn't do it.
They're like totally understand.
Does, your partner agree with how the business is working right now?
Yeah.
Today, I mean, do they agree with you that there's a problem?
32:02
Yeah, I mean, you're they're not they're not happy with the situation.
Right?
Well no, all right, well then why would they be?
Why would they be against fixing?
Something that they already don't approve of it.
So the key here is relying on past agreements that have already been made.
So this person with their partner, with their spouse with their business, you know, whatever has aren't.
32:21
That person knows that there's a problem and they also don't approve of that problem.
And so why would they be in any way against remedying, a problem that they already don't approve of right?
And then finally always tack on sometimes, it's better to ask for forgiveness than permission, right?
Ha, ha ha depends on the ticket sale, right?
32:37
You can get those in right.
And then obviously, last last case here is you just do a delayed close and say, let's get your car down.
We could put a down payment, we can pay the rest on Friday.
And if between now and then, you know, your partner comes back and says, no, man, I want to be poor, I want to keep struggling and like I want to never make money and like continue to do this for the rest of our lives, and I'll absolutely tear up the contract.
32:56
Don't worry about, right?
Finally you've got stalls, right?
I need to think about it.
So these are because people don't, people are afraid of making mistakes, right?
People are afraid of making mistakes and because of that, they don't like making decisions because it's easier to let life make the decision for you.
33:17
It's so they like doing it that way because they feel like it's not their fault.
Right?
And so, I mean a great obstacle over for this is what's your main concern?
Which is usually my number one thing I go to when someone's like, I can do you think about it's like totally what your main concern, right?
Let's think about it together, right?
33:33
So fundamentally, these are the things that they need to know.
Do you feel like what we're doing?
Can meet your needs and solve the problem?
Yes.
Or no?
Yes.
Do you want to work with us as a company?
Do you like our values?
Do you like what we stand for?
Do you believe what we believe about the world?
Yes.
Do you have access to funds or know?
33:50
Someone who does?
Yes.
Well, then, let's rock and roll because those are the only things we know to me, to make the decision, right?
Do you like the product do you like us?
And do you have the money to do it?
That's it.
Simple as that.
All right?
And so, when we Through those if you encounter these situations obviously there's you know, for you to do it now sooner or later, you might as well to like, there's plenty of things to say, but I think it's more important to learn the theory behind.
34:14
Why someone has this objection, right?
They have an objection on price because they don't see the value because you didn't articulate it.
They have an objection by decision-maker.
Usually, cuz you fuck something up earlier in the sale.
But at this point you're the red zone.
So you got to deal with it.
So you rely on past agreements, if they come with a stall, then you help them confront a decision to make a logical choice and teach them how to make.
34:33
A decision that in that moment was like what are you most afraid of?
Happening.
I'm afraid you just you're afraid of me taking the money right?
Just taking your money and you getting nothing right again.
Well let me tell you how that's not going to happen, right?
You can bring their concerns are.
And then finally, they say yes and you're like awesome and this is where if you're selling for someone else get them to send a personalized video like hey Johnny saw, you just sign up with us today.
34:54
Super pumped to have you, you're going to be meeting with Heather tomorrow.
She's gonna get you kicked off.
You should in the mail, get a special gift.
So, keep a lookout for that and then, you know, send a handwritten card.
If someone just bought a really expensive thing, NG people are making their decision about whether they believe in you as a company within the first 48 hours after the sale.
35:13
They make a decision of whether or not they're going to be with you in the long term and how they are treated, The First 48 hours after they give you money.
So it's critical and it's usually in that point that people fuck up and just ignore them, right?
That's we need to overcome because they want to scare away the sale when it's completely the opposite.
35:28
You want to over communicate after you've soaked because I'm like, what do I do now, right?
And, and lack of communication is usually where the sales get lost, so that's why you reinforce it.
Alright, so that's how we use the closure sequence as framework.
One framework to And you know, Mike I can stop I'll just do framework to and then we can do the Q&A because if I don't have time to scale, the sales teams I can hit all the points later.
35:50
So this is a big one for everyone, who is whose newer to sales, all right.
If you believe you can outperform the season sales, rep by learning control your tone, all right?
And so I reworked all of our scripts into the closure framework.
And the thing is immediately some people crushing it right.
36:06
While others were still not selling shit.
And I was like, what the fuck, right?
So I talked to my friends and they were like, dude, you should read this book by Jordan.
Buffer.
And the biggest thing that I got for the book was just he was very specific about tonality.
And that was a big shift for me in just learning to teach how to ask the question.
36:23
Not just asking the question, right?
And so, In the book, he talks about having the same issue that I had was scaling sales.
I give the scripted you guys some guy crushes.
Some guy doesn't like what the fuck, right?
And the thing is, is there's a hidden dialogue that the sales team does not know that they are talking it, right?
36:41
And so the words are not going to be enough.
All right there just literally ten percent.
So the words that you have it might be the most tested script of the world.
It's still only 10%. 90% is how you say the words, right?
Because how you say what you say is tonality like, right.
36:58
Now I could give everyone hears, you know, Jerry Seinfeld, stand up script you could read it, it wouldn't be funny, right?
Because it's not just that you had the script, it's how you deliver it, right?
So let me give an example. of like, This is my wife Leila by the way.
37:16
So if she says, Alex, I'll do it again.
So somebody pooped in Alex.
Alex Alex, very different things and that's just my name.
37:32
Right, so imagine how many words you're saying is script right?
The wrong way and so if you learn how to say the right tone you're going to line the words with the meaning.
All right, the words is The Logical influence.
37:48
If like, this makes sense, this is a reasonable argument.
The tone is the emotional influence that you're making on the Prospect and ultimately, how they're making the decision.
You have to have both, right?
Once you become more season, you'll learn to control your tone on purpose.
You can raise your voice right at the end of a statement.
38:05
Make it a question.
Or you can lower your voice to whisper to show that while you're talking about right now is really important.
And that takes time to develop, right?
And that's kind of unconscious Mastery.
And so, there's two ways to do this.
38:21
All right, that I have found, you can either trick yourself into it or you can train yourself to do it, all right?
And since we don't have enough time to to train on the influence of tonalities, here's the trick that I teach.
All right, conviction will correct your tone conviction made real.
38:38
So let me tell you the story.
So I was, I was brought in to do a day of Consulting for this mortgage leads company to In their sales team, and the first half of the day, I reworked the whole script to put the closure framework made it a question based sale and then I came in and they were expecting me to like rain, you know, fire and brimstone these guys.
38:57
And so I sat down, I was like, who's the guy Ever Knows trouble?
There's this guy, John sounds like John and they were selling leads those like John, I'm gonna leads.
He's like, well, you know, I was like, we're good.
Thanks.
It was like, let me show you how you would answer it if you actually believe.
39:13
The police were good.
I was like you'd say, like, do these leads, you're fucking unbelievable.
Right now, I'm studying for my real estate exam, so I can get in on these leads.
My aunt is realtor, and she has more businesses, you can handle, and I'm sending her traffic.
I'm trying to get my my brother to do with me.
I'm not sure how long been a worker because these leaves are killing it for us, right?
39:32
If you believe in the product, you don't need to have all the sales skills, you'll do it the right way because you'll actually want to help the person.
So that's why the most important part of the sale is the product Because unless you are malicious person, Like, most people hear it was ever in here.
39:49
Have some level of ethics on some level like known as just want to like take someone's last dollar, right?
So then the only way to sell hard because if you're going to close your got to sell hard, the only way to sell hard is to believe through and through balls to bones, when you look yourself in the mirror at night, this is what I talked about.
40:05
Whom I said in the very beginning like what happens when people start hating on you?
The only way that I've been able to stay where we're at in the gym industry, Mike knows the amount of heat that I get right.
The only women will do that.
Is that I read the Ammonia.
Lles the thousand of them that I have of Jim's who have gone to six figures of the hundred Jim's.
40:23
We've taken a seven figures, right?
Like I know beyond a shadow of a doubt that our product works.
I also know that if you sign up for a gym not everyone was as way and I'm willing to deal with that.
I am willing to give everyone the opportunity to change their life.
40:41
And I will anyone who's swimming towards me, get in the boat, but if someone is not something towards me, then there's nothing that I can do, all right?
And so you have to have those conversations with yourself because I'll tell you the difference between a world-class sales professional in a mediocre sales.
Professional.
You know the days that you're hot has anyone here been on a hot streak?
40:57
You're like dude I'm fucking closing.
Like fire today.
Jacob, Alan's been on it, case has been on a bang.
You've been on one.
Okay.
So 45 you guys been on a hot streak, the difference in a world-class closer, and in every other, every other type of closer, Is that the real cost closers never get cold?
41:14
And they do that because they manage their state, they learn to harness conviction as a weapon and they know how to recreate that state over an organ and because it's I'm telling you I'm telling you right now the script is important but you need to make sure the model stones are there you have to hit the check marks but once you know the script you should be able to breathe that.
41:31
Like it's the Bible like you that you should, you should have it should occupy no time in your brain or energy to know what you're going to say next.
You have nothing like there should be no thought or attention to that all of your attention should be remaining on the Act, right?
Because if your present, then you'll be able to have the correct tonality, and actually speak to them, like a person rather than a guy with the next thing in the script.
41:53
Rather than, like, talk to Mike, who's the person in front of you?
You're actually trying to help who's got a business or whatever that you're trying to solve, right?
All right, let's rock and roll.
So here's the tactics around this reread testimonials out loud daily in front of your sales team alright.
42:11
And if the business that you're working for doesn't have testimonials find another business.
Right, I'm serious.
You're not gonna be able to close unless you're like literally unless you're an ethical, you're not going to be close.
So go find something.
That is a good product because there's plenty of them out there.
All right, find a good product that you believe in you.
You see tons of testimonials and then read those every day in front of the team.
42:30
All right, second.
Well, this is for the business owners but fix everything you possibly can about the product, all right?
And never blame a customer for lack of success.
So as much as there are people who have not been successful, we've used him lunch.
I still take the fact that they were not successful.
42:46
I think, what could I have done?
That would have made the next person like them successful and you plug the hole, right?
If you do that over and over and over and over again, you know, truly at the end of the day, when you look at yourself in the mirror, when no one else is watching whether or not you truly put the effort for it.
43:01
That merits, the price that you are charging, right?
And only, you can know that.
And the thing is, is like the reason sales people get beat up is because they don't put the work in and then it grates on their soul.
And then, eventually the burnout they burn out, not because they can't handle no, but because they can't handle how they feel about themselves.
43:19
Right?
And so you have to put the work in to have the conviction because that's what's going to get you through it.
If you've ever met someone who's a born-again Christian, all right, they are convicted, they do not care how many people tell them to shove it because they're trying to save people's Souls.
43:39
It's real.
Like if you let that hit you, it's real.
You know what I mean?
And if you can be a disciple of whatever the product that you have an evangelist in the truest terms, then all the scripting stuff, it won't matter.
Why are some of the best salespeople clients who had success because they believe in it?
43:55
That's it.
And the most convicted person will always win the fight, right?
They'll always lead the dance because they have conviction in their skepticism.
You have conviction in your product and one of you is going to win out, right?
And it's the in is whose belief is stronger because belief isn't binary.
44:11
It's not.
Do I believe or do I not believe.
It's how much do I believe to what extent do I believe?
What I bet a thousand dollars on this product.
Little bit ten thousand dollars on this product.
What I sell my mother, this product think about it.
If you would sell your mother, this product how convicted are you?
44:28
Probably very and you will have no problem, closing deals, and notice that I have a lower tone right now, so that you listen to the words that I'm saying that you think that they're important.
Tone matters, right?
Go.
Come on rock and roll.
44:44
So the end goal.
Here is out.
Work yourself out.
All right so never stop improving it.
So you always know it's the best in the easiest for the client, which if you're the one closing, then encourage the owner to do that, all right?
And that's how you had conviction, right?
That's how you get your tone to be unconsciously, correct.
And it's by truly believing in your product and caring about your prospect right at the same time.
45:04
Yes, I'm on Instagram at that were Mosey.
My YouTube is Alex from Rosie.
By podcast and just type in Alex Mosey.
I've got a book, I've got a book called it has 35 pages in the appendix for each.
45:23
One of those obstacles.
If you guys want to go grab that, there's I think there's a, there's a sales training there for like 100 bucks.
Do, if you want to grab it, you can grab it.
It's very good.
I do it because I know it's so good.
People by their shit, so it's worth hell.
Yeah, Alex.
Thank you, thank you.

Real quick guys.
If you can think about how you found this podcast, somebody probably tweeted it told you about it.
Should it on Instagram or something like that?
The only way this grows is through word of mouth and so I don't run ads, I don't do sponsorships, I don't sell anything.
I only ask is that you continue to pay it forward to whoever showed you or however you found out about this Pockets that you do the exact same thing.
0:19
So if it was a review, if it was a post, if you do that would mean the world to me and you throw some good karma out there for another entrepreneur mr.
Pittman question that leans on philosophical, meaning of life side.
What's Sure.
Let's let's, let's rock in.
Welcome to the game where we talk about how to get more customers, how to make more per customer and how to keep them longer and the many failures and lessons.
0:40
We have learned along the way.
Hope you enjoy and subscribe.
Welcome to the call.
Today, I want to open the floor up to ask you guys, is I'm sure because it's been, it's been 30 days since last time we spoke.
So if you guys have questions in the chat burning burning things decisions that are impending things, you're unsure about strategies that you need to validate.
1:00
Or even just a verbal high-five.
Please, put in the chat.
I'll go.
I'm going from top to bottom and then we'll rock and roll from there, mr.
Pittman question, that leans on philosophical meaning of life side, what's sure?
Let's let's let's rock in.
1:17
Let's do it.
So, in your podcast you talk a lot about the like how happiness is like the equation of like wants versus needs and like I had a million cash in the bank but I was living off of 30 grand.
1:33
Or something like that.
And so, were you have, you always just been predisposed to wanting less?
Or is that like a skill that you learn?
Because most people are like, yo, I want to make millions and millions of dollars for that.
I can get more.
At least that's kind of, like, where I was the direction.
1:50
I was going until I like start listening to you and now I'm thinking like, oh my, you know, and so I'm just curious to know like, if that was just like a natural, like, predisposition that you had or you like got to a certain point to where you're like, okay.
Now that I had experienced more I want last like, how did that all kind of play out because I think it would help me become more happy.
2:13
Then that's a loaded question.
It has probably been what that question is.
Been the primary thing that's occupied, my mind space in the last 18 months.
And so for context I don't talk as much probably about what we do but like between are all of the companies that we own we're doing just under 2 million a week like I don't need to take these calls, right?
2:32
I do these things.
Things because like there's a few things that I drive drive from like I love, you know, like I like hearing Peters updates.
I like hearing Patrick knowing that he's moving, you know, for in the chiropractor buses and Jason's, finally get his fucking lead gen, fuck this setup and Mac, you're doing your own dance thing, which is saying, you know what I mean in Michael.
2:50
I know I remember your first sale like that, that is where I find meaning.
And so, I think, first off, if you redefine the term from happiness, which is, which is based on outside circumstances, you are happy as a reaction, Joy comes from within, which means that I can be sad.
Sorrowful and filled with joy, you can mourn and be joyful because joyful is an Express, how you choose to experience the circumstances.
3:10
So first I would redefine the word that you're shooting for, right.
The second thing is, is asking like, but why, right?
And so, a lot of us want to make money because we're like, I want to, you know, and and then and then when we talk publicly, it's like I want to leave a legacy.
3:27
I want to leave an impact blah blah blah, right?
All that stuff I want to help people but the real she is that everything that you do that is external achievement is ephemeral.
And what it means is it literally only exists on the physical plane and that physical plane is temporary, which means it will end, which means that all of the achievements and all the things that you're doing on this plane, literally by definition, will have no lasting impact.
3:53
Hey guys real quick for those of you guys who are 100 million-dollar offers fans I love you.
I added in a lost chapter that has never been released.
I'm releasing it now transparently.
I'm doing that to build hype 400 dollar leads but you will have the unreleased chapter, it talks about your first Avatar and how to segment customers to make more money.
4:11
You can get it by going to acquisition.com forward slash leads.
Its fo free in exchange for your email so that I can email you when we launched under Miller, All Leads and so that you can not miss out on it.
Because last time I sold out for like, Straight weeks really fast.
So that is my way of making sure that y'all get first dibs.
4:30
And so if it means that nothing that you do, any all the things that you accomplished in all the things or rather the wealth that you accumulate will eventually disappear, it changes, the perspective somewhat.
And so the way that I like to think about it is the analogy of a casino.
And so I think all of us are given a token.
4:46
When we're, you know, when we come of age and start to get into the game and we sit down at a table and we play and we play and we play and we play and the players around the table are bragging about how their child big their chips.
Are some players win, some players lose and more.
More chips.
Get Stacked right?
But the difference between that casino and the casino of life is that at the end of the day, you leave the table with your chips, still on it, and you don't cash out and then everyone takes the chips that you had there.
5:12
So you're playing a fake game with fake money.
And so I think when you realize that, like you can buy a castle, you can buy a house and there's a person in India who has no shoes who has more joy in their life, realize that none of the things that we do to accomplish serve any real meaning whatsoever.
5:35
They really just act as the shovel that we use to dig the holes that we're going to fill back up at the end of the day when we die.
And so it's like what shovel do you want to use?
To dig your hole.
And so, I like to think of those things.
5:52
As what things do I inherently, find joy in.
And so, for me, I enjoy learning and I learned through teaching and so, that is how I derive meaning.
And the only thing that I can dedicate my life to that is eternal are things that will last past the physical plane, which are values.
6:16
And so if You can shift your decision-making process from outcome, based decision, making process to Value.
Based decision making process, you'll always feel in alignment with your identity.
And so, for me, when I experience alignment between what I truly believe what I say.
6:33
And what I do, I feel like I'm acting in the way that I that is in alignment with who I am.
And so, I think that a lot of us have made decisions or say things that are contrary to what we believe or we do things that are contrary to what we say, we do things hundred what we think.
And we experienced dissonance and that's most of our lives.
6:50
And so I think that if you can free yourself into thinking, I can, I believe these things to be true.
I say them with certainty and and my life is a reflection of those things, which I believe to be to be meaningful.
And I can dedicate my life to that Eternal value, and that value will exist after I die.
7:10
And so that for me is, is kind of where I drive meaning From work.
That was helpful.
Yeah, I was real big.
How have you defined your values, though?
You know, like, did you like sit on a stone set?
7:27
I value integrity and courage.
And what does, what does that look like?
And how does that play?
I mean, obviously, if you do business, you're doing it with integrity and courage, or whatever your values are.
But like, how do you mean What do you mean, if you think about it?
7:44
There's a lot of times where where we sacrifice, we cut a small corner, right?
And so where we cut the small Corners.
A lot of times, it's not anything that anyone else would notice.
It's just that we know it.
Like you make the email campaign and you just know you didn't do your best.
8:02
You just wanted to get it done, right?
You made the ad and you didn't really go through the process that you know you should be going through, right?
You made the vsl and you just try to knock it out because on your to do list rather than thinking like I'm going to make this truly excellent.
And so every time you do that, you live outside of the values that you have for yourself.
8:20
And so, I think that like you, you feel like you live in alignment, when what you say to others about what you believe is actually what you do.
And so yes, sure, we all believe in being honest.
Sure.
We all believe in.
Trying hard.
Sure.
We all believe in doing your best, but don't fucking does.
8:42
Then I'll work, everyone is like, go to fucking China.
Where they work.
Six days a week, 12 hours a day and that is their 40-hour work week and tell me how hard you work.
I work the weekend.
So hardcore, right.
9:00
And then why is working even considered something that's loud?
Apple?
Right.
Laudable, like why is it, why is that even anything?
Because, like, we're supposed to be doing things that we enjoy that we derive, meaning from, so why should we be loud?
And for doing things that we find joy like that we derive driver, just, interesting thoughts.
9:16
But anyways, tackle that sound.
That's my








0:00
Hey guys, love that you're listening to the podcast.
If you ever want to have the video version of this which usually has more effects more visuals more graphs, you know, drawn out stuff.
Sometimes it can help hit the brain centers in different ways.
You can check out my YouTube channel.
It's absolutely free.
Go check that out if that's what you are into and if not keep enjoying the show Jason bring you on a business partner.
0:20
Don't do it and go ahead ha ha so welcome to the game where we talk about how to get more customers how to make more per customer and how to keep them longer.
ER and the many failures and lessons we have learned along the way hope you enjoy and subscribe.
Welcome to the call today.
I want to open the floor up to ask you guys because I'm sure because it's been it's been 30 days since last we spoke.
0:43
So if you guys have questions in the chat burning burning things decisions that are impending things you're unsure about strategies that you need to validate or even just a verbal high five.
Please put in the chat and then I'll go and going from top to bottom Jason bring on a business partner.
1:00
Don't do it and go ahead ha ha.
So I've had this business for over a decade and Legions just net.
It's always been my weakest function and I'm more real quick.
What's that an apology real quick on that one point.
1:17
How many hours a day?
Do you spend working on Legion?
Not a lot because I get caught up another stuff.
Yeah.
So you're doing a partnership with Kyle and you're making these consideration.
You want to know the decision process.
So right.
Yeah.
1:34
I mean a I want to know if it's a good idea, which I know there's risks involved.
So then I'm like, what?
What are the risk and what consideration, I'm meeting with Elizabeth Morgan this evening to bring up my concerns but I wanted to get your feedback because you've probably seen a lot you benefit eat build Ships.
1:50
So I know nothing about this.
He's, you have to have real like, talk about all the ugly shit first.
Yeah, right.
So right now you guys are in lust, right?
You guys are like, making out getting, you know, haven't, haven't they all sex?
And just like, it's things are amazing.
The bright.
You don't want to have the really ugly, like, how are we going to split up alimony if we, you know, if we get divorced later conversation with no exit strategy all that.
2:12
Yeah, so like that's what has to get defined and you now could Define roles and responsibilities.
The only reason to have a partner's if they have skills, you do not have or They have money, you don't have or they have time, you don't have.
If you're on the flip side, like you have money, and they have time, right?
2:28
So that's where that's where Partnerships are useful.
The number one way, most people do Partnerships that was like, Hey, I'm cool, you're cool.
We love the same thing.
Let's go into business together, which is a terrible way to do a partnership because when it is not necessary, right?
And you're diluting Equity, that being said, are you looking for doing a true partnership, or are you looking on doing like a minority type deal?
2:50
I would always maintain a majority and it would be a scaling, you know, my big companies, an S corp.
So he would basically get a piece of the company as he helps me hit certain million-dollar milestones at to the point of Max maybe like a third of the company.
3:07
Okay well that's different.
That's more like a Performance Based relationship with kickers.
I would, I would structure it as Phantom equity.
Which means what.
So it's Equity that doesn't actually have a stunt unless there's a sale.
3:23
And if he were to leave, then he doesn't get the equity. and so you can pair those two things together so you can do like Equity with profit sharing and so That, that would be, that would be probably how I would structure it either profit, yo, rev, share, depending on, you know, how you negotiate it.
3:40
Okay.
God, but just as it just, as I do for everyone on here, like I remember, I had a mental really early on he's like, and I was taking on all these Partners left and right because I didn't know what I was doing and he's like, listen, you're going to need an accountant, he's like, you just pay.
3:58
The accountant is like, he's not a part, he's not a partner in my business, he's like, I just ready to come, right.
So it's like, just cause you have a knee, doesn't mean they have to be Equity owner, right?
There's plenty of companies that are owned by people who are not lead generation specialists.
You know, so I think if it were me, I'd probably try and set up a really lucrative relationship that isn't necessarily A partnership.
4:20
So it's a like, you know, it's paper or a percentage of something something to that extent, right?
I don't know if you're ever planning on selling because the only reason someone would ever want Equity is is if they want control or they want to be able to make money on an exit.
4:35
So the only two reasons you want a quick otherwise Equity sucks.
Because then you have liability blows.
So unless he wants control, which I don't think it does.
And unless you think you're going to solve, which I don't think you are or anything you want to.
Just you've been doing it for decades unless you're just sick and tired of it, but I don't get the impression, right?
4:53
So then the only thing that he should want or that you should probably negotiate for, is the stuff they want.
Switch is a percentage of Revenue or percentage of profit based on x y z.
So, I think that's what you should.
I don't think you need to make this an equity partnership.
Well, at all, I think you just need an agreement.
Mmm.
Okay.
5:11
Amazing.
Yeah.
Usually due to poor performance agreement, this is like standard.
You know, there's tons of e-commerce companies that like they take 10% of top line from from sales attributed to the marketing that they make in their full service.
They don't have equity in the company but they get they get a percentage Remnant.
5:28
Hmm, got it.
Yeah, I guess I have to see or talk to Kyle and figure out like why would Equity matter to him because, yeah, I've been like just seeing what do you want?
Exit or the or control?
But just ask.
What do you want?
5:44
He's probably say.
I want to purchase with the upside.
Cool.
What specifically?
Because if it's sale I'm not going to sell.
So what specifically I want to pee?
I want a piece of what I'm bringing it.
Cool.
So, Then let's do it.
Based on do xers X or Y for.
You would be advantageous to profit, share for him to be advantageous, to rupture.
It's up to you.
6:03
A most efficient quick break just to let you know that we've been starting to post on LinkedIn and want to connect with you.
Alright.
So send me a connection request and note.
Let me know that you listen to the show and I will accept it.
There's anyone you think that would be should be connected with tag them in one of my or laila's posts?
And I will give you all the love in the world.
6:19
All right, so let's get back to the show.
Okay, that makes sense in the next question.
Looks like it's relevant feeders exit.
Okay, so Peter, this is for you how to sever ties the business partner and best practices go separate ways.
6:36
So it depends on whether you have a kid or not, right?
And how good-looking the kid is and how much money the kid makes, right?
And so you guys have a business.
If the business isn't making a ton of money, then mostly times, you can just be like, hey man, like why don't we just both fuck off.
And go, our separate ways, Steven Wilson the businesses and making any money and Has your debt that needs to be paddle?
6:58
So then you can just, I mean, then at that point you should just split the debt if you want to.
If you like, you can split the debt or you can is this an LLC that you are ending or is this in general.
So, so the way the business is setup is it is an LLC and then I have obviously my own agency.
7:16
So the to the idea was to use my agency to generate sales to then pay the debt of the other LLC back.
However, I'm responsible for the backend, he's responsible for the front and like the sails.
Yeah, last six months ahead of he hasn't really brought in any cell so now that I'm selling and doing everything.
7:39
Exactly.
Now becomes their point of like, okay, this debt is 50/50.
However, if I'm doing a hundred percent of the work, why should I also pay 100% of the debt and fulfill the product and do everything else on the back end?
Yeah, I mean, I figure out like, how to rip that Band-Aid off and say, you know, It was good.
7:59
Easiest way to easiest way to have hard conversations.
Is just ask the questions that you asked here.
So, like literally the biggest hack and all of relationships is the way that you talk shit about someone behind their back is literally what you should just tell them.
So it's like, hey man, you said that you were going to do all the sales and I was going to do the back end.
8:16
Well, you're not doing the sales but we're still both responsible for this thing.
So what do you think's Fair?
You'll have what you have in mind, but a lot of times people who were once you once you present the information, like that'll be like fuck.
You're right.
Like so what do you think's?
8:32
Fair is like, well, you should just take the business and I guess I can try and start paying off my chair over time.
You're like cool, that's what I was thinking, too.
Let's sign these that way that, you know, the things dissolved and then you transfer your Equity to me and you have a note back to me for fifty percent of the debt.
8:55
That makes sense.
Yeah, you can Google promissory note template one page.
It just like from borrower to lender no interest x amount by this paid, by the state in this increment.
Like what happens if they default and that's it.
9:13
Like, it's a very simple like I've done million dollar loans on one page, like you're there.
They hold up.
And you're in real estate.
So you should find plenty of promissory notes, that are simple.
Yeah, that makes sense.
So the equity as to where investors are to our lenders, right?
9:31
So I want to make sure like, so this the equity and the debt, so, there's two pieces, right?
The equity, you just say, hey, I own 100 percent of this company, you're giving your shares to me because you're not doing shit, right?
That's number one, or we dissolve the company.
I create new entity, I'd prefer to say, $300, it's up to you right?
9:48
With thing is, is you could do that right now.
It doesn't like and you could just say, like I don't really give a shit if you sign this and it saves me 300 bucks.
Like this is not really discussion because there's nothing here.
All right.
The second piece is is ok.
Now, let's now that we've dealt with the equity piece.
Now let's see what the debt piece right into the debt piece.
10:05
This is what we both owe.
This is what we agreed on.
This is what I will do and this is the promissory note that you can write, you know, or we can both sign together towards the lenders.
Okay, makes sense and then you don't, then you're not.
And then, as far as his involved, in my agency, just he can quote, unquote, sell my product and earn a commission and do whatever he seems with it or not because that's the other, you know, tricky part is.
10:33
She's also involved in my agency, but more so because we did you guys are making any money so it's not like you can start making money now.
Yeah, okay, right, yeah, that's kind of what I'm thinking as well.
Yeah, it's like, let's go obsess about the fact that it's like, what if he gets rich on my products, he wasn't getting rich on your fucking For the last two years.
10:50
So I gotta think it's just sort of, I mean, you know, my thing was like I want it.
I want him to pull some cells in for us to actually sell the product because then we would actually pay the other thing.
Oh, that's fine.
Then I would say a and on top of this I'll still continue to give you the the thing you still sell it and you know, we split the revenue, whatever.
11:08
Okay, we'll go sweet.
For the last two years.
So I gotta think it's just sort of, I mean, you know, my thing was like I want it.
I want him to pull some cells in for us to actually sell the product because then we would actually pay the other thing.
Oh, that's fine.
Then I would say a and on top of this I'll still continue to give you the the thing you still sell it and you know, we split the revenue, whatever.
Okay, we'll go sweet.

Hey guys, real quick.
So Leyland are definitely working on our social media presence.
If you guys haven't noticed and we're just breaking now into LinkedIn.
All right.
It's not as bad as I thought it's actually a pretty awesome so far and you guys have been really cool in there and people are sharing our stuff a lot.
So if we aren't connected on LinkedIn, it go ahead and let's connect and let's rock and roll.
0:17
But I want to walk you through it because it looks okay.
But as you should, as I show you the framework that I use test for four lenses that I look at Investments through.
You'll see more and more.
Why it wasn't good.
Welcome to the game where we talk about how to get more customers, how to make more per customer and how to keep them longer in the many failures and lessons.
0:33
We have learned along the way.
I hope you enjoy and subscribe.
One of the deals.
I did 60 days to go pays me a hundred thousand dollars a month, in passive income, just by being the bank.
And so what I will show you in this video is how I find these deals, how I structure these deals.
And one thing to make sure that you don't do because actually one of the CEOs of the companies, our portfolio should reach out to me because he got an email from his wealth advisor and we use quotes here because it was almost borderline unethical.
1:00
What the deal looks like, but I want to walk you through it because it looks okay.
But as you should, as I show you the framework that I use to test for four lenses that I look at Investments through.
You'll see more and more why it wasn't good.
And then at the end, I'll show you what, what, what was good and the deal that actually made this happen.
All right, so, the deal that his advisor, I sent him was, hey, we've got a business that wants 450,000 dollars, right?
1:23
450k to invest in their startup, okay?
So we're sending this money to a start.
Up just in case you're curious.
It's a little bit risky.
All right, we'll get into that in a second.
So 450,000 to a start-up and he said they're willing to pay you 10% per year and they're going to pay this at the end of 12 months.
1:46
All right.
Which means at the end of 12 months, he's going to get 450 thousand plus 45k.
All right?
That is what the return is going to be, all right?
And so they were like, hey can you break this?
It didn't sound like a good deal but we kind of want you to walk us through, all right?
2:04
And so here's how you should think about these Investments.
All right, number one is yield, all right, which is how much money cash flow is coming to me every single month.
Alright, that is one way that you look at the investment.
2:20
The next way is capital preservation which is How likely am I going to be preserving?
My Capital?
That my money is going to come back to me.
All right?
All of these are on.
On a scale so it's not like a guest.
No it's more like to what extent.
Alright the next one is tax advantage.
2:36
All right, so if I do this investment, is this going to cost me a lot?
Tax-wise write something that's treated as capital gains versus something that's income is going to be have a better tax treatment and then finally, you've got Equity growth.
All right, so does the thing that I'm buying or putting my money in become more valuable.
2:53
All right, so, when you're looking at any kind of investment or anywhere to put your money, look through this lens of one, two, three, Think.
Okay to what extent is my Capital being preserved?
To what?
Extent am I getting the yield?
What are my tax advantages in my growing?
All right, it's how I walk them through this exact same process and so let's look at this deal that you got.
3:11
All right so Capital preservation box one.
Well there's this is going to a start-up in they're saying they're not going to pay you anything at all and then at the very end they're going to give you 495,000 at the end right?
For 50-plus 45,000.
How likely do I think that's happening with the starter?
I would put that as a no probably not like it.
3:29
You and wise Sighs.
I'm going to get 10%.
Okay.
That's cash flow, kind of good but for a debt deal.
Probably not great.
All right, because we're going to compare this to is that like if you look at indexes like the S&P I don't even know what it was last year but I'm guessing it was really good.
3:47
Is probably 20 percent something like that last year and so literally having a hundred percent Capital preservation and having a 20% increase in equities which is here, right?
You'd have a better return there but this one No increase in equities because we're not participating on the upside.
4:02
We're just participating on the downside which by the way when you ever do money-lending, all you get is guaranteed cash and you participate on the downside.
So you really need to make sure the downsides get.
All right?
And then the fourth box here is tax advantage.
These guys make good money.
And so I was like, 10% was like you're going to get taxed at 45%, right of that 10%?
4:22
Which really means.
You're effective increase is going to be five point five percent.
Alright, that's how much you're actually going to make on this deal.
After taxes that's like barely enough to cover inflation.
And so they're saying risk 450,000 dollars to barely cover inflation, not participate in the upside at all be tax disadvantage and have into this with a start-up so that you're very unlikely to have your Capital preserved, right?
4:47
So like this is borderline, unethical how bad this deal is?
And so what I want to do now, if you guys are good with it, is I'll show you the flip side which is the deal that I just did about 60 days ago.
Alright, so here's how this deal.
It worked.
I wrote a note for 2.5 million dollars, all right, to secure a building out of foreclosure.
5:06
All right, so somebody emailed me and said, hey, I found this building is to, it's 2.5 million dollars.
That's how much I can buy for and I said, okay, well tell me more about this deal, so we're going through the same framework.
All right, so we've got Capital preservation.
5:22
We've got yield, we've got tax, and we've got that.
Most Nation real quick.
If you are a business owner that has a big old business and wants to get to a much bigger business, going to fifteen hundred dollars.
5:37
Plus, we would love to talk to you and if you like that or like to hear more about it, go to acquisition.com, you can play anywhere on the page and talk to one of our team and see if we can help you get there. so in this, in this situation he then said, I have four offers On the building already between 5.1 and 5.6 million.
6:04
All right, it was like, okay, so now I know that this is reasonable and you sent me the offers over.
So I knew that they were good on top of that, the intake in the top guy and this guy had put three hundred thousand dollars in earnest money down, meaning he had committed to doing the deal as soon as he as soon as it comes available.
6:21
All right, so we have a real buyer lined up at 5.6 million.
Sounds good so far.
This building is worth 2.5.
So I'm thinking Preservation.
If if, for some reason this deal goes through, I've got three other people who said they've been willing to give more than twice as much money as a buying this for.
6:38
All right, pretty good.
Now, mind you, I'm not buying the building.
I'm the bank here.
I'm the one lending the money to the guy.
All right there he's going to make good money on this.
He's going to get two and a half million.
That's not his money and then he's going to sell it for five point, one, two, five point six and this case 5.6 and he's going to end up making two point 1 million on this deal - whatever my fee is for supplying the money now.
6:59
On top of that, I asked to have a personal guarantee.
From him and the partner.
All right, so just in case these three offers fall through on top of the fourth offer with the earnest money.
I got personal guarantees by both the buyers of the building.
7:16
Alright?
So this is how I wanted to make sure that my capitals preserves some like cool check.
Now, do I participate in any of the equity of this of this business?
The answer is none.
I don't have any Equity participation from a tax perspective if they're just going to pay me a yield, which is exactly how I structured it.
7:35
What am I going to have bad tax treatment?
You bet your ass?
I am it's going to be treated as regular income.
So it's got to be really worth it for me only yield side.
And so the way that I wrote the note is I get 48 percent to ninety six percent per year.
7:52
You're like how can you achieve, you know, a returns like that.
If you look for right, that's the simple answer, right?
And the more deals you do, the more people know that you have money that you can do deals.
And then the more they reach out to, right?
And if there's not a lot of people can just snap ahead and just throw out two and a half million dollars.
8:08
And so you got on a higher and higher list and you get access to different deals.
All right, that's the short answer.
So what they're doing here is that means that I'm getting four percent per month, all right.
Now if you do the math or two and a half million four percent per month is a hundred thousand dollars per month.
8:25
Now, you might be wondering, why would Anyone pay that this is a bridge loan, this is a short-term loan.
It's called hard, money lending, private lending private placement, different things like that, but they need money fast and so they can't go through a normal process because they got a steal on this building, right?
8:41
How many times you get a building for two and a half?
That's worth five immediately, right?
Not many it.
So they need someone can immediately provide liquidity and in exchange they pay a higher rate.
Now they're not planning on holding the money for the whole year, but if I do multiple deals like this, that I can effectively get a rate that's comparable to this.
8:57
Over the time period of the Year, all right, so four percent per month.
That's a hundred thousand dollars a month.
Their plan holding time was going to be 60 days.
I give them 90 days at this, which means in the minimum carry.
Meaning, if they did it into in 24 hours, I still get two months of minimum carry.
9:16
Meaning, if I'm going to do this deal, I have to make at least two hundred thousand dollars on just sending the wire and then getting the money back, even if it takes a day, like, it doesn't matter.
All right, so I set up a minimum carry for that of times to, I'm giving it up to 90 days where they can continue to pay.
9:32
If it's like 65 days, it still rolls into three months, right?
Which means that I'm it makes three times this, right?
Which is three hundred thousand dollars and so sometimes when you were like why aren't you selling stuff on this channel?
It's because I don't really care.
And so hopefully this makes sense to you.
9:48
If you're thinking if someone emails you God I hope they don't even know you but if someone emails you a deal that looks like this one run the other way and you know question their morals and ethics because either they're absolutely.
Absolutely no idea what they're doing or they're expecting that you have no idea what you're doing.
And so that is why I'm making this video so that you don't do a deal like this.
10:06
Think through it, through Within These, these four levels, and there is a point because I know I'm going to get this question.
Well, at what percentage is it worth getting the yield, which is this fourth box here, right?
Well I'm going to get taxed of this.
Right at a, my after tax rate on this is going to be like 27 percent return.
10:25
So from a 27 percent return still makes sense after taxes and everything.
So that that deal makes sense.
But it has to be really, really good for me because I have a ton of income.
So I'm gonna get taxed at the highest Racket.
If it's any kind of regular income type deal.
And so if you're going to do a deal like this, you have to make sure that it makes sense.
10:43
All right, so hopefully that makes sense.
You guys.
Hope you enjoyed that like subscribe, all that stuff and I'll see you guys next video.
Racket.
If it's any kind of regular income type deal.
And so if you're going to do a deal like this, you have to make sure that it makes sense.
All right, so hopefully that makes sense.
You guys.
Hope you enjoyed that like subscribe, all that stuff and I'll see you guys next video.








0:00
Real quick.
Because you guys already know that, I don't run any ads on this and I don't sell anything.
And so, the only ask that I can ever have you guys that you help me spread the word so we can have more entrepreneurs, make more money, feed their families, make better products, and have better experiences for their employees and customers.
And the only way we do that is if you can rate and review and share this podcast, so the single thing that I have to do is you can just leave review will take you 10 seconds or one type of the thumb mean, the absolute world to me and more importantly, it may change the world of someone else.
0:27
So many people like to think like do you think Believe in what you are selling, right?
They asked the question is though, it's a binary answer.
Yes or no?
I believe, I don't believe but it would be much more accurate to say.
To what extent do you believe in?
Welcome to the game, where we talk about, how to get more customers, how to make more per customer and how to keep them longer in the many failures and lessons.
0:44
We have learned along the way.
I hope you enjoy and subscribe.
In this video, I want to talk about how to close a higher percentage of deals, and how to close more deals overall.
And it's all centered around a single concept which is the belief Continuum, all right.
And so, if you think about this visual right, I have right here.
So you've got your salesman here and you got your prospect here, right?
1:01
And you see, this bubble that I put over their head at the prospect has no bubble inside.
It's completely empty and they might have a negative bubble as well and then you've got the salesman who's got his belief bubble, so many people like to think.
Like do you believe in what you are selling, right?
They asked the question is though, it's a binary answer.
Yes.
Or no, I believe, right?
1:16
I don't believe but it would be much more accurate.
To what extent do you believe in, right?
Because belief is not a binary question.
It is a Continuum it is.
How much do you believe in what you are selling?
Because if you thoroughly 100% believe with all of your heart and mind that what you are selling is true.
I guarantee you that you will sell significantly more.
1:34
And so, what I want to show you these two equations that I wrote down as simple equations for how to actually sell.
And so many people focus, I would say disproportion amount of people focus on the skill of selling and there absolutely is a skill to sales.
You have to know exactly what to say.
Have to know how to say but you can shortcut that path to success by having conviction.
1:54
And the way that you have conviction is by a dramatically, understanding the the needs of your prospects.
So that when you are talking to somebody, you know exactly what their problem is.
So that if your product perfectly matches their problem, you can have conviction in order to sell it.
2:10
Most sales people don't even listen to the prospect at all, and simply want to deliver their pitch which inherently means that they can't believe in the product that much because Not even thinking about whether it solves the problem for the prospect because you can't be convicted that it's going to solve the problem if you don't even know what the problem is.
2:26
And so they haven't taken any time to understand the prospect most sales training should be, is currently focused on educating salesman around the product when it should be most of them most I'm focused on educating the salesman around the Prospect and their problems, not the product.
2:43
Alrighty, understanding shift that has to happen when you're educating a sales team and or yourself Cough, especially if you're entering a market that you are not the Avatar, right?
One of the reasons that many successful businesses happen from somebody who suffered from a pain and then went to go solve it for themselves and then ended up solving it for other people is because they desperately and they.
3:01
So clearly understand, the thoughts needs and pains of the Prospect and they know how the product solves those problems, right?
And so the first equation here is for increasing closing percentage.
And so if it's you that selling, or if it's a sales team that selling, it's the skill of skip sale.
3:18
X the extent to which you believe it is.
Not yes, I believe.
No, I believe this number can be 100, right?
And the thing is that I believe that this number of conviction can grow far higher than what skill can give you.
You can be a very skilled salesman, but let's say the skill of sales is one to ten, right?
3:38
I'll put this on here so you can see it.
Let's say your skills.
Talents can be 1 to 10.
I believe that your skill your beliefs around conviction can be 1 to 100, right?
So Even if your skill of sales is a to, you can have a hundred belief and I guarantee you that you will close because people can sense, whether you believe what you were telling them is true.
3:58
And they believe that what you were selling them is going to solve their problem, right?
And so most people, most sales teams, most sales managers do not focus enough on this bubble, which is conviction, which is this part of the equation, right?
If you think about what sales is, it's fundamentally a transference of belief and so how can you, how can you transfer?
4:18
And Empty cup.
How can you transfer a cup that is only 1/3 full into another empty cup and expected to be over the threshold of the amount of believe that's necessary to and that's required for a prospect to Major.
Make a purchasing decision, of course not right.
And so we still try and get the person to say a certain thing or pausing this way, or have this tonality, or this emphasis in it, that is important, right?
4:40
And there's definitely a place for that.
You have to have the basics of sales in place, but a much much bigger lever that is often and most underutilized.
Or unrealized at all is the conviction or the extent to which the salesman believes and what they're selling and to what extent it can help, solve the prospects problem.
5:00
Hey, guys, real quick.
If you're new to the podcast, I've a book on Amazon called 100 million-dollar offers that over eight thousand five star reviews.
It has almost a perfect score.
You can get it for 99 cents on Kindle.
The reason I bring it up is that I put over a thousand hours in the writing that book and it's my biggest gift to our community.
5:15
So it's my very Shameless way of trying to get you to like me more and ultimately make more dollars to that later on in your business career I push the partner with you so that's my give go check it out Amazon and back to the show.
All right.
5:31
And so that will influence the closing percentage of an individual or team.
The second piece is going to be the work ethic, right?
So, a lot of people have probably seen really good closures versus really bad closers based on their closing percentage but also total number of deals closed.
Personally, when you have somebody who has really high work ethic, then they can make up for a lower closing percentage by having more activity.
5:52
So that means that they are following up with their pipeline faster.
They are.
Following up more times right there, reaching out to people on their own, in their own time.
You give themselves more opportunities and they can compensate for low closing percentage by simply having more at-bats, right?
And so if you think about the expert salesman is having these two things together, which is you want to have a high closing percentage and you have lots of units, sold, all right?
6:13
And so there's three variables here, you've got skill, you've got conviction and you've got work ethic but conviction, counts twice.
Because if you believe that what you are selling is genuinely going to help people, you will follow up faster, you will file.
More religiously.
You will follow up as though you were trying to help someone.
6:29
And so let me, let me ask you this question is a good mental, thought process.
If you could go back in time, let's say you could go back in time, five years.
And you can talk to yourself and say, Hey, I want you to put 100% of the money that we have right now.
Mind, you, you kept, you couldn't tell the person that is, you your past self that you are you in the future, right?
6:48
So you can't say anything like that, but in this thought experiment and you went back in time and said, hey, we've got this money in the bank account.
I want you to put 100% of money into this thing called Bitcoin, right?
I want you put a hundred percent money, To something called Amazon.
I want you put it all that money into Tesla or whatever, right?
Something that blew up over the last five years, all right.
7:05
If you were to tell yourself that let's say you were talking to you and you were like I'm good thanks?
Right.
How many times would you follow up with yourself to get yourself to do that thing or do that action?
7:21
Or make that investment a lot?
And it's because you truly believe that it would solve your prospects problem and you have pure And that what you were selling them, the investment, the opportunity to whatever it is is 100% going to work.
Think about how you would approach that?
7:38
How many times would you follow up?
How, how convicted would you be when you spoke?
Would you be focused on the skill of selling?
Or would you be focusing on how true what you say is?
And if you can make that perspective shift and if you were a sales manager and you're trying to manage a sales team, I would implore you to focus way more of your time around the thing that counts twice in the equation of selling and creating Great salespeople, which is the belief to which the extent the extent to, which they believe what they're selling, and to whom they are selling, then then then then boring with the, with the monotony of the skill which, which don't get me wrong.
8:12
It is very important to sell.
There's lots of videos that you've probably heard where I talk about the skill of sales.
But I think when you rate this and you were to in a forest multiplication standpoint, I don't think that they equated.
I don't think they are equivalent, right?
And the proof that I have in this is that if you look at every single religious, you know, move You are selling something very hard to sell, which is a completely new frame of you around the world.
8:33
The people who believe this many times, they don't train them in the skills of selling.
They just get them to believe wholeheartedly in what they are selling, right?
And so, if you're salesmen and your sales team are not drinking the Kool-Aid, quite literally of the products that you sell, or the services that you sell, then that is your problem, not, whether or not they are clarifying the problem.
8:53
The beginning, now they should because they should be listing and they should believe that what it should make sure that the prospect is is going to be best served by this.
This right?
But big picture.
If you fix this, everything else will happen and I'll tell you.
This is the one last story around this. if you believed wholeheartedly in the, the solution that you are selling, would you not then spend lots of time.
9:17
Honing, your scalp probably because you would want to help more people because you believe in the thing that you were selling them, right?
You would probably.
Would you not if you believe in this thing will hardly follow up as many people as possible.
Be quick to respond because you know how much it's going to change their life probably.
9:33
And so I think that just like, Simonson excess, start with why I believe that the skill of sales is fundamentally a transference of belief and we do need to start with why for sales People because it is not a question of whether or not they believe it is annexed.
It is the question of to what extent do they believe?
9:49
And if you can get that to 100 you will never have problems selling ever again.
So hope you found this valuable.
Click subscribe, lots of love and I'll see you next video.

Most Nation real quick.
If you are a business owner that has a big old business and wants to get to a much bigger business, going to 50 $100.
Plus, we would love to talk to you and if you like that or would like to hear more about it, go to acquisition.com, you can play anywhere on the page and talk to one of our team and see if we can help you get there, okay?
0:19
So slay one, Dragon at a time.
What do I run mean by that?
One of the things that you're mad at me transfer, my business was being able to focus on one thing at a time.
And I do that and how I manage my schedule, I did that in how I manage my tasks, my responsibilities, as an owner.
0:36
And I mean, if you think about it, like why, why go one on two?
So, a lot of the times, like, the first thing that I want, I'm getting on the phone with someone who's new and, you know, they have their own gym will be like, hey, I'm starting an online business, and starting a food prep business, and my gym struggling.
I'm like, why are you doing?
0:53
Why are you?
Why are you trying to start three?
Businesses, one of them is working, you know, like each business is going to have problems like every single business has issues if there weren't problems or difficulties or obstacles to overcome, then everyone would do it, right?
1:10
And so everyone would be killing it with food prep, or everyone will be killing it with supplements or everyone would be killing with whatever, right?
And so, you want to focus on one thing at a time.
And I promise you that as soon as you take those other things off your plate, the problems that are presenting you and your normal business, your gym Are going to seem really really easy and it's because you have all your attention back and you can focus on it.
1:30
And so when you've got like all these other distractions that are coming up and they're things are not fruitful like I had someone who called me the other day and they were starting an online that, you know, they wanted to get into online personal training in the gym and they're like, I need, I need help getting my gym going so that I can focus back on my personal training and I was like, if your gym was doing 50,000 a month, I was like what you care about online personal training, they're like, probably not.
1:53
And I was like, well then why don't we just get your gym to fit?
3,000 a month and then we'll go from there.
You know what I mean?
I mean this like I've been in so many different masterminds or someone gets up there and they say with their situation is what their problems are.
And like most of the time you already know what the answer is like.
2:08
It's really obvious to everyone else who's not there.
That like what you need to do is stop doing all this other bullshit and just focus on the one thing that matters right now, which is your gym, right?
Like don't start all these other side quests because your gems not working fix your gym and sometimes it's hard to like as As a guy, you know like our ego wants to be like well if I could hundred percent commit and then I can't make it work then it would make me a failure.
2:32
Whereas if I tell myself that I'm just too busy to make it work then it's not on me but at the end of the day like if you can't make it work then it is only.
And so like make your job easier like I like making sales Easier by making good offers.
I like making business Easier by only focusing on one at a time.
So just something that's important to really realize that like I mean, I'm guilty of this so I'm saying this because I did it.
2:56
Like I tried to take on five of them uses the once and like I made no money, it was only when I was able to focus on one thing that my income increased and I was able to actually make something that was productive.
So that's my, you know, Food For Thought Russell Brunson, who's he's my business Mentor, he talked to a group of us and he was like, you want it?
3:16
What how I got from 3 million to 30 million a year and he's like by just focusing on one business.
And that was it, that was this Whole Town's this whole thing.
And so I'm just relaying the same information I was told to me and you can either continue to search a muscle.
You can find or search for me and your mom, told you, whatever it is, whatever you need to listen to, in order for that to actually resonate with you and stop being busy all the time and stop spreading yourself.
3:38
Crazy thin trying to do nine different things and just focus on one business.
I guarantee you it will make your life a lot easier and business will be a lot better.
Promise.
All right, execute.

Real quick.
Because you guys already know that, I don't run any ads on this and I don't sell anything.
And so, the only ask that I can ever have you guys that you help me spread the word so we can have more entrepreneurs, make more money, feed their families, make better products, and have better experiences for their employees and customers.
And the only way we do that is if you can rate and review and share this podcast, so the single thing that I have to do is you can just leave review will take you 10 seconds or one type of the thumb mean, the absolute world to me and more importantly, it may change the world of someone else.
0:27
So many people like to think like do you think Believe in what you are selling, right?
They asked the question is though, it's a binary answer.
Yes or no?
I believe, I don't believe but it would be much more accurate to say.
To what extent do you believe in?
Welcome to the game, where we talk about, how to get more customers, how to make more per customer and how to keep them longer in the many failures and lessons.
0:44
We have learned along the way.
I hope you enjoy and subscribe.
In this video, I want to talk about how to close a higher percentage of deals, and how to close more deals overall.
And it's all centered around a single concept which is the belief Continuum, all right.
And so, if you think about this visual right, I have right here.
So you've got your salesman here and you got your prospect here, right?
1:01
And you see, this bubble that I put over their head at the prospect has no bubble inside.
It's completely empty and they might have a negative bubble as well and then you've got the salesman who's got his belief bubble, so many people like to think.
Like do you believe in what you are selling, right?
They asked the question is though, it's a binary answer.
Yes.
Or no, I believe, right?
1:16
I don't believe but it would be much more accurate.
To what extent do you believe in, right?
Because belief is not a binary question.
It is a Continuum it is.
How much do you believe in what you are selling?
Because if you thoroughly 100% believe with all of your heart and mind that what you are selling is true.
I guarantee you that you will sell significantly more.
1:34
And so, what I want to show you these two equations that I wrote down as simple equations for how to actually sell.
And so many people focus, I would say disproportion amount of people focus on the skill of selling and there absolutely is a skill to sales.
You have to know exactly what to say.
Have to know how to say but you can shortcut that path to success by having conviction.
1:54
And the way that you have conviction is by a dramatically, understanding the the needs of your prospects.
So that when you are talking to somebody, you know exactly what their problem is.
So that if your product perfectly matches their problem, you can have conviction in order to sell it.
2:10
Most sales people don't even listen to the prospect at all, and simply want to deliver their pitch which inherently means that they can't believe in the product that much because Not even thinking about whether it solves the problem for the prospect because you can't be convicted that it's going to solve the problem if you don't even know what the problem is.
2:26
And so they haven't taken any time to understand the prospect most sales training should be, is currently focused on educating salesman around the product when it should be most of them most I'm focused on educating the salesman around the Prospect and their problems, not the product.
2:43
Alrighty, understanding shift that has to happen when you're educating a sales team and or yourself Cough, especially if you're entering a market that you are not the Avatar, right?
One of the reasons that many successful businesses happen from somebody who suffered from a pain and then went to go solve it for themselves and then ended up solving it for other people is because they desperately and they.
3:01
So clearly understand, the thoughts needs and pains of the Prospect and they know how the product solves those problems, right?
And so the first equation here is for increasing closing percentage.
And so if it's you that selling, or if it's a sales team that selling, it's the skill of skip sale.
3:18
X the extent to which you believe it is.
Not yes, I believe.
No, I believe this number can be 100, right?
And the thing is that I believe that this number of conviction can grow far higher than what skill can give you.
You can be a very skilled salesman, but let's say the skill of sales is one to ten, right?
3:38
I'll put this on here so you can see it.
Let's say your skills.
Talents can be 1 to 10.
I believe that your skill your beliefs around conviction can be 1 to 100, right?
So Even if your skill of sales is a to, you can have a hundred belief and I guarantee you that you will close because people can sense, whether you believe what you were telling them is true.
3:58
And they believe that what you were selling them is going to solve their problem, right?
And so most people, most sales teams, most sales managers do not focus enough on this bubble, which is conviction, which is this part of the equation, right?
If you think about what sales is, it's fundamentally a transference of belief and so how can you, how can you transfer?
4:18
And Empty cup.
How can you transfer a cup that is only 1/3 full into another empty cup and expected to be over the threshold of the amount of believe that's necessary to and that's required for a prospect to Major.
Make a purchasing decision, of course not right.
And so we still try and get the person to say a certain thing or pausing this way, or have this tonality, or this emphasis in it, that is important, right?
4:40
And there's definitely a place for that.
You have to have the basics of sales in place, but a much much bigger lever that is often and most underutilized.
Or unrealized at all is the conviction or the extent to which the salesman believes and what they're selling and to what extent it can help, solve the prospects problem.
5:00
Hey, guys, real quick.
If you're new to the podcast, I've a book on Amazon called 100 million-dollar offers that over eight thousand five star reviews.
It has almost a perfect score.
You can get it for 99 cents on Kindle.
The reason I bring it up is that I put over a thousand hours in the writing that book and it's my biggest gift to our community.
5:15
So it's my very Shameless way of trying to get you to like me more and ultimately make more dollars to that later on in your business career I push the partner with you so that's my give go check it out Amazon and back to the show.
All right.
5:31
And so that will influence the closing percentage of an individual or team.
The second piece is going to be the work ethic, right?
So, a lot of people have probably seen really good closures versus really bad closers based on their closing percentage but also total number of deals closed.
Personally, when you have somebody who has really high work ethic, then they can make up for a lower closing percentage by having more activity.
5:52
So that means that they are following up with their pipeline faster.
They are.
Following up more times right there, reaching out to people on their own, in their own time.
You give themselves more opportunities and they can compensate for low closing percentage by simply having more at-bats, right?
And so if you think about the expert salesman is having these two things together, which is you want to have a high closing percentage and you have lots of units, sold, all right?
6:13
And so there's three variables here, you've got skill, you've got conviction and you've got work ethic but conviction, counts twice.
Because if you believe that what you are selling is genuinely going to help people, you will follow up faster, you will file.
More religiously.
You will follow up as though you were trying to help someone.
6:29
And so let me, let me ask you this question is a good mental, thought process.
If you could go back in time, let's say you could go back in time, five years.
And you can talk to yourself and say, Hey, I want you to put 100% of the money that we have right now.
Mind, you, you kept, you couldn't tell the person that is, you your past self that you are you in the future, right?
6:48
So you can't say anything like that, but in this thought experiment and you went back in time and said, hey, we've got this money in the bank account.
I want you to put 100% of money into this thing called Bitcoin, right?
I want you put a hundred percent money, To something called Amazon.
I want you put it all that money into Tesla or whatever, right?
Something that blew up over the last five years, all right.
7:05
If you were to tell yourself that let's say you were talking to you and you were like I'm good thanks?
Right.
How many times would you follow up with yourself to get yourself to do that thing or do that action?
7:21
Or make that investment a lot?
And it's because you truly believe that it would solve your prospects problem and you have pure And that what you were selling them, the investment, the opportunity to whatever it is is 100% going to work.
Think about how you would approach that?
7:38
How many times would you follow up?
How, how convicted would you be when you spoke?
Would you be focused on the skill of selling?
Or would you be focusing on how true what you say is?
And if you can make that perspective shift and if you were a sales manager and you're trying to manage a sales team, I would implore you to focus way more of your time around the thing that counts twice in the equation of selling and creating Great salespeople, which is the belief to which the extent the extent to, which they believe what they're selling, and to whom they are selling, then then then then boring with the, with the monotony of the skill which, which don't get me wrong.
8:12
It is very important to sell.
There's lots of videos that you've probably heard where I talk about the skill of sales.
But I think when you rate this and you were to in a forest multiplication standpoint, I don't think that they equated.
I don't think they are equivalent, right?
And the proof that I have in this is that if you look at every single religious, you know, move You are selling something very hard to sell, which is a completely new frame of you around the world.
8:33
The people who believe this many times, they don't train them in the skills of selling.
They just get them to believe wholeheartedly in what they are selling, right?
And so, if you're salesmen and your sales team are not drinking the Kool-Aid, quite literally of the products that you sell, or the services that you sell, then that is your problem, not, whether or not they are clarifying the problem.
8:53
The beginning, now they should because they should be listing and they should believe that what it should make sure that the prospect is is going to be best served by this.
This right?
But big picture.
If you fix this, everything else will happen and I'll tell you.
This is the one last story around this. if you believed wholeheartedly in the, the solution that you are selling, would you not then spend lots of time.
9:17
Honing, your scalp probably because you would want to help more people because you believe in the thing that you were selling them, right?
You would probably.
Would you not if you believe in this thing will hardly follow up as many people as possible.
Be quick to respond because you know how much it's going to change their life probably.
9:33
And so I think that just like, Simonson excess, start with why I believe that the skill of sales is fundamentally a transference of belief and we do need to start with why for sales People because it is not a question of whether or not they believe it is annexed.
It is the question of to what extent do they believe?
9:49
And if you can get that to 100 you will never have problems selling ever again.
So hope you found this valuable.
Click subscribe, lots of love and I'll see you next video.

Company0:00
What's going on, everybody?
I'm bringing some more books, but I wanted to say that, if you haven't checked out Hunter million-dollar offers, I would definitely suggest that you start there.
I've gotten some solid feedback and it couldn't be happier with its.
Number one ranking on Amazon for direct marketing and over 5,000, five star reviews.
So, thank you guys so much for that.
0:15
It's 164 pages.
I really can help you out.
It takes about four hours to get through, check it out.
On Amazon, the Kindle book is 99 Cents.
The audiobook is Lowe's, they'll let me put it on for it, so I think it's 12 bucks.
So enjoy that and let's start the podcast.
Do you think about them?
Is all the friends that I have that are worth 300 million, 500 million, a billion plus they think about it differently.
0:34
And so, if I can change your perspective around it, you'll realize that most of the things that most people obsess about, actually don't matter.
Welcome to the game, where we talk about how to get more customers, how to make more per customer and how to keep them longer and the many failures and lessons, we have learned along the way.
I hope you enjoy and subscribe in this video.
0:50
I want to talk to you about the Tax Strategies of the ultra-wealthy.
And I want to make this.
Because as somebody who is ultra-wealthy, I look at a lot of the videos that I see that are propagating around YouTube, from people who are not Ultra-wealthy, describing ultra-wealthy strategies despite not being so, and doing it based on what they believe they're doing, rather than what people are actually doing.
1:06
And so, I want to use this video as a way to, at least break your beliefs around tax readies, overall, rather than give you the individual tax, things that may change over time, little text, you know, hacks but instead if you can shift your the way that that you're thinking about taxes and shift the weight to the ultra-wealthy, do think about them because all the friends that I have that are worth 300 million, 500 million, a billion plus they think about it differently.
1:29
Lee.
And so if I can change your perspective, around it, you'll realize that most of the things that most people obsess about actually don't matter.
Cool.
So the first thing right off the bat is where you live.
So your where you live is going to affect your your tax tragedy.
Simply because at least, for us residents, the state that you live in, has a certain tax rate and the country itself at a federal level has a certain tax rate.
1:53
So number one strategy, rests atop is live in a tax, efficient State, all right?
And so I would recommend I think there's Seven or eight states that are zero income tax.
You should live in those States right now.
The next level below that is is getting out of the United States and so there's only two ways to avoid taxes in the US one is that you stop being a u.s. resident?
2:17
Meaning, you become an expatriate, you renounce, your citizenship, which obviously has some ramifications.
You actually have to pay taxes on everything you owned at that point, as though, you had sold all your belongings.
So you basically pay capital gains on everything you own.
On that day.
So, for example, for me, if I were to expatriate, I would have to pay taxes on the worth of all of my companies.
2:35
Despite not having sold those companies and so it's like if I have to.
So if you think about it, like if you're in most of like my net worth, for example, is in my company's and so I would have to pay the taxes on all of the value of all of the companies that have with the liquid assets that I have available to me, which would be, you know, almost bankrupt Lee.
2:55
So without the money, right?
So I could probably raise dead or do some sort of thing but anyways, they do it on purpose.
They don't want people do it, but if you don't have a lot of net worth and you want to grow outside, you can do that.
So that is totally a strategy.
The second and only other strategy besides that is living on an island.
3:11
So Puerto Rico has a 4% tax rate.
You can if you choose to live in Puerto Rico for six months or more of the year and you Source Services outside of the unit of Puerto Rico, you can pay it for percent tax rate at a federal level.
That also works in USVI, US Virgin Islands.
There's a little bit, there's a lot more Hoops.
3:28
You have to jump through.
You have to become Professor there.
You have to have at least 10 people who work for you and the island that are originals from the island.
It can't be people who you transport transplanted over there and they do that because they want to boost those economies.
They want to make attractive for people who have money to go there.
Alright.
So those are the only two strategies but you might be thinking, okay?
3:46
Well, you know, Alex, why are you not in Puerto Rico, if you didn't have to pay income tax?
And for perspective, I paid eighteen million dollars in income tax.
The last three years.
So like it hurts.
But the thing is I've had so many conversations with the the internet entrepreneurs of the world, who are like men.
4:05
I'm moving to Puerto Rico.
Why aren't you moving to Puerto Rico?
And I think that, you know, decreasing, your tax liability, make sense a little bit in the beginning of your career, but it quickly stops making sense.
Because most of us, at least for me.
I wanted to make money to live where I wanted to live and have the freedoms that money provides, right?
4:25
And so I think what it sometimes does is puts the cart before the horse and says I want to to make money so that I can have freedom.
And yet now I'm going to become a prisoner to my money by not by relinquishing my freedom to live, where I want to live, so that I can have more money.
And so, in some ways, it kind of becomes a backwards equation and we make money the objective, rather than the things that money gives us because in and of itself money has no value money.
4:46
Only has value in that we exchange it for other things and so if I want to exchange it for Freedom, why would I exchange freedom for money?
So think about that for a second.
And so that's for me why I'm not moving to Puerto Rico at least anytime soon.
I don't think I am unless Make a video if I do, and I change my mind, I'll tell you what.
5:03
But that is that has been my reasoning around that.
Now, if you're below, you know, three, four, five million dollars, it does make sense.
But the thing is, is if very quickly stops making sense, because once you have quote enough, money enough passive Revenue, that's coming into you.
Then it doesn't make sense to give up your freedom in order to or like continue to give up your freedom of living where you want to live.
5:23
Now, if you like love Islands or you at least you've convinced yourself that you love violence because you actually like money more, then that's fine.
You don't know me.
But that is that is the first tech strategy around this.
Now, the reason that I say this doesn't matter is because if you plug in your wealth into like a retirement calculator, and you say, I want to retire at x amount of money, right?
5:44
If you plug it in what it'll show, you is, how much you've contributed to the the amount of money that you grow over time.
And then how much of the net worth that you have to the end of your life or by XD is going to be based on growth.
Here's what's interesting given the Money.
6:00
I have now I have a lot of money, right?
And despite that when I plug, what I have into the calculator with me, contributing millions of dollars a year to it, the vast majority of the growth.
Still comes from compound interest, it comes from growth of the assets itself from the wealth itself growing.
6:16
So here's what's interesting, this is what the wealthy realize they realize that all of their net worth is going to come from this, not from this.
And so, this grows tax-free.
So it doesn't matter because we're You want to make your money is how you use the money, what you buy, right?
6:33
So if I buy something that's worth $100 and I buy it for $30, then I instantly tripled my money, right?
But here's the cool part, that tripling of my money, I don't pay taxes on and that's where the vast majority of this growth comes from.
It comes from tax-free growth and it comes from, not thinking short-sighted and thinking that have to buy and flip and flip and flip and flip, which is short-term, right?
6:52
The wealthiest people in the world, think, on multiple decades Horizons.
They don't think in these in these months, 6 months, 1 year.
Your type type Horizons.
Even five-year.
Horizons are short for the vast majority of very wealthy people that I know.
Real quick guys.
7:08
If you can think about how you found this podcast, somebody probably tweeted it told you about it.
Should it on Instagram or something like that?
The only way this grows is through word of mouth and so I don't run ads, I don't do sponsorships, I don't sell anything.
My only ask is that you continue to pay it forward to whoever showed you or however you found out about this podcast that you do the exact same thing.
7:27
So if it was a review if it was a post, if you do that would mean the world to me and you throw some good karma out there for another entrepreneur.
And so that kind of leads me naturally to the third bullet here which is how / if you sell the only reason, you know capital gains in these other things will affect you is if you sell.
7:47
But if you buy with the intention of holding for a very long period of time were holding until you die, then you aren't affected by any of these tax things, right.
And that's the thing is that everyone thinks so short term, the people with the most money the world realize that life is long and realize that if they just continue to do the game, compound interest becomes an asset time becomes an asset instead of a liability.
8:06
Right?
And the tax structure is built for this, right?
So the goal is that you can plow is to decrease how much you spend and how much you live plow as much as you can into things that are where you buy below, what it's worth and then let it continue to grow and never sell it.
8:23
And here's what's cool about this.
He's kind of the fourth Point P.
So this is the fancy stuff and there's tons of like little things.
You know, there's 1031 exchanges.
Who knows how long that's going to be a round which is basically you can buy a piece of Real Estate and then sell sell it and then take the gains from that and put into another piece of real estate that the same without paying taxes.
8:40
Candidly.
I think it's a complete farce.
It's ridiculous that they let people do that.
But I mean, well, obviously take advantage of it as long as they do, but I can't sell my business and then take my money and put into another business and not pay taxes.
It's just this weird loophole for one thing which definitely was lobbyists doing their job.
8:57
So I guess, but the other thing that also, what people realize is that you can create these assets right now, You can take loans against the assets and Loans are tax-free and loans that you can sit against assets are secured loans.
9:12
They are not unsecured loan.
So in a secured loan, you can typically get very, very, very low interest rates on.
So like for me, I can I can get loans against my assets for about one to one and a half percent which is crazy low, right?
It's essentially free money and so that's exactly what it is.
And so I can continue to plow my money into these things.
9:29
They grow at a disproportionate rate tax free and then I can take loans against those things to live on, right?
And that is what the ultra wealthy friends.
That I know they don't sell their things, they take loans against them as they've grown and so if your assets grow by, let's say 10% a year and you have 10 million dollars in assets, you don't sell the assets to fund your lifestyle.
9:47
You take a loan against the assets and you lose use the loan money and that is how you live.
And so the Tax Strategies of the ultra-wealthy are realizing that the little hacks and stuff are not the game, right?
The game is understanding that you're going to buy things below what they're worth, and then you're not going to sell them because they're going to grow tax free.
10:05
As long as you don't sell them and that becomes the strategy.
Sure.
If you have something like if you're if you're good in real estate and you can do the 1031 exchanges.
Absolutely use it.
You know what I mean?
But you can also buy something.
Hold it and then you can refinance it and suck the money back out and buy something else again tax-free.
10:23
And so that's those, that's kind of the big picture perspective that I think it, most people don't understand about the ultra-wealthy is that they're just not even playing the game that people think they are, everyone's thinking that they're playing Putt-Putt with these six inch things and doing All these little hacks of, you know, captive insurance and easements and things like that.
10:39
And, and honestly, sure some of those things are a little sketchy, they get flipped back and forth by the IRS.
A good friend of mine, I was like, hey, you should do this captive thing with me, I looked at it and I was like, I don't know.
I mean, I guess it makes sense on paper but it smelled fishy and guess what?
The IRS audited, everyone who worked with that company.
10:57
It's just not worth it to me, right?
And so if you can think in the big buckets, all of the net worth of the wealthiest people in the world comes from here.
Yeah.
Here it's not because they're fancy with their Tax Strategies, it's because they're understanding that they're not even playing the tax game.
11:14
And so if you give up and this is one that I heard from a couple buddies of mine who are doing the Puerto Rico thing, there's nothing wrong with that.
Is that they're like, hey man 40% you know, adds up when you compounds.
Well yeah but so does also the other 60% that is compounding you know what I mean?
11:30
And so no matter what you do the extra 40 percent is like the the it's Just 40 percent more.
So if I, if I die and I never lived in Puerto Rico and I die and I have a billion dollar net worth.
I could have had a 1.8 billion dollar net worth if I had lived in Puerto Rico because 100% of that money that I would have saved over that time but it's not like you're going to 10x your net worth because of that, you increase your net worth by the proportion.
11:53
That the tax agency, which is 40%.
And so that is the idea.
And so just big picture, like if you look at your own income and again, I said in the beginning, this makes sense because that is the difference between having Million dollars in ten million dollars is significant that is between having, you know, Thirty million dollars and sixty million dollars.
12:11
Or different mean 100 and 200 million dollars.
Basically makes no difference.
And so for me I'm not willing to sacrifice where I want to live in the freedoms.
That I supposedly started this journey for which is the freedom to do, X, Y, and Z.
But I will tell you this, as the, my freedom Journey has continued to evolve.
12:29
Now that I have the freedom to do all of XYZ things, I think the best all the best thing that I've thought of.
Recently in this came from a book that I just read is that it shifts to freedom from because at the end of the day, money can only solve many problems.
And most of the problems that we saw for us humans are not money problems.
12:47
So as much as I tell you all of these things, I do that with the intention that you get to the point that you realize that it really won't change your life very much.
It'll just solve the problems that money can solve and then you will be left with all the problems that money doesn't solve, which is two-thirds of the problems in life, which are usually health and happiness.
13:02
And so, any hope that hope you got value from this?
That keeping awesome.
Maybe I'll do a breakdown of kind of our wealth strategy in the the stuff that we do.
There's some cool whole life things that you can put in here where you can contribute money into something that has guaranteed income.
That you can take loans against kind of that fancy stuff and I'll do that in another video, but I hope you got value from this subscribe and I'll see you next video.








0:00
Real quick.
Because you guys already know that, I don't run any ads on this and I don't sell anything.
And so, the only ask that I can ever have you guys that you help me spread the word so we can have more entrepreneurs, make more money, feed their families, make better products, and have better experiences for their employees and customers.
And the only way we do that is if you can rate and review and share this podcast, so the single thing that I have to do is you can just leave review will take you 10 seconds or one type of the thumb, mean, the absolute world to me.
0:25
And more importantly, it may change the world of someone else.
Quitting.
My job was the hardest entrepreneurial decision of my entire life.
So rewind and fully years ago, I was sitting on my balcony.
I was 22 years old and I was staring out over this condo that I had purchased because the job that I had paid me.
0:42
Well and I was looking over the city of Baltimore.
And I thought to myself is this it welcome to the game where we talk about how to get more customers, how to make more per customer and how to keep them longer in the many failures and lessons.
We have learned along the way.
I hope you enjoy and subscribe.
Quitting.
My job was the hardest entrepreneurial decision of my entire life.
1:00
So rewind and fully years ago, I was sitting on my balcony.
I was 22 years old and I was staring out over this condo that I had purchased because the job that I had paid me.
Well and I was looking over the city of Baltimore and I thought to myself is this it and this was a rock top and Rock Bottom moment for me specifically, because at that time, I had graduated in three years from Vanderbilt mad cum laude.
1:24
I was president of all these things.
While I was at school, I got a good consulting job and I'd saved almost 50 thousand dollars at that point in my life.
And I had this condo that was increasing in value and I saved pretty much everything - my mortgage and I was like as I was looking out there, all I could think to myself, was how I hated my life and how I hated my job.
1:46
And I just didn't, I felt so empty inside.
And I was so depressed that I really every day, I would consider as I was driving, like, what if I wanted to To the other lane and just like things would end.
And so that was like my actual reality.
And so that's called passive ideation, which is like, I'm not saying that I would want to, you know, kill myself.
2:05
But I if I died and didn't wake up tomorrow, I wouldn't be upset and that was kind of the existence that I live for two years of my life and it was very hard time for me and so I don't know if where you're at in your entrepreneurial Journey but I kind of wanted to answer one of the questions that I get most frequently itches you know when should I quit and start my own business?
2:22
And so I think a lot of it depends on you specifically in self-awareness.
Talk about skill set in a second but I want to talk about the mindset.
First me quitting, my job was the single hardest decision that I've ever made in my entire life.
And I mean that genuinely it was the hardest decision that I've made.
2:38
It took me six months to do it and I listen to Arnold's rules of success speech.
Every morning when I wake up about, you know, it's okay to fail and I had to keep saying this stuff because I was so out really driven?
I was so status driven that I didn't want to take the risk of being seen as a failure.
2:54
And so it only Was when I was literally confronted with my own, you know, the fact that I was really not even willing to be alive anymore is one.
That was kind of my jogging to awaken this moment where I was like, you know what, if I'm willing, if I'm not, even if I don't even want to be alive, any more than what's worse than that?
3:11
And so that was what ultimately shot me on the trajectory to, you know, quit that job.
Sell the condo, put everything that I had in my car, and I drove across the country in 36 hours to California, which is where I thought the land of Fitness opportunity would be.
Now mind you, I was a Management Consultant.
Did space are burn intelligence for the military at a subcontractor at Booz Allen.
3:30
If you familiar with that consulting firm and we and that's what I did for two years.
And it sounds really cool and sexy but it was not at all for me and I really did not enjoy it.
But I learned some valuable lessons like how to learn while I was there.
And so I think that what most people you know it really depends on who you are and understanding your skill set and honestly and how much pain you're in.
3:51
And so there's also different ways to satisfy that paint, I think true to my core Or if I had been in a different company or I was working on different projects at that time of my life, I probably would have never quit.
It was so hard for me and I didn't have a wife.
4:07
I didn't have kids, I had zero dependents and I lived on nothing and it was still one of the hardest decisions in my life because I'm very risk-averse.
So, believe that most entrepreneurs, you know, a lot of people talk about how they, you know, they didn't do well in school and you know, teachers never understood them.
They always knew they had to go out on their own.
I never had any of that.
4:23
I worked really hard in school.
I did really well in school.
Teachers like me for the most part and, you know, I got a good job afterwards.
And so, I did not have the traditional entrepreneur journey and it was only because I was so sad.
Deeply depressed in that time, my life and felt so empty, that I actually made the job.
4:39
And so, I think the first thing is like, one, is there one, are you?
Are you incredibly sad?
Are you credibly dissatisfied with your life?
So much that you be willing to uproot and change?
Number one number two, entrepreneurship is not easy.
And so, if you need, I think, Elon Musk said this on a clubhouse meeting I just think it's so true.
4:57
People are like, what was the motivation?
Would you get for a new entrepreneur?
If you need motivational quotes, or motivational words than entrepreneurship isn't for you?
And I tend to agree with him, like if you need that motivation, like it is one of the loneliest paths period.
You know, at least in co-workers, you have other people who are around you, you can.
5:15
But when you start on your own, you're starting at zero with no one and basically no one is rooting for you.
I mean it depends on like for me when I left like no one really supported me my parents thought I was stupid.
Bit.
And that's a stupid idea.
I was throwing my education away and I was risking everything to go started.
5:31
Jim Wright, which is really not even that good of a return on investment.
You know what I mean?
But I was so committed to the fact that I was so miserable that I was like, at least I can just live my life doing something that I enjoy.
I don't even care if I make money and that was literally the mindset that I was able to quit with.
And so I'd again, I don't know where you're at, but the first piece of this is understanding short and long-term payoffs.
5:52
I did not make a significant amount of money for years after I quit my job.
All right, so I say for the first four years, I essentially broke even and made less money than I did as gets home.
All right?
So like, think about that for a second right now.
There's a lot of mistakes.
I made two and you're going to make them as well because none of us is perfect.
6:10
There's so many skills that you have to, like, you have to acquire so many skills to run a business, right?
And so, you may have a single job right now.
And you are, you were doing one specific function of one specific sub Department of a business.
But in order to be an entrepreneur, you have to understand all of it right in order to be a successful.
6:26
Twitter.
So you have to understand how to generate demand you have to generate understand how to generate leads.
You have to understand how to work leads, have to understand how to sell.
You have to send, how to fulfill and deliver and how to manage people.
How to communicate, how to relay expectations, how like how to recruit how to hire, how to interview like there's so many things that you have to learn and I don't want that to be overwhelming.
6:44
I just want to confront you with reality because honestly, if I knew how hard it was going to be when I started my first business, I don't know if I would have done it, I just forced myself into a hole and I always Like to say this is you'd be surprised what you can accomplish when you have no choice, right?
6:59
And as dark and morbid is I'm going to as what I'm going to say is and don't get triggered by this.
But like the fact that an entire race in our country was enslaved, for hundreds of years and was still able to do that.
Every day, shows the strength of the human spirit and what is possible, and you have no choice.
7:15
And so I think that to juxtapose what I said about how hard it is, if you can put yourself in a position where you have no choice, you will be successful, right?
If you want to succeed, as bad as you can breathe, you will be successful.
Cessful.
And so I think that was the situation where I was and where I was I knew that the alternative to what I was doing was death for me and so it was just anything is better than this.
7:36
And honestly the next you know, year of my life even after that was still incredibly hard but it was different but it was still incredibly hard.
Hey guys, love that you're listening to the podcast.
If you ever want to have the video version of this which usually has more effects more visuals, more graphs, you don't drawn out stuff, sometimes it can help hit the brain centers in different ways.
7:58
You can check out my YouTube channel.
It's absolutely free.
So check that out if that's what you are into and if not keep enjoying the show, And so, just to give you a couple of stats on this that I think I think everyone should have data to make decisions its proper expectations.
8:15
Right?
So the average so this is according to small business administration.
The median scuse me, the median income of a small business owner, 49 thousand dollars a year so I don't know what you're making right now but this is what the middle of the small business ownership makes.
Now you might be making more than that.
8:31
There are people who are number 30 at Google who make away more than this right and there So you have to understand kind of where you sit on the hierarchy and there are some people who would be so much better served.
There are so many of my ex-employees, who ended up going out on their own and I don't think many of them make more than they did when they were with us and they probably have more stress.
8:50
And that's okay, that was their choice.
And there are trade-offs, you make for Freedom.
Right there are trade-offs, right?
Risk and reward.
There are both of those things in the aspect of this decision.
All right, now as opposed to say average, sorry.
Now, if you're curious, what's the average small business owner make?
According the SBA Seventy-three thousand dollars a year.
9:08
Now, averages are skewed because there's top-end people that move that average up.
So that should say average sorry.
But medians 49, that means that the most likely most repeated outcome is forty-nine thousand dollars a year which is pretty much the median household income of the United States, kind of interesting and then the average is 73 thousand so it depends on where you're at and how to satisfied you are.
9:27
And so the first thing is are you dissatisfied because you don't like the company you work for or are you just asking because you don't like the work you do now both of those have solutions that are out outside of starting your own business, right?
You can just go and find a different position and learn on someone else's dollar which is I think is so wildly under underappreciated like go to a company that you like and learn and get paid to learn.
9:50
That's amazing right?
Like because you're not gonna learn anything at school, that's going to be useful for business, right?
So if you want to be an entrepreneur, you have to learn these things in the real world.
And so going and getting paid to learn is one of the best things you can possibly imagine.
You just have to understand that what you're getting paid for is not going to be your income for life.
10:06
Literally you getting paid to learn how to do something, which is amazing.
I did not have that.
I literally went from making money to starting to learn everything from scratch and I and it was very difficult for me.
All right.
Now the, the piece here about shortened short-term versus long-term.
10:21
If you make this decision, expect a three four, maybe five year, decrease in income, right?
You're not going to make as much money for the first few years, right?
And then maybe, if you are successful and you re investing yourself new Grown, you acquire skills and beliefs and attitudes.
Character traits, then you will be able to have the long-term payoff, but entrepreneurship is the ultimate value investment in yourself, right?
10:44
And so again, there are lots of people who don't have the risk tolerance for that and that is okay.
The vast majority of people should not be entrepreneurs, right?
The second thing in terms of the choices, right in the beginning, its do I need to switch companies?
That's if I don't like what I'm doing.
Sorry, if I don't like the company, I'm working for.
Number two is, do I need to switch what I'm doing and get paid to learn, which is a second alternative to quitting your position.
11:05
Number three, Is if I like what I'm doing and I like the company am I just not getting paid enough.
Well, then talk to them and see how you can provide more value.
Do not ask, I would like to get paid more say, how can I provide more value?
If you ask that question, any smart business owner, be able to tell you exactly to provide more value, so that you can make more in a low-risk environment.
11:26
All right.
And then, the fourth way you can do this, if you're considering quitting is start investing all of your extra time in acquiring, the other skills and start actually.
We doing it.
Spend some money on a marketing.
Do some Outreach.
Do those types of things to generate demand for your business.
11:42
Now in the beginning it's going to be a side Hustle.
But over time it can grow and then at a certain point it will grow in excess of what you are currently making and then you can make the jump.
I did not do that.
What I did was candidly very stupid and I got lucky.
I got very lucky, I got extraordinarily lucky that.
I had people who were able to speak into my life at an early time point.
12:00
I was able to learn from experts, very, very quickly, which candidly I invested in that.
I paid all of my Savings that I'd saved up the fifty thousand dollars was gone within the first three months of me starting entrepreneurship gone because I paid for mentorship.
I paid for coaching programs and I bought and I reinvested in gym, which I shouldn't have done, I shouldn't have opened it the way I did because I didn't know any better, right?
12:21
And so, the biggest issue, your biggest risk.
When you start on your own is that you don't know what you're doing, right?
And so the idea is, if you can decrease, your downside Risk by learning more skills, getting paid to learn them, asking how your business, how you can provide more value, which will allow you to learn more skills and get paid more as you do it, right?
If you do all of those things.
12:36
Things and after doing all those steps, you still are not satisfied.
Then be willing to take the risk and make the short-term trade off that you're going to make less for period of time.
And so this is why I'm so such a big believer in In Living cheap, Right, Live cheap and keep your expectations at cheap.
12:53
So that if your your income does drop, you're still not losing money.
And then long-term, you can keep reinvesting in yourself, so that you as the valuable asset can become more valuable and then increasing your earning potential and by extension, because of the skills, you learn, Earn your business.
All right?
And so to answer the question, when do you when you couldn't start a business?
13:11
It depends on who you are and where you're at in your life.
There are lots of other steps you can do before that, like switch a company.
So it's the job ask.
If you can do things that are making more valuable.
Start the side, hustle first.
Then start making sure that it works if you like it before, betting everything on it.
13:26
And then finally, if none of those things work for you, then at that point, I would say, okay, if you have reasonable means that you've saved up, you have a vehicle that, you know, is tested, you know, other people who are doing that specific thing and you can do it, then I would say, by all means, but I think that I made a lot of stupid decisions and candidly, I think I got really lucky.
13:46
And so that is, that is the long-winded answer to this question, which is, when, when do you when you quit?
At your own business.
It depends on you.
I can't give you a perfect answer because I don't know who you are but those are the Frameworks that I'd be thinking of and these are the expectations that I would set in understanding the reason the average 25 year-old.
14:04
I heard from my neighbor thinks that they're going to be sorry.
The average 18 year old senior in high school when surveyed believes that they will be a millionaire by age 25.
How ridiculously unreasonable is that they believe this is the average right believes that they're going to be in the top 1% within seven years of graduating high school.
14:24
Well, let's be real here.
Do we think that that is a reasonable expectation?
No, so if you believe that the stats are against, you doesn't mean I'm saying, I don't believe in you.
I believe in you 100%.
I'm your biggest fan.
But understand that these are the actual expectations of what this means.
14:41
All right, I remember when I quit my job and I found out what the top gym owners were making and I remember literally, my first thought was that's it.
And so you have to understand that there's there's the hullabaloo of Revenue, which I made another video about measuring value.
Lots of people talk, big numbers, not a lot of people make big numbers.
14:59
Most people are broke.
And the reason I have this channel is to make sure that you are not one of them.

Real quick guys.
If you can think about how you found this podcast, somebody probably tweeted it told you about it.
Should it on Instagram or something like that?
The only way this grows is through word of mouth and so I don't run ads, I don't do sponsorships, I don't sell anything.
I only ask is that you continue to pay it forward to whoever showed you or however you found out about this Pockets that you do the exact same thing.
0:19
So if it was a review if it was a post, if you do that would mean the world to me and you throw some good karma out there for another entrepreneur.
In this video, I'm going to show you the seven ways to measure business value and and how you're probably being deceived by most people you see on the internet simply because you're not understanding The Words In terms they are using.
0:37
All right, so by the end of this video, you'll understand who's BS, who's legit, who's real, who's fake.
And if they haven't given you enough information, to make the decision, exactly what questions to ask, welcome to the game, where we talk about, how to get more customers, how to make more per customer and how to keep them longer in the many failures and lessons.
We have learned along the way.
0:53
I hope you enjoy and subscribe in this video.
I'm going to show you the seven ways to measure business value and how Probably being deceived by most people you see on the internet simply because you're not understanding The Words in terms of theory using, all right?
So by the end of this video, you'll understand who's BS, who's legit, who's real, who's fake.
1:11
And if they haven't given you enough information, to make the decision, exactly what questions to ask.
All right, so let's dive in.
So, the first of the, seven types of ways that people measured value is that they will extrapolate a single month of contract value into eternity or at least over a year.
And so, for example, what that looks like is someone, you know, selling Being a yearly contract at an event, they sell 100 people at that event.
1:34
Let's say for thirty thousand dollars a year, right?
And they say we're doing three million dollars a month.
Wow right crazy but the reality is they sold three million dollars of contracts that are unenforceable to people on, monthly income streams are monthly, cash flow and so 100 people at twenty-five hundred dollars a month is what will get you to that thirty thousand dollars, right?
1:58
Roughly And so if you were really means is they did 250,000 dollars that that event, but they said I'm doing three million dollars a month, right?
Even though it was a one-time event, that is not going to recur, and they based it on Contra value, contract value, and not payments collected.
2:17
And so the first way to see through this stuff, is to say, well, how much money was actually collected and how reliable are the contracts that you're actually selling.
If you have highly, you know, secured contracts with companies that are legit or your have them secure.
Gets assets.
Meaning that the likelihood that they continue is high or you have a net negative turn company, meaning the contract increases in value, over time, based on the business economics that you have like Salesforce.
2:39
For example, when you sign a contract with Salesforce, you signed a contract with HubSpot which is another CRM, most of those clients increase how much they spend over time and so that would be legit in that instance.
But the vast majority of people who are saying this to, you are not being legit.
And so, first thing to look out for at the very end, I'll give you my rating for each of these ways of doing it.
2:58
All right?
The Second is Lifetime Revenue.
So this is when someone says, you know, we've done x amount of total revenue collected in our business.
A lot of times they say, I have a, I mean, I see an ad right now, all that, I run all the time.
It's like how I built a 50 million dollar business.
But they mean, how much revenue they've collected over the lifetime of the business.
3:18
And so, for context of how ridiculously inflated, this will be a McDonald's employee will collect a million dollars in Revenue as income as honestly.
That's even better because it's income, it's not In Revenue, but like just to show you how ridiculous and Preposterous this is a McDonald's employee will collect that over the entire life.
3:35
So if you were to McDonald's or whole life, right?
And so, if you, if you use this metric, then it's incredibly inflating and it's great for ego, and it sounds good to impress people who don't know what you're talking about.
Okay.
And so you may have seen one of my videos to said 122 million in revenue for me.
3:52
And I do that a because the headline is more compelling than saying, you know, we've done mid-30s for the last three or four years, but And, you know, I'll play the game too but understanding what that comes from.
And so that's why I try to be as honest, as possible.
Like, well, this is what we did in Revenue.
That's what we did in profit so that I can just be transparent with everybody.
4:09
So, you know, at least what to look for.
And so when someone says we have a 50 million dollar business or 100 million dollar business, ask them, are you talking about yearly Revenue?
Are you talking about profit?
Like, what are you talking about specifically?
When you say that number, right?
And a lot of times we like well I meant I guess that's how much, you know, total revenue we've done.
4:28
You know, since we started now You most entrepreneurs, especially new entrepreneurs will conflate or or they will mix Revenue with cash collected, right?
Those are two very different things, right?
Revenues is is contract value, right?
But cash collected is really reality and so they'll use this term and for the purpose of this video, when I say Revenue, I mean, cash collected.
4:49
What was processed and received by the business?
So the second way that people describe their values, how much total revenue, the donor lifetime?
So you may actually have seen, you can see this I work on over here.
I got four doing 100 million or passing 100 dollars in total revenue in three years, three and a half years.
5:07
I think, since we started with clickfunnels, which is software for, with that, we use for landing pages, and they recognize the people were top performers.
All right?
But again, that's Revenue.
Like, it doesn't mean every means cash collected.
But it doesn't mean that like we're doing that per year.
5:22
Now, this year is a breakout year and I'll tell you what we do at the end of this year because we will be close to that number.
I don't think we'll cross 100 million this year but We're will be really close.
So, anyways, number three is business valuation.
So this one is one where it's based on the market value of the business if it were sold.
5:41
So this is another way of kind of inflating, the business that you have.
Now, this isn't necessarily an unfair way of valuing a business, right?
Based on its own value.
But the thing is, is it all depends on?
Who's the one who's described in the value?
What are they, what are they using to?
Create that value?
I hear all the time logo.
5:56
I think I'm gonna be able to get 15 times Top Line.
You don't know squat, right?
The market will pay with the market will pay, all right?
And so for most businesses that are small businesses, so anything that's under 5 million dollars a year in Revenue.
Most of those guys are getting two to three times ibadah which is another measurement of get to in a second, which is the earnings before interest tax and motivation and appreciation.
6:20
Right?
And so those are those are business metrics.
That is going to have a multiple ascribe to it.
So if you're a mid-market, which Like 10 to 100 million dollars in Revenue per year, then you might have a six to eight times multiple, if you get above a hundred million dollars than a lot of times, you can get into the, you know, twelves 15s Etc.
6:40
And most of the time that's done on ibadah in a very, very, very rare number of circumstances, will they do it on top line revenue, alright, and that is in a fast growth company that has high amounts of capital.
They need to be reinvested in it, that they believe are going to give it a strategic Advantage for high gross profits in the future, that the reinvesting capital into.
6:58
All right?
And so, That is where, you know, I saw somebody recently saying that they had, you know, they sold their business for 100 times ibadah, right?
What that really means is that, like, in this is where this is what I want everybody to watch this video to be thinking, well, either they had a really really crazy business or more likely.
They were making almost no profit in their business and just got a high valuation because of or not even necessarily a high valuation, if they if they're doing, you know, ten thousand dollars a year in profit on a 5 million dollar business, then if they sell for, you know, five million dollars, they get 500 times.
7:30
Even though which is ridiculous, right?
But people do that because it sounds impressive, right?
So that's why we're, that's why we're going through this.
You can cut through the BS and hopefully get better sources of information, which is kind of my goal here is that you can measure.
You can measure other entrepreneurs value, based on the True Value that they've been providing.
7:45
All right?
So the next one, here is yearly Revenue.
All right, so this is how much revenue a business is doing yearly.
Now, we're getting a little bit closer to reality here.
Now, again, Revenue versus cash collected, it depends on the type of business.
If you have a service business, it's based on recurring, revenue, and contracts then.
Going to have contracts that are factored into that.
8:01
If you had an e-commerce business, for example, just purely transactional, then the revenue and cash lecture to be very close to each other, right?
And so and, you know, Revenue would also not take into account refunds chargebacks things like that.
Which then gets into net revenue.
I won't get into it.
There's a zillion terms and just as a side note here, the reason there are so many terms is because measuring value is something that is one of the hardest aspects of investing in business in general, is that people want to figure out what is this thing worth.
8:27
And so that's why they have lots of different metrics that they look at.
And so for you, As a as a clean entrepreneur investor or, you know, person who wants to grow within the business World understanding all of these metrics and how they work together to to assess or get as close to True Value.
As possible is are these are going to be Tools in your in your skill set and some of these are better than some of these are worse and I'll get to my ratings in a second.
8:47
All right, so yearly revenues the next one's just, how much are you doing every year in terms of top-line right now the next one is is profit or even it.
Now these two things are not necessarily the same but I'm going to say you been Beating earnings before interest taxes, depreciation and amortisation, right?
9:04
For most businesses.
This is where coming back to the business valuation.
If you're mid-market, you're getting six to eight.
If you're kind of smaller than your at, you know, two to three sometimes four if you're doing really well or you have some sort of competitive advantage and so anything and any sound soft you in terms of those numbers.
9:19
But the reality is that a lot of people just look at the the outliers which catch all the news in the Press but most businesses every are, you know, businesses are sold every day at 1X 2x 3x.
But up all the time, just no one wants to talk about, right?
And so this is even closer to reality.
9:36
So if I'm looking at a business owner or somebody's trying to posture with me, right?
The eggplant measuring contest of of Entrepreneurship, they're going to.
If they're starting to talk to me about these numbers, I'm like, hey, bro, like what are we doing?
Bottom line, right?
What are we doing?
Bottom line per year, this is what I want to know, right?
Hey guys real quick for those of you guys who are 100 million-dollar offers fans I love you.
9:58
I added in a lost chapter that has never been released.
I'm releasing it now transparently.
I'm doing that to build hype 400 dollar leads but you will have the unreleased chapter, it talks about your first Avatar and how to segment customers to make more money.
You can get it by going to acquisition.com forward slash leads its hope free in exchange for email so that I can email you when we launched under Miller, All Leads and so that you cannot Miss out on it because last time I sold out for like eight straight weeks really fast.
10:24
So that is my way of making sure that y'all get first dibs.
And so that leaves me naturally to the next one, which is okay.
Well, you've got a, you've got certain amount of ibadah that's coming up, but depending on your type of business, you might have to reallocate all that money back into the business to just maintain your competitive Advantage, which Charlie Munger Warren Buffett.
10:44
They talk about how their least favorite type of businesses or businesses.
That require lots of additional Capital right now as they become gazillionaires.
They have to find businesses like that because they have to put their Capital work.
But for the thing that created their wealth was Finding businesses, that did not require a lot of additional Capital that created lots of of survey says, Net free cash flow.
11:03
So how much owner earnings?
How much can you extract from the business?
All right, that's what this NFC fer here is, net free cash flow, right?
And I've talked about this in other videos, but this is after I've reinvested profits in the business to maintain and grow our competitive Advantage.
11:18
How much can I is the owner?
Take out.
The reason this is so important is because a lot of times you're not going to sell a lot of times businesses fail.
There are tons of risk, that's why business.
One of the riskiest things to get into most businesses, do not succeed.
That's just those are the stats, right?
And now, 99 times out of 100, you business.
11:34
Never actually sells you might do an asset sale or a garage sale but doesn't actually sell for what you think it is, which is why for me as an entrepreneur you want to D Risk by extracting cash flow.
And many times, this is one of the values of the business.
And so if I'm talking to an entrepreneur and they tell me this, then I'm going to probably ask, well, what are you big?
What are you taking home?
11:49
An owner earnings, what do you extracting them business?
What are you taking out as dividends because I want to know what's reality, right?
And that leads me to the last and the bottom one here and I'll give you my ratings on these, which is what's your net worth, right?
This is what entrepreneurs.
Is you know everyone's shying away from talking about a lot of guys that you see on your newsfeed.
12:06
Those guys message me and say, hey man, you know, I want to do XYZ, I want to start investing etcetera and they've got half a million dollars to their name and they talk about how they've done ten million dollars in Revenue, right?
Right Lifetime?
And so again you could just I'll give you a funny example for you.
12:23
So if someone says, Hey, we've done a million dollars in Revenue, look at our Ward right?
That's over a total Lifetime, right?
That could be over ten years so he did a million dollars for every 10 years.
We do a hundred thousand dollars a year in Revenue, right?
And if you're doing 50 percent margins on that, right?
12:39
That's a fifty thousand dollar year, owner income business, which is just the median income, the United States, and there's nothing wrong with that, but in terms of taking this person as an authority, I would be Be, I would be hesitant to take their advice because gandil either, they're probably just spending what they're making on living, because if that's how they're trying to position.
12:58
So, just just take that with a grain of salt.
You know what I mean?
And the reason I'm going through this is because I'm the best thing you can do is learn from others, but to make sure that you're actually learning from others, learning from people who are good information sources is important.
And there's tons of people in a way more about business, but I just try to share the stuff that is worked well for us in creating, you know, for me and Try net worth which is over 30 million and there's two aspects of net worth.
13:23
All right, you have your net worth that comes from your investable assets which is what you've extracted right.
We've extracted paid your taxes on and then been able to reinvest in grow and the second is the percentage of the businesses that you own business or businesses that you want, all right?
Which is why having a fair and reasonable valuation is important because what's the true market value of the business that you have now?
13:43
If someone says like my business does like 10 million dollars a year and they do too.
Million dollars of ibadah right?
Two million dollars a year and they're getting a five times multiple on that because it's truly a business and doesn't require their face.
If it requires their face, then they're not going to get that multiple, right?
14:00
So it's important understand these variables that create and measure value in a business.
Because if you're looking for people and you're trying to listen to advice, then make sure you're getting it from the sources that are true and real.
All right.
And so, again, two different ways that that can combine to create a net worth is going to be your after-tax.
14:18
I think you've extracted from the business and be able to reinvest on the side and growing your own, right?
And the percentages of the businesses that you own in the value around them.
All right, so let's get to the good part which is yeah, you're an a, is this something that I'd be looking at, in terms of whether I'm in a value, this person's opinion based on this stat alone survey says contract value.
14:38
No, I would not do that.
And that is because this can be wildly inflated especially if you extrapolate on one month, contract value for the rest of the year.
It can be wildly inflated.
Alright, so number two, lifetime Revenue survey says no, I would not use this as a way of measuring.
14:56
How could someone is at at business because you want to know how long was that was that over 20 years?
Was it over 40 years because that's what I McDonald's employee can earn over that amount of time.
Alright so don't be impressed by this number.
Ask more questions which we which you should hopefully do as we go down this.
15:13
Alright, business valuation survey says yes, but caveat This you want to know, what kind of multiple are you assuming, and what is that off of top line, or bottom line, and why can you defend that, right?
So this is asking good questions, so that you can actually get closer to True Value.
15:28
Which is why all these metrics even exist to begin with so that people want to describe and measure value.
All right, next one, yearly Revenue survey says, Ah, partial answer, because it goes with number five, which is yearly profit.
All right, the difference here.
If someone's doing a hundred million dollars a year in top-line revenue and they're spitting out just a little bit of profit that that may be okay, right?
15:49
If you're doing five hundred thousand dollars a year in profit, I knew a company that those are 20 million a year in profit and 500,000 sir, two million Revenue, 500,000 a year profit they got sold for 168 million right now, that's a super valuable business and it's because the bankers and the people who bought it saw that they had reinvested everything right into growing the business, right?
16:08
And so, understanding the relationship between these two things.
If I have another business is doing five from thousand dollars a year in a million dollars a year in top-line Revenue then it's going to be a far less valuable business.
All right, so Standing that they might be making some strategic decisions about their reinvesting, The Business Etcetera, or some Capital costs that might have cost them but they see what it's going to yield them in the future, Etc.
16:26
All right, now this is especially true with software businesses FYI, all right?
Which that particular business was a software business.
Next one survey says yes, on net free cash flow.
This is Uncle Warren.
This is Uncle.
Charlie Munger.
This is their primary metric for measuring business.
16:44
They try and figure out.
What is the?
Net free cash flow laughter.
I invest everything.
This is an excellent way.
Excellent way to figure out the value of the business, all right?
Because if you can do your net free, cash flow and then you multiply it, then you're going to get very close to what an investor, might be willing to pay for the asset, excluding some sort of crazy.
17:04
Only thing that they're trying to get with some sort of category King you know, situation in a Marketplace.
All right, and then finally net worth, how do we see this on the on the valuing of an entrepreneurs eggplant?
Right?
Survey says yes, I think this is an excellent measure of value because this is what is left.
17:22
After all the chips, all the chips, have fallen.
All the cookies have crumbled, all the roosters have roosted.
This is what's left after everything, right?
Because if you, you know, if you like, I've had 13 businesses And I now own eat more.
So had 21 businesses, right?
So I've had a lot of these things and the thing that remains is you you are not worth as an entrepreneur.
17:42
And if you look at the Inc, 500, sorry, the The Fortune 500 and you look at it. 50 years ago, what you'll see is that there's only two businesses that are still on the, The Fortune 500 from now, from 50 years ago, G, and Ford.
That's it, that's it, right?
And so when you think about that, a lot of times what business becomes is, you create something, and then as an entrepreneur, you want to be able to create a Enough personal wealth throughout the trajectory of the business.
18:06
That's like literally all businesses Fortune, 500 and only two of them, right?
Are still there and so thinking about that, that should hopefully shift your perspective, which is why I'm so big on extracting dividends while the business is growing.
And I know that they might not be as popular in the Silicon Valley world, but a lot of those guys don't live in reality.
18:25
And for the everyday business owners everyday entrepreneurs that are, you know, hustling out there trying to make a buck trying to feed their families.
It's important to D risk because you can't put all your eggs.
In the single basket.
That is my opinion.
Sure, you can bet on yourself, but there are so many more stories of guys, who'd bet everything on themselves at the casino and walked away empty-handed.
18:42
Alright?
And so it is my belief that if you were generating a profit, you should be purposely taking some out every month.
Even though the like for me the vast majority of my net worth is in my business valuations.
Still I still have you know over whatever a lot in investable assets that categorizes Mia's Ultra high-net-worth, all right?
19:00
And so again I'll try not worth just so you know from the definition standpoint Is investable assets.
It's not based on total value.
All right, and so these are the seven ways that I wanted to highlight for measuring value.
If you see someone and they say, I am worth this or my business is worth this.
19:16
I built an x million dollar business.
Ask these questions is that lifetime revenue?
Is that contract value that's been extrapolated?
Is that your business valuation based on?
What multiple is that based on a top-line multiple, or is that based on a bottom-line, multiple, what's the net?
19:31
Free?
Cash flow.
What are you taking out as dividends?
Year and then finally, if someone will share it with you, which I'm actually not that opposed to sharing Network numbers.
I know some people are, I don't really know why I figure if you make enough money over time, people always end up finding out what your net worth is, which is basically the entire Forbes list.
19:48
And so anyways, these are the ways that you measure value.
These are my two second snap judgments on them and if you have if you have your astute cap on and you probably figured out that a lot of these things go together, right?
It's not just one number it's understanding the interplay between them so that you can ascertain.
20:04
Pain with the true value of a business and or the entrepreneur that owns it is.
So hope you found valuable in that hope you find valuable in that.
Hit the Subscribe button if you did and if you didn't the, don't hit the Subscribe button because that's what this is for.
All right, so for you guys, so I hope this was valuable and keeping awesome because bot

Hey guys, love that.
You're listening to the podcast.
If you ever want to have the video version of this which usually has more effects, more visuals, more graphs, you know, drawn out stuff.
Sometimes it can help hit the brain centers in different ways.
You can check out my YouTube channel, it's absolutely free.
Go check that out, if that's what you are into.
0:16
And if not keep enjoying the show in this video, I want to talk about how to close a higher percentage of deals, and how to close more deals overall.
And it's all centered around a single concept, which is the belief continue.
Welcome to the game where we talk about how to get more customers, how to make more per customer and how to keep Keep them longer and the many failures and lessons, we have learned along the way.
0:33
I hope you enjoy and subscribe and then you've got the salesman, who's got his belief bubble, so many people like to think.
0:49
Like do you believe in what you are selling, right?
They asked the question is though it's a binary answer yes.
Or no, I believe, right?
I don't believe but it would be much more accurate to say to what extent do you believe in, right?
Because belief Not a binary question.
It is a Continuum it is.
How much do you believe in what you are selling?
1:05
Because if you thoroughly 100% believe with all of your heart and mind that what you are selling is true.
I guarantee you that you will sell significantly more.
And so, what I want to show you these two equations that I wrote down at simple equations for how to actually sell.
And so many people focus, I would say, disproportion amount of people focus on the skill of selling and there absolutely is a skill to sales.
1:25
You have to know exactly what to say.
You have to know how to say, but you can shortcut but that path to success by having conviction.
And the way that you have conviction is by a dramatically, understanding the needs of your prospects, so that when you are talking to somebody, you know exactly what their problem is.
1:43
So that if your product perfectly matches their problem, you can have conviction in order to sell it.
Most sales people don't even listen to the prospect at all, and simply want to deliver their pitch, which inherently means that they can't believe in the product that much because they're not even thinking about.
Whether it solves the problem, The prospect because you can't be convicted that it's going to solve the problem if you don't even know what the problem is.
2:04
And so they haven't taken any time to understand the prospect most sales training should be, is currently focused on.
Educating, salesmen are on the product when it should be most of them most I'm focused on educating the salesman around the Prospect and their problems, not the product.
2:22
Alrighty understanding shift that has to happen when you're educating a sales team and or yourself especially if you're entering a market that you are not the Avatar, right?
One of the reasons that many successful businesses happen from somebody who suffered from a pain and then went to go solve it for themselves and then ended up solving it for other people is because they desperately and they.
2:40
So clearly understand, the thoughts needs and pains of the Prospect and they know how the product solves those problems, right?
And so the first equation here is for increasing closing percentage.
And so if it's you that selling, or if it's a sales team that selling, it's the skill of skip sales multiplied by the extent to which you I believe it is not.
3:01
Yes I believe no, I believe this number can be 100, right?
And the thing is that I believe that this number of conviction can grow far higher than what skill can give you.
You can be a very skilled salesman, but let's say the skill of sales is one to ten, right?
3:17
I'll put this on here, so if you can see it, let's say your skills.
Talents can be 1 to 10.
I believe that your skill your beliefs around, conviction can be 1 to 100, right?
So even if your skill of sales is a to, you can have a hug.
And belief.
And I guarantee you that you will close because people can sense whether you believe what you were telling them is true.
3:37
And they believe that what you were selling them is going to solve their problem, right?
And so most people, most sales teams, most sales managers do not focus enough on this bubble, which is conviction, which is this part of the equation, right?
If you think about what sales is, it's fundamentally a transference of belief and so how can you, how can you transfer, an empty cup?
3:58
How can you transfer a cup that Only one-third full into another, empty cup, and expect it to be over.
The threshold of the amount of belief that's necessary to, and that's required for a prospect to Major.
Make a purchasing decision, of course not right.
And so we still try and get the person to say a certain thing or pausing this way, or have this tonality, or this emphasis in it, that is important, right?
4:18
And there's definitely a place for that.
You have to have the basics of sales in place, but a much much bigger lever that is often and most underutilized unutilized at all.
It's the conviction, or the extent to To which the salesman believes in what they're selling and to what extent it can help solve the prospects problems, all right?
4:37
And so that will influence the closing percentage of an individual or team.
A Mossad agent quick break just to let you know.
We've been starting to post on LinkedIn and want to connect with you.
Alright so send me a connection request.
A note letting me know that you listen to the show and I will accept it.
4:53
There's anyone you think that would be should be connected with tag them in one of my or laila's posts?
And I will give you all the love in the world.
All right?
So, let's get back to the show.
The second piece is going to be the work ethic, right?
So a lot of people have probably seen really good closures versus really bad.
5:10
Closer is based on their closing percentage.
But also total number just close personally when you have somebody who has really high work ethic, then they can make up for a lower closing percentage by having more activity.
So that means that they are following up with their pipeline faster.
They are.
Following up more times right there, reaching out to people on their own, in their own time, to give themselves more opportunities and they can compensate for low closing percentage by Simply Having.
5:34
Or at bats, right?
And so, if you think about the expert salesman is having these two things together, which is you want to have a high closing percentage and you have lots of units, sold, all right?
And so there's three variables here, you've got skill, you've got conviction and you've got work ethic, but conviction, counts twice.
5:49
Because if you believe that what you are selling is genuinely going to help people, you will follow up faster, you will file.
More religiously you will fall off as though you were trying to help someone.
And so let me, let me ask you this question as a good mental thought process, if you could go back and Let's say you could go back in time, five years, and you can talk to yourself and say, Hey, I want you to put 100% of the money that we have right now.
6:12
Mind, you, you kept, you couldn't tell the person that is, you your past self that you are you in the future, right?
So you can't say anything like that, but in this thought experiment and you went back in time and said, hey, we've got this money in the bank account, I want you to put 100% of money into this thing called Bitcoin, right?
I want you put 100% money into something called Amazon.
6:30
I want you put it all of that money into Tesla or whatever, right.
Something that blew up over the last Five years.
All right.
If you were to tell yourself that let's say you were talking to you and you were like I'm good thanks?
Right.
How many times would you follow up with yourself to get yourself to do that thing or do that action?
6:51
Or make that investment a lot?
And it's because you truly believe that it would solve your prospects problem and you have pure conviction that what you were selling them, the investment, the opportunity to whatever it is is 100% going to work.
Think about how you would approach that?
7:07
How many times would you follow up?
How, how convicted would you be when you spoke?
Would you think be focused on the skill of selling?
Or would you be focusing on how true what you say is?
And if you can make that perspective shift and if you're a sales manager and you're trying to manage a sales team, I would implore you to focus way more of your time around the thing that counts twice in the equation of selling and creating great salespeople, which is the belief to which the extent the extent to, which they believe.
7:33
What they are selling and to whom they are selling, then then then then boring with the, with the monotony of the skill which, which don't get me wrong.
It is very important to sell.
There's lots of videos that you've probably heard where I talk about the skill of sales.
But I think when you rate this and you were to in a force multiplication standpoint, I don't think that they equated.
7:52
I don't think they are equivalent, right?
And the proof that I have in this is that if you look at every single religious, you know, movement you are selling something very hard to sell which is a completely new frame of you around the world.
People who believe this many times, they don't train them in the skills of selling.
8:08
They just get them to believe wholeheartedly in what they are selling, right?
And so, if you're salesmen and your sales team are not drinking the Kool-Aid, quite literally of the products that you sell, or the services that you saw, then that is your problem, not, whether or not they are clarifying the problem.
The beginning, now they should because they should be listing and they should believe than what it should make sure that the prospect is is going to be best served by this, right?
8:30
But big picture.
If you fix this, everything else will happen.
I'll tell you.
This is the one last story around this. if you believed wholeheartedly in the, the solution that you are selling, would you not then spend lots of time.
8:47
Honing, your skill, probably because you'd want to help more people because you believe in the thing that you were selling them, right?
You would probably like would you not if you believe in this thing, will hardly follow up as many people as possible.
Be quick to respond because you know how much it's going to change their life probably.
9:02
And so I think that just like, Simonson excess, start with why I believe that the skill of sales is fundamentally a transference of belief and we do need to start with Y for sale.
People because it is not a question of whether or not they believe it is annexed.
It is the question of to what extent do they believe?
9:18
And if you can get that to 100 you will never have problems selling ever again.
So hope you found this valuable.

Lots of love.
I'll see you next video.

Hey guys, real quick.
So Leyland are definitely working on our social media presence.
If you guys haven't noticed and we're just breaking now into LinkedIn.
All right.
It's not as bad as I thought it's actually pretty awesome so far and you guys have been really cool in there and people are sharing our stuff a lot.
So if we aren't connected on LinkedIn, it go ahead and let's connect and let's rock and roll.
0:17
In this video, I want to talk to you about the Tax Strategies of the ultra wealthy.
And as someone who is also healthy, I find it ironic that the vast majority of it is that I see on YouTube are made by people who are not wealthy talking about how the ultra-wealthy do things when they have no transparency with there's actions.
Actually our, it's welcome to the game where we talk about how to get more customers, how to make more per customer and how to keep them longer in the many failures and lessons.
0:37
We have learned along the way.
I hope you enjoy and subscribe to different Tax Strategies to try and figure out.
At least the u.s. system to you know, minimize tax drag and the conclusions that I have are somewhat simple.
0:55
And I want to share this with you so I can hopefully help you avoid a lot of the headaches and pain that I had to go.
During this process and for context, in the last three years, I spent 18 million dollars are paid eighteen million dollars in taxes to the US government and so and happily done.
1:11
So, Uncle Sam.
But what I want to do is rather than talk about the little itty-bitty hacks.
I want to shift your perspective around them because as I looked into many, many, many of these things that are touted as Tax Strategies, most of the times they are, they are just tiny little babies.
1:27
They do not make a significant difference and so if I can shift your Perspective room, this and get you to think the way the ultra-wealthy think about taxes, then I think that'll make a bigger difference in your life than anything else.
Well, alright.
So right off the bat, the first thing is where you live is going to make, you know, the biggest initial difference.
And so, first off in the u.s. at a state level, where you live is going to enter, you can have a zero tax day versus, you know, California to 15 or 16 percent tax state.
1:50
Plus all the other taxes, they tack on everything else you do.
And so, you know, the first and obvious thing to do is you can live in to live in a lower tax state.
Now, the second level of this is what country you live.
And so if you are a u.s. resident, you are you suffer from Global taxation, meaning.
It doesn't matter where you live there going to tax you and so there's only two ways to get around federal tax.
2:11
The first is to live in Puerto Rico, six months of the year and Export services from Puerto Rico.
If that is you can do that.
It's about four percent federal tax rate.
So you can have zero percent State.
Four percent Federal and live there.
It's 100% legit.
It is legal to do that.
The other way to do it is to expatriate.
2:28
Meaning you stop becoming a u.s. resident Didn't you renounce your citizenship as a US citizen and then you come back?
Basically as an alien and the way that you do that is you can become a citizen by investment.
You spend a million dollars in investments into the u.s. and then you get basically a golden Visa which means you pay for it.
2:46
And again, though you have to be here less than you know six months to a year, otherwise you then become a u.s. tax resident again, even if you're not a US citizen and show, so the big conclusion here is in the beginning, you know?
Out of the states that are, you know, the high-tax days move to a state that is lower tax.
3:04
But what I want to do is shift your perspective around this overall big picture.
Because if you look at how your wealth will compound and again this is why I said this is Tech strategies of the ultra-wealthy, the vast majority of your net worth is going to come from growth, not the contributions, okay?
3:19
And so if you plug your money into your, what Your what your retirement calculator, you can Google when they're all over the place.
You'll be able to see that the vast majority of your net worth over time is going to come Um the growth of the assets that are in it, not from the contributions, okay?
And it comes mostly from starting early and so that is why I'm such a big proponent of living on absolutely nothing for as long as humanly possible, so that you can.
3:41
So you can start using the compounding interest of time to your advantage and for perspective for everyone who's listening to this, don't think right now.
I can only put five hundred dollars a month aside, it's not going to make a big difference.
The thing is that $500 a month when you are 20, will make a bigger difference than five thousand dollars a month when you are 45.
3:57
All right, so think about that for prospective.
The dollars now count ten times more than the dollars in ten years and so forth.
Okay, so that's number one.
The second thing that the ultra-wealthy do in terms of tax considerations is that they think differently about how they buy.
So, for example, if I buy something that's worth $100 for $30, I instantly tripled my money except I didn't pay tax on that tripling, right?
4:19
Because the value of what I purchased is worth three times more than what I paid for it.
But the beauty of this is that I get that game without having to pay taxes on it, and then it continues to grow and compound again.
Without Taxation and so, the vast majority of ultra wealthy people understand this and they structure their life in their investments in that way which leads me to the third thing, which is how / if you sell.
4:40
So the only reason that the the tax rate is going to matter to you is if you pay capital gains and that means that you've chosen to sell but there are a lot of strategies around buying and holding you.
Look at Warren Buffett, he's hope he's held See's candy for how, you know, 30, something years or 40 something years.
4:56
Same thing with Coca-Cola, right?
Same thing with Geico.
He continues to buy things.
Hold them because he realizes that the tax treatment is going to be so efficient if you buy correctly.
And so the goal is to think from the perspective of not I'm going to buy and try and flip this.
I'm going to hold this for five years or this company.
What's good for this month is do I think that this thing is going to last for a very long time?
5:15
And if so I will get disproportionate returns by buying safe and buy something that's going to be here in 30 years.
Then trying to buy something sexy now.
And so if you can understand that, then you buy things to hold them for the long term, because the biggest shift in perspective, the ultra-wealthy have versus the not wealthy.
Is that they think in longer time Horizons?
5:31
They think about generational wealth.
They don't think about what I'm going to pay for this month.
How can buy a car or whatever.
Right.
And so the fancy stuff that leaves and after the faces of which is like, well, if I'm buying all these things, how am I going to live my life later?
Good question.
Well, the cool thing about how the US tax code works is that loans are never treated as income but they are spendable.
5:52
Money that you can consume and use.
And so for example, if I continue to pile all of my money into assets that are while I sleep, which is the definition of well, that I gave you one of my other videos if they continue to grow and they are growing tax free, then the growth that is tax-free.
I can I can realize by taking loans against those things and I can use those loans to live my life.
6:12
And as long as the loans that I am taking are less than the growth of my assets, then I can use all of that growth continue to let it compound tax free for the rest of my life and live off the loans.
And when I die, they can, they can Rectify my account.
Most Nation real quick.
6:28
If you are a business owner that has a big old business and wants to get to a much bigger business, going to 50 $100.
Plus, we would love to talk to you and if you like that or like to hear more about it, go to acquisition.com, you can play anywhere on the page and talk to one of our team and see if we can help you get there.
6:47
Okay.
So these are the strategies of the people who are ultra wealthy the things when they talk about conservation easements which is a basic view donate land and you get the full value.
The land even though you didn't pay the full value, it's a BB, right?
You're not gonna be able to put your entire, you know, income against that, you know, captive Insurance.
7:04
I've got a friend of mine who was like, do do this thing with me, it's going to, it's going to sit in for me.
It ended up.
So it was going to save, like, 250,000 a year, which honestly doesn't make a big done for me.
It wasn't really worth the hassle.
So I was like, I don't know, it smells a little fishy, guess what happened?
The IRS.
I ended up flipping the their ruling on it saw people taking advantage of it and then they back back charge people with interest in fees, right?
7:25
And so the thing is, is that the US tax code is not fair because the government can change the rules whenever they want, they can say, you know what, we change, this rule this year, and we're going to back text people, three years.
They can do that because they have complete control.
There's nothing we can do about, right?
And so, I like to think about it, just like, I think about content on any kind of platform is that I just have to align within the rules that that exists and long term.
7:46
If I don't sell anything.
I'm not going to get taxed on that.
And so, the idea long term is live for less than I, you know, for as low as I possibly can, if you like Island living, then by all means go and live on an island.
If you, if you so choose for me, I've chosen not to do the Puerto Rico thing because the difference in net worth, for me, makes no difference in my life because the difference between having a hundred million dollars in 180 million dollars to me makes no difference.
8:09
And so I got into this game because I wanted to have used money to have freedom to do X, Y, and Z, right to live.
I wanted to live to do what I want to do with whom I wanted to do it, right?
And so if that is the goal of what the money is going to afford me.
8:25
I can't put the money above the freedom.
And so if I have to remain prisoner of an island for six months of the year, in order to get my, my increase my a better income tax rate, right?
Then it seems like it's putting the cart before the horse from its, I'm relinquishing, the original objective I had and making the path of the vehicle the objective rather than realizing that money in it of itself has no value.
8:46
It only has value So far as it allows me to do things that I want to do.
And so if I'm not if I'm forgetting that which many of us do because the game is so enticing, then I think that that is what makes that more reason why a lot of people end up rationalizing.
Now you know I love Island living but I'll tell you what, the reason that they give you that 4% is because it's not that sick and so that is a.
9:07
So for me I think the easy thing, mean, living in Texas versus California, the the living lifestyle is the same for me but I but I pay less to fewer taxes.
Worth it makes sense to me, living in Puerto Rico.
I'm relinquishing a lot of freedoms there and I have to be there six plus months of the year.
9:24
And for me, that's very difficult with outages.
And basically no stores that are interesting and not a lot to do, I'm not going to give up their half of my life literally so that I can get half more money on my net worth.
Because as much as people are like, well that 40% is going to compound will.
So is the other 60.
9:40
And so again, I think it makes sense.
If you are, if you are a smaller and you were starting out in you're trying to develop your net worth.
But I can tell you right now, the vast majority, Draw, your worth is going to come from the growth and none of that has to be taxed.
And so if you play the game, the right way, which is the way the ultra-wealthy play, they're not trying to think about all these little hacks and codes that you see on the internet here.
9:57
It's really about making sure that you understand the big rocks correctly which is Bi-Lo immediately get value on your money for buying for less than what something's worth.
When you sell it, or don't sell it at all, you can continue to take loans against the increased value of the assets and you can live off this for this, your life if you so choose.
10:15
And so these are the Tax Strategies of the, ultra-wealthy, from someone who actually is ultra-wealthy.
I hope you found value in this video, click subscribe and I'll see you next video.

Real quick.
Because you guys already know that, I don't run any ads on this and I don't sell anything.
And so, the only ask that I can ever have you guys that you help me spread the word so we can have more entrepreneurs, make more money, feed their families, make better products, and have better experiences for their employees and customers.
And the only way we do that is if you can rate and review and share this podcast, so the single thing that I have to do is you can just leave review will take you 10 seconds or one type of the thumb, mean, the absolute world to me.
0:25
And more importantly, it may change the world of someone else.
What I want to show you is just one of the The many vehicles that exist to incentivize employees.
And it's called, Phantom Equity.
Welcome to the game, where we talk about, how to get more customers, how to make more per customer, and how to keep them longer and the many failures and lessons, we have learned along the way.
0:42
I hope you enjoy and subscribe.
So I was having a conversation with a newer business owner and he was talking about how he had this person was good at marketing and he wanted to give them a percentage of his business but not the whole business in order to do as marketing and after talking about it a little bit more, it became clear that it really should just have a performance relationship.
1:00
Not give up Equity, but one of the key things is that there are positions that are more difficult to measure within a business that it does make sense over time to, you know, give some sort of equity to an employee.
Because I have realized over time is that in order to grow my slice of the pie, it's better to get a bigger pie and have more people get wealthy.
1:19
And so, having other people use my business as a vehicle for their wealth is ultimately allowed me to gain leverage on how I can increase my own wealth.
And one of my rules of life is the more money than other people.
More money I make and that is not just limited to your customers.
It's also applies to your employees and that's been something that it took me much longer than I expected much longer than I had hoped to learn.
1:39
So hopefully I can transfer that lesson to you faster.
Sam Walton even talk about this in his book made in America how he said.
One of the biggest things that influence Walmart's growth is when they created their employee stock option program and by doing that, he said, there was such a tremendous amount of buy-in that the company just continue to grow and grow.
1:56
And he said, he wish he had done it sooner.
And so taking advice from that man, and somebody who's made Less money than Sam Walton myself.
What I want to do to, you is just one of the many vehicles that exist to incentivize employees and it's called Phantom Equity.
This is something that I have used in every company that I own believe it or not, I've used Phantom Equity to incentivize high-level employees in just about every company and it happened because I actually had someone use it with me as an affiliate.
2:21
So I was an affiliate of a big software company and the CEO flew out and was like, hey, how can I make this really worth it for you to, like, push this?
And I was like, listen, man, like Ian Enjoy the, you know, affiliate commissions, but for me to really make this like a focus, I would need some sort of equity on the upside.
They said, well, what if I instead of giving you Equity, I can give you a fan of equity and I was like, what's that?
2:40
And so, he explained it.
And I want to explain, you know, to the extent that I understand it as entrepreneur explaining to you, is, we've used it.
So I'm going to break this down to the employee in the owner.
All right, now in this case, the example just said I wasn't an employee, but I still had treatment.
I'll use the employee's.
2:57
The example here.
All right, so there's a couple different variables.
You can think through about Phantom Equity.
So Phantom Equity is simply put Equity, that is not vested, but has events that can trigger its vesting, vesting means whether it's happened or not, like does that Equity exist it?
3:13
Is it yours or not?
Has it vested.
All right, so the first thing is if M and Equity is typically triggered upon a sale or change in liquidity.
Now there is variables all of this stuff is negotiable all of these things that variable.
So I could say, for example, the Phantom Equity vests or you are able, To participate in a transaction of the company, if ownership changes, if majority ownership changes.
3:35
So that would be a clause that I could say, if I sell a majority the company then you can liquidate your shows as along with me.
Now if the reason that you might not include something like that is because a buyer might not want the key employees to leave with the liquidation of it.
So that's something that would protect the owner.
Now, if you wanted to say, hey I want to do it so that you guys can participate.
3:53
Then you could also put like, you can sell up to this amount or you can sell proportional amount.
So, there's lots of different caveats here, but Big Picture Mode.
People have Phantom Equity.
So that if there's a transaction of some sort, the employees can also participate in and build their own wealth.
Alongside the objective of phantom equities to get owner like thinking and owner like engagement owner, life Behavior, among people who are not majority owners, the business.
4:15
And a lot of times it makes a ton of sense like I used to be so stingy with Equity early on.
Well, in the very beginning I was really really loose with equity and then I kind of like swung back the other direction.
They're going to give anyone equity and I feel like now I've kind of fallen in the middle path of.
I don't need to give huge chunks away to people.
I need to find people who are key key players and give them finem Equity.
4:34
That is proportional the effort in the contribution that they have.
Right.
I used to give away a disproportionate chunks and I ended up paying for it.
And then later ended up trying to find ways to incentivize hot and sometimes attract high level employees and the best people want steak because winners win and they want, they know they're going to win.
So they want to have be able to participate the outside.
4:50
So number one that is where sale is triggered.
The second is that it's beneficial from a wealth standpoint because the employee can increase the value of their wealth, their Take the Phantom Equity by increasing the value of the business, right?
And the beauty of that is that it's entirely tax-free.
Now, the owner and employee are completely aligned on this one together.
5:07
Now, from a tax standpoint, the reason you fed him Equity, instead of normal Equity is that if you give normal Equity, the employee also gets the downside of equity, all right?
So this is good for the employee, right?
It's good.
Because the employee doesn't have to buy the equity because normally if you actually have an equity transfer a true transfer, then what happens they actually have to pay tax on it because they're getting something, right?
5:24
I can't just Zuckerberg, can't just give, you know, all the shares to Facebook, somebody they have to pay taxes on it, right?
Right?
And so you can't.
That is a taxable event when you transfer Equity.
So you make it Phantom Equity because it doesn't technically vest unless a trigger occurs and so, what that does is it means that they don't have to get taxed on it, right?
5:40
Which is beneficial, you know, for the employee.
Hey guys, real quick.
If you're new to the podcast, I've a book on Amazon called 100 million-dollar offers that over eight thousand five star reviews.
It has almost a perfect score.
You can get it for 99 cents on Kindle.
The reason I bring it up is that I put over a thousand hours in the writing that book and it's my biggest gift to our community.
5:59
Unity.
So it's my very Shameless way of trying to get you to like me more and ultimately make more dollars to that later on in your business career, I push the partner with you.
So that's my give go check it out Amazon and back to the show.
Right now, the downside of this though is that typically it will get triggered as regular income during the sale.
6:21
Now, there's ways of writing this, I'm not going to get into the complexities around this, but this is kind of round the vesting schedule, which is, when are they going to get this?
So, for example, you could say, I want to give you 5% of this company, and I want to give it to over five years, which means you get one percent a year for the next five years and you could say, hey, I want to create a cliff which means that after the first year, the entire first percent vest and then after that, every quarter another points, you 5% Fest after that.
6:43
So it means that At you know, month nine, they're still zero vesting and then at month, you know, 13, they'll have one percent that will have vested in its entirety and then after that, it's piecemeal, right?
What happens, if the employee leaves?
Now, one of the benefits to this and this protects the owner is what if you say, you know, someone comes in there Hotshot, they're you know, smooth-talk in and they're like, yeah, man, I want to find an equity whatever and the and you're like, sure, I'm going to give you five percent over the next five years, right?
7:08
And let's say they leave within, you know, X period of time now a upon the Nation of the employee.
You can have them not get those and you can also write that in the original Green, which means that if you leave, you lose your Phantom Equity.
Right.
Which also gets people to stick with it over the longer term, which is why companies employ this structure, its to incentivize people to stay and continue to grow the business, right?
7:31
This protects the owner, the tax thing, it protects the employee.
The other piece that protects the employees at with Phantom Equity.
They're not liable, right?
So, if something happens, the business, the employees and personally liable, which is why this is a nice attractive.
Thing for many people.
Now, this one is something that's interesting.
7:47
I want to talk about which is profit, right?
Because a lot of times people conflate Equity with profit, you can be an equity owner and not participate in profit distributions.
You can also participate, prophetess, distributions and not being a donor.
So these things are not connected.
Often times.
We think of them together because we as owners have both, but it doesn't mean that our employees need that necessarily, and I'm not saying you shouldn't do that.
8:07
I'm just saying it is yet another variable that is considered in the negotiation.
And so what if thinking Phantom Equity most times it's going to depend on the value of the business.
But what I learned from the, you know, the mentors that I have spoken with typically when you're having a leadership type position, who's a senior leadership.
8:25
So somebody who's like on the executive track, they might get between half a percent to two percent depending again, on the value of the business, their seniority, their experience, etcetera.
And if you have a true executive, that's a huge value.
Add that is leading, you know, almost half the company, Etc.
8:41
Then that is where you know sometimes 3% 4% And 5% can come into play.
And so this is Phantom Equity.
There are lots of different types of, you know, you can do bonus programs, you can do esops just wake up Employee Stock ownership programs.
There's lots of different things you can do in a business, but this is one that I have used and has been very, very helpful for me.
9:01
I've had people leave, who had had equity and we've been able to be on good terms.
Everything's been fine.
They were protected from a tax standpoint.
I tend to keep profit-sharing not to say that it's bad or good thing.
It's just Preference.
I love the fact that my employees can go there.
9:16
Well, alongside me because they hear the same videos that you guys watch.
And then finally it's nice because they think in terms of a sale so they're thinking in terms of Enterprise Value.
So the more aligned I can omit Mike, make my team and their life outcomes with my personal life outcomes.
Then the more line will be and ultimately the faster we'll move in that direction because we're not, you know, pushing focus and effort in opposite directions.
9:37
We're all 100% aligned.
And so Phantom Equity is one of the best vehicles for that.
Hope you found value in this video, you can click subscribe.
A band if you're thinking about doing something like this.
I'd recommend it.
I think that it's better to increase the size of the pie.
Give a handful of slices out to people who've helped you along the way.
9:54
And I think that for me as I've shifted I really just want everyone to be wealthy.
Heck, there's a lot of people were broken.
The reason I made this channel is so that you're not one of them.
One of the best things that I can think of is helping the people who've helped me build this and so building, my employees wealth is something that is my is something top of mind for me and trying to find new ways and creative ways to build wealth.

0:00
Most Nation real quick.
If you are a business owner that has a big old business and wants to get to a much bigger business, going to 50 $100.
Plus, we would love to talk to you and if you like that or would like to hear more about it, go to acquisition.com, you can play anywhere on the page and talk to one of our team and see if we can help you get there.
0:18
Welcome to the game where we talk about, how to get more customers, how to make more per customer and how to keep them longer in the many failures and lessons.
We have learned along the way.
I hope you enjoy and subscribe if you're stuck in your business right now.
A lot of times you don't, Not need to do it a lot to show you but if you've reached a point and you are focused on a niche right and you're getting to the 1 million or three million or 10 million dollar Mark there may be a time when it might be time for you to increase the so the size of your total addressable Market which the shorthand for that is Tam.
0:46
So in the investment banking world or the finance World, they call the Tam, the total just market, and that's one of the first questions they're going to ask you about your company.
If you wanted to sell some day, they're like well, okay, you've grown well, how big is the market that we're going after?
Because if you're going after Market, they realize that there is an invisible cap on the business that they, you know, they're going to say okay well this doesn't this isn't a massive opportunity and so when you increase your Tam you literally increase the size of your opportunity.
1:11
But in so doing you also change the nature of your delivery and your prospects.
So it's something you should do with a great amount of care.
That being said, what I'm going to do is take you through the three ways, to increase your total, addressable market and some of the considerations around that, all right?
So the first way that you can increase your tan and this is one that a lot of people don't look at or more.
1:29
Afraid of and this is probably one of the most profitable ways to do it at the end.
I'll show you the the ones that we've done and what I would have done differently etcetera.
Alright, so the first way is to go up Market when the term upmarket what that means is is that if you're in a service business of some kind and you serve a specific Avatar.
1:46
So let's say, I helped, you know, salon owners, generate customers, whatever, right.
If I wanted to go up market, then I would say, okay, this is think about it like a Christmas tree.
Each one of these individual, like, units has people blow it and All above it, above it would be the organization's or conglomerates of these people that I currently have.
2:05
So, can I go after associations?
Can I go after franchises?
Can I go after licenses or license ores of this type of business model, by doing that and serving those people?
I now have changed the nature of my business.
So if I'm serving somebody who serves salons, then I go up Market, I get another degree of Leverage.
2:25
This typically happens when you have more experience in the field you have demonstrated.
And results, you have evidence of your efficacy or your systems, your process or whatever.
It is to add value.
This is one of the best ways to gain leverage, and instantly, sell hundreds of clients at a time.
2:40
Alright, so that is the first way to increase your Tam and also increase the quality and size of the contracts you're dealing with, when you're selling the second way to increase your tan is to go adjacent.
All right?
Adjacent would be If I'm if I'm a salon owner, I'll just use that one as the or if I'm serving Sloane has or excuse me.
3:02
If I wanted to go adjacent there's a couple different ways I could do this one is I could go for people who manufacture stuff for salon owners, right?
I might go after a drying companies or a chair companies that do the little chairs that they have there, or might be the physical product side of the salon business.
3:20
It could also be a business that's closely related as long.
So I might go after nail salon, right?
Or I get my After A Lash expert or whatever.
Right?
And so this is how I could go adjacent and do the same thing, right?
3:35
So I give you two different examples.
That one is changing the nature of the business.
So if I started selling physical products within that same sphere, that would increase the size of my tan, but I also go direct to Consumer.
So there's multiple levels of that.
The most direct adjacent jump would be going from helping salon owners to helping nail salons.
3:54
Like so a hair salon to a nail salon to a Lash Salon or whatever, right?
So it's carving out these little vertical stripes that are close enough to one another, the lot of the best practices that you've already learned.
Probably apply.
Alright.
And so, this is the second way that you can eat.
4:10
Increase the total addressable Market that you are serving and by doing that, if you can, triple the amount of customers that you can that you can Market to, then you can triple them people, you can sell.
And this is especially important when you reach a bottleneck.
Now, it's important to understand that you might have a bottleneck on your current channel.
4:26
So let's say you're running Facebook has to get these customers or your running, you know, Google search ads, you're running, or you have a great affiliate partner, whatever?
It is, whatever we are getting customers.
You might have an artificial bottleneck.
So you feel, are you perceive like you can't grow anymore within that space?
But you realize that this is 60 billion dollar space in health and beauty and you're doing four million dollars a year.
4:43
Well, you probably should keep everything you have the same and a different channel to it or increase how much you're making per customer, which is beyond the scope of this video, but just something to think about, as you're as you're going through this.
All right, the Third Way So you can do this is to go down Market, all right.
This one I have I have personally tried and hated it but I'll explain some of that my personal experience of these things in a second.
5:07
Look, wise, you guys already know that.
I don't run any ads on this and I don't sell anything.
And so, the only ask that I can ever have you guys that you help me, spread the words we cannot more entrepreneurs, make more money, feed their families, make better products and have better experiences for their employees and customers.
The only way we do that is if you can rate and review and share this podcast, so the single thing that I have to do is you can just leave review but they can 10 seconds or one type of the thump.
5:31
It means the absolute world to me.
And more importantly, it may change the world or someone else.
All right, so going down Market is let's say use the salon owner example.
Again if are going down market then I would be serving hair stylists, right?
So what's one level below the person that I'm currently currently serving?
5:50
It would be hair stylists or actual, nail polish people, right?
And you absolutely can't do that.
So if I had a certification or something that would help them you know be better or service more customers or allow them to charge higher rates because we had a proprietary system around it or whatever.
6:06
Then this would be something.
That I would be able to sell down market.
Now, typically what happens if you're thinking about this from a pricing perspective, this is what you're normally charging.
This is probably what you're charging times 5 to 10.
All right, and this is what you're charging, probably / 5 to 10.
6:23
All right?
And if you think about this, this is much more akin to a pyramid, right?
Where you have where you're currently at, you have your down Market.
Oops.
And then you have your own market right on the top of that and so making the decision about what to do here.
I would say that most people are in this kind of number two, bucket, right there.
6:41
Your you are where you're at, you, sir for you serve and most times what you're encountering is an artificial bottleneck, you just have maxed out this particular stream of getting customers and there's lots of ways to solve that bottleneck one is by adding another channel.
The other way would be increasing the lifetime gross profit per customer so that you can mark it twice as hard or spend twice as much or three times as much on that same channel to acquire more customers, right?
7:03
And so one of those is back in solution, the others, a front end solution, both of them are viable.
Enzo where you're at.
All right.
And so me personally I'll give you the, the gym example.
So we serve gym owners in one of our one of our portfolio companies during launch.
If we wanted to go down Market, it would be helping personal trainers.
7:19
If we want to go up Market, it would be helping franchisors, you know, make more money with their franchise within that space, right?
So, that would be an example of all three of those things.
If I wanted to go adjacent, it might be like, kind of like, I would say, cross diagonal, both adjacent and down Market, but having the pension potential job market would be like, having online, Fitness business, Because someone like, this is B Fitness, businesses can be bigger.
7:40
Some can be about the same as a gym and many many many times.
Many of them are less than that because most of those people are kind of more along the lines of business opportunity Seekers which leads me to the kind of the fourth final point that I want to make here.
If you are in some way involved with client acquisition, which many of the people who listen this channel are, because it's just the nature of the world that I've been in.
7:59
If you're in that world, one of the ways that you can make your opportunity appeal to more people, is by transitioning from Improvement offer, which is where you help people do better.
When the thing that they are doing to a new opportunity, being a business opportunity, so it's helping people who do not have or who do not enjoy, you know, the job they're in or do not enjoy their current vehicle and want to try something else, that's different.
8:21
If you have a better way of doing it, that doesn't have a huge barrier to entry, then that can be a viable.
I would say, like options.
You know, 3.5 is, is Biz op right with each of these levels as you go down this way.
So, too does the quality of the prospect, all right.
8:37
Right?
When you were selling somebody who's a hair stylist, or a personal trainer, or a real estate agent right versus a real estate brokerage or a gym owner or a hail salon owner versus a license.
A franchisor of any of those things or a broker, if I was in the real estate space, hopefully you're seeing the parallels here like all Industries, work this way and the ultimate Fu position to have and this is what, you know, the banking world and what creates real real term.
9:07
This Enterprise Value is something called vertical integration, vertical integration and what that means is actually owning all aspects of the supply chain.
So, for example, if I owned a business that certified, you know, personal trainers and help them, you know, start their first gym and then I help them grow their gym.
9:26
And then, I either had a franchisor I consulted with franchisors and I made recommendations to these people to go into a franchise, then that would be a completely vertically integrated business.
Now, I might also own adjacent portions of that, I might Tone.
The processing.
I might own the crms.
I might own the physical products that they're selling within that distribution Basin.
9:43
All of these are different ways that you can increase your total addressable market and ultimately the amount of things they sell.
Now, with each of these changes, comes tremendous operational complexity.
And so, if you're going to make one of these switches, I would do so incredibly carefully and make sure that you're not doing the number one mistake that I see all its printers make, which is thinking that an artificial bottleneck on a channel is a, is a reflection of the bottleneck of the size of their Market.
10:06
All right?
So one of the Issues that I see and so hopefully found value than this.
Hopefully, if you are stuck at your current level of growth, think about increasing lifetime grow for profit per customer or just adding another Channel.
Either of those things will likely be bottleneck you, but you may be in a situation where it might be better for you to go down Market or go up market and make sure that when you're doing that, you're addressing the pricing accordingly.
10:27
You can't go up market and just charge twice as much because there's so much so many fewer of those customers and they're going to expect a lot more and to, the same degree in this one of the biggest mistakes that I've made.
I went down Market, I dress him.
My price accordingly but I actually kept my service the same and so it was actually not viable for me because I was putting so much time and effort into people who didn't pay enough and then it didn't work out, all right?
10:46
And so hopefully, this makes sense to you.
Hopefully found value in this, click subscribe, and I'll see you guys next video.
Bye!

What's going on, everybody?
I'm bringing some more books, but I wanted to say that, if you haven't checked out Hunter million-dollar offers, I would definitely suggest that you start there.
I've gotten some solid feedback and it couldn't be happier with its.
Number one ranking on Amazon for direct marketing and over 5,000, five star reviews.
So, thank you guys so much for that.
0:15
It's 164 pages.
I really can help you out.
It takes about four hours to get through, check it out.
On Amazon, the Kindle book is 99 Cents.
The audiobook is Lowe's, they'll let me put it on for it, so I think it's 12 bucks.
So enjoy that and let's start the podcast.
Welcome to the game.
Where we talk about how to get more customers, how to make more per customer and how to keep them longer in the many failures and lessons.
0:34
We have learned along the way.
I hope you enjoy and subscribe, what's going on?
Everyone?
In this video I'm going to show you how to raise your prices in a tactical way on your existing customer.
So it's one thing to raise your prices on your customers which for many times, you know, that's what something that you have to do, because you need to do, you want to reinvest in making the business better.
0:52
You want to cover some Capital expenses or just want to make more money, which is fine in the number one, lever on making money is how what?
Your pricing at, right?
We've This and thousands of businesses now.
And there's a process that we go about this because if you raise it on existing customers, be ready to have people be upset, but here's why this is so important.
1:10
So let's say that your business runs at a 20% net margin which is fine, right?
And let's say that you just for number, say, Q charge $100 a month.
If you're running a 20% margin and your $100 a month, a 20% increase in pricing would double your profit, a 50% increase in pricing with three and a half extra profit.
1:26
That's pretty good.
If you doubled your price, you would see XX, how much money you make.
And so this is how big of a lever pricing is on how much profit you make.
And so knowing how to raise your prices obviously would be something that would be very important.
So there is a right way and a wrong way to do it.
So what I want to do is show you the right way because the wrong way to do is send an email out saying hey we're raising our prices, you know, Screw you and you'll get a ton of customers who leave you and then you end up being worse off than you were before.
1:51
But I did this in my facility, this is one of my first businesses, and I actually had a third of my customers cancel, but I tripled my price and so I Able to keep two thirds of my customers at three times the price and lose one, third of my biggest, my employees called it the calling.
We got rid of all the problem customers in one Fell Swoop.
2:07
So, if you have a paint, a bunch of customers are always telling myself, you might want to do this because you'll get rid of all the cancerous people and keep only the people who love you.
And when I did that, I doubled my revenue.
And here's what's even cooler.
My profit went through the roof because I even had to service a third fewer customers which is awesome.
2:23
All right?
And so the way that we do this is through a price increase letter.
And if you're curious my gym on speakers, book is a book Book that is about Jim's but it is a business book.
That is simply applied to jobs.
If you want it, you can grab it is not how I make money, but let's say let's walk through this.
2:39
So you have your letter to increase prices right now.
There's a format to doing this.
All right.
Now, it's not about you.
It's about the prospect is about the consumer, all right?
So the first thing that we want to do, right?
Is, you know, we don't say, Hey, you probably know that we've been, you know, growing a lot.
2:54
You probably noticed a lot of the good things that are going on right now.
And so that's why I'm writing this letter, all right.
So it's like I am I doing this.
Why am I writing this letter to you?
What's the intention the letter?
All right.
The second is we're going to talk about what we currently are doing, all right?
And so this is allowing you to re resell them a little bit on what you're currently doing.
3:12
The value are currently providing that because sometimes they forget, because they might only use one aspect your service.
And so if they're like, oh wow, there's a lot of extra stuff that I'd even know about and believe me, I can't even tell you, the amount of times people read this letter, they're like, I don't even know you were doing all this stuff, right?
And so you want to list out, you know, the stuff that you're doing or say, okay.
You know, we hire and retain the best talent.
3:29
Talent.
You know, we have, we offer continuing education for our employees.
We, you know, we're providing new software's and equipment to our members that we always try to keep up to date.
That's what we're currently doing, though.
I didn't you think about that.
So the goal here is to is to get them to think about your costs, try and get them into the mind of you as an entrepreneur to the best of your ability, right?
3:51
Like these are the things that we incur in order to provide this value is not like we're just taking all the money you give us and putting it in our pockets because that's what everyone always thinks.
Alright, the next thing, Do is when we say, wow, despite all this stuff that we're doing, we want to do even more because we're losing our minds because we should provide crazy value.
All right?
4:07
And so it's like, we want to let you know, we're currently a ragtag bunch of Champions our facility if you have an actual facility and if you're online, it's like, you know, we've had a lot of stuff that's duct tape together.
We want to really, you know, level up the brand and we want to do it for you, right?
4:22
You want to tell them what's coming.
So this is like we want to add these X y&z things.
We want to add specialty programs, going at higher levels of service, we want to Add you know events to our to our business.
We want to add all these things, right?
A massive Improvement to our level of service.
These are all things that we want to be adding, right?
4:39
And then what I like to do is I like to tie this tie this increase to a promise of values.
Okay?
Now what I mean by that is Real quick guys.
If you can think about how you found this podcast, somebody probably tweeted it told you about it.
4:55
Should it on Instagram or something like that?
The only way this grows is through word of mouth and so I don't run ads, I don't do sponsorships, I don't sell anything.
I only ask is that you continue to pay it forward to whoever showed you or however you found out about this podcast that you do the exact same thing.
So if it was a review, if it was a post, if you do that, you mean the world to me and you throw some good karma out there for another entrepreneur.
5:17
I want to tie this to values that I ascribe to that, no one can contest.
So I can say, I have made this promise to you.
And with Integrity, I can no longer provide the level of service that I have promised unless we do these things.
Because I will not stand here in this Marketplace and say that we are the best at XYZ, unless we do these things.
5:37
And the only way for me to do these things is for us to have a corresponding increase in price.
All right, now mind you when you're communicating the price, it's also important to communicate the Price in a way that's, you know, attractive.
So you don't say hey it's going to cost you five thousand dollars extra a year, you would it be better to say?
It's going to cost you an extra hundred bucks a week, right?
5:54
Sounds like a lot less, right?
If you can break down even more, it's 15 bucks a day.
It depends on, you know who you're talking to what level of service you have, but you can break it down to weekly, or break it down to daily, and that's why insurance quotes people in days.
So only a dollar a day, right?
So that you can do this in and it will minimize what the perceived cost is.
6:11
So, ideally, you want to maximize by saying, this is all the stuff we're doing that, we you didn't even No about this is the stuff we want.
That's even more than that.
And this is how little it's going to cost you and the reason we must do this is so that I can maintain my Integrity to you and the promise that I made you I am forbid.
6:27
That this is something.
I'm planting my flag here is that I demand to be the best in the marketplace and for us to do this.
We must continually invest in for us to do that, it's like this is what is required, right?
And then and here's what's cool is that I like to add a little PS at the end and that little PS is to give perspective.
6:43
All right.
And what I do here is I say If this is going to materially affect your life, if you're not gonna be able to pay your mortgage or not gonna be able to buy groceries for kids, please reach out to me and we can figure something out.
And so by saying that you automatically perspective to everyone, that listen no one's going to go homeless over this thing right now is going to lose their house because we're raising the price of our XYZ, right?
7:03
Right.
But we open the door for discussion for the people who feel obligated or feel the need to do this.
Now if you make an announcement like this, which I recommend you doing via video and be a direct mail, you want to make it and then also turn the comments off on whatever.
The post is because believe me, you don't want to do with that.
7:19
As you just say, hey, I don't want this to be, you know, a gossip form.
If you have anything, just bring it to me directly out of respect for you.
I want to deal with these, you know, face-to-face and not over the keyboard, right?
And so it's an easier way to also manage and mitigate any kind of negativity that happens.
And believe me, if you raise your prices, you're going to have people going to be squeaky wheels and it's in their best interest to get you to not raise the prices.
7:38
So just don't chicken out.
Once you commit to it, stick with it, all right?
Because I'm telling you, if you raise your price like I just sold your over 25 percent margin and you raise your 25%, you double your profit.
All right, so I told you I lost a third of my customers.
That's because I tripled my price.
And most businesses don't realize how much of a pain it is to find another one of your business and so if you can capitalize on that, you can usually eke out an increase in revenue and profit as a result, you will be far out rewarded by making that change and the people who do leave are usually your worst customers and you've been wanting to get rid of them anyways and this gives you a great time to do it.
8:14
So if you're going to raise your prices, this is the way.
That I do it to existing customers.
I write a letter.
I tell them.
You know why?
I've said I'm setting the stage for why we're doing this.
I tell them all the things that we're currently doing that.
They don't know that we're doing and you probably do tons of stuff.
It's good to listen stuff out.
Then you tell him about the future of what's going to happen, what the benefits are going to be to them, do what they're about to enjoy, and how that's going to impact them in a real way.
8:35
In every single time, they see you, they experience your business, they interact with you.
And what benefit of the benefit is going to occur, and then finally, I'd like to end with values and perspective.
All right, so probably values are right here, dude.
So values is kind of the wrap-up, so just consider that 3.5.
Sorry, we both live, right?
8:53
And then you have your wrap up, which is, Hey, Big Picture.
This is going to make you or break you.
You're not going to go homeless because of this, but if you do have something that's going to materially affect you because you have that anchor, it makes it very easy for you to have that discussion.








0:00
What's going on, everybody?
I'm bringing some more books, but I wanted to say that, if you haven't checked out Hunter million-dollar offers, I would definitely suggest that you start there.
I've gotten some solid feedback and it couldn't be happier with its.
Number one ranking on Amazon for direct marketing and over 5,000, five star reviews.
So, thank you guys so much for that.
0:15
It's 164 pages.
I really can help you out.
It takes about four hours to get through, check it out.
On Amazon, the Kindle book is 99 Cents.
The audiobook is Lowe's, they'll let me put it on for it, so I think it's 12 bucks.
So enjoy that and let's start the podcast.
What's up?
Buddy.
0:30
Hope you guys have an amazing week so far.
And today I want to talk to you about The Virtuous vicious cycle of pricing results, service and profit.
So I'm sure if you've been hanging around this area Community, this little Nook of the internet, Our Little World of Jim launch.
You'll have encountered, a lot of gym owner saying that they're making more money and they've got more customers and they're charging more money for all of them in your like, how does this even make sense?
0:52
And it's because a lot of things in business are counterintuitive and I think pricing is all So one of them.
And so I wanted to kind of go over some of the things that I've learned that really help me shift the way I saw pricing and really, how I ethically came to the conclusion.
1:13
I came to the ethical conclusion that spending charging more was really.
It's a win-win for everyone.
Not, it's not a like, it's not a zero-sum game in business, like it's a win-win for everyone.
So let me explain.
So here's the, here's the typical picture right?
1:31
As prices go down.
So, most people are, like, I want to help more people and so I'm going to lower my prices cuz I wanna make more of an impact, but the reality is that when you do that, you just hurt everyone.
And here's how.
So, from the client side, the emotional investment goes down.
So they're paying less that they care less right.
The perceived value also goes down.
1:47
So even if you gave them the same thing, you give them.
Two bottles of 11 times, I charge $10, another time you charge $1000, the perceived value goes down.
There's tons of studies to support.
This initiative.
Makes sense to intrinsically right now because The perceived value goes down the results, go down because they don't think the, about the information that's valuable.
2:03
They don't think your workouts are as viable at your gym and Generals is valuable.
And so, they don't try as hard because they just don't value it as much, right?
And ironically, this is what's kind of interesting and this is something that I can only tell you off of everybody who's that, you know, that we've worked with and anyone who does low ticket or high tech geek in can support.
2:23
Its that the demandingness of these customers actually go up.
So as you decrease, your prices, you get, We'll ask you to come to their house, rub their back, rub their feet for $50 a month, it's insane.
But it's because the people that you attract at that level of quality have different views around money and at the same time, like they just try and get as much out of everyone as they can.
2:42
And that's the reason that they are where they are in life, right?
They take take take instead of gift, right?
And the recent, like the richest people in the world, once you give the most, the people were, the poorest are the ones who always try and take, right?
And so, it should make sense that those are after understanding that, it should make sense that That when you're decreasing your prices, you actually the worst customers to.
3:03
And then this also compounds because sometimes they're a little bit in the right that they get you.
They get less service per customer, right?
Because now there's more of them and you're making less money on them, right?
So your margin goes down, the amount of them that you have go up.
And so the amount of service per customer goes down.
3:18
So they care less, they value it less their results go down, they ask for more and you are able to give them less because there's less money left over.
All right, so that's the Vicious Cycle around price for your customers.
Now, as the prices go down from you as a business, your profits go down your perceived value of self go down like for me like we, I love having a high price service because I value.
3:43
I value what we do a lot and I want other people to value that, right?
And if you're selling, you know, cheap cheap cheap, cheap stuff, you just start to think that you're cheap, right?
Like you start to think that you don't really provide as much value as you really do.
Right next thing, is that your results go down.
4:00
Okay, now, you stop getting testimonials stuck.
Eating feedback.
Okay?
And this is kind of like, this is also soft like self battering, right?
Like you value yourself less because you're cheaper, and now no one's getting more salts.
And then all these people are demanding, more of you.
And the service goes down because you can't afford to give them as much because the price price on your service team side, you have to cut people.
4:21
You have to decrease how much you can pay on how you can only be on the phone for five minutes.
You can't give them a full service because you got so many other customers see where I'm going with it.
Real quick guys.
If you can think about how you found this podcast, somebody probably tweeted it told you about it.
4:36
Should it on Instagram or something like that?
The only way this grows is through word of mouth and so I don't run ads, I don't do sponsorships, I don't sell anything.
I only ask is that you continue to pay it forward to whoever showed you or however you found out about this podcast that you do the exact same thing.
So if it was a review if it was a post, if you do that would mean the world to me and you throw some good karma out there for another entrepreneur.
4:58
And then the last piece and someone people don't talk about is that your sales team has Integrity issues.
So, all of a sudden, they feel like they're lying when they're promising.
Something that they know that they can't that you as a business, can't fulfill.
And it sucks.
It's not cool because they have to sell the dream because anytime you're in sales, you have to you have to sell a cure like you can't sell them maybe like people by conviction, right?
5:20
And so of a sales teams trying to feed his family, right?
He's going to be start to be making promises.
That on some level, he knows that the business can't fulfill.
And when that happens, then they start to struggle with Integrity issues and start get all out of whack.
And you start wondering what's going on, right?
5:37
And if you're the person doing the sales for your business, then sometimes it's you because now you feel like you're promising something that, you know, you can't deliver and we finished, people are ethical people.
We want to help people, but at the same time, like, Like we want to help other people but totally lost my train of thought so I'm assuming want.
5:58
Okay, so as prices go up, okay, here's the virtuous cycle instead of the Vicious Cycle.
So the prices go up, emotion investment, goes up, perceived value, goes up.
Imagine if clickfunnels for five thousand dollars a month, everyone would be like, oh my God, this is the latest greatest, most amazing software of all time, right?
That's what they would think.
Because the perceived value gone up, even though the software had changed, right?
6:17
And what happens now, everyone if spent His monthly follows everyone learns how to do it.
Everyone builds all these photos because they are more invested right now.
This is what's ironic though.
As you build more clients, ironically become less demanding and it's because you're tracking different types of customers which is interesting.
6:34
It's always, that's why I was always fascinated.
And now that prices went up, we have fewer customers, they're less demanding.
And if they ever do ask for anything, we have so much service to give them their blown away, and the right types of customers.
And then they tell their friends, who are other rights because Summers, they come.
6:50
And I'm only telling you this, because I've lived this, I've lived both sides of this.
And I'm telling you this height is way better.
So do this side and then from a, from a business standpoint, whoops, that should say when your prices go there.
Yeah, your profits go up.
7:06
So now you're making more money, the perceived value of stuff goes up because you're like, you know what I'm worth.
What I'm charging.
Right?
Your results go up.
Now you're getting tons of testimonials, everyone says that your stuff's amazing.
Everyone says your service is amazing, right?
Demanding is goes down because these people are better.
Service goes up because you can afford to give them the best to your service team feels like, they don't feel overwhelmed, they're not stressed out.
7:25
They are not like I'll have to get off the phone in five minutes.
I have to keep my core volume up, just work that way and be like, hey cradle-to-grave someone walks in with a problem.
If it takes you two hours to get two hours to get the problem fixed.
Right?
So now, they feel like they're really helping people, not just like putting fires out, but actually helping people in providing service because you can afford to do it, because there's margin left over and there's fewer people and the people that aren't there are better and they perceive the value better.
7:49
And so the results go up and see how The Virtuous cycle continues, right?
And now you're in flow increases because the sales team has more testimonials to work.
Often they have conviction that they can promise something that they know that you will fulfill it.
Because I don't care what you say, conviction is what self people.
8:04
And unless, and it's really hard for people who are moral individuals, which most people I think are especially salespeople, are business.
People is like, most people think that people are trying to take advantage of them?
Most sales people want to do right by people.
No one wants to sell products that they don't believe in.
8:21
And so, if they actually like sales people get super excited when they have a product that really works because then Can push it so much harder like it.
That's that's really what it is.
Is like they have that conviction and now they can actually push the way.
They would love to be able to push products.
So I hope this was valuable for you.
8:38
I hope if you're like, on the edge of like, should I increase my prices?
Like, do it, like almost every time.
Like if you were in our group, if you're wearing are paid group, you know, like virtually 100% of the time I say, you should probably like raise your prices and usually by a significant margin not like well I to memberships ones. 101's. 120.
8:55
Like that's not a like That's irrelevant, right?
Like those are basically the same buying decision.
So there's like you might as well just have everyone at 120, but if you're going to do it at 120, the same buying decision will be like 167 is the same buying decision.
So, anyways, hope that was valuable drop a comment.
9:11
If that resonated with you, lots of love and I'll catch you guys.









0:000:000:00
Hey guys, love that.
You're listening to the podcast.
If you ever want to have the video version of this which usually has more effects, more visuals, more graphs, you know, drawn out stuff.
Sometimes it can help hit the brain centers in different ways.
You can check out my YouTube channel, it's absolutely free.
Go check that out, if that's what you are into.
0:16
And if not keep enjoying the show, this video is for all my friends who are doing, you know, 1 million, three million, five million dollars a year and who come to me and are always like, man, I want to challenge.
This is so boring.
I want to do something new and exciting.
And so let me tell you a story, welcome to the game, where we talk about, how to get more customers, how to make more per customer and how to keep them longer and the many failures and lessons, we have learned along the way.
0:39
I hope you enjoy and subscribe about my neighbor and so my neighbor had a trash business.
All right, trash collection, business that's boring is against it, he sold his business, a few years back for a lot of money.
I'll just put it that way and I was walking one day and he was like watering his lawn and I was like, hey man, you know what's going on and He said I just got out of my non-compete and I was like oh that's awesome.
1:02
So you know what do you plan on doing?
He's like well I plan on doing the exact same thing again and I was like wait what do you mean?
He was like well I plan on starting another trash business and selling it right back to the guys who bought my last one and I was like what?
And like he could tell that I was kind of like confused by this and he was like he's like why would I learn something new?
1:22
He's like I already know everything about the trash business.
He's like I'll just do it again.
It just really hit me because I was like, So many entrepreneurs myself included, right?
And I made this mistake so many times early on, in my career, we desire novelty.
We desire challenges, we want growth, right?
1:38
But the thing is that we think growth means new.
When I think that a lot of times we could redefine growth as meaning, we develop the character traits to be able to persist, and continue to do the same things over and over again.
You don't see these real estate Moguls.
For example, being like man I've built, you know, twenty million dollars in real estate.
1:54
I kind of just need a challenge.
I'm going to start, I'm going to start a restaurant, right?
They don't Do that.
I mean think about how stupid that would sound to you.
You're like dude you're so good at real estate, just keep doing real estate, right?
But I see this, especially in the marketing Community more than anything, is this this need for constant change and, and, and growth and challenge, right?
2:12
But I think you need to redefine the challenges.
This is becoming hard for you because you're getting bored.
So the challenge is learning to a be comfortable with boredom or be, not need it.
Because the business doesn't exist to status.
Fi our internal He's right?
2:28
And it's usually on most of us build it.
We're insecure.
We need connection.
We need.
We want status, right?
These are the things that we build our business to solve but our business doesn't actually need to solve any of those things.
It just needs to provide value to the customer and then we try and extrapolate our project.
Our own needs on the business and in so doing break our businesses and make the wrong decision.
2:47
And so let me tell you different story.
So I've had one two, three different guys, tell me in the, in the internet marketing space, who I say once doing Eighteen to twenty million others doing about 10 million others, doing about 10 million a year.
Probably, in the neighborhood of, like, 3ish million in profit per year around there 325 and so each of them on their own reached out to me and said, hey man, I think I'm going to start a software company because I'm I'm not I'm not challenging enough doing this anymore, right?
3:16
And I thought about that and I just thought how kind of hilarious it was.
It's like I've risen to the top of my game.
I'm bored doing what I'm doing and so I'm going to stop doing this and then I'm going to enter a new Arena where one else has been doing that for 10 years and there are other kingpins in that Arena and I'm going to try and relearn everything from ground zero and then try and beat them now.
3:36
Here's what's interesting, right?
Here's what's crazy.
If you were to let's say make a hundred thousand dollars a year in your business and you decide that you're going to be a true entrepreneur and I mean you're never going to quit and it means that you're going to continue to do business for, you know, 40 years or whatever.
3:51
Right?
If you were to gain at the same Pace as the marketplace, which by the way, when you're smaller is really easy, right is 10% a year.
If you were to grow by 10% a year, by the end of the 40 years, you would have a gazillion dollars, right?
But most people are always trying to beat the market.
When in reality, if you just match the market, you would become extraordinary.
4:09
Ordinarily crazy wealthy, at the end of this game.
But because we are so frenetic.
And we have these insecurities that we project on our business.
And then Force our business to solve our own personal issues, we end up breaking.
The thing that is actually working just fine because we have, these interpersonal needs that we're trying to satisfy and this was very hard for me to learn.
4:27
I'm saying this because for me, this was a mistake that I made over and over again, probably for the first four years of business.
For me, I tried to make my business.
So my personal problems, when it really, just needed to solve my clients problems and I needed to do with my own personal, Stuff, right?
One of the things that I wanted to give you was the ways that I create challenges for myself within the business without destroying the business.
4:48
All right, so let me give you two different things that have been complete life savers for me.
So I have desires for Innovation.
I have desires for new things, right?
And so, where to channel that, it's not to create new businesses where to channel that is to create new friends or new back-end.
5:05
So meaning like how can I change the hooks?
How can I change the Creative.
How can I change the a daityas, the marketing, the front ends that bring people in.
Because the more variety of there, the more different types of avatars I'm going to attract and ultimately grow the business.
So you can use that entrepreneurial add, but use it in a way that's going to serve you, right?
5:22
And serve the business without rather than Breaking the business, right?
Whereas if you start creating more businesses to satisfy your add, then what ends up happening is, well, you know, you have lots of businesses and you don't have any money.
That's the first thing.
The second thing that I do that I will walk you through is understanding constraints.
5:37
All right.
One of the lessons.
I've learned over the last 12 months is multiple metrics for success, and so I'll dive more into that in another video.
But basically for a very long time in my life, the only metric for Success that I had was how much profit and how much increase in net worth I had at the end of the year, that was it.
5:53
So I care about and I think that as we've gotten to the point where like an increase in net worth the marginal utility of more money, meaning like the amount of extra good that I can purchase.
Or that more money can purchase me is very, very little, right?
There's nothing that an extra 10 million dollars or an extra 50 million Ours is going to purchase me that the first 50 of them by me, right?
6:12
There's nothing right that it can, there's nothing that I can't already get, right?
And so when you think about things like that, right?
Would it forces you to do is create different ways to win, right?
Because it's a game, right?
If your entrepreneurial then you all you should, especially if you become more successful, you'll see it as a game, right?
6:28
And so, you have this game that we're playing and we have these metrics for Success.
That originally are just increasing net worth, right?
But then you can say, can I increase my net worth and have a good marriage?
Can I increase my net worth and And and be in shape, right?
And so one of the constraints that I'd like to offer you as a challenge to give to yourself so that you don't get bored in the business that you have is a constraint around time.
6:54
Hey Mose, a nation quick break.
Just to let you know, we've been starting to post on LinkedIn and want to connect with you.
Alright so send me a connection request.
A note letting me know that you listen to the show and I will accept it.
There's anyone you think that would be should be connected with tag them in one of my or laila's posts?
And I will give you all the love in the world.
7:10
All right, so let's get back to the show.
Right?
And so that was one of the things that I did over the last 12 months was like, okay, I want to build something that does a billion dollars a year in Revenue which is the goal for the portfolio and transparently.
We're not there, you know, where to about 85 million dollars a year across our portfolio but we're still a little short but it's a good thing to focus on.
7:33
Now the thing is is that I don't want to make and the way that I have to make that is it I can't not going to outwork to get to a billion.
Write it you have to make good decisions and you have to let compounding work in your Ever, right?
Because if we have the 85 million and we give grow by 10% a year in, you know, 20 years will probably be there, right?
7:52
And so well, let's see a doubling would happen every seven years.
So 21 years would be double double double.
So that would be 2 4 8.
So 8 times 85 know, we'd still be so we need another doubling.
So we'd have to like 28 years from now.
We could be it if we just grow at the market rate, which is pretty encouraging.
8:08
I think so.
I think we can beat the market rate.
But anyways, the point is Adding constraints makes the goal is far more interesting, because I think the first level of achieving any goal is learning how to sacrifice everything to achieve the goal, which I think candidly.
I don't know many people who are super successful who haven't done that, you have to be able to put everything you have on the altar of success and sacrifice it for what you want.
8:28
Some people may not like that idea and that's fine.
I don't, I just don't know people who are Ultra successful, who have done that and the reason they are willing to sacrifice everything is because the deficiency they have in their soul is so great that the pain they're suffering from is like for not having the thing is, so great, that the put everything else.
Else on the Altar for their success.
8:43
And I know that I did that first hand and so I remember even when I when I was growing growing into this entrepreneurial role that I didn't tell myself, I'm gonna outwork everyone because I didn't even think that was realistic, I said I without sacrifice, everyone's one of my competitors are going out to dinner when my competitors are hanging out with their kids and my competitors are hanging out with their wives or being good husbands.
8:59
I was like, I will get ahead.
That was what I told myself and it worked but at a certain point and this is why multiple metrics of success are important.
The new goals that I'm setting have constraints on it because anyone can Sacrifice everything to get what they want.
9:15
But the question is, can I build a billion dollar a year Revenue portfolio working two or three days a week, right?
And can I do that?
Also, while being in competitive shape physically, right?
And working out one to two hours a day because I like it, can I do all those things.
9:31
And so this is kind of the new levels of challenge I'm doing rather than trying to break what I have and going doing ten other new things.
It's like, can I add constraints the existing game to make the game?
More fun for me without Making the machine because ultimately like the machine doesn't serve to, it doesn't exist to serve me.
9:47
It exists to serve the customer and making sure that I don't conflate.
Those two things has been a very valuable lesson in the very beginning for me, I'll tell you the story.
When I, when I started the first time, where I really saw success was, when I learned, how to sacrifice those to us saying sacrifice earlier.
So I'll tell you how I actually learned how to do this.
10:03
So when I was in college, I ended up pledging a fraternity and it was a very hard pledging process hard, being like time-consuming, right?
And I think Basically, every hour of the day - three hours and - class time, so we had three, our study hall, and we had whatever our class time was all the rest of the time we had during the day, we had to be at the house and doing chores and stuff.
10:22
And so that was pretty miserable.
And that wasn't like, you know, a ton of fun.
But what ended up happening was I end up getting really good grades that semester in college, and it was because they forced me to do three hours a day, every single day, of homework.
And if you do three hours a day of work every day and this is what I realized in college, there's the days that you don't I have work to do if you still work three hours, you get ahead on a future work.
10:46
And so I realized that for only 3 hours a day if I just did that.
I would I think that that semester I got like a 383 or something like that.
What I did after I finished pledging was I realized that all these extra hours of the day were mine.
And so what I did was I was like well if I can just study all the rest of the hours, then I should do really really well.
And that ended up being a really good.
11:03
Methodology was I just sacrificed all of my day.
So I basically went to the gym, went to the library and went to class and that was it.
And I do I never worked past 9 p.m. and I went out almost the nights of the week, but by always doing it that way, not wasting my time, I ended up doing really well and it was the first time I ever learned how to sacrifice everything, which was everything else I just didn't do anything besides work, work out and go to class like that, was it throwing day?
11:28
And so when I started applying that same kind of concept to business, it was actually fairly easy for me because I was so used to sacrificing everything.
I just switched over what I was sacrificing for and I think that you have to learn how to sacrifice first in order to learn how not to sacrifice later, right?
11:45
Because a lot of people are like, why would I want to achieve the success you have or whatever?
But I don't want to sacrifice X y&z.
I just I think you can say that.
I just don't know anyone who's done it.
It's kind of like saying, I want to get over the whole that money has on my life except I haven't made any money.
I think you have to achieve something before you can give it up, right?
12:02
I mean Buddha who who gave up his worldly riches, like he talks about, you know, he walked the middle.
Path because he had been extremely wealthy and a prince and then giving it all up and lived as a poor person and then walk the middle path.
And so I think that in order for us to walk the middle path in life, we have to have achieved the thing.
12:18
In order, we have to achieve Mastery over the thing before we can truly Master it and mean and give it away, right?
And that's how we can eliminate the desire desire for the thing because we truly know what it's like to have it, right?
And then that means we can truly know why we don't need it.
And so I think that's um, I know, it's it didn't mean to get 100% business philosopher on you.
12:37
But That's kind of why I think this goes full circle, so big picture here.
Multiple metrics of success, don't change your business just to challenge yourself.
Find new ways to either create front ends when new product lines or things like that, within your business that can satisfy your add.
12:54
And if neither of those things are what you want to do, then just use constraints to create challenges in your own business, that improve your life in other ways, right?
And you can always go back to my neighbor, the guy who sold his business for trash his trash business for a lot of money.
13:10
And and just say he's like, why would I I learn another business when I'm already really good at this one.
He's like I'd have to learn everything from ground.
Why he's like that?
Just sounds hard and stupid and I couldn't really argue with the wisdom of that advice because he doesn't use his business to satisfy his inner personal desires.
He used his business to create wealth, which was the whole point.
13:28
So anyways, hope you found value in this video.
Click subscribe if you did more videos like this to help you make more money mostly Nation.
Keep being awesome.
And I'll catch you guys on the flip side.0:00
Real quick.
Cause you guys already know that, I don't run any ads on this and I don't sell anything.
And so, the only ask that I can ever have you guys that you help me spread the word so we can have more entrepreneurs, make more money, feed their families, make better products, and have better experiences for their employees and customers.
And the only way we do that is if you can rate and review and share this podcast, so the single thing that I have to do is you can just leave review will take you 10 seconds or one type of the thumb, mean, the absolute world to me.
0:25
And more importantly, it may change the world of someone else cuz the proxy halves.
Not good enough and it's really hard to confront.
Welcome to the game, where we talked about it, get more customers how to make more per customer and how to keep them longer in the many failures and lessons.
We have learned along the way.
I hope you enjoy and subscribe.
0:45
One of the biggest shifts that I had is an entrepreneur are going from, you know, making a few hundred thousand dollars a year, a million dollars a year to making, you know, just under nine figures.
Like we do now has been a simple understand that I'm going to try and hit at a couple different ways and hopefully you'll be able to shift your perspective in terms of how you see product and delivery and so right now, if you're not making the amount of money that you want to make, it's because the proxy has not good enough and it's really hard to confront that fact.
1:09
But if you really do and sit here, I can't tell you the amount of times I talk to entrepreneurs and they're like, man.
Just had more people more people to just find out about my product.
Then all my problems will be solved, but the reality is that if you have any amount of customers then people already have found out about your product and for one reason or another, they have chosen not to tell anyone else about it and you have to sit with that for a second if the realize that like people have found out about your product and they're not referring people and you have to ask why, why are these people not sending me business?
1:37
And so, one of the one of the first times, I heard a statement that I really liked about this was from Dan Kennedy and he said, Most small entrepreneurs, try and get customers to make sales.
Bigger entrepreneurs.
Try to make sales to get customers.
1:53
And the difference is one person is all about trying to get to the money as fast as possible.
What do I need to say, to get this person?
Say yes.
What I need to say, to get this person to, by right?
How do I get the money right?
The other way, is, how do I make some sort of exchange so that I can now create a long-term relationship with this customer and continue to provide value over time.
2:10
One has a compounding View and perspective on time and value in.
The other is short-sighted and I can tell you the difference between the people who are Millionaires that I have that.
I'm friends with and people who are billionaires that I am friends with this is probably one of the most fundamental differences and so I was talking to a friend of mine who's worth over a billion and he was saying he said, if it's not going to grow on its own over time, it's not worth doing.
2:35
And I really sat with that for a second and it was like if if I if you put in a one-time effort, like this is what this is how people who are the ultra-wealthy.
Think if you put one-time effort into something and it compounds over time and that is an Enterprise or a product that they want to continue to invest in on the flip side, if you have to consistently show up and consistently promote and consistently, get out there and sell and sell and do all this stuff.
3:00
Then what ends up happening is that the product itself is not good enough, right?
Because people In and of themselves are not referring business.
And so let me let me give you three questions that really changed, and hopefully will alter your perspective.
Like they did mine around product and service.
3:16
And so the first is, if I have an existing product or service and I were to make it 10 times more expensive.
So really think about the price so or you can say a hundred thousand dollars or a million dollars.
Whatever it is right.
Just huge number.
And if that's how much are we charging for it?
What would I need to do?
3:32
What would the experience need to be?
What would the product need to deliver in order?
For it to be worth that much.
What happens?
You start thinking in a very different type of mindset about how much value you have to create, right?
And so, that is the first question that I asked.
3:47
There's two more in the third one's, my favorite, I'll get to in a second.
The second question I ask is, if this product that I have cost one tenth as much as it does right now, but I had to make it better than it.
Currently is what would I need to do?
What one time asked, it's what I need to create.
4:03
That would consistently provide value that I could do.
At scale, that could I could do profitably, right?
So, Hey guys, real quick.
If you're new to the podcast, I have a book on Amazon called 100 million-dollar offers that over eight thousand five star reviews.
4:20
It has almost a perfect score.
You can get it for 99 cents on Kindle.
The reason I bring it up is that I put over a thousand hours in the writing that book and it's my biggest gift to our community.
So it's my very Shameless way of trying to get you to like me more and ultimately make more dollars to that later on in your business career I guess a partner with you.
4:36
So that's my give go check it out Amazon and back to the show.
First question, If This Were 10 times expensive or a hundred thousand or million dollars is what I charge for my product, what would it need to be?
What would the experience need to be?
4:52
And what value would I need to deliver in order for it to be worth that much?
The second question is if it were one-tenth the cost but I had to make it better than my current product or service.
What else would I create or do or make in order to facilitate that outcome?
5:08
And the third question, which is probably my favorite, which I think underpins the entire ideology that That I'm hitting on here is if I had a business and I were only allowed to sell one more customer and the rest of the growth of my business had to come from that customer without me, asking as in the, that customers experience was so remarkable was so positive was so amazing that they alone had to on their own volition.
5:34
Tell other people about my service, what would need to happen, What would need to happen to create that experience, and when thinking about, All three of these product frames.
I like them because they kind of hit on different aspects of the product.
The first question, which is a hundred thousand dollars million dollar question hits on value, which is how do I create the most value in the product itself?
5:56
The second question hits on the profit of the product because if it's one-tenth the cost and I have to make it better, this means I don't have to do high-margin one-time investment type things to make the entire product more valuable, right?
So that it's on profit.
So, first is the value of the product.
The second is the profit to me, right?
6:11
As a business owner, And then the third question hits on the experience, which is what's the customer experience, which is everything else that surrounds the product that we're selling or service that we're selling.
Right?
What is the experience that has to occur in order for this customer to become a raving fan?
That the it's so good that they remark about it, they cannot help themselves with remark about it.
6:31
And what's interesting is that every super wealthy person that I know pretty much exclusively talks about product, and usually, the really small people that I know only talk about promotion, and Promotion should really only exists to get your product right?
And then once it is right, then you can juice it and then let it go and take care of itself.
6:51
And the reason that's so important, at least in my opinion is that if you think about the six ways of getting customers, right?
And if you don't know what those are, it's paid media earned media.
So paid me these advertising, right?
And promotions earned media is following.
So right if you have any kind of organic following the third is through your contact list.
7:08
So people on your phone and your email list to set of the, you already own their contact information, the Fourth is through manual outbound, so that's DM's cold emails, cold calls, cold, all of that stuff, where you reach out to people, the fifth is through affiliate so Partners who can promote your stuff and the 6th, which is the most powerful and the only one that compounds is word of mouth.
7:29
So, think about that for a second.
Every of the other five ways of acquiring customers is not compounding.
Those are linearly scaled, right?
It means if you double the amount of outbound people, you have you double the amount of Tumors that you get, if you double your ad spend, you might be able to double the amount of customers.
7:47
You get, sometimes it's less than that, but you get the idea they skill relatively linearly, right?
Whereas word-of-mouth referrals, which is the 6 way of getting customers is the only one that compounds it multiplies rather than is additive.
All right?
If you get two people to tell to people and those people tell to people that it continues to compound and that is what creates Enterprise Value.
8:07
That is what creates an enduring thing.
And that is what, when you spend the extra time to make the Product so good that people have to tell their friends about it.
Then that's where you get the unending scale.
And also is where all the profit is, right.
You'll have to worry about the turn as much because the product.
So good.
8:22
You don't have to worry about the negative reviews because the product so good.
You don't have to worry about customers bad-mouthing you because instead they're telling their friends about how good you are and this has been one of the shifts that has been most helpful for me.
And honestly what I when I look back on my own trajectory how much I talk about promotion in the beginning of my career versus now, I talk so much more about people and product.
8:42
And, and anyways, I wanted to share this with you because it was, I could tell you how good I am about this kind of stuff.
Anyways, the real nuts of this is that Everything that the ultra-wealthy do is compounding a grows with time.
9:00
We're time become an asset instead of a liability.
And if everything you do, you have to go out and get more business.
Go out and get more business, go out and get more business, right?
It means that it requires effort every single day.
Whereas if you put a lot of front-end effort, which is the investment which is the patient's, right to make the thing that much better in the beginning, then it will pay you in dividends over time and most people skip that step because they just want to make the first sale.
9:25
They're just trying to get a Customer to make a sale rather than trying to make a sale to get a customer.
And so anyways, I hope you found this valuable.
I cover this stuff in my book which is basically freeze 99 Cents.

0:31
That is a saying that we have in my world.
Welcome to the game, where we talked about it, get more customers how to make more per customer and how to keep them longer in the many failures and lessons.
We have learned along the way.
I hope you enjoy and subscribe.
I did business owner reach out yesterday.
0:49
She was doing about five hundred and fifty thousand dollars a month and they were requiring for us to become an acquisition.com portfolio company and the conversation was really interesting so I thought I would share it with you so we hopped on the call and you know, within the first minute or two, you know, after saying hey how's it going etcetera?
1:07
He's like yeah, you know, I had a bunch of clinics and then covid hit.
We took everything too.
Health.
And then, our profit exploded and it's been awesome.
I was like, well, that's great.
And he's like, so, what I'm thinking about doing is helping starting a new business to help Physicians improve their their medical practices and I was just like huh, he's like, yeah, because you know, you did this thing with gym owners and you kind of license your model out.
1:33
I kind of want to do the same thing with with, with Physicians and I sat there and I was like, this is going to be a really interesting conversation.
And so after him going, you know, giving his reasoning Behind this.
I was like well I have no interest in that business at all.
And I was like, let me tell you why.
1:50
I was like, first off, you want to enter a new market, sorry?
An established market place.
That is incredibly saturated.
The value proposition that you have is not based on like a ton of personal experience, right?
You've a handful of examples, it's also not that unique.
2:05
There's plenty of other people who do this same thing.
And so, you want to enter a space, you've never been in, before have a new acquisition system, a value proposition, The certified.
It's incredibly saturated and there's nothing new and I was like, I have no interest in this business and he was like, huh?
And I was like, but what I am more interested in is, why don't you want to take the thing that's making you five.
2:25
Hundred fifty thousand dollars a month that you grew in two years and just take that 25 million a month.
Hey, why aren't you doing that?
And so use like, well, honestly, I kind of got stuck and I didn't know how to how to grow it from from here.
And so, it was such a nice point because there was a pause and I could you do Most like hear him saying it to himself and hearing him say it out loud.
2:46
I was like so let me ask you this if we could go from five hundred fifty thousand islands to you know, to tripling, your amount of customers you have, and go to one and a half million a month, I was like, would you still be interested in doing this whole medical thing?
You know, this other thing that you're telling me about earlier we're trying to teach medical Physicians.
3:02
He was like, oh no, of course not.
I would just want to do this thing and I was like, okay so to be clear, let me restate this because you got stuck in this existing business.
You thought the Soon would be, I will start another business, huh?
Not a good deductive reasoning pattern, right?
3:21
And this is, and this is obviously, very smart individual, right?
And I say this, because all of us, right?
I do this, I do this all the time, right?
And this is going to be repeated theme because needs to be repeated, right?
We need to be reminded more than we need to be taught.
That is a saying that we have in my world and I will, I will pass it on to you guys mozi Nation.
3:38
We need to be reminded more than we need to be taught.
Do the boring work, repeat, successful actions.
And So if he's gotten to this point or if you've gotten to a point in your business and it has plateaued, the question is has it plateaued?
Because this is true.
Like, I have the only reason a business should Plateau.
3:54
That is reasonable, that is not your fault is that you have reached the total addressable Market.
As in, you have saturated the total the total Market of that thing.
So, for example, if you were selling dog food and every dog within this time, you know, maybe you saw a specific type of niche of poodle food.
4:13
You've gotten, you know, 70% of poodle owners to buy your food and you can't grow anymore beyond that, right?
Well, that would be reasonable, but then you'd obviously just do a different type of dog, right?
You'd hop verticals, right?
So there's not even a reason but it would be the only potentially rational reason would be that your Market has changed.
4:35
So, a different examples of friend of mine owns a company that does newspaper advertising.
All right, so they actually help newspapers translate their Heisman sin to digital products, which is pretty cool.
So they are able to sell a whole like, basically a whole new ad product to small businesses who want to buy ads, right?
4:51
Which is, by the way, how newspapers make money.
And so he could not grow his business because newspapers have shrunk by 25% year over year, which is 25% compounding the wrong direction and he's been in that business like ten years.
So now, the market size is like, literally like five percent of what it used to be 10 years ago.
5:09
And so as a result of that, he was growing at an inverse rate to the The shrinkage of the of the industry, right?
And so he got to a point where you couldn't grow any more than just basically servicing the ones that are still alive and then as they fell, so did his business, right?
5:25
And so that is the only logical reason that a business can Plateau.
That is not in your control and unless you're selling newspapers, which you're probably not.
The reason is much simpler which is you just don't know how, and I'll tell you a different story that I had and then I'll wrap this up at the end.
So I was having a different conversation with a woman.
5:43
Who is doing, I think four million dollars a year and she was selling info products that were weight loss.
I like wheel off in some info products so like programs and ebooks, and things like that, which is cool.
Righteous, big following.
All I kinda stuff and we got I want I did a podcast with her and after I got off the podcast she was like, yeah.
6:01
So these are my plans.
I'm going to be doing like an apparel line and supplement line and cream line and whatever, right?
And I just kind of sat there and I was like I think that's a terrible idea.
She was like, she just looked at me cross-eyed like what I was like.
Yeah, I think it's a terrible idea.
6:18
She was like and I was like, why don't you just take the thing that's making you four million dollars and make it make you ten million dollars when you do that?
And the answer is the same as the first answer, I just don't know how and I was like, right, why don't we solve that problem?
And then not create a new business.
6:36
Why don't we just put all of our effort in solving that problem and so I'm a big believer and this is the the piece that I want to share with you.
Most nation is that I'm a big believer in the theory of constraints, which means that a system will grow until it is constrained, right?
As a constraint.
Then when you remove the constraint, will continue to grow right?
6:51
Until it reaches another constraint.
And so most people are always, curious are many people ask me.
Hey, Alex, how did you achieve quote so much in quote, such little time or at such a young age and I say all that quotes because so much could be and you Age, whatever.
But I'm saying I'm just I'm paraphrasing, right?
7:07
And I think that one of the things that we have done well, is prioritizing what problems to solve and that is understanding the prioritization of problems.
And realizing that there is really only typically, one or two things that are constraining our growth.
7:26
And by definition, that really only be one thing that's the constraint until we reach.
Another thing that might be beginning to constrain us, but isn't the true constraint yet?
Real quick guys.
If you can think about how you found this podcast, somebody probably tweeted it told you about it.
Should it on Instagram or something like that?
7:43
The only way this grows is through word of mouth and so I don't run ads, I don't do sponsorships, I don't sell anything.
I only ask is that you continue to pay it forward to whoever showed you or however you found out about this podcast that you do the exact same thing.
So if it was a review, if it was a post, if you do that, you mean the world to me and you throw some good karma out there for another entrepreneur.
8:04
Right.
I'll tell you what third story so I had a conversation with a young business owner who is doing about a hundred fifty thousand dollars a month.
And within, you know, a little bit of time, I was able to see that the issue that he had was that he hadn't scaled a sales team, right?
That was the issues that he couldn't scale sales and we had there was a zillion things that he could do to improve his business.
8:25
Could increase his life number of profit.
He could change his pride, his pricing model, I think there were some things in his messaging that were off, but at the end of the day, the thing that he hadn't done was that he hadn't scale, sales team and so we ended up circling back two weeks later and he was like, Hey, you know, I was To know how I can like get the most out of this that this phone call with you.
8:46
And I was like, well I have you have you scale the sales team and he was like, no I was like well then we don't really have anything to talk about because there's nothing else that matters right now besides this and it took like two or three reinforcements of that message.
Until he was like, you're really not going to do anything else.
I was like, no, because it doesn't matter.
9:02
It doesn't matter.
That's not the constraint right now.
Sure.
You could improve your prizing.
Sure you could do these other things, but the thing that is stopping this business from growing, is that you do not have Skilled sales team and you don't have that skill.
So let's phrase the deficiency as a question, which is, how do I learn how to recruit manage and and, and train a sales team?
9:24
Right.
And to the first business owner, the question that I said that he was doing the five fifty a month, who's doing the clinics.
Like the question is, how do I scale acquisition?
And he had, he had a product that was, it's not a lot of be marketed on, on, on Facebook and things like that.
9:39
So he had to do alternative methods and it's like, so the question is, how do I acquire more customers than I already am from a different channel that I'm allowed to?
When you, when we phrase the questions like that, then they become problems that we can solve right, rather than I don't know what to do.
Therefore, I will just start another business, which so many times is, the is the entrepreneurial solution and it's because it feels good, and we think that somehow when we'd start another business, it's going to somehow grow.
10:04
But the reality is and this is what I have found over and over again is that the businesses will grow to the level of incompetence of the entrepreneur.
So if you're a four million dollar entrepreneur, the next business will be a four million dollar business.
No matter what it is because that is your level.
That is yours.
Also, right?
That is there's that is that is dictated or predicated by your beliefs, your traits in your skills and unless you change one of those things, when you start the next business, you will be capped at that.
10:28
And the other reality, is that how many, how many publicly traded companies do, you know, have to our, how many CEOs of publicly traded companies, do you know that are seized a two companies?
CEOs, not Founders.
Elon Musk is the only is the only exception but he's the founder.
He's not the one who's running out, the operator of those companies.
10:45
All right, because literally only one, And he's also a genius in the literally, like the smartest human being alive, but most of us are not Elon Musk.
We're on YouTube right now, we're probably both not be Elon Musk.
All right, maybe we can agree on that, all right?
And so, the point of this is that you can't be CEO of two things, it's hard enough to be in one business.
11:04
Business alone is hard enough, right?
Why make it more difficult and three times as complex but by adding more variables in.
And so I think what most business owners most entrepreneurs can do right now is Simply ask the question and this is usually what I'll start any conversation that I had with an entrepreneur who's reaching out for something, right?
11:25
Or one of the portfolio company CEOs is I'll just ask the question which is whatever the Run rate is at the moment.
Let's say it's a million dollars a month, I'm like what's stopping us from being a 5 million a month.
What's up again?
And until we can clearly answer that question.
There's nothing else we need to do and when we ask better questions, we get better answers.
11:43
Right?
Why am I not growing is different than why am I not doing an extra million dollars a month?
What is stopping us from doing that and if we can get crystal clear on that, we can find the constraint and then we can remove the drink and we can put all of our effort towards that singular problem, and that, in my opinion is how you scale companies quickly.
11:59
Is it appears fast from the outside, but from the inside, it feels oil and clear because we're all focused on the one problem that were solving at this moment, which might be in the beginning.
We need to increase our sales team.
And then once we've increased our sales team, we might say, Hey, you know, we've increased the sales team, but they're not all performing the same level.
12:16
So it's like, okay, we need to have better on boarding and training for the sales team.
Okay, we need to do that, okay?
That's the next problem that we saw when you have consistency in this process, okay?
Now we're doing that but now we're not getting of leads.
Okay, now we'll put all of our Focus here, right?
And so each time there's going to be a constraint and we just have to focus our attention towards the constraint and in so doing Wildy bottleneck and we will naturally grow to the next level.
12:38
And so that has been one of the more valuable lessons that I've had.
And I will tell you that there are a lot of entrepreneurs who are listening this, you right now.
It might be you.
So I might be talking to you right now is that you think you need to start another business or another product line, because you're stuck at a current level.
12:55
And somehow think that this new product line or new business is going to solve the problem and it is not.
All right.

Hey guys, love that.
You're listening to the podcast.
If you ever want to have the video version of this which usually has more effects, more visuals, more graphs, you know, drawn out stuff.
Sometimes it can help hit the brain centers in different ways.
You can check out my YouTube channel, it's absolutely free.
Go check that out, if that's what you are into.
0:16
And if not keep enjoying the show, we desire novelty, we desire challenges.
We want growth, right?
But the thing is that we think growth means new, welcome to the game where we talk about how to get more customers, how to make more per customer and how to keep them longer in the many failures and lessons.
0:31
We have learned along the way.
I hope you enjoy and subscribe.
This video is for all my friends who are doing, you know, 1 million, three million, five million dollars a year and who come to me?
And always like, man, I want to challenge.
This is so boring.
I want to do something new and exciting.
0:48
And so let me tell you a story about my neighbor and so my neighbor had a trash business, all right, trash collection business about as boring as it gets and he sold his business, a few years back for a lot of Money.
I'll just put it that way and I was walking one day and he was like watering his lawn and I was like, hey man you know what's going on and he said I just got out of my non-compete and I was like oh that's awesome.
1:12
So you know what do you plan on doing?
He's like well I plan on doing the exact same thing again and I was like wait what do you mean?
He was like well I plan on starting another trash business and selling it right back to the guys who bought my last one.
And I was like what?
And like he could tell that I was kind of like confused by this and he was like he's like why would I learn something new?
1:31
He's like I already know everything about the trash business.
He's like I'll just do it again and I and it just it just really hit me because I was like, So many entrepreneurs myself included, right?
And I made this mistake so many times early on, in my career, we desire novelty.
We desire challenges, we want growth, right?
1:49
But the thing is that we think growth means new.
When I think that a lot of times we could redefine growth as meaning, we develop the character traits to be able to persist and continue to do the same things over and over again, right?
You don't you don't see these real estate Moguls.
For example, being like, man I've built, you know, twenty million dollars in real estate.
2:06
I kind of just need a challenge, I'm going to start, I'm going to start a restaurant.
Want, right?
They don't do that.
I mean think about how stupid that would sound to you.
You're like dude you're so good at real estate, just keep doing real estate, right?
But I see this, especially in the marketing Community more than anything, is this this need for constant change and, and, and growth and challenge, right?
2:25
But I think you need to redefine the challenges.
This is becoming hard for you because you're getting bored.
So the challenge is learning to a be comfortable with boredom or be, not need it.
Because the business doesn't exist to status fi h.
Internal deficiencies, right?
2:40
That's usually what most of us.
Build it.
We're insecure.
We need connection.
We need.
We want status, right?
These are the things that we build our business to solve but our business doesn't actually need to solve any of those things.
It just needs to provide value the customer and then we try and extrapolate our project.
Our own needs on the business and in so doing break our businesses and make the wrong decision.
3:00
And so let me tell you different story.
So I've had one two, three different guys.
Tell me in the in the internet marketing space who Say, once doing 15 to 20 million others, doing about 10 million others, doing about 10 million a year, probably in the neighborhood of, like, 3ish million in profit per year around there 325, and so each of them on their own reached out to me and said, hey man, I think I'm going to start a software company because I'm I'm not I'm not challenging enough doing this anymore, right?
3:29
And I thought about that and I just thought how kind of hilarious it was.
It's like I've risen to the top of my game.
I'm bored doing what I'm doing and so I'm going to stop doing this and then I'm going to enter a new Arena where everyone else has been doing that for 10 years and there are other kingpins in that Arena and I'm going to try and relearn everything from ground zero and then try and beat them now.
3:49
Here's what's interesting, right?
Here's what's crazy.
If you were to let's say make a hundred thousand dollars a year in your business and you decide that you're going to be a true entrepreneur and I mean you're never going to quit and it means that you're going to continue to do business for, you know, 40 years or whatever.
4:04
Right?
If you were to gain at the same Pace as the marketplace, which by the way when you're smaller is really easy, right?
It's 10% a year.
If you were to grow by 10% a year, by the end of the 40 years, you would have a gazillion dollars, right?
But most people are always trying to beat the market.
When in reality, if you just match the market, you would become extraordinary.
4:22
Ordinarily crazy wealthy, at the end of this game.
But because we are so frenetic.
And we have these insecurities that we project on our business.
And then Force our business to solve our own personal issues, we end up breaking.
The thing that is actually working just fine because we have, these interpersonal needs that we're trying to satisfy and this was very hard for me to learn.
4:40
I'm saying this, because for me, this was a mistake that I made over and over again, probably for the first four years of business.
For me, I tried to make my business off my personal problems, when it really, just needed to solve my clients problems and I needed to do with my own personal, Stuff, right?
And so, one of the things that I wanted to give you was the ways that I create challenges for myself within the business without destroying the business.
5:04
All right.
So let me give you two different things that have been complete life savers for me.
So I have desires for Innovation.
I have desires for new things, right?
And so, where to channel that, it's not to create new businesses where to channel that is to create new friends or new back-end.
5:20
So meaning like, how can why change the hooks?
How can I change the creative?
How can I change the, a daityas, the marketing?
The, the front ends that bring people in.
Because the more variety of there, the more different types of avatars I'm going to attract and ultimately grow the business.
So you can use that entrepreneurial add, but use it in a way that's going to serve you, right?
5:38
And serve the business without rather than Breaking the business, right?
Whereas if you start creating more businesses to satisfy your add, then what ends up happening is, well, you know, you have lots of businesses and you don't have any money and so that's the first thing.
The second thing That I do, that will walk you through is understanding constraints, all right.
5:56
And so I one of the one of the lessons that I've learned over the last 12 months is multiple metrics for success.
And so I'll dive more into that in another video.
But basically for a very long time in my life, the only metric for Success that I had was how much profit and how much increase in net worth I had at the end of the year, that was it.
6:13
So I cared about and I think that as we've gone to the point where like an increase in net worth the marginal utility of more money meaning like the amount of extra A good that I can purchase or that more money can purchase me is very, very little, right?
There's nothing that an extra ten million dollars or an extra 50 million dollars is going to purchase me that the first, you know, 50 is a my me right, there's nothing right that it can, there's nothing that I can't already get, right?
6:36
And so, when you think about things like that, right?
You would it forces you to do is create different ways to win, right?
Because it's a game, right?
If your entrepreneurial then you all you should, especially if you become more successful.
You'll see it as a game, right?
6:52
So you have this game that we're playing and we have these metrics for Success.
That originally are just increasing net worth, right?
But then you could say, can I increase my net worth and have a good marriage?
Can I increase my net worth and, and be in shape, right?
And so, one of the constraints that I'd like to offer you as a challenge to give to yourself, so that you don't get bored in the business that you have is a constraint around time, right?
7:15
And so, that was one of the things that I did over the last 12 months was like, okay, I want to build something that does a Billy.
Ian dollars a year in Revenue which is the goal for the portfolio and transparently we're not there, you know, where to about 85 million dollars a year across our portfolio.
So we're still a little short but it's a good thing to focus on.
7:36
A Mossad agent quick break, just to let you know that we've been starting to post on LinkedIn and want to connect with you.
Alright.
So send me a connection request.
A note letting me know that you listen to the show and I will accept it.
There's anyone you think that would be should be connected with tag them in one of my or Layla's posts?
And I will give you all the love in the world.
7:52
All right, so let's get back to the show.
Now the thing is is that I don't want to make and the way that I have to make that is it I can't not going to outwork to get to a billion.
Write it you have to make good decisions and you have to let compounding work in your favor, right?
8:09
Because if we have 85 million and we give grow by 10% a year in, you know, 20 years will probably be there, right?
And so well, let's see a doubling would happen every seven years.
So 21 years would be double double double.
So that would be 2 4 8.
So 8 times 85 know, we'd still be so we need another double.
8:27
So we'd have to play 28 years from now.
We could be it if we just grow at the market rate, which is pretty encouraging.
I think so.
I think we can beat the market rate.
But anyways, the point is, adding constraints makes the goals far more interesting, because I think the first level of achieving any goal is learning how to sacrifice everything to achieve the goal, which I think candidly.
8:45
I don't know many people who are super successful who haven't done that, you have to be able to put everything you have on the altar of success and sacrifice it for what you want.
Some people may not like that idea and that's fine.
I don't, I just don't know people who are Ultra successful have done that.
And the reason they are willing to sacrifice everything is because the deficiency they have in their soul is so great that the pain they're suffering from is like for not having the thing is so great that the put everything else on the Altar for their success.
9:07
And I know that I did that first hand and so I remember even when I when I was growing growing into this entrepreneurial role that I didn't tell myself, I'm gonna outwork everyone because I didn't even think that was realistic, I said I was out sacrifice, everyone's one of my competitors are going out to dinner when my competitors are hanging out with our kids and my competitors are hanging out with their wives or being good husbands.
9:23
I was like, I will get ahead.
That was what I told myself and it worked worked.
But at a certain point and this is why multiple metrics of success are important.
The new goals that I'm setting have constraints on it because anyone can just sacrifice everything to get what they want.
9:39
But the question is, can I build a billion dollar a year Revenue portfolio working two or three days a week, right?
And can I do that?
Also, while being in competitive, you know, competitive shape physically, right?
And working out one to two hours a day because I like it.
9:55
Can I do all these things?
And so this is kind of the new levels of challenge.
I'm doing rather than trying to break what I have and going doing ten other new things.
It's like can I add constraints the existing game to make the game more fun for me without breaking the machine because ultimately like the machine doesn't serve to it doesn't exist to serve me it exists to serve the customer and making sure that I don't complete this new things has been a very valuable asset and so, you know one in the very beginning for me.
10:23
I'll tell you the story when I when I started the first time where I really saw success was when I learned how to sacrifice us to us saying sacrifice earlier.
So I'll tell you how I actually learn how to do this.
So when I was in college, I ended up pledging a fraternity and it was a very hard pledging process hard being like time-consuming.
10:41
Right?
And I think we had to basically every hour of the day - three hours and - class time.
So we had three our study hall and we had whatever our class time was all the rest of the time we had during the day we had to be at the house and doing chores and stuff.
And so that was pretty miserable and that wasn't like, you know a ton of fun.
10:57
Um, but what ended up happening was, I end up getting really good grades that semester in college, and it was because they forced me to do three hours a day, every single day, of homework.
And if you do three hours a day of work every day and this is what I realized in college, there's the days that you don't have work to do if you still work three hours, you get ahead on a future work.
11:16
And so I realized that for only 3 hours a day if I just did that.
I would I think that that semester I got like a 383 or something like that.
And and so what I did after I finished pledging was I realized that all these extra hours of the day were mine.
And so what I did was I was like, well if I can just study all the rest of the hours, then I should do really really well.
11:34
And that ended up being a really good.
A really good.
Methodology was I just sacrificed all of my day.
So I basically went to the gym, went to the library and went to class, and that was it.
And I, that was it.
I never worked past 9 p.m., and I went out almost the nice the week, but by always doing it that way, not wasting my time, I ended up doing Really well.
11:54
And it was the first time I ever learned how to sacrifice everything, which was everything else.
I just didn't do anything besides work, work out and that, you know, and go to class like that, was it throwing day?
And so, when I started applying that same kind of concept to business, it was actually fairly easy for me because I was so used to sacrificing everything.
12:12
I just switched over what I was sacrificing for and I think that you have to learn how to sacrifice first in order to learn how not to sacrifice later.
Right?
Because a lot of people are like, why would I want to The success you have or whatever, but I don't want to sacrifice X y&z.
12:28
I just I think you can say that.
I just don't know anyone who's done it.
It's kind of like saying, I want to get over the whole that money has on my life except I haven't made any money.
I think you have to achieve something before you can give it up, right?
I mean Buddha who who gave up his his worldly riches.
12:44
Like he talks about you know he walked the middle path because he had been extremely wealthy and a prince and then giving it all up and lived as a poor person and then walk the middle path.
And so I think that in order Order for us to walk the middle path in life.
We have to have achieved the thing.
In order, we have to achieve Mastery over the thing before we can truly Master it and mean and give it away, right?
13:03
And that's how we can eliminate the desire desire for the thing because we truly know what it's like to have it, right?
And then that means we can truly know why we don't need it and so I think that's how I know it's it didn't mean to get 100% business philosopher on you, but but that's that's kind of where I think this goes full circle.
13:19
So big picture here.
Multiple metrics of success, don't change your business just to challenge yourself.
Find new ways to either create front ends or new product lines or things like that, within your business that can satisfy your add.
And if neither of those things are what you want to do, then just use constraints to create challenges in your own business, that improve your life and other ways, right?
13:42
And you can always go back to my neighbor, the guy who sold his business for trash his trash business for a lot of money.
And, and just say he's like, Why would I learn another business when I'm already really good at this one.
He's like, I'd have to learn everything from ground when he's like, that.
Just sounds hard and stupid.
13:59
And I couldn't really argue with the wisdom of that advice because he doesn't use his business to satisfy his inner personal desires.
He uses business to create wealth, which was the whole point.
So anyways, hope you found value in this video.

Hey guys, real quick.
So Leyland are definitely working on our social media presence.
If you guys haven't noticed and we're just breaking now into LinkedIn.
All right.
It's not as bad as I thought it's actually pretty awesome so far and you guys have been really cool in there and people are sharing our stuff a lot.
So if we aren't connected on LinkedIn, it go ahead and let's connect and let's rock and roll.
0:17
You want to take your passive things and make them more active in order to increase your returns.
And that's a very tempting thing to do because we are entrepreneurial and we can see where the margin is getting lost.
Welcome to the game.
Where we talk about it, get more customers how to make more percussive.
Esther and how to keep them longer in the many failures and lessons.
0:32
We have learned along the way.
I hope you enjoy and subscribe in this video.
I'm going to show you how to take an active business and make it into passive income, right?
So the goal that most of us entrepreneurs have right is to is to is to have freedom, right?
So we want to not work or not have to work and have money coming towards us.
0:51
And the thing is, is what I have learned is that you can make anything passive and you can make anything active.
And one of the difficulties for entrepreneurs when you switch from entrepreneur, Investor, is that you want to take your passive things and make them more active in order to increase your returns and that's a very tempting thing to do because we are entrepreneurial and we can see where the margin is getting lost, right?
1:10
But if you always chase time, then you'll always be able to make whatever it is.
Like if you chase time, always then eventually you'll end up with all your time and you should have some leftover that is coming towards you, right?
And so I'll give you a quick example.
So, Jim launched, two years ago, I think mates, it made 17 million.
1:27
I mean, according to our quality of earnings, we made 17 million in profit.
It in 2019, 2018, 2018 season 2018.
And this year, we'll probably do eight million in profit.
So you're like, whoa, you cut in half.
Here's the difference.
When we did 17 million, I was the business.
1:45
It was 100% Alex's face wrapped with a monetization structure wrapped around it.
I was taking calls.
I was doing all of these things.
I was definitely CEO.
I was definitely in front of the marketing.
I was also the product.
I was doing all those things, right?
Right now, the business basically generates half the profit, but, Involves me for about 90 minutes a week and so my dollars per hour significantly higher.
2:05
Because now I also have all these other things that I can do with the time that has earned back for me.
And so, what I want to walk through in this video is kind of the process and how to do it, and when to do it.
And so, one of the issues that I see people starting out and when I say starting out there, you know, making a million three million etcetera is that I'll get messages from them and they're like, dude, I think I'm ready to Outsource my business and I'm like, but why?
2:28
Like, I don't think you've gotten to the.
I mean, it may.
Maybe maybe somebody who's at zillion, you know?
So this to me, like, why are you doing that now?
But I think for me, I would my answer would be like, I've achieved the wealth that I that I want.
I don't need to gas it anymore and now it's really using a different metric for Success, which is like, how much can I spend?
2:44
You know, how much time I spent with my life, my wife, how much time going to spend whenever I want in the gym, working out eating this stuff.
I want to eat etcetera, right?
How can I have other metrics for Success spending time?
You know, meeting people Etc and doing stuff like this which I never did while I was growing the business.
Not in this way, right?
3:01
And so anyways the thing that I see people do is they try and jump out of the CEO see too soon but what I want to do is give you a mass model for how to do it when it's right, right?
Because ultimately if you can turn your active income into passive income, I just love this quote.
You get paid on what you do.
3:18
You get Returns on what you own, right?
Jim launched as an Enterprise as far more valuable or my fitness companies, because there's a couple, there are far more valuable now than they were one of eight Seventeen million dollars in profit because then no one would ever buy it.
Right?
Because no one's going to buy me, right?
It's just a bruise, A personality brand.
3:33
Whereas now it is an Enterprise that generates Revenue by providing value to customers on a consistent basis and I have nothing to do with it and as a management team in place etcetera, right?
And so, as we make these transitions, right, going from CEO to owner, you have to go from active to passive.
3:49
So this is the mental framework, that that, it took me a really long time to discover when figuring this out.
Alright, so think about your trajectory as an entrepreneur, right?
So first you start, you do everything.
Right.
And then all of a sudden you start delegating out the things that are the lowest value TimeWise, right?
4:04
If you can pay someone $10 an hour or 15 dollars an hour to do, you know, ten dollars, ten hours a week of your work, then you get 10 hours back and then you can put higher value skills in those 10 hours and then make more money and then fundamentally that's literally what entrepreneurship is just arbitraging time over and over and over again and then leveling up your own skill set.
4:19
So that with the time that you get back, you can provide you can do more valuable things.
And that's I think one of the bigger issues that I see a lot to is that people will Outsource their time and then not fill their time back up with highwomen.
About your skills right now.
If that's what you want to do for lifestyle-wise, that's cool.
But like in terms of the game, if you seek to grow then you need to re-read put more things in your stack and take the extra ten hours and do something even more valuable.
4:41
Maybe it's marketing again or learning a new channel or improving the product or whatever it is.
It's more valuable than maybe Frontline support right or whatever.
And so the idea here is going from active to passive.
And so, as I was saying, when you replace that role, right?
4:58
What you did is you got time back All right.
And so if you do that enough times, you're always, you know, doing the next thing.
But here's what's kind of funny and this is the mental framework that I want to give to you.
Imagine.
Like, let's say, you look back at what you were doing a year ago and it probably should look different than what you're doing today, right?
5:16
Hopefully, if you're if you're growing your business, what you're doing?
Then versus what you're doing now is different.
Most Nation real quick.
If you are a business owner that has a big old business and wants to get to a much bigger business, going to fifteen hundred dollars.
5:31
Plus, we would love to talk to you and if you like that or like to hear more about it, go to acquisition.com, you planning on the page and talk to one of our team and see if we can help you get there.
So if you look back to what you were doing then, and you see the progress that you made to what you're doing now then rather than saying, okay, well in 12 months, I'm gonna be doing all these things and all these things are gone.
5:54
If you can actually jump two steps forward then your business could be 100% growing at the same Pace that is now with somebody doing both of these things that you were doing and then you just owning it all right.
And I know that you're like wait what does he mean?
I'll try and explain this again.
So this is like if you can understand this concept it will set you free and allow you to turn your active income business.
6:14
Businesses into passive income things that you get Returns on these become assets to become celibate.
One of the number one issues that people have is like you can't sell personality Branch.
You can't sell their own businesses because they're so integrally involved in them, right?
And this is one of the mistakes.
A lot of people make especially smaller entrepreneurs is there like you know my business makes let's say three million dollars a year right?
6:32
And net profit.
Well if it would cost, you know, a million and a half to get all of the leadership and Executives in order to do all the stuff that you're doing, which is which is very realistic.
You might need 45 high level Peter's to do that stuff.
Then your business is actually making a million or a million-and-a-half in profits.
6:50
It's actually half as valuable.
So you're doing a million and a half dollars a year of payroll work because you're getting paid for that and then your business is returning, you an extra one and a half million.
So your your total as a person or knitting 3 million dollars but the business is generating 1.5 and you are generating 1.5.
7:06
If you can delineate that concept it will serve you very well in business and especially with the concept I'm saying right now.
So the idea is What we want to do is take two steps forward from where we're at right now, not one because if you take one step forward you delegate what you're doing now and then you start doing the next thing, right?
7:23
That you need to do but if you do get what you're doing now and then you get someone else to do the thing that you should be doing next.
Then you can take a step back and now you're owning the business while this person.
Now, does the thing that you were doing before and that is ultimately how you can take your active thing and turn it into passive.
And now you're an owner who looks at the Enterprise and then was crazy about this is that you can actually see the weaknesses of Your own business far better.
7:46
When you're outside of it, looking in and see, you can see the marketplace better, you can see what your customers are saying better.
It's you just get so much more perspective and then you really become the chairman of the board.
And then you're really meeting with the CEO and you're talking to see about their direct reports, how they can improve as a leader and what they need to do in order to kind of like and help them cast The Vision for the company, that's really it.
8:08
And the thing is the vision to change that frequently and so you need to be smart about why you're choosing to go in the direction you are.
But once you've made the decision, there's Not a lot of change that has to happen, right?
It's really like how can we execute consistently to get there?
And so big picture to wrap this puppy up, if you want to go from business running to business ownership one.
8:29
Don't do it too soon.
And this is the probably the number one mistake that I see people make is that they do it too soon to if you are going to do it then if you can think about what you get paid on versus what you can Returns on, then you can separate what you do versus what you own within the value that you have in your own network.
Like you are valuable because you have skills I own about like I love this quote, I'll say it again.
8:50
Poor people do the wrong things, rich people do the right things, wealthy people own the right things and so if you can think through that within your own life, it's like, well, I need right now.
You're probably doing the right things and you own some of the right things, right?
But you're doing both of these things you're getting paid here.
9:06
You're getting paid here and getting returns here.
So we want to put someone in place to do the things that we're getting paid for and then continue to keep the things that we're getting Returns on a mind, you at some point.
That means that might you might lose half of your income.
If If it's 50/50, right?
If if your business makes you a million dollars a year and then you make a million dollars, you're working your business and the business you two million.
9:26
Then you quitting right quitting and and hiring somebody else to do this thing because you take two steps forward.
If you do that, then all of a sudden you'll get a pay decrease, but your dollars per hour will go up your Enterprise Value.
Go up because now it is something that is sellable that operates without you, all right?
9:43
And so that actually means that your net worth increases even though the the quote profit of the business decreases and then here's what's cool.
At once you've done this right once, you've eliminated the step and now you just own the thing that you get Returns on.
Now, you can focus on how can I, how can I increase Revenue here?
Trying to put more fingers on my, on my right here, right?
10:00
How can I increase the revenue that I'm making here without me being involved?
Because it's all about the constraints that we can put on ourselves.
So if I can increase the revenue without me doing anything, how would I do that?
And then you ask better questions and then you get better answers.
And then that is also only how you can grow the wealth of the business without you spending more time or making more trade-offs that you don't want.
10:20
To make because you got in this game for Freedom, right?

What's going on, everybody?

On Amazon, the Kindle book is 99 Cents.
The audiobook is Lowe's, they'll let me put it on for it, so I think it's 12 bucks.
So enjoy that and let's start the podcast.
One of the ways that people try to deceive you into thinking that they have, a more valuable business, welcome to the game, where we talk about, how to get more customers, how to make more per customer and how to keep them longer in the many failures and lessons.
0:39
We have learned along the way.
I hope you enjoy and subscribe.
In this video, I'm going to talk to you about the seven, most common ways that people measure, or measure the value that they are providing in business.
And to the marketplace, this is kind of the eggplant measuring contest if you will of entrepreneurs.
0:56
And I want to tell you, which ones are BS, and which ones are my favorite in the, in the remainder of this video.
Alright, so the first and possibly, the most BS way, especially in the information, space of measuring, this is on contract value.
All right.
That's when someone says, I like to call this marketer math.
1:14
And that's when someone goes to an event and you know, pitches something of some sort and gets people to sign up for a one-year program, for example.
And you know, that means that people are paying monthly.
But when they say hey, we did two million dollars in sales, right?
The real tour that we're doing two million dollars a month right there, extrapolating, a single month, that's a one-time event based on contract, value in the future.
1:34
That's a no, a guaranteed, right?
And so in the reality, they might have signed up a hundred people at twenty-five hundred dollars a month.
And in their minds.
They say we did too, we're doing two point five million dollars a month.
So, in your mind, you're thinking, oh, this is a 30 million dollar a year Revenue business, but in fact, they literally only added two hundred fifty thousand dollars a month in one month that they did and they have probably lots of turn and people leave.
1:57
And so, one of the ways that people try to deceive you into thinking that they have a more valuable business is that they will tell you the contract value.
And so on the BS almond, her of this one actually, I'll write them at the very end so it'll be a little bit fun.
All right.
So number two, so we've got contract value.
2:14
The next one is revenue over a Lifetime, right?
So that is the total amount of sales that was, that was collected right now.
Mind you the different like, in terminology Revenue versus cash, collected are two different terms.
Most times people use them interchangeably, they shouldn't be used interchangeably.
2:31
But for the purpose of this video, I will talk about revenue from a perspective of cash collected.
All right, and so Revenue over lifetime is basically Saying, all right I've been in business for you know 10 years and over those 10 years, we've done, you know, two million dollars right.
2:51
Now that sounds impressive because they have an award and it says I've done over a million dollars in sales of my business.
But the reality is they were doing two hundred thousand dollars a year.
And if it was a business let's say they ran 40% margins.
You need they mean it means they were making eighty thousand dollars a year for 10 years which you can do just driving Uber and not have any of the stresses Of running a business.
3:12
And so I find this one kind of funny but it is one of the ways that people talk about business Revenue, all right, and I'll get to, I'll get to reading these and some of the pros and cons of the end, all right?
So contract value is number one, lifetime lifetime.
Revenues number two, number three is business, valuation.
3:31
So that means how much is the business worth to the marketplace.
So if I were to sell my business today, how much is that worth?
Now this is actually fairly common, especially in more publicly traded companies.
That's where you get the CEOs, like Jeff Bezos has his personal.
3:47
Net worth is based on the business valuation, right?
That means that if someone to buy the business today, what were they value at?
And a lot of that is taking the profit of the ibadah at the end of the year, which is earnings before interest tax.
And where does Asian, right?
Um, and appreciation and and extrapolating that on a multiple.
4:06
So it's like, if I have if I'm doing a million dollars a year in ibadah and I might say that in my particular industry.
Let's see, we're growing so we'd get a higher multiple because they're buying discounted, cash flows are future earnings.
Let's say that on that multiple I get 10 times, right?
So I might say, I have a ten million dollar company.
4:22
When in fact I'm only doing a million dollars a year in profit that's not necessarily incorrect.
It's just a different way of measuring the value that you've provided the marketplace.
All right.
Right.
The fourth way of doing this is is is the actual yearly Revenue, right?
4:39
This is starting to get a little bit closer, to reality, in my opinion, for most people, because remember, only like one percent plus of business is actually sell, all right.
And so 99 times out of 100, they're not going to sell.
All right, so getting a little bit closer to reality here, we've got yearly Revenue which is how much actual.
4:54
And again, the difference I said earlier between revenue and cash collected for me, I look at Cash, collected revenue and a lot of times, it's just dream.
What they think is going to happen versus what actually will happen, but you're really running how much cash is being collected on a yearly basis in the business.
Alright, so if a company collects, 30 million dollars a year in Revenue than that is, that is, you know what, they want to ascribe their business as all right, the fifth in this little equation.
5:20
Here is your Lee profit.
Alright, so its yearly profit.
That's how much in excess or even outright the end of the year.
So it's a prophet even these aren't Fect Lee exchangeable here.
All right, I recognize that, but for the purposes of this video, this is what's left.
5:39
What's the top of the end of the year.
Now, what's important is that this does not take into account, the fact, you may reinvest a lot of that stuff in the business, right?
So if you have good Returns on Capital in your business and you want to expand etcetera which many businesses do, right?
As long as the return on Capital in your business, is in excess of what you'd get in the in the past of marketplace, which it should be because this is your active business.
5:58
Then this is how people grow wealth, right?
This How you grow?
This is literally how entrepreneurs make money is by reinvesting, a certain percentage of the profit into the business because the growth of the business exceeds the growth and they were able to get past belief in the marketplace.
That is the whole entire idea.
And so when people describe how much they make as we're measuring value in the business, how much profit are making per year is one of those ways.
6:20
Alright?
Again, I'll tell you at the very end where I rate these and the pros and cons of them, all right?
The sixth one is owner earnings.
All right, so this is the extraction.
So how much was I as the owner or the shareholders of the business able to take out of that yearly?
6:37
But are your Lee profit?
What kind of distributions am I personally taking right?
Because this is, you know Warren Buffett is famous for measuring that free cash flow which I'll put right here.
Now free cash flow.
All right, he's famous for measuring business is not on this but on this which is well sure.
6:54
What if I have a manufacturing business that's making lots of profit but every three years, I need to invest three times my earnings into buying another Machine, it's like, well, that's not a very fun business because it means that everything I've never actually get to make any money because I consistently have to buy a new machine to stay updated with advancements in technology, Etc, right?
7:11
And so, that is why, this one can be somewhat deceiving versus how much I'm able to take out as a business owner every single year because that to me is the value.
The business phone a reallocate, the capital in other places.
All right?
And then finally, We've got good old-fashioned.
7:27
Net worth.
All right.
This is how much meat as an owner and the reason your life.
Be like, what some of these are kind of different from another.
And the answer is you're right, they are very different from another.
But when you see YouTube videos and you see thumbnails, and you see people describe their business or as they describe themselves, which most entrepreneurs have merged their identities with their business, which I'd encourage you not to do for other reasons, psychologically.
7:48
But people do merge this things which is why net worth somehow also gets conflated with all of these different things.
All right, so let's get to the measurement of, you know, ascribing values to each of these things.
All right?
So if I'm looking at a business, a business itself, I don't care about the lifetime Revenue the business, right?
8:08
I don't care about this very much at all.
It does make really, it makes for great headlines and sexy numbers.
There's one of my other videos that said we did 122 million in Revenue over three or four years.
And that is because it definitely sounds sexier than saying we do 32 million dollars a year in Revenue, right?
8:24
Which is kind of of this guy.
And in case you're curious at the time of this video, actually, I'll share a share at the end of this year, what we, what we did, but I'll say that, I was stuck at mid 30s for three years in yearly Revenue, cash collected.
8:40
And this year, we are breakout year.
So look, stay tuned for that video.
Anyways, the next one.
And this is, this is probably the most BS of all measures entirely because it's completely made up right now, the only And this matters, the only time this would be of any value whatsoever is if you have a type of contract that's 100% enforceable and you have - Turner there were these contracts only go up in value, right?
9:06
But the vast vast vast.
Majority of businesses do not have this because people do not consistently, follow the contracts that they sign up for or they do not have enforceable contracts or they are not secured by anything.
And so that means that these contracts are barely worth the paper that they are written on, which means that they are completely fictitious value and only are for your ego.
9:25
So I would say this is probably the worst way of measuring value.
I would say, the second worst way of measuring value is revenue of is Lifetime, revenue revenue.
All right, so let's work our way down this, this, this ladder here, the next one business valuation.
I actually think that's a pretty decent measure, but the question is, who's valuing it right?
9:45
And how are they, how are they measuring the value?
And someone says, yeah, we're going to get 20 times, Top Line.
It has to take in extremely, extremely unicorn, special business with crazy.
Growth, competitive modes in a fast growth Market that has some sort of unique technology that people think is going to become a monopoly or category King in order to get that type of evaluation.
10:04
But when people ascribe that type of evaluation of their business most times, they're just doing a completely subjectively and making it up because it just makes them feel better.
Alright.
And so I would not get duped into believing something like that.
Now someone says, I believe our business is reasonably valued at five or six times, even though which is this number, right?
10:21
In most cases, that is a pretty accurate.
Comment, if you're looking at business and I really get smaller businesses and might be two to three.
If you're looking at Middle Market businesses, you're looking at six to eight.
And if you're looking at, you know, publicly traded companies.
Well, I mean, if you look at the stock market now that's closer like 30 times and it's nuts right now.
10:39
But for the most part you'll get into the kind of the twenties ranges is kind of more more common and kind of the public markets and you're like what why is that?
It's usually just because there's so much capital and they're so easy to invest in and that's like the ease of access to liquidity and other People's money also increases the valuation because it's so much easier for people to purchase shares of the company, right?
11:00
But from a True Value standpoint, like, the recent business valuations, even interesting is that like you have to think about as return on Capital, if I'm going to buy a company that's doing ten million dollars a year, are less than a million dollars a year in profit.
Well, if I put, you know, if I say that the company is worth 10 million dollars, if I put ten million dollars in, then I'm getting a 10% return on the money right, where this gets all thrown to the craziness which will make it a different video.
11:23
Is is the reason people do a 10x multiple and still make tons of money on it?
And it's all based on Leverage so how they can use other people's money to fund these deals at lower interest rates than it costs them that they're going to make from the business, which is called covering debt, which I won't even get into.
All right?
So first, we have contract value to think is most the X BS Revenue lifetime is really good for your ego, but not really good for valuing a business business valuation.
11:45
If done properly is an excellent measure of the business, but it has to be done fairly with a third party that doesn't have their ego invested in it.
The fourth way is yearly Revenue.
The nice thing about this is that I think it's just this is a top-line measure.
This is a measure of how much revenue our cash has been collected this time defining it over a period of time.
12:05
Now, the reason that I think this is somewhat nice, is it gives you an idea of what kind of volume someone's doing right now?
Because that is why profit, which is the next one.
These ones you want to kind of report on these together, right?
Because let's say someone saying you know I'm doing five hundred thousand dollars in profit might be like God's a small business but if you says well we're Owing and we're doing, you know, a hundred million a year and we just continue to plow all the profit into the business.
12:27
And that's because we have lots of Founders and we want to grow this as an asset because we think are getting Superior Returns on Capital.
Then in that case, then you're like oh it paints a very different picture saying we're doing a hundred million and word and we're quote profiting 500,000 right versus Versus versus you know Million Dollar business.
12:45
That's doing 500 million dollars in Revenue.
Business is suing 500,000.
Alright, that's kind of the difference here.
Now again, I'm trying not to I'm trying to because there's lots of different terms for this, right?
Because if I can take out five hundred thousand dollars in debt free cash flow but there's, you know, 40 million and even in the business but we're plowing all that into growth.
13:00
Then again, the numbers can be a little bit more confusing and if this sounds confusing, that's okay, you'll learn it over time.
But the entire point of this video, I'm going to get to the last two in a second.
Is that you should understand what each of these are.
So that when someone says a number, you can push back and say well what do you talk about specifically?
13:20
You're talking about, you're talking about lifetime Revenue, are you talking about yearly revenue or talk about business valuation and talking contract value of what's people signed, like, what are we talking about you?
But like, what are we talking about here?
Real quick guys.
If you can think about how you found this podcast, somebody probably tweeted it told you about it.
13:37
Should it on Instagram or something like that?
The only way this grows is through word of mouth and so I don't run ads, I don't do sponsorships, I don't sell anything.
I only ask is that you continue to pay it forward to whoever showed you or however you found out about this podcast that you do the exact same thing.
So if it was a review if it was a post, if you do that would mean the world to me and you throw some good karma out there for another entrepreneur.
14:00
Right.
And then I just give you another lens through which to see business so that you can at the end of the day, the goal is to be able to describe your own value to the business.
And so I'll show you what mine is at the very end of kind of what I think through these are the different ways that you guys will see on YouTube.
And on podcast, when people talk about values that their business and their own value, what they'll use?
14:18
All right.
This one.
Number six is net free cash flow.
All right.
So this is near and dear to my heart because Uncle Warren Buffett.
This is what this is what he uses it.
It's good enough for him.
It's good enough for me.
This is how much money is this thing actually making me the owner, right?
14:35
Where the shareholders, how much money is this producing in excess of what it costs to run the business or reinvest in maintaining a competitive Advantage?
Alright.
That's why See's Candy, one of his most famous companies that are required for 25 million dollars and over the course of its over the course of his career has generated over a billion dollars in net free cash flow for him as an owner, which is insane.
14:54
Right?
Think about the return on that investment is because there really was no additional increase.
They had to spend to keep that business.
Competitively Avenged.
It's chocolate right or candies and so there's not like new technology taste buds aren't really changing and so they were able to consistently generate and pump out cash flow for the owners that they could reallocate into other businesses.
15:13
All right?
And the final one, here is net worth.
And the reason I'm bringing this one up is because as many as entrepreneurs like to measure each other's eggplants, right.
And in their business success, which is a totally different thing from now from self-worth.
Right net, worth side note.
15:29
Don't make your software with into your net worth because if your net worth goes down then so too will your soft worth?
And on the flip side, if your net worth goes up and your self-worth goes up with it, then you will become an arrogant prick.
So don't do that.
Anyways, so the final one here is net worth, which is after taxes.
15:47
After, you know, depreciation after everything is said and done.
What is my net worth right now?
Net worth is going to be somewhat tied to business valuation.
If you're like wait some of these are tied together.
The answer is yes.
And if I could make everything Knead into a single number, then I would, but the reason the business World works the way it does, is because there's lots of different metrics that are used to measure value slowly, so that we can get at the intrinsic thing of value.
16:09
What is, what is this worth, right?
And, so, a person's net worth, is going to be a percentage of what the, of the businesses that they own.
Now, if you give a fair valuation to business, right?
There's kind of two aspects to net worth, there's their investable net worth, which is how much do they have outside that they can put into investing into things and Then how much do they have in like their Core Business?
16:31
And I'm describing this purely for Founders and entrepreneurs.
If you're a purely, an investor, then all you're going to have is investable assets that you that you, you know, that you have access to.
And so with net worth, like I said, there's the two buckets.
There's what you can invest in, then what you own in terms of business valuation?
16:47
Oops here.
And so when we're looking at that, I like this one a lot because it's BS free, right?
Because imagine a guy who says, I've done, you know, a McDonald's employee, for example, over the course of their entire career would do a million dollars in lifetime Revenue.
17:05
Most of us would not consider McDonald's employees very well off, right?
And there's nothing against being a McDonald's employee.
I'm just saying from a, from a purely, you know, income standpoint.
It's not considered a very fruitful, you know, income producer right.
But over if you work for 45 years and McDonald's, you'll make a million dollars, right?
17:24
And so they could start selling advice on how to make a million dollars at McDonald's.
Bye.
Your Frontline employee, right?
And so, that is why these things can be somewhat deceptive, and make people think that they are doing better than they are.
And the worst person to sieve is yourself, right?
Which is what oftentimes people are doing with these numbers, which is why I try and be as open as an honest about the numbers that we have everyone in my company's knows what we make.
17:46
And I choose to run our companies that way because I don't like to hide things because, you know, to the same degree, if if expenses go up and profit goes down, I won't be able to see that if we have a Downturn, I want people to see that I'm taking on risk here and I'm paying everyone's mortgages in the meantime, basically out of Uncle Alex's pocket.
18:04
And so understanding this is important.
And so for me, the measure that I do, as promised in the video, I'll separate the final two things here.
So in terms of personal, I measure people not on Revenue over lifetime, or their yearly revenue, or their yearly profit or there, you know, contract value, or any of that stuff.
18:25
I look at net worth and Earth is what is left after everything is done at the end of the day because this is the thing that you were trying to build.
This is the nest egg.
This is the wealth that hopefully will continue to grow and if you do it properly will grow tax-free because you're buying smart and buying for long-term holds without having any intention of selling them.
18:46
And if you buy that way, then you the tax system will incentive is incentivized for you to buying that manner so that you can grow tax-free.
And so, another way of thinking about the tax system is thinking Of it as an incentive system that the macro economists.
Economists of the government have said in place to grow the economy, right?
19:06
The tax system is a penalty system, but it also means that if you're not being penalized or you get right Officer, you get our ways of getting tax free.
It means that those are things that are going to fit everyone.
And so, if you play the game, the way they want, the way they've set up the rules is because they believe that those things are be, the things that are going to grow the economy, right?
19:23
Trying to Arbitrage two things doesn't necessarily grow the economy and so they take Adjective that if you buy things with the intention of investing long term so that you get something that builds infrastructure within the economy, makes everyone's life better off and they do not tax you on that.
And so if you buy things that are going to grow slowly over time or just grow over time in general, with no intention of selling them, then your net worth will grow disproportionately again tax-free and so this is what I look at when I look at entrepreneurs, in general, as I look at their net worth, which is a combination of their investable assets and the businesses that they own percentages of which is the business valuation.
19:55
And as long as that is being done in a, in a truthful, A manner, which is usually going to be a multiple of this guy, right?
Time, 628, you know, if you're mid-market Market being, you know, 10 to 100 million dollars a year in Revenue, then then these are that, that is a fair valuation for most people, all right?
20:13
And so next time you see someone who's you know who's got enough, you can even see this in this, see if I can turn this camera quick.
So I've got this fancy little word here.
Boom.
That's for doing 100 million in sales, through our through our businesses and we got that thing.
November. 20 20 is when we cross that line, since then we've done, I don't know another 30 or 40, it doesn't matter.
20:34
I'll just I'll give you guys the year on numbers later, but the point is that, that seems really impressive and it's a good idea for the business that gives those because it makes everyone see more successful, right?
But what I'm trying to warn you against is don't read too much into this stuff, try and put the pieces together so you can describe your own value to both the entrepreneurs contribution to Society.
20:54
And also the value of the business itself and lots of things to look at.
At are especially these three numbers, four, five, and six, which is what are they actually doing?
Nearly, what's the ibadah in relation to that?
And then how much money can they take out a net free cash flow or earnings after reinvesting in the growth of the business?
21:11
And a lot of times we hear the Silicon Valley stories of, you know, these companies that are worth these crazy amounts, but 99.9% of the times, you know, it's a it's a guy who owns Five dry cleaning shops, right?
Or its somebody who has a digital marketing agency or somebody who has an education business of some sort or it's you And those types of businesses are not going to fetch the crazy evaluations that, you know, Salesforce does.
21:35
Because there's a CRM that will never, you know, people once they get on it, they never leave and they increase in Revenue over time and their contracts are enforceable, right?
And so when you're thinking about these things, you need to basically make up your own, darn Mind by combining these things, and not being fooled by people who will try and exaggerate their numbers in order to impress you, all right.
21:55
And so I've said before, you know, we did, 17.
I think 17 for in ibadah, in 2018.
I think we did three or four the year before that, but I almost take 100% of my ibadah as personal income and that's because in the, by the nature of the businesses that I own those businesses, do not require huge Capital Investments, to maintain a competitive Advantage.
22:21
We do have things that we have to do to maintain a Competitive Edge.
They were just not capital-intensive means, it doesn't cost a lot of money.
For us to say the best at these services to continue to grow.
And that's because that was how I chose to get into business.
That was the game that I wanted to play.
There are certainly other ways to play the game.
22:38
This is just the way that I've played it right.
And since then we've done I think just under just under 50 million in owner earnings that I was able to extract just the last four years and so you can do your own back of napkin math, I'll give you are 2021 year-end number soon so stay posted for that video but otherwise measuring value do.
22:57
Don't be tricked.
Look at these numbers.
And then at the end of the day, the chop of all chops is how much is the net worth of the shareholders and the owners of the company growing in the tax-free?
Stay cool.

Real quick.
Because you guys already know that, I don't run any ads on this and I don't sell anything.
And so, the only ask that I can ever have you guys that you help me spread the word so we can have more entrepreneurs, make more money, feed their families, make better products, and have better experiences for their employees and customers.
And the only way we do that is if you can rate and review and share this podcast, so the single thing that I have to do is you can just leave review will take you 10 seconds or one type of the thumb, mean, the absolute world to me.
0:25
And more importantly, it may change the world of someone else.
What's going on guys?
Hope you guys have.
An amazing amazing day.
So what is one of the hardest obstacles to overcome in all of selling price?
I don't have the money right here all the time and sometimes and most a lot of times it's because the pre-sale and during the conversation leading up to the actual price not enough.
0:47
Pain was engaged we didn't go not like we didn't really establish enough of a need before offering a price or offering a solution right?
We're offering a solution to a problem that we didn't create right.
So someone's gonna be like hey you know it's not really worth it, right?
Because that's really what they're saying is, it's not worth it, something on them.
Is this, their money isn't worth that solution, right?
1:04
And so, I was talking to a friend Nixon deck, who runs the sales team at a lady boss weight loss.
And before that was the number one sales rep at six pack shortcuts 75-minute sales for doing a million plus a month in sales and he was doing all phone sales and we were, you know, you know, I just always well spitball talk back and forth at different obstacles and stuff.
1:25
You say, hey man, how do you, what's your, what's your best to overcome for this, right?
He's like, I'm to our team and we were all playing back and forth and so I was kind of just in sales mode and I remembered In sales mode, like what I would actually say to that, I don't have the price, you know, I don't mean right now whatever it is right.
1:46
And so I call this, we vote with our dollars, okay.
So, easiest way you can, you can at least remember it.
And so it goes like this, I totally understand it first, you always agree, right?
Whenever they say like hey I can like totally understand, you know, one of the things that we found, right?
2:05
Because now you're fucking pass it.
Whenever you want to talk to someone about their circumstances, Dances, you never talk to them.
You talk about someone who's just like them in an identical circumstance yesterday.
Right?
So, I had a girl who's just like, you, same job everything.
And she came in yesterday, we talked about and like, and she actually came up to the same conclusion, which is issued have the money to the program.
2:23
And so I told her a story that they made a lot of sense to me and it was something that really helped me when I started my fitness journey kind of I guess, makes sense of the time, the time investment, the money investment, all that kind of stuff and the return.
A on it.
2:39
All right, mind, if I share it with you.
Yeah, sure.
Okay, cool.
So we tend to vote with our dollars about the things that we care about, right?
Because, I mean, like, we can say that we care about X, Y, and Z.
But what really matters is where we spend our money, because we really care about everything else is just things that we would like to care about, but we don't actually care about them things, we really care about.
2:58
We spend our dollars, right?
And so, if we want to change the things that we care about, we have to change the way we vote with our dollars.
And so there was an interesting story that I was actually, I was with my wife and we were at For Mac or or the makeup stores.
There's a little girl walked in front of shoes.
3:13
She must have been 14 years old and she was there with her friend.
And, you know, the makeup lady was like you need one of these pencils and one of these other pencils and some glue and whatever, you know, like I don't pretend to know what it was that she was buying but it was like, basically, your makeup starter kit and and she's like, okay, now I want you guys to understand that every month you need to start budgeting for this because this is Nothing that like you're going to be spending money on regularly now, okay.
3:42
And I thought that was so interesting because what happened was that expenditure right?
And the girl is super excited about it.
She's like, yes.
I'm like, yeah, totally budget.
Like I like and she was all in and it was because what that did was that purchase Mark, the transition from her going from a girl to extend that accepting the new identity of a woman, right?
4:04
And so with that, new identity came new priorities, right?
And so right now, what we're talking about isn't going from a girl to a woman is going from a woman that's unsatisfied with how she looks in her habits, someone who is satisfied with, she looks in her habits.
Now, she feels, right.
You want to have that fit identity.
4:21
And so, part of that, identity comes with the priorities of where we spend our money, right?
And so, if we really break it down like we're talking about 10 bucks a day, right?
You guys love that you're listening to the podcast.
If you ever want to have the video version of this which usually has more effects, more visuals, more graphs, you know, drawn-out stuff, sometimes it can help hit the brain centers in different ways.
4:45
You can check out my YouTube channel.
It's absolutely free.
So check that out if that's what you are into and if not keep enjoying the show, What can we do?
Because like that.
New identity is also going to come with other savings, you're not going to go out to drink as much.
You're not going to spend as much money on junk food and oxygen is what funny?
5:03
Like that your visits.
Like there's there's a lot of other things that are go along with it, right?
That will save you money.
I promise you eaten chicken and rice is cheap, right?
And and so what we need to do is basically breakdown that it's really just a priorities issue.
5:18
And so once you give them that Epiphany bridge that you can break it down to, you know, dollars per day etcetera.
But that bridge is what shows that it's really the, we vote with our dollars about the things that we care about in all intimately.
It's not a lot of times, it's not a budget issue, it's a priorities issue.
5:35
You can say those words on a budget issue to usually priorities issue.
We have this story with a little girl and what happened is you shifted her identity and with that, new identity came to priorities and so we need to do for you is Bring bring these new priorities along with you so that we can solidify that identity shift so that we can get what you're looking for.
5:55
You're not just trying to lose weight, right?
Trying to become a fitter better person, right?
And that person spends money on health since money on coaching, right?
So that you can be the best version of you so pretty.
Do you guys to struggle the price overcome or like it's not worth it or you know that's that's really expensive.
6:13
It's especially effective on recurring stuff, fronted offers are easy to sell emotionally no matter what.
I feel like even high-ticket front end offer, but it's the recurring, that's the one, especially so many of T selling memberships because what you're doing is you're showing a permanent fix and so with a permanent fix him as a permanent cost and so a lot of people don't like them.
6:30
Front of the rather spend $2000 for 12 weeks then spend 150 a month for the next year, right?
Which is why I think we should price things differently but I'll get in time to the time, but the whole point is that if you have a permanent cost, it's going to be introduced that we need to reduce that with an identity shift in a line.
Priorities with that new With the new cost.
6:48
So hope that makes sense for you guys.
Hope you guys have an amazing day use that we've already had a bunch of guys who are in our launch and Legacy program using it to some phenomenal.
Success.
Just remember like we vote with our dollars with the things that we care about.
And so honestly, like I had the same conversation yesterday with a woman decided to sign up because what we realized what we realize not her, right?
7:07
Not you, we realized was that for her, it wasn't a budget issue.
It was just a priorities issue.
And so here's a story to illustrate that, right?
And so you kind of walk threw it in that way and it's an easier way of getting to the main point.
Close, close close.
7:23
Close, close close.








0:00
Real quick.
Because you guys already know that, I don't run any ads on this and I don't sell anything.
And so, the only ask that I can ever have you guys that you help me spread the word so we can have more entrepreneurs, make more money, feed their families, make better products, and have better experiences for their employees and customers.
And the only way we do that is if you can rate and review and share this podcast, so the single thing that I have to do is you can just leave review will take you 10 seconds or one type of the thumb, mean, the absolute world to me.
0:25
And more importantly, it may change the world of someone else.
I was CEO of one.
Business and so I said oh I'm outside of the day to day, I'll start another business, welcome to the game where we talk about, how to get more customers, how to make more per customer and how to keep them longer in the many failures and lessons.
We have learned along the way.
0:40
I hope you enjoy and subscribe.
So when I was 28 years old, we made 28 million dollars and Seventeen million dollars in profit.
And the next year, I mean, one of the biggest mistakes my business career which was I started another business.
And so what I ended up doing was I was CEO of one business and so I said, oh, Outside of the day-to-day, I'll start another business because there's this big pile of money right here that I can't say no to because I'm a capitalist and I should I should definitely do that and so the next year we did 37 million dollars in top-line revenue and we did 13.4 and profit.
1:12
So my profit went down and murder of a revenue went up.
Now I could try and you know BS you and tell you that it was weary invested in infrastructure and all that stuff and we did.
But candidly it was because starting the business at that time, given the skills that they had was a mistake.
And so what I want to do is talk to you about a conversation that I had.
1:29
Had with my neighbor who was a trash man and he went from trash man to Cashman and sold his.
His business for multiple eight figures and we were talking one day and he was really excited.
I was like, hey man, what's going on?
He was like my knock impedance today.
1:45
I was like, oh well, I mean, what does that mean for you?
You know, he's like, well, I'm gonna start another business.
So I was like, what do you start?
Yeah, this is exciting.
New chapter etcetera and he's like a woman to do the exact same thing again.
I was like what you mean?
He's like, I'm going to build the exact same.
I'm trash company and I'm going to sell it to the exact same company.
2:02
You bought my first company, what you this opportunity to start with all the capital and all the knowledge you have now you will do the exact same thing.
Don't you want something like new and different?
And I was like, no, he's like, why would I start over brand-new?
He's like, I'm so good at trash.
2:18
And I spent the last three years working for the company that bought me.
I learned stuff from them, and I already had my knowledge that I came in with, you know, with my own company.
So, I understand the scale even better than I did before and I know how to start it from the from the ground up.
And what you have to understand about my neighbor is that he's not a warden or Harvard MBA, he's not some like, statistical Math Genius or anything like that.
2:37
He's a blue-collar guy from Wisconsin, who maxed out his credit cards to start a trash business where he literally was the first one, picking up, trash for residential homes in one night.
And then he just scaled that business through word-of-mouth and service with a smile.
And there's a lot of things that I feel like I learned from him, that I see all these people that reach out to me.
2:54
And there's tons of people who are much smarter than I am, who reach out and they're like, hey men, like I've, you know, I've got this, I had a conversation either day with an agency owner, who sorry, an agency coach, he coaches agency owners on how to scale their businesses use at probably five or six million bucks a year.
And he was like I'm thinking about going into General business and I was like why?
3:13
And he was like well it's just I'm people are asking me for you know how out there and it's I'm just turning down money and I was like duh that's the point.
The like a strategy means knowing what you say no to.
And you know, I shouldn't be necessary.
Shouldn't like just because somebody asked me For something doesn't mean I should change my entire business to say, yes?
3:31
Right.
You have to know who your avatar is and who it isn't.
Because otherwise if you try and be, you know, every every what is it, all things to all people.
You're nothing to no one.
And this was a huge mistake that I made earlier on in my career is because I didn't understand the the growth that I had to do was not through doing something different and new and exciting.
3:50
But the growth was going to come for me sticking with it was from developing the character traits of grit from developing the character traits of stick-to-itiveness from Open the character traits of perseverance of focus and I think that at all levels in business, you get seduced by a woman in the red dress, which is the analogy that I like to use because at every level in business, like, if you know the Matrix, there's a woman in the red dress, she walks by Neo looks again and then it's an agent pointing a gun at him.
4:15
And I think that a lot of the opportunities that come around towards us as we scale up, and it happens at all levels of business, every one of them, look, seductive and attractive and at every level, it actually becomes more and more attractive and you have to kind of defeat them, emotionally, Because it's so hard to turn down.
4:30
You know in the beginning you have to turn down ten thousand dollars then you have to turn out a hundred thousand dollars they have to learn it turned out a million dollars then ten million dollars and you know for me it turned out I wasn't able to turn down about you know, 20 or 30 million dollar your opportunity when I was doing about 20, 30 million dollars a year.
4:46
And what ended up doing is it cost me a tremendous amount of time and effort and probably lost growth on my main business at the time because I didn't know what I didn't know.
And so, what I'm training with you guys, mozi nation is hopefully the lessons Lessons that I learned from this, which is you can't be CEO of two businesses.
5:03
You can't serve two masters.
You have to.
If you were the one, running your business and CEO, make no mistake, is the one running the business, even though if you're not doing the day-to-day just because you're like, oh I'm an owner, you get paid for what you do, you get Returns on what you own and so if your business cannot run without you and you're like no it can run without me just because it can run without you for a day.
5:20
Doesn't mean can't they can run without you, you have the attention.
It's the shower time headspace where you're thinking about new ways to improve the business, you're thinking about your threats, you're thinking about Innovation your thing The team members need to Circle back with.
It's the small nuances that create the Excellence in the business that your head space has to be dedicated to.
5:36
And when I split my attention, and I became CEO of two companies, and I always split my term to serve, two masters.
I basically made the same amount of money and I just did this.
And I think what ends up happening for most people is that one of the truths that I've observed is that the amount of money that I make is only proportional to the skill that I have as an entrepreneur period, that's it.
5:55
And so, if you start more businesses, you're just going to end.
Up leveling out.
And so even though it looks like small unattractive, it's a small quick win that were choosing to take rather than confronting the hard brutal facts of why is the business I'm currently doing?
Not growing and if it is growing, well, is there a way that I can grow?
6:12
It better, you know what I mean?
Can I improve the product in a new way?
Can I, there's all these things that we can do to improve the existing business and I'll tell One More Story to drive this home.
So I got reached out to you by a guy that I went to high school with and he owned a general contractor business and so I was like cool man.
Like what do you guys do what you guys specialize in?
6:27
He's like oh well we do a lot of Moves.
We do a lot of roof repairs.
We do new roofs, we do.
He's like, but I'm also doing like real estate stuff and Contracting and flipping and all this other stuff and I was like, man, that's a lot of stuff was like, why are you doing all those things?
And he said, you know, I need to grow the the different revenue streams, the business and I was like, dude, there's, there's like 200 million homes in America that have roofs as like the biggest roofing companies in the world are billion dollar companies as like, why why do you feel like you need to do more things to grow bigger?
6:55
Because what happens is the better, you get the bigger you get yet, it's not the bigger, you get the better, you get better, but gets bigger, not the other way around.
Hey guys, love that you're listening to the podcast if you ever want to have the video version of this which usually has more effects more visuals, more graphs, you don't drawn out stuff, sometimes it can help hit the brain centers in different ways.
7:19
You can check out my YouTube channel, it's absolutely free.
Go check that out if that's what you are into and if not keep enjoying the show, And so the deeper you can sink your roots.
In the more time you can put under the bar, this has been my finding the better, the business becomes and then as a result, the bigger it becomes.
7:37
Because it comes from the disproportionate gains and knowledge.
We get at the end of the track, not at the beginning right in the first, you know, year of whatever business you do, you're going to learn more than you ever will about that business than any other time.
But learning what you learn in the first year, is not the stuff that makes you better than the rest of the playing field.
7:54
It's learning what you learn in the 10th year in the 20th year, in that same business.
To get you, the disproportionate returns.
And so the easiest way to think about this is like if you think about the Olympics because they're on right now or they are, hopefully, when you're watching this, who knows.
But the Olympics, right?
You've got sprinters and if you were the best friend in the world, you win the gold and you might only be one tenth of a second better than the fourth best friend in the world.
8:15
I don't know track metrics but you get the idea right.
And so even though you're only this much better, the real world implications of being this much better is that it's being gold and getting all the endorsements and Nike and Adidas and all that stuff versus being for Earth and getting almost, no notoriety and I think the same thing happens in business, right?
8:31
It's a winner-take-all world are often times and the way that you can combat that is being able to develop the stick-to-itiveness.
It's the grit of understanding that your knowledge will compound with time.
It's using time as an asset, instead of a liability.
It's not being in a rush.
8:47
It's understanding that the growth account comes as entrepreneurs doesn't come from new.
It comes from from doing the same, it comes from volume, right?
Which is one of the core tenets that we have it all of our companies.
Do the boring work, right?
We're willing to consistently confront, the hard fact of like, okay, if we're not growing that, it's our fault.
9:04
It's not because we need to introduce a new thing, it's because we need to confront.
What is not happening.
Why aren't we getting more word-of-mouth?
Because fundamentally if our thing was so good, that every single person should tell their friends, and we shouldn't even have to Market or so, right, because we should be so good at that.
So there's always areas for improvement that we just don't want to confront because it makes our egos feel bad and then we try and use our business to satisfy our interpersonal.
9:23
Needs its try to satisfy our insecurities and the holes that we have.
Because we want to Have more attention.
We want to have more status or we want to have more interpersonal relationships, or we want to have novelty in our life and we use our business to try and satisfy a personal needs.
When in reality, the business is only there to serve the customer.
And so this was one of the biggest lessons, one of the hardest hardest lessons that I've had to learn.
9:44
And to make this to drive this last Point home to make this real for everybody to show you that this isn't me just saying this, when I started my first five years in business, I think I had like 11 businesses And it was only once I chose to commit to one of them that I saw the disproportionate returns in my life and it was through sticking with it for a long period of time where I like I had my chain of gyms.
10:03
Right.
And then at that, after that point I was like, I'm going to start an agency.
So I started a Cairo agency and I started a dentist agency and I started I had another thing I can remember was I going on?
And I had my six gyms and they were all different types of models in different Partnerships.
I was spread so thin, I was all over the place because I kept thinking the false premise, which is one of these things will take off when the reality of none of them will all Any of them could, but none of them will if I have all of them.
10:27
And so, you have to pick and you have to commit.
And the thing is, is that I think a lot of things that come with success, or not, intellectually difficult to comprehend, their just emotionally difficult, which is why most people don't do them.
Most people understand that you have to, you know, spend less than you make, right?
10:43
But no one does it.
Most people know that you if you want to lose weight, you gotta eat less than you burn, right?
But people don't do it.
It's simple, not easy.
And I think that a lot of times in business, at every level of the game, you have a and more attractive opportunity, you have a woman in the red dress, who walks by that you have to say no to because that's what it means to have a strategy and that's where the compounding Returns come from and that of doing more of being able to stick your head down and continue through what you said you were going to do is what creates the growth.
11:11
And so there's a story that I heard about Henry Ford and he was, he was walking his Co office was here and he walked past marketing every day.
And so you walked every day and walk every day, and he would see this campaign that they were running, right?
The after like three or four months he was like, hey John he's like dude why don't you stop running this ad.
11:30
He's like I'm so sick of it and the CMO smiled and looked at it was like we honestly haven't even started running it.
And so we get sick of these things in our business that has nothing to do with the marketplace.
It's only because of our own internal needs.
And so we sabotage things inside our own business because we want to satisfy things inside of us that have nothing to do with business.
11:48
And so, I think what happens is that's why I say, like it's skills its beliefs and it's character traits.
And so, a lot of times I think to get to the next level, we have to look at Ourselves and think, you know, for me, you know, which one of these things do I lack?
Is it a belief about the world that is incorrect?
Is it a trait that I have not developed at?
Or is it a skill that I lack?
12:04
And so I think a lot of entrepreneurs get stuck because what they do is they start doing too many things and they get spread to thing because they like to recreate chaos in their lives because whatever traumatic childhood story, they tell themselves about, you know, how they had chaos in their early life.
They try and recreate it in their business because that's where they feel comfortable subconsciously.
12:19
And you have to unlearn those patterns in order to be able to consistently grow because honestly the businesses that we have are fairly.
Ring.
I'll be honest with you.
They're not they're like they're not like crazy exciting all the time you know like we do the same things, we mark it we sell, we provide value, we get referrals and we try to do as much as that as we can over and over again but that gets boring and that's why do the boring work is one of the core tenets that I have and it's one of the hardest learned lessons that I've learned in my business career because you have to say no at every level and so my goal for this channel Mosey nation is that you can hopefully learn from the many failures that I've had so that you don't have to experience them for yourself.
12:53

And more importantly, it may change the world of someone else.
The reason we get stuck in our businesses because as we either have a belief that is incorrect, we there's this character trait that we lack or there's a skill deficiency.
Welcome to the game where we talk about how to get more customers, how to make more per customer and how to keep them longer in the many failures and lessons.
0:42
We have learned along the way.
I hope you enjoy and subscribe.
If you're stuck in your business, then this video will help you get unstuck.
So this morning, I was reached out to by a business owners in about one and a half million dollars a month in revenue and he was like, hey man, I'm kind of stuck doing what I'm doing and I just don't know anyone who's in my space, who does more than two million dollars a month and he's in the online marketing space, the generalist.
1:08
So, just Mass market and I thought that was really interesting and we had a good conversation about it, and so, I wanted to share what we talked about.
And so the first thing is, I We oppose that Viewpoint.
And I think this is so interesting, because the reason we get stuck in our businesses because we either have a belief that is incorrect, we there's this character trait that we lack or there's a skill deficiency.
1:28
We don't know how to do what we need to do.
We don't know how to be, who need to be.
We don't believe what we need to believe, right?
That's what we think about the world.
And so whenever I'm looking at a business or business owner or myself, and I'm stuck at a certain level, I think.
Is this a belief that I'm lacking, or that that's wrong?
Is it a trait that I have that?
1:44
I need her?
I need to change.
Or is their skill, right?
And a Of times.
It depends on who you're talking to but you need all three.
And a lot of people who are just really good at character development, only talk about tradespeople really good at skill development.
We talk about skills and people were kind of like a little bit more womanly talk about beliefs, but you need all three, right?
1:59
And so, when I was talking to this guy, he said, you know, just no one's knowns in the online space making 12 million dollars a month.
And I thought this was interesting because when I came into the gym space, we start with our first company there is known as making more than three million dollars a year in that space.
And for those who don't know, you know, we grew that company to 30 million dollars.
2:17
R+ It Sweet.
N EXT with the biggest person in the space was doing at the time and so a lot of this kind of like running the four-minute mile for the first time is like just because no one has done, it doesn't mean it's not possible and so you know for this individual is like will break it down to physics, right?
Break it down to like tell me why you think that you can't get past that no one sees me that no one can get past two million dollars a month.
2:40
Like why right?
Is that is it not is there not enough customers, right?
And he's mass-market.
So of course, there's enough customers like so, so Tell me like why can you not do it right?
And so as we're talking about this, I want you to think like think about your business, right?
I get resets all the time, like, hey, I'm doing a minute, you know, two million dollars a year in five million dollars a year after ten million dollars a year.
3:01
I just don't think we can grow any bigger within our market now.
There are real Market constraints, right?
So for example, if you were, if you were serving chiropractors and there's 50,000 chiropractor the United States, if you had all 50,000 of them, then yes, you wouldn't be able to grow in that space and then, A point you could wrote adjacent and so that a point your business will still would continue to grow and it's normal for businesses to go vertical to vertical and expand horizontally in that way.
3:27
But in if you're any Mass Market business or a business that serves consumers in any way, the entire Marketplace is your base.
And so when he said that, he doesn't know anyone who's doing over two million dollars a month, that is a belief issue, right?
I'm like, well, let me give you this one to think with.
Well, if you have 10 competitors, and each of them are doing two million dollars a month.
3:45
And it means that one of you could be better than all of you and make A million dollars a month.
So with that for a second, think about it.
Because when I, when I looked at the gym space, when I got into the very beginning, I looked at all of the people who are out there and I saw that all of them were doing one, two, three million dollars a year.
And so, I was like, if I'm better than all of them then I should be able to do 30 million, I should be able to add up all of their businesses and that should be what my business should be able to do.
4:06
And so, if you think about like that, like, it is 100% that way, how much do people spend on Logistics and, you know, fulfillment.
Right.
How much do people spend in consumer?
Can you imagine Jeff Bezos like in?
In the early days of Amazon thinking to himself like, well, like you just can't get past ten million dollars a year at just can't get past a hundred dollars.
4:24
You're like, there are so many people.
The reason that people get limited is because of their beliefs and the reality is because they don't have one of those three things.
And so with this individual, I first started with the belief I said, Do you believe it's possible that you can get there?
Because like, if we don't have that then nothing can happen, right?
4:41
And so I was like, well, let's just add up all your competitors.
Is there any reason that you couldn't get all of their revenue, right?
Was like well, no, Okay cool.
So that one's done.
Yeah.
Hey guys, real quick.
If you're new to the podcast, I have a book on Amazon called 100 million-dollar offers that over eight thousand five star reviews.
4:57
It has almost a perfect score.
You can get it for 99 cents on Kindle.
The reason I bring it up is that I put over a thousand hours in the writing that book and it's my biggest gift to our community.
So it's my very Shameless way of trying to get you to like me more and ultimately make more dollars to that later on in your business career I push the partner with you so that's my give go check it out Amazon and back to the show.
5:21
Traits.
Well this one is like, are you?
Are you patient enough to see it out with which and part of that comes to the fact of like if you believe you're making a positive impact, right?
And you believe that your product or service, really is benefiting the world, which is honestly, what I think one of the biggest issues is a lot of people don't really genuinely, when they look at themselves in the mirror at night believe that the product is good enough.
5:40
And so subconsciously, they do not push it further than to meet their own.
Individual needs, think about that for a second.
Like, if you, if you've matched your own individual, like, you've capped out, Your ability to spend money and, and like your ability to generate money, the only reason to make more money past that if you're a software individual is because you actually believe the thing that you have is going to help more people.
6:01
And so it shifts from being a self-centered Focus to another Center focused process, right?
And so that person may not have the traits or the like to have the like to do that, right?
And the third is like, he might not be able to grow because he lacks the skills, like you might not have the skills of recruiting somebody to open a new sales Channel.
6:19
You might not have the you want to have the skill himself to do it or the skill to find someone because those are two different ways to think about it.
Like you can always acquire the skill, which is, how do I do it?
Or you can have the, you know, probably the wealthier mindset of like well who can do this, right?
And so that you can make you can approach that.
But as long as you know what needs to happen, then you can find the who now if you are completely unaware, because I get this question all the time, like what, at what point do I bring someone in to like, run my business for me?
6:43
So I had someone ask me this yesterday.
They're making a think like, 50 or 100 Grand a month.
A camera was and I was like, dude.
Like you're just Just starting you don't even like, you're just getting into the game.
Like what's the?
You know, I'd be like you don't need to have like is your market cap?
Is there a reason that you like, why do you want to do this, right?
7:01
And I think it's because they didn't really believe in the thing, right?
That they're selling.
Because if you believe in the thing that you want to, you want to be the one who's driving it, you know, and continuing to grow to over time.
So anyways, all that to say, right now, if you're stuck, right, are you perceive yourself to be stuck?
I would break down.
Is there an actual cap on how big my market is, right?
7:19
And have ice?
100% of my market by so, 30% of my Marketplace.
And if you're in like the 1% of your Marketplace are half a percent or Marketplace or point one, person your Marketplace you haven't capture Market, you just have capped your skill or your beliefs, or your traits.
And so then I would look at okay, well if all my competitors are doing this put together, then there's no reason I can't get all of that or half of that.
7:41
If I were way better than all of them, right?
If you were better because each one of those businesses has a specific way, they acquire customers specific way fulfilling this customers, right?
And so if you knew Knew how to do each one of those things and you did it better than them.
Then there's no reason that you couldn't beat them, right?
And so if you think about that, then then then all of a sudden that should break the limit that you have on how much you can actually make within your current vehicle.
8:00
Then you get forced to look at the other two, which is like, is there a trait that I lack or is a skill that I lack and getting to where I want to go?
And so this was the conversation I had with him at the end of conversations are well I guess I can get this thing to ten million dollars a month Etc.
And was like right.
And so that was the entire purpose of this video is that if you are stuck and you're thinking that you are capped, you might be but it's not.
8:19
Because your Market often times it's because of your beliefs a trade or a skill that you lack and then figuring out which one it is and then attacking it is usually way to go through.
So I hope you found value in this video keeping awesome.
Hope you like my mobile Studio setup.
Your we're rocking the Colorado.
Mountains is beautiful up here and I hope you guys have an amazing day.
8:35

0:16
And if not keep enjoying the show, the two to three gyms you came here were over seven figures and the other one is going to probably hit it within the next three months.
Welcome to the game, where we talk about, how to get more customers, how to make more per customer, and how to keep them longer and the many failures.
And Lessons.
We have learned along the way.
0:31
I hope you enjoy and subscribe.
Hey everyone.
Happy Saturday I am here at Pirate's Cove in Nevada.
And it's sweet.
Anyways, what I wanted to talk to you about today was I have the tiger so I just had our like a 3-day Mastermind type thing with the top sellers.
0:51
So, two to three gyms you came here were over seven figures and the other one is going to probably hit it within the next three months.
So it's really, it was great because it's really higher-level conversation that I might typically have with a much worse which is fun.
And what we talked about was kind of more amorphous, but I think it's incredibly valuable and I think it's probably the one.
1:10
I think that sets apart, the guys who are really winners / cows, who are really winners and the ones who are.
And so, it's really just around hunger.
And what I mean by that, is we like, if recently I had some of our, some of our older OG gym or it's been a while, you know, I mean, they, they turn their gym around the throne there, you know, you know, close to seven figures or right around there.
1:35
And they've been doing it for a while and they were complaining about showing they're like, hey, our show rates are low, and You know, you go through this.
And while you're doing the reminders, are you doing all this above all?
Yeah, we're doing all this up.
Okay, cool.
And I did a little bit deeper and I look, and it turns out that they're only open one hour per day.
1:54
At 7:15, a.m. for their availability.
Availability for new clients.
And I'm like, how the fuck do you think that you're going to grow your business?
If the only time that you can take new customers is that 7:15 a.m. like in what world does that make sense, right?
2:12
Like imagine a grocery store that's only open from 7:00 to 7:30 because that's when it's convenient for the owner.
Like what chance do you think that that that grocery store has at succeeding virtually none.
And so what happens is people have success.
2:28
They implement Tactics.
They use Jim watch and then they make money, right?
And then what happens, they get comfortable, they get complacent, right?
And they lose their hunger.
And so, all that's like, after that point everything, like it's almost, like, almost like after you after you, like, quote, made it in your mind and that's what's funny is that making in some people's mind is like having ten Grand in the bank account.
2:49
So, like, it's scary in terms of what level of making it is.
But like, once people have made it, I almost want to say, like, none of these tactics matter, because you're just not hungry, like it is.
A matter, like the obvious shit you aren't doing, you know what I mean?
Like, like I'm trying to like wrap my head around it.
3:08
Like if your if your child was going to die or your spouse or your significant other, your family member, whatever it was right, who's was going to die unless you succeeded, unless you've got more clients unless you made more money with your gym.
How would you approach it right?
3:24
Would you only be available for one hour a day?
Would you only be available from 7 to 8 a.m. right?
Would you?
Would you would you only set aside an hour a day to prospect for you?
Customers would you only reach out to your customers if they hadn't shown up for a month?
3:41
like, Like sometimes people ask questions that they already know the answer to, it's like duh no shit, right?
And it goes back to the, the main thing, which is like, what drives you, I think, what drives you what drives you to be better, what drives you to continue to want to win.
3:59
And, you know, I was asked that question yesterday by the gentle words that were here and I think, honestly, it comes from a dark place, and I think I've said this before.
But like, I'm saying it again, because I think people need to hear it, like, What?
Sometimes you have to wonder like why is it that only when someone else's life is on the line, right?
4:21
Do you then actually try right?
Like why is it only then you actually cut all the noise out of your life and then would go laser focused on actually succeed, like why can't we do that all the time, really?
Why can't we do that?
Because it will, then I would be happy whatever, right?
4:39
And like whatever happiness makes right and so like the people who are the most successful, What in the world are driven by something that is deep inside of them.
That is normally it insecurity or fear of some sort.
If you were only trying to make enough to live on, you will always only make enough to live on and you will slack the moment you get comfortable and you will wonder why is it that?
5:05
As soon as I start making money, I stopped because you actually don't want to make four That's why you actually don't want to make.
And so your internal motivation is not their life because you've accomplished what you set out to accomplish.
And so the real question is, do you actually want what you claim to 1 right?
5:25
Do you actually want because if you did, you'd already have it, you'd already you'd already be willing to sacrifice other things in order to achieve it.
And that might mean like maybe waking up earlier maybe you like working for to 8 p.m. to take sales appointments or whatever that thing is.
Is right?
5:40
But like, it's just the obvious shit.
Like, if you were coaching you, what would you recommend you to do, right?
Like, a lot of times, if you think about it, like, You most of the time, know what to do like you do on some level.
5:56
Like like you probably know that you're like, man, I do stupid shit sometimes, right?
You probably think that on some level sometimes, right?
Then you like men, if I were, if you could step out of yourself and say I need to coach myself, you probably have the answer, right?
6:13
And it's just that you don't do it for some reason.
And so, all of your attention should be on that reason.
Why is it that this thing?
Preventing me from doing the things that I already know I should do, right?
Most like this last match for my that, I had sort of the, for the top sellers was really interesting for me, because it was the first time that had no one who had extra shit.
6:31
I didn't have any, like everyone.
There had really like clean lives outside like really focused and just focused on doing the things that we're going to grow their business.
And so the conversations are actually really easy and very direct most times.
It's like, okay well here's the obvious hole in your business.
6:50
Yes, but you're not doing anything about it.
So let's attack why you're not doing anything about right?
And so then I have to spend the next hour and a half digging into why they're not doing anything about it.
Which has much more to do with, how they manage their head space and how they manage their relationships and how they manage their, you know, because what ends up happening, is they start focusing on the business, the personal life goes to shambles and then they then are like, oh my gosh, my personal life is going to shambles, I need to stop paying attention to my, my business, they go to pay attention their personal life and their gym explodes.
7:20
Right?
It's just this this consistent cycle because they just don't know how to just do both right or they don't know how to prioritize these.
And so all this to say like, It's just like how hungry are you like how willing are you to put in what you need to achieve like and if you're not then that's cool.
7:40
Then just to stop stop saying you won.
Yeah.
I mean, just be like I only want to make ten thousand dollars a month.
That's it.
It's like cool.
Then just say that and be good with it rather than constantly complaining about how you're not.
Because you're not even willing to do the things that that you already know you should do like, like, right now.
7:58
I get on the phone with Jim owners are like I know I should work when leads harder.
I know, I know I should go through the sales training.
More like I know, I should, you know, go through the portal.
I know I should, I know I should meet with my team or I know I should form a like, then why aren't you Hey Mose, a nation quick break.
8:14
Just to let you know that we've been starting to post on LinkedIn and want to connect with you.
Alright.
So send me a connection request.
A note letting me know that you listen to the show and I will accept it.
There's anyone you think that would be should be connected with tag them in one of my or Layla's posts?
And I will give you all the love in the world.
All right, so let's get back to the show.
8:35
Why aren't you at Y at y?
Like I know, like I know you have time because other people have time and had the same business as you so you have something.
So why aren't you, right?
And it's like what like because once you have the tactics, right?
And this is one of the biggest, the freeing and also most soul-crushing parts of Jim Lynch is that once, once, once a geometer joins Jim launch, you know how to make a seven-figure jet.
8:59
You know how to do it and so, then it reflects back onto you, it's like, oh shit.
I'm the reason that we're not there and you have to swallow that red because up until they go to gym, lot of people been doing it for five years or seven years, eight years and they're like, I don't know how and then once they see how then the oh shit, I'm not sure if I'm willing to do that.
9:21
It's like cool now, but once they know that there is no secret, there is no hack.
It's literally like a microphone was he uses the term?
Chopping wood.
Like I call doing the boring work is like chopping wood.
It's reps is day in day out.
You got to reach out to people, right?
You gotta give great service.
9:36
Right?
The handwritten cards like remind people to weigh in.
You have to work the leads.
When the person comes in the door, you have to be enthusiastic, got a green with a smile.
You have to ask the same questions over and over and over again because to that person is the first time they've ever heard right?
9:51
And it doesn't matter if it's the hundredth time that month, you asked the same questions to that person to that person, stay warm.
And so, if you were trying to be successful, do you think that only having availability for sales appointments, at 7:15 to 7:45 in the morning one?
A day is going to get you, the optimal cup.
10:10
Do you need a coach to tell you that?
Really, you know what I mean?
Like really and and so like or there was another one that's all there was like between 9 a.m. and 11 a.m. that, was their availability like, hmm.
Good luck with that.
10:27
That's when that's when the people who have the most money are available, right?
I do huh during the week.
So like we know what to do, right?
Anyone who's in our world like, you know what to do?
It's just you have to figure out why you're not doing it, right?
And then attack that, because Tactics aren't the thing, right?
10:44
The tactics are there.
You can read a book and give away for free, right?
Like you can do that, like, figure out why you're not hungry, figure out why you're not true, like why you're not trying?
They just figure it out.
Like there might be something inside, maybe don't want.
And like, you need to discover that, it's okay.
11:00
Then like now, you know, but like if you claim to want more and yet you can't do what's necessary to get more.
Then that's where your attention should go.
And you should figure that out because otherwise it doesn't matter what tactics there are you're just not going to do them anyways.
11:16
So what's the point right?
So anyways it was incredibly refreshing to have the three guys who are out here.
We had attorney microphone.
So both those guys have been over you know some figures roommates for a while.
I doing really, really well and and Aaron Aaron Stafford, just started inside of three, hundreds of people as for six weeks.
11:39
I did like 80,000 dollars and something sales and six weeks it's prequel.
So any of those guys were just like what do I need to do?
Like because they like their clear ice, you know, toes forward know exactly what to do.
And I was like, why is it that these meetings are so much easier than some of the other meanings I had?
11:54
And so, we've probably spent a little bit of the day kind of digging into that and it's just a question.
How about you want it?
I really think that's it and like, figuring out why you're not doing, what you already know you should do in order to achieve it.
Like do you need to go pay someone?
12:12
A bunch of money in order to then get motivated.
I don't know.
Like hopefully your kid doesn't need to be kidnapped in order for you to get motivated by your business hopefully, right.
And so it's like, what, what is that thing for me?
It's just fear.
It's just fear and insecurity fear failing, fear of, not being good enough, fear of people, who hated to be right.
12:31
You know what I mean?
That's what my fear and so hard to just like that's what drives me.
It's not about money.
It's because like I say couldn't have been about money because I don't need any more for the rest of my life like at all.
So I guess it can't be about that.
If it is like about that for you and you feel like when you make your first twenty thousand dollars take home with you first 40,000 or take a month to First 50,000, 100,000 or take a month.
12:49
The first time you hit that like if that's where you're like, oh, you feel this, big sigh of relief, then your motivation is not coming from the right place.
I'm time, I'm telling you straight up.
If you feel relief, when you make a lot of money, when month, your motivation is not coming from the place of a champion, if you want to be the best in the world at something.
13:08
That's not going to do anything for you.
You shouldn't feel anything from them.
And so, What do you feel to feel nothing?
Really because it's not about that.
That's just that's just an output.
13:24
That's an output from internal efforts and should be focused more on the internal efforts and all of the deficiencies that you probably had in still hitting 100 K.
It's like, oh my gosh, if we hadn't done this, this, and this, we would have been less, right?
And if we had done this in, this would have been more like, that's what you're focusing on, and you're only focusing on those things.
13:41
And if you can do that, then you'll be able to unlock something in Side of you that's much stronger than what might currently be driving.
So anyways guys hope you have an amazing Saturday.
Drop a like if you feel like this is cool, drop a comment.
If you like it was cool if you don't, then that's cool too.
13:59
So anyways have an amazing day and I will catch you guys soon.
Hopefully, that was viable for somebody who is on the fence who's like not sure about why they can't achieve what they want, why they can't be consistent because your motivation is not coming from the right place, right?
You're just trying to make enough money to live on and the moment.
14:15
I make enough money.
You stop working and then you wait for things to blow up again until you try her again and it's like it's like it's not How many times?
All right, I'm going on.
S little ramp.
How many times have you needed to make money?
14:31
And then immediately made the amount of money that you needed in like a day in like a week, right?
Need to make payroll, I got to make 10 grand next three days.
Howdy, how many times has that happened to you and you always make it work.
Why?
Because you already know what the fuck to do, right?
14:47
You just choose not to do it.
You choose not to do it.
You choose not to make money when, you know, how to make money because whenever you need to make money, you make it.
And so That's what you have to attack, you have to figure out why when you already know how to make money, you don't do it.
That's the that is the that is the the summary of this entire this entire talk, that was trying to get out of myself.
15:06
As like you already know how to do it.
When you need to do it, you do do it.
So why aren't you doing it?
That is what you need to focus on and if you can conquer that piece, no amount of money in the world will satisfy you.
And that is what's going to unlock, your ability to become greater and for you to build your business, too.
15:24
I think that is much greater than yourself because if the only thing that you want to satisfy is you you're going to see this small.
It's a here.
See this big because to satisfy a single person or a single family doesn't mean a lot, right?
But if you want to satisfy Community, want to satisfy statement satisfy Nation, you want to satisfy entire group of people?
15:43
It has to be bigger than you and so yeah.
So anyways, hopefully that my resonated with somebody.
If it didn't then I apologize for the extra aggressive us on this Saturday morning but Anyways, job like Drop, comment and I'll explode.
I'll catch you guys on the flip side.
Alright.








0:000:000:000:000:00
Hey guys, love that.
You're listening to the podcast.
If you ever want to have the video version of this which usually has more effects, more visuals, more graphs, you know, drawn out stuff.
Sometimes it can help hit the brain centers in different ways.
You can check out my YouTube channel, it's absolutely free.
Go check that out if that's what you are into.
0:16
And if not keep enjoying the show, the one tree I see over and over again, that is clear to the people who are our winners.
Right?
The top 1%.
I'm not talking top. 10% of the top 1% is.
Is the speed with which they execute, after making a decision.
0:36
Welcome to the game where we talk about it, get more customers how to make more per customer and how to keep them longer in the many failures and lessons.
We have learned along the way.
I hope you enjoy and subscribe.
Good morning, everyone will be observing a fantastic friday.
Today, I wanted to talk about something that has been.
0:53
It's been on my docket for a while, but today felt like the right day.
So calling this fuck end of week.
And what I mean by that is One of the one of the things that I've seen across the board when we're talking to you entrepreneurs.
1:09
And, you know, the, the gym owner of community that we have is that the one trait I see over and over again, that is clear to the people who are our winners.
Right?
The top 1%.
I'm not talking top 10% of the top 1% is the speed with, which they execute after making a decision.
1:29
And so one of the definitions that like, we talked about the community is that difference in power, as I understand it is, The gap between thoughts becoming reality.
And so if you thought about an omnipotent being, write something, someone has unlimited power as they think that thing would be right?
1:45
And so, if you were to believe in a creator of some sort than you might think as that Creator, thought the universe became, right?
And so, if you think that is like the ultimate scale of power, then the closer we can get to that.
The more powerful we become the more potent, we are as entrepreneurs, and so, I see this so many times.
2:05
Times that it's not even, it's not even a no, like, this is associated with success.
Like this is what creates success because the gap between where you decide, something is a good idea.
And when it actually occurs is the loop with which you can improve your business and so it's it's a lot like can remember the saying was but it's not like how old the cars, but how many miles are on it?
2:30
What I mean by that is like We're Young, right?
But there's been a lot of a lot of iterations.
Is that have happened from, you know, when the business first started, when I started my first game until now and I think the key to that is the speed of the ooda loop.
And that's that's just a military term like observe Orient, decide act and it's just a loop with which that you can basically see what's going on.
2:51
Maybe decision act on it and then do that whole loop again, right?
Because the faster you can pivot and iterate.
The more responsive, you are as an entrepreneur, the fast you can take advantage of opportunities.
The faster you can find out what failures are at then move on, right?
Right?
And so I want to talk about this within the context of running, a team and employees and then also within yourself.
3:11
And so from running your team, right?
One of the things that, you know, once once you're moving out of you doing things all the time, there is, how do I get other people to do things?
And so that's why I called this, like, fucking of leak, right?
Is that, I one of the things, one of my biggest pet peeves is like, yeah, I can get you that, by, by end of week I'm like, why don't you just get it to me in an hour?
3:30
Because that's how long it takes.
And then all of a sudden, it's like, oh, it's like, well, I have a meeting, right?
Then it's like, is it more important?
This know?
Okay, well, then do it, right?
And you can speed like, if you think about how you can run an organization like that, if you can get things done end of day, right?
3:47
Rather than end of week, you were literally speeding up.
The organization 7x think about that.
And so, when you're thinking about deadlines, if you're thinking about expectations, you as the owner can set, the you set the Cadence if people say hey Can we do this?
4:02
And then you're like, cool.
Let's start right now.
You set the tone for how the organization is going to move, right?
How quickly it's going to orient, how quickly thoughts become reality and ultimately how powerfully organization will become because of the speed, right?
And speed isn't doing things fast.
4:18
It's basically just not being distracted by other shit.
That doesn't matter.
It's being able to prioritize right and most people a lot of the times aren't doing something that's high priority, right?
A lot of times they're just doing nothing right?
And so if You can, if you can speed up that Loop and Force and and put apply pressure to your team to not do things by end of week or even end of day.
4:42
It's like, it's 10 a.m., can you get this done by noon, okay?
And then you can have that Loop happen three times within a day rather than it taking three weeks, right?
Because you've set that Cadence from the beginning and then things get done faster.
I was talking to so I've been reading some really interesting books lately, you know, and I refer them out to handful of my friends that I have that are all doing 55 to 15 million kind of in that range.
5:08
And what was amazing to me is that every single one of them read the book immediately set me back their notes and what they were going to do with it and act like and basically we're asking feedback on on the angle that they were going to take with it.
And what's fascinating to me is that if you look at, if you look at lower level entrepreneurs, They and I'm not saying that in a negative way.
5:29
I'm just saying in terms of just objective Revenue, just having achieved as much.
Heimo's a nation quick break just to let you know that we've been starting to post on LinkedIn and want to connect with you.
Alright.
So send me a connection request a note.
Let me know that you listen to the show and I will accept it.
5:44
There's anyone you think that would be should be connected with tag them in one of my or laila's posts?
And I will give you all the love in the world.
All right, so let's get back to the show.
The the delay between being able to gain information and act as so much longer and that's why they have where they want to be, right?
6:04
And so it's kind of the same degree people who are like pay for our program and haven't gone through the podium.
Like, what are you doing, right?
Like what priority like?
What, what education you have that is not relevant to your business.
Like you're reading a motivational blog right now when you have to translate that motivation into a thought that you're then going to quote test and then you have to see how that test work.
6:25
And then maybe it improve something rather than just following the Playbook that has already been tested and has already like the tree has been shook, right?
And so if you look at like Joey, for example who buy it by all definitions, his gym is the is the number-one gym within Jim launch, right?
6:43
He was, he had already finished everything in Legacy by week, 8.
His first eight weeks, he'd already implemented every single system and Legacy.
And so it's not like, it's not like he has more hours in the day, right?
It's not like his business is different.
It's just that his level of efficacy in execution was so high because it allowed himself to get distracted by things and the moment he has something he needs to execute, its creeps this kitchen side of him that he cannot be.
7:08
Can't move forward without executing this.
So that the relief And if you can start to Foster that type of behavior in yourself in those attitudes about execution, you will grow faster and you will become more powerful as an entrepreneur, right?
7:24
If you think about your competition, who would you fear, right?
The competitor, who sees what you're doing, can immediately execute Implement and improve on it at a faster Loop than you can even understand what's going on.
Right.
And that's where speed of first and market and things like that.
7:39
Don't matter as much because if an X if a competitor could Execute an outer loop, right?
Kankan speed that Loop up faster, they can iterate improve on it fast as you can and then you have no chance to catch up, right?
And so if you're looking at your business, look at it from a context of speed of how long does it take us to improve things, right?
7:57
How long from understanding that are churn is high to executing the five Horsemen?
Right, how long did that take, we knew what the problem was.
How long did it take for us to do?
And if you can if you can if you can get real with yourself about how many actual hours, it will take to do something.
And then you look You're weak and you think.
8:14
Okay, what am I doing today?
That is more important than this and where can I put these two hours and start with the moment that you make the decision?
And then all of a sudden, you'll be getting things, done that day that afternoon, rather than end of week, end of month, right?
We purposely delay these things because we just procrastinate for no reason when the, the problem will not go away, right?
8:35
And so, that is why within Jomon speed is King, is one of the core tenets of the business.
Because like You have to, and the tone has to start with you as the entrepreneur.
Like, you have to apply that pressure.
You have to say, Fuck end of week.
Why like, what are you doing today?
8:51
This more important is, right?
What are you doing in the next?
Two hours is more important in this tell me, right?
And a lot of times you'll get the answer like well I guess I can do it now.
It's like yeah.
Then let's do it now.
Let's get it done right and that small change can 7x, right?
If you even go in from end of week to end of day, can 7x how quickly your business grows because the solutions that you Implement the solve the problems, and break through the bottlenecks happen.
9:15
Today, not in a week, not in a month and then the reaction to the next thing, that breaks the next bottleneck in the business happens not in a week, not in a month, but in a day.
And then that's how quickly you can pivot from where you are to where you want to go.
Because it's not one big thing, it's a million, small turns that will get you there.
9:33
So anyways, I hope I hope anyone, you know, somebody found value in this if you have an employee or you're managing your team and you want to implement new things, Start with today, right?
Start with end of day, not end of week, start with end of the next two hours and then work backwards from there and then apply pressure and push back on excuses for why something else, why something can't be done asked for why?
9:59
Why do you think this thing that you're going to do is more important than this?
And I want a real answer, right?
And if they can't give you a real answer and it means that I need to help you prioritize and that's fine.
But this is now going to be your priority because this is Drives Revenue.
This is what drives our attention.
This is going to drive the business.
10:16
So Look at your schedule identify the bottlenecks you have and then start doing them now, not in tomorrow, not in a week not in a month because there's no point.
It's just the speed with which you can Close the gap between your thoughts and your decisions and the reality that you create in front of you, will dictate how powerful you are as an entrepreneur and even as a human being.
10:39
So, anyways, have an amazing day, have a fantastic Friday for my chemours.
I will see you guys on the call later today.
Otherwise keep being awesome tag like comment, All That Jazz.








Company0:00
Hey guys, real quick.
So Leyland are definitely working on our social media presence.
If you guys haven't noticed and we're just breaking now into LinkedIn.
All right.
It's not as bad as I thought it's actually a pretty awesome so far and you guys have been really cool in there and people are sharing our stuff a lot.
So if we aren't connected on LinkedIn, it go ahead and let's connect and let's rock and roll.
0:17
And the total room cumulatively was doing over 500 million dollars a year.
Welcome to the game, where we talk about how to get more customers, how to make more per customer and how to keep them longer in the many failures and lessons.
We have learned along the way.
I hope you enjoy and subscribe.
So I was at a mastermind with seven other entrepreneurs and the total room cumulatively was doing over 500 million dollars a year in revenue and so this was kind of a cool meet up of very high-level entrepreneurs.
0:48
And you know, everybody kind of went up there and shared the things that they were doing well.
And you know, between things were eating and having a time and what was You're saying to me is that in the entrepreneurial world so many entrepreneurs, have all these weird sticks about like their food and their exercise and their hydration and they're what, you know, aren't glasses, they wear and their finger toe shoes and their bio hacking and just all this weirdness.
1:18
But I actually came from the Fitness world and all that stuff is complete make-believe bullshit and so it's really good for selling people stuff but it's complete.
Complete farce.
So anyways, I the whole time.
These guys are sitting there and they're like, oh no, I only keto there.
1:35
So, I only do intermittent fasting, right?
And, and I'm sitting there listening to them.
I'm like, you can Twizzlers and cookies, and ice cream.
And they're like, what the, you know, what are you doing, right?
And by the second day, they see that.
I literally continue to eat this way, like, an asshole and they're like, what do you, what are you doing, man?
1:54
Like how does this work?
And so between all the stuff that we talked about business-wise, While it was lunchtime, I was like, all right, this is this is kind of how I've been eating for 17 years and I was in better shape than all the guys there and believe it or not, a bunch of those guys.
2:12
Ended up telling me months later that they had all gotten in shape based on the presentation that I gave them, which is a different way of eating.
And so, I've been doing this for almost 20 years, I've been in shape that entire time I have not not had a six-pack since I was 13 or 14.
2:30
And I eat ice cream every day.
Yep, every day and I drink alcohol and I eat cookies and I do all the things that people want to do.
All right?
And so what I'm going to take you through is a very special little thing that I put together which is actually an adaptation of what I presented to these guys at this little meet up, all right?
2:52
So buckle up and I think that you will enjoy this.
So the first thing that everybody has to understand is what body If you are and what body type you'd like to become, right?
And so, I kind of put this on a little Matrix of high fat, low fat, low Muscle, High muscle.
3:08
So you could be, you know, high fat, low muscle, and you'd have a very feminine figure, right?
You could have low muscle low-fat and be Skin and Bones, right?
You could be high fat, High muscle and just be big, right?
You could be low fat and high muscle, which is what a bodybuilder is right?
3:27
And you know, there's various pieces along this.
This curve.
Right?
And so once you figure out where you are, let's say you're skinny, right?
And you want to get big right?
Then you would have a line that you can pretty much draw directionally to the place that you want to go, right?
3:44
So if you're going up that way, that means you need to increase your number of calories and you need to increase your volume, right?
Those are the two things that you need to do.
Because if you're going in this direction, right?
Then this, these are the Two directional arrows, this guy and this guy that you would need to adhere to, right?
4:05
So you basically plot the same hot hot increase calories, decrease calories, decrease volume increase volume along the same plot line that you had high fat low fat, High muscle, low muscle, right?
Don't get to spec caught up in this.
I just like to have visuals because that's how I think.
4:22
All right.
And so if you know where you are and you know where you want to go, then you can know what you need to do together.
You increase your calories, and increase your volume in.
There you go.
Go.
Now here's the thing that got them all, tripped up and then I said, hey guys, do you guys want to know why all your diets are the same and they were like what I was like.
4:39
Yeah, crazy, I know.
And so right now and not, including alcohol, there's three main macronutrients, are you got protein carbs and fat, all right, now, if you're eating a normal balance meal, that's what something like this would look like right.
You have kind of an even distribution of protein carbs and fat and your mail.
4:57
Right?
Right now, what Is whenever you do a diet, right?
So let's say you do Kido, all right?
Well, if you're doing keto, all you're doing, is you're going to be removing this orange thing and having just you basically eliminate your carbs, right?
5:13
And so you eat, 1/3 fewer calories.
Make sense.
If you have a low fat diet, you're eliminating your vet, which is this yellow guy, right?
And again, you're eating 1/3 fewer calories.
If you did a portion control diet, you would eat equal.
5:29
It's of the same three things, but just less of them overall.
And so you would you guessed it, eat fewer calories.
And if you did an intermittent fasting, you would go from eating three meals a day, deeding two meals a day and guess what?
You would be eating fewer calories.
Sorry about the camera being crazy any.
5:47
So, this is the thing that's happening right now, right?
Is that you're eliminating calories?
That is what is going on in every diet that you possibly do, all right?
And so all these guys get all like, oh no, I do really well with low carb.
I do really well with high fat.
Harlow, whatever.
It doesn't matter.
Like it's all horseshit it just calories, it's all the matters.
6:04
Okay.
And so this was driving me nuts, which is why I started making this little put together for you guys.
But this is why every other dies the same, right?
And here's the, here's the fun.
One for you.
If you struggled, and you had a diet that didn't work for you.
6:19
Here's why let's say, you did keto.
If you did keto the wrong, the right way, it would look like this, right?
You would cut out your carbs, right?
And then that calorie amount, Mount is eliminated from your diet and then over time you lose weight right now.
This is what a lot of people who said, akihito didn't work for me.
6:36
It's like because you started drinking butter, right?
You started eating Ribeyes for breakfast every day?
Well, no shit.
There's a lot more calories that you took in.
So the amount that you cut out did not compensate for the amount of excess protein and fat that you added into your diet, the ended up actually netting, you more calories than you would need right?
6:54
And that's why didn't work for you.
So that is why these diets don't work.
So what I will tell you now is what actually has to happen in order for it to work in reality.
Okay.
So these are the only three things that 99% of people need to know in order to figure out what they want to, how they want to eat, how they want to look.
7:14
All right.
You just got to know one how many calories you need to eat to how many grams of protein you need.
Eat and three.
How much volume you need to do?
I'm not going to talk about number three today.
I'm just gonna talk about one and two because that's what 99% you need even think about anyways.
Alright so here's the simplest way to Figure out number one, all right.
7:33
Now there's a million, there's a million little formulas that you can use here, all right?
But the basic one is your body weight times your goal, very simple.
So if you're 200-pound guy right, you wanted to maintain, then you'll probably be eating between 2600 and 3,000 calories.
So, 200 to do times, 15 would be cool, 3,000 calories, right?
7:53
That's if you wanted to maintain on the high side.
Right now, let's say you wanted to lose weight and let's say you wanted to go a little bit more extreme than it would be 200.
Oops, too. 200 times 10, which would be 2,000 calories, right?
Tada very simple.
All right there's a million different ways to try and calculate this and none of them matter.
8:13
All right, because controlling what you ingest is easy, understanding how much you expel in calories is very hard and so, it doesn't matter.
Anyways, all right.
Most Nation real quick.
If you are a business owner that has a big old business and wants to get to a much bigger business, going to fifteen hundred dollars.
8:33
Plus, we would love to talk to you and if you like that or like to hear more about it, go to acquisition.com, you can play anywhere on the page and talk to one of our team and see if we can help you get there.
So the thing is is step one is you determine how many calories supposed to eat based on your goal.
8:51
And the thing is, if you started this and you're like, man, I wanted to lose weight and you don't losing weight at a rate that you would find fast enough.
You can always just decrease it's not that hard, right?
Very straightforward.
So you multiply your body weight by the the number here so you can see here.
9:07
It's from Seven all the way up to 21 if you want to have extreme weight gain to be your body weight times, you know, a high up number over here, if you want to have Weight loss would be a low number over here and that's it, right?
If you everything in between.
So I said, if you wanted to have a pretty fast weight loss, then you'd be your body weight times 10, right?
9:26
Very simple.
Now now that we've done that we go to step 2.
All right?
You gotta figure out how much protein D.
And this is the part that everyone gets kind of trippy on, right?
Because it was showing you the whole point of this, some put this together for you and then you can have all the ice cream in all the cookies and all the alcohol you ever dreamed of and still have a six-pack.
9:45
All right, forever for good because it's my belief that if you're if you're going to do this, right?
If you're going to play the game, you have to do it in a way that you'd be able to do it forever, right?
If I can't do something for the rest of my life, then I don't see a point in doing it.
Who cares about being in shape for eight weeks, right?
When I want to be in shape for the rest of my life, right?
10:02
No One's Gonna remember you for being the in shape that that time period.
They're going to be like, oh yeah, you always struggled with his way and he was always trying new crazy things, wouldn't it be nice to just solve it for good?
Right.
Right.
Okay.
So protein, which is the second number here, your body weight times.
10:18
One in G, is about what you need to have for protein per day.
Very simple.
All right, so if we're 200 pounds, then you need 200 grams of protein.
Now, here's where it's kind of cool.
You're like, well, and here's the big as life.
A can possibly give you 100 grams of protein is To one pound of lean meat.
10:37
All right, so if you needed have 200 grams, that would be two pounds of lean meat.
And so for me, the world's simplest, you know, diet of all time and by died it's like this is just how I live is that I eat two pounds of meat a day, all right?
And like that's crazy, it's not really.
10:53
You get used to it right?
And you just stop eating the crap that you probably right now, right?
So two pounds of meat can be two pounds of shrimp, could be two pounds of Tilapia me, two pounds of and not have to be the same thing.
You could have a quarter pound of four different things, you know, excuse me, a half pound of four, different things you could have tenderloin.
11:14
You know, you have skirt steak, you have flank steak like, those are very lean.
Steaks, actually, doctor say sorry, flank steak saline.
You could have top round.
You could have top sirloin, like those are all very lean steaks.
All of these are just very lean proteins.
All right, chicken breast, right?
11:30
There's a million of these.
But the point is, is that a lean meat is lean meat, and They're all about the same in terms of grams.
All right, so if you needed to have 200 grams of protein, then you would have two pounds of lean meat and that's what you would eat for the day.
11:45
Alright, wait, don't worry.
You're like what about the cookies and ice cream.
I'm gonna get there.
All right, so Now, we have to figure out if we know how many calories were eating per day and we know how much protein reading that we need to figure out what's left over.
Alright, so here's how you put it all together.
12:02
One is we calculated our calories for our goal.
So if we said we wanted to lose weight and we were 200 pounds and we did 11 shirt because that we want to do moderate weight loss, we would eat 2200 calories a day.
Awesome Second Step here, we calculate protein for our body weight.
12:20
So if we were 200, Pounds.
We have 200 grams of protein, great, which is going to be two pounds of lean meat.
Simple.
All right, step 3.
We're going to calculate our calories from our protein.
All right, so roughly roughly, all right.
12:37
So if you want to be all sciency, 4 calories per gram is how many actual calories are in a gram of protein.
But when you eat a source of protein, like, a chicken breast, there's also some fat in it right, even when it's super lean, there's still some And so what we do, what I do, my back of a napkin, secret super method is you just multiply it by 5?
12:59
All right, the reason I do that is so that I can count for a little bit of fat that's going to be carried along with it.
All right, so if I'm going to have my 200 grams of protein times 5, it means I'm going to need about 1,000 calories, they're going to come for my protein sources.
Alright, great.
So now what I'm going to do is I'm going to take my step for my 2200 calories subtract my thousand calories of protein and I've got 1,200 Calories of whatever the hell I want.
13:24
Pretty cool, right?
And so, every day, here's the secret to having the body want for the rest of your life, eating cookies, every day and making every entrepreneur that you go to the master Minds with feel like a moron because you have six pack in your eating ice, cream and cookies and Twizzlers and all the things that you want in this world, while they are telling you about why they're biohacking, right?
13:44
And why, they're burning so much fat right now.
Except they look the same every year, right, right?
Here's the key.
You eat the 1200 calories of whatever the hell you want, and you can do it every day.
You can change what you want to eat in those 1,200 calories every day if you feel like it.
But the key point is that the Cornerstone of the diet is that you get enough protein in.
14:02
So you get your protein in first and then you fill up to the lid and whatever else you want.
Now, you may find out that a white potato is more filling than nerds ropes.
I would know this from first hand, but if you don't have a compulsive need to eat right, which I don't, then you can control yourself and eat whatever the heck you want.
14:20
Right?
I tend to not be that hungry as a person in general and so I like to have more appetizing foods and I'd rather eat less of them, right.
Some people love to have huge volumes of food in which case, you'll probably eat more Whole Foods, right?
You'll probably have more potatoes and rice and all that kind of stuff, right?
The point is that once you just know those two numbers, how many calories you eat, how many grams of protein you have, you can eat for the rest of your life.
14:42
Never go on or off a diet ever again.
And here's the cool part, you can split up those meals whatever way you want, all right?
You can eat them.
You can be, like, I can have five meals a day.
You can have three meals a day.
You could have one meal a day, it doesn't matter.
All right, crazy.
I know.
14:58
It's like, it's almost like they've been trying to sell you your whole lives.
I know.
All right.
But the reason this is so cool.
Is that you can't fall off, right?
There's no like Diet.
Like you can eat whatever the hell you want.
Like, it doesn't matter.
You want to have ice cream every day you guys from every day, right?
And so if you're like, oh, like you can't, you won't feel like you're cheating on a cheat day because you have ice cream every day.
15:19
Right?
The best Way to get people to become obsessed with food, is to get them to restrict themselves from doing stuff because then they splurge and, you know, do a ton of it.
But if you get extra day, it stops being special, Vicky cookies, every day.
It stops being special, right?
And so this is how I've eaten for almost 20 years.
15:35
This has been, you know, the secret behind it.
And I get very tired of seeing the entrepreneurial World get fooled with Shenanigans of stuff that does not matter.
And so, that is, that is why I wanted to share this with you.
It's also like the number one question I get which is like, hey, what do you what do you eat every day?
15:53
This is what I've eaten every day for almost 20 years.
And all I do is I just the, you know, the goal up and down.
If I want to, you know, if I wanted to gain weight, I would eat the same two pounds of protein.
I would just have more extra calories, that's it, right?
16:09
If I wanted to have it.
So you basically have this base of protein that just protects your muscle, right?
And then everything else is just variable of How many calories extra you want to eat?
And you can eat it whenever you want.
I want to make sure that I got all my little notes here that I remembered.
But the big Point here is that all this stuff works because you can't fall off, right?
16:28
You can't cheat because nothing is forbidden, right?
And no one is immune to a calorie deficit, right?
If you eat nothing long enough, you will lose weight.
Everyone like, like, some people lose weight faster or slower.
But everybody loses weight and deficit period.
Right?
16:44
And so that's it.
That's the that's the Food portion of what Alex eats every day.
And if you're an entrepreneur and you're like, man, I wish I could, you know, you're obsessed with all this biohacking and all the all the supplements to try and try and lose lose fat faster, but you're, but you look the exact same years later.
17:02
Then it's possible that maybe the stuff that you're doing doesn't work and it doesn't matter.
And instead you should take a page out of this and what's kind of funny is that I know just as much if not more about Fitness stuff than I do about business stuff, Tough.
But I haven't talked about in a long time and I don't want this channel to be a fitness channel.
17:21
I just get really, really tired of of, of the shenanigans and the tomfoolery that I see in the entrepreneurial space around this, and people speak in these absolutes and they're completely false and so anyways, I know that Mosey Nation.
You guys are intelligent and hopefully shredded and jacked in the future.
17:41
And I want you to be able to hashtag never skip dessert, while also having a six pack, and that is why I made this video for you.
So, So keep being awesome.
Lots of loved enjoyed this at sub.
If you didn't love you either way.
Could you guys next video?
Bye.








0:00
Hey guys, love that.
You're listening to the podcast.
If you ever want to have the video version of this which usually has more effects, more visuals, more graphs, you know, drawn out stuff.
Sometimes it can help hit the brain centers in different ways.
You can check out my YouTube channel, it's absolutely free.
Go check that out if that's what you are into.
0:16
And if not keep enjoying the show, the one tree I see over and over again, that is clear to the people who are our winners.
Right?
The top 1%.
I'm not talking top. 10% of the top 1% is.
Is the speed with which they execute, after making a decision.
0:36
Welcome to the game where we talk about it, get more customers how to make more per customer and how to keep them longer in the many failures and lessons.
We have learned along the way.
I hope you enjoy and subscribe.
Good morning, everyone will be observing a fantastic friday.
Today, I wanted to talk about something that has been.
0:53
It's been on my docket for a while, but today felt like the right day.
So calling this fuck end of week.
And what I mean by that is One of the one of the things that I've seen across the board when we're talking to you entrepreneurs.
1:09
And, you know, the, the gym owner of community that we have is that the one trait I see over and over again, that is clear to the people who are our winners.
Right?
The top 1%.
I'm not talking top 10% of the top 1% is the speed with, which they execute after making a decision.
1:29
And so one of the definitions that like, we talked about the community is that difference in power, as I understand it is, The gap between thoughts becoming reality.
And so if you thought about an omnipotent being, write something, someone has unlimited power as they think that thing would be right?
1:45
And so, if you were to believe in a creator of some sort than you might think as that Creator, thought the universe became, right?
And so, if you think that is like the ultimate scale of power, then the closer we can get to that.
The more powerful we become the more potent, we are as entrepreneurs, and so, I see this so many times.
2:05
Times that it's not even, it's not even a no, like, this is associated with success.
Like this is what creates success because the gap between where you decide, something is a good idea.
And when it actually occurs is the loop with which you can improve your business and so it's it's a lot like can remember the saying was but it's not like how old the cars, but how many miles are on it?
2:30
What I mean by that is like We're Young, right?
But there's been a lot of a lot of iterations.
Is that have happened from, you know, when the business first started, when I started my first game until now and I think the key to that is the speed of the ooda loop.
And that's that's just a military term like observe Orient, decide act and it's just a loop with which that you can basically see what's going on.
2:51
Maybe decision act on it and then do that whole loop again, right?
Because the faster you can pivot and iterate.
The more responsive, you are as an entrepreneur, the fast you can take advantage of opportunities.
The faster you can find out what failures are at then move on, right?
Right?
And so I want to talk about this within the context of running, a team and employees and then also within yourself.
3:11
And so from running your team, right?
One of the things that, you know, once once you're moving out of you doing things all the time, there is, how do I get other people to do things?
And so that's why I called this, like, fucking of leak, right?
Is that, I one of the things, one of my biggest pet peeves is like, yeah, I can get you that, by, by end of week I'm like, why don't you just get it to me in an hour?
3:30
Because that's how long it takes.
And then all of a sudden, it's like, oh, it's like, well, I have a meeting, right?
Then it's like, is it more important?
This know?
Okay, well, then do it, right?
And you can speed like, if you think about how you can run an organization like that, if you can get things done end of day, right?
3:47
Rather than end of week, you were literally speeding up.
The organization 7x think about that.
And so, when you're thinking about deadlines, if you're thinking about expectations, you as the owner can set, the you set the Cadence if people say hey Can we do this?
4:02
And then you're like, cool.
Let's start right now.
You set the tone for how the organization is going to move, right?
How quickly it's going to orient, how quickly thoughts become reality and ultimately how powerfully organization will become because of the speed, right?
And speed isn't doing things fast.
4:18
It's basically just not being distracted by other shit.
That doesn't matter.
It's being able to prioritize right and most people a lot of the times aren't doing something that's high priority, right?
A lot of times they're just doing nothing right?
And so if You can, if you can speed up that Loop and Force and and put apply pressure to your team to not do things by end of week or even end of day.
4:42
It's like, it's 10 a.m., can you get this done by noon, okay?
And then you can have that Loop happen three times within a day rather than it taking three weeks, right?
Because you've set that Cadence from the beginning and then things get done faster.
I was talking to so I've been reading some really interesting books lately, you know, and I refer them out to handful of my friends that I have that are all doing 55 to 15 million kind of in that range.
5:08
And what was amazing to me is that every single one of them read the book immediately set me back their notes and what they were going to do with it and act like and basically we're asking feedback on on the angle that they were going to take with it.
And what's fascinating to me is that if you look at, if you look at lower level entrepreneurs, They and I'm not saying that in a negative way.
5:29
I'm just saying in terms of just objective Revenue, just having achieved as much.
Heimo's a nation quick break just to let you know that we've been starting to post on LinkedIn and want to connect with you.
Alright.
So send me a connection request a note.
Let me know that you listen to the show and I will accept it.
5:44
There's anyone you think that would be should be connected with tag them in one of my or laila's posts?
And I will give you all the love in the world.
All right, so let's get back to the show.
The the delay between being able to gain information and act as so much longer and that's why they have where they want to be, right?
6:04
And so it's kind of the same degree people who are like pay for our program and haven't gone through the podium.
Like, what are you doing, right?
Like what priority like?
What, what education you have that is not relevant to your business.
Like you're reading a motivational blog right now when you have to translate that motivation into a thought that you're then going to quote test and then you have to see how that test work.
6:25
And then maybe it improve something rather than just following the Playbook that has already been tested and has already like the tree has been shook, right?
And so if you look at like Joey, for example who buy it by all definitions, his gym is the is the number-one gym within Jim launch, right?
6:43
He was, he had already finished everything in Legacy by week, 8.
His first eight weeks, he'd already implemented every single system and Legacy.
And so it's not like, it's not like he has more hours in the day, right?
It's not like his business is different.
It's just that his level of efficacy in execution was so high because it allowed himself to get distracted by things and the moment he has something he needs to execute, its creeps this kitchen side of him that he cannot be.
7:08
Can't move forward without executing this.
So that the relief And if you can start to Foster that type of behavior in yourself in those attitudes about execution, you will grow faster and you will become more powerful as an entrepreneur, right?
7:24
If you think about your competition, who would you fear, right?
The competitor, who sees what you're doing, can immediately execute Implement and improve on it at a faster Loop than you can even understand what's going on.
Right.
And that's where speed of first and market and things like that.
7:39
Don't matter as much because if an X if a competitor could Execute an outer loop, right?
Kankan speed that Loop up faster, they can iterate improve on it fast as you can and then you have no chance to catch up, right?
And so if you're looking at your business, look at it from a context of speed of how long does it take us to improve things, right?
7:57
How long from understanding that are churn is high to executing the five Horsemen?
Right, how long did that take, we knew what the problem was.
How long did it take for us to do?
And if you can if you can if you can get real with yourself about how many actual hours, it will take to do something.
And then you look You're weak and you think.
8:14
Okay, what am I doing today?
That is more important than this and where can I put these two hours and start with the moment that you make the decision?
And then all of a sudden, you'll be getting things, done that day that afternoon, rather than end of week, end of month, right?
We purposely delay these things because we just procrastinate for no reason when the, the problem will not go away, right?
8:35
And so, that is why within Jomon speed is King, is one of the core tenets of the business.
Because like You have to, and the tone has to start with you as the entrepreneur.
Like, you have to apply that pressure.
You have to say, Fuck end of week.
Why like, what are you doing today?
8:51
This more important is, right?
What are you doing in the next?
Two hours is more important in this tell me, right?
And a lot of times you'll get the answer like well I guess I can do it now.
It's like yeah.
Then let's do it now.
Let's get it done right and that small change can 7x, right?
If you even go in from end of week to end of day, can 7x how quickly your business grows because the solutions that you Implement the solve the problems, and break through the bottlenecks happen.
9:15
Today, not in a week, not in a month and then the reaction to the next thing, that breaks the next bottleneck in the business happens not in a week, not in a month, but in a day.
And then that's how quickly you can pivot from where you are to where you want to go.
Because it's not one big thing, it's a million, small turns that will get you there.
9:33
So anyways, I hope I hope anyone, you know, somebody found value in this if you have an employee or you're managing your team and you want to implement new things, Start with today, right?
Start with end of day, not end of week, start with end of the next two hours and then work backwards from there and then apply pressure and push back on excuses for why something else, why something can't be done asked for why?
9:59
Why do you think this thing that you're going to do is more important than this?
And I want a real answer, right?
And if they can't give you a real answer and it means that I need to help you prioritize and that's fine.
But this is now going to be your priority because this is Drives Revenue.
This is what drives our attention.
This is going to drive the business.
10:16
So Look at your schedule identify the bottlenecks you have and then start doing them now, not in tomorrow, not in a week not in a month because there's no point.
It's just the speed with which you can Close the gap between your thoughts and your decisions and the reality that you create in front of you, will dictate how powerful you are as an entrepreneur and even as a human being.
10:39
So, anyways, have an amazing day, have a fantastic Friday for my chemours.
I will see you guys on the call later today.
Otherwise keep being awesome tag like comment, All That Jazz.0:00
Real quick guys.
If you can think about how you found this podcast, somebody probably tweeted it told you about it.
Should it on Instagram or something like that?
The only way this grows is through word of mouth and so I don't run ads, I don't do sponsorships, I don't sell anything.
I only ask is that you continue to pay it forward to whoever showed you or however you found out about this Pockets that you do the exact same thing.
0:19
So if it was a review if it was a post, if you do that would mean the world to me and you throw some good karma out there for another entrepreneur.
What's going on everybody?
If you guys have an awesome amazing Monday I've spent the entire weekend making presentations for our gym, Lords Mastermind event, that's coming up, so stoked, so many, so many slides.
0:40
But that being said, I wanted to bring something up.
That came to my attention this weekend, and I thought it was worth mixing for those of you who are in this group and it's, I told you to watch your mouth, and the reason I said that, it's mostly because it's catchy, but also, because one of the reasons that a lot of gym owners will come talk to me, be like, I wish wish like team work harder.
1:01
I wish my team like cared about my customers.
We I care about my customers, like, I feel like, they don't care.
They only do the minimum, like they're not like investing in the clients, like, if someone walks in like, sometimes they Norm or they're like, just not as energized.
They seem like.
They're just going through the motions and for anyone who's like dealt with our team.
1:20
So I need the gym owners who are here.
What's up, Steve?
What's up, Tim?
What's up, Spencer for anything Motors were on here.
Like you guys can probably tell the other gym owners, we haven't told our team, Like our teams in love with gym owners like they obsess about gym owners, they work in their free, time to work on the weekends, they work until midnight every night to serve our customers and it's because they've fallen in love with the customers and that didn't happen by accident.
1:42
And it was something that took me a really long time to figure out how to do.
And obviously, half of this is because my wife's way cooler than I am and she made, it's just the team, but, um, but when I started out in the gym, I would be, like, why don't you guys doing this?
Why aren't you guys doing this?
Like, this is what you need to be doing this.
1:58
What you need to be doing?
I kept saying it like that.
Would never happen they'd be like yeah and then they would never execute.
And so what I had to realize was the way that I was talking about my customers in front of my staff, especially wasn't aligned with what I wanted to be happening.
2:13
Like I want I said we were all about service.
I said we were all about, you know, creating an amazing Community except when customers walk in I would like go into the back room was I didn't want to talk to him, right?
And like I would be sometimes for with my own customers because I was like, I'm too busy.
I'm a business owner, right?
And what It did was I gue some leading with that, example of like not caring, you know what I mean and so like it didn't matter what I said, it matter what I did and so the culture always has to start at the top, right?
2:41
There's two aspects of scaling service which is what the business that were in.
You have culturing of training, all right?
So the training can still automate the, which you should hopefully have automated training for different positions.
That way everyone has the same on boarding process and fluoridation sign up for do much but the other aspects of the culture and I think if Thing, the cultures will get you so much further with your team in terms of productivity which is why all these corporate trainers almost have talked about it because once you have an actual team like you're in the soft skills of managing people and the difference between like highly effective team.
3:14
And a mediocre team is like three, four ten to one in terms of productivity and you don't need.
Like a lot of times is like I wish I wish I could just get more of the people that I have.
It's not like the way that you do that is by instilling a culture of Excellence.
3:29
World class support.
And then leading with the example, right?
Like I love seeing like the pastor of our church in Albuquerque is known to like, pick up the Pebbles on the sidewalk is a, you know, they do.
It's a probably 10 to 15 million dollar-a-year Church.
3:46
You know in terms of Revenue that brings big church.
Okay.
And he's picking up Pebbles on the side of the sidewalk when he's got hundreds and hundreds of volunteers.
That work at the church and we asked him about it and he was like, I do that because I care about it and I want it to look clean.
4:03
But what happens is now you see all of the employees without him saying anything when they're around and they're like just hanging out, they start picking the Pebbles up and pushing him into the grass.
Right.
And so it's that tiny bit of leading.
By example, from like your actions of like if you tell people like, hey guys, I want this place to be spotless when you walk in.
4:22
Do you start like like like organizing things cleaning things up, like like have to having an owner mop the floor.
I'm not saying all the time but I'm saying every once in awhile demonstrates, how much you care about certain things being done, Hey guys, real quick for those of you guys who are 100 million-dollar offers fans I love you.
4:40
I added in a lost chapter that has never been released.
I'm releasing it now transparently.
I'm doing that to build hype 400 million dollar leads but you will have the unreleased chapter, it talks about your first Avatar and how to segment customers, make more money.
You can get it by going to acquisition.com forward slash leads.
4:57
Its fo free in exchange for email so that I can email you when we launched under Miller, All Leads and so that you can not miss out on it.
Because last time I sold out for like eight.
Great weeks really fast so that it's my way of making sure that y'all get first dibs. and to the same extent, How you talk about your customers, when you went there.
5:17
Like, man, I wish they cared more about my customers.
Usually we need to care more about our customers and how we tell we talk like the last like we had a culture meeting at Jim launched like a month and a half ago and I basically explained our origin story like where we came from and like how I got in the gym business and all this stuff.
5:35
And like I got really, really choked up and I like could barely talk because it was our so, just like overwhelmed with emotion of how like, why we push so hard and why we're trying to like Reset the standard in the industry and like why we want to help him owners get their jobs back, and just because of, like, all the stuff that I had to go through, like, sleeping on the floor, and for nine, straight months, and like, living out of my car for such a long time.
5:58
You know what I mean?
To figure this out and getting screwed by business partners like having my bank account emptied, like, I mean, literally everything you can imagine.
Like, I've had, you know what I mean?
And I don't want anyone else have to go through that.
And so, I was explaining that to the team.
And if you can have those types of meetings, Or they remember why you like, remember why you started is just as important for you as a gym owner and for your team even more so than it is sometimes for the customers.
6:22
So if you have the weekly Workshop meetings, which if you are in our program, you should be doing with your team, like take a moment and remind them of why you got in this and why is this important to you and why your customers mean so much to you, sometimes you'll get emotional and then you like they do remind them, why they mean so much.
6:39
But then it like the way you talk about it to your staff, you're selling your staff.
Laugh.
On the importance of what they do by the conviction that you're speaking about it with.
And so, if I, if I want my service, to my gym, owners to be like, the worst thing that can happen.
6:58
Here's the counter example, is when you're like, can you believe that Carol asked, if like, did you see Carol's squat?
Like she asked, like, is this parallel, but like, she was, like, this far above, or like, you know, like she asked if, like beans were a carb, you know?
Like, when you talk about your customers like that, like, Though they're stupid or as though they're less than and like they're just the mughals or the plebeians, right?
7:22
When you talk about them like that?
Some of you may be guilty of as I mean, like me.
That's kind of me.
Like, I can't believe she didn't sign it.
Like, why do they keep doing this?
Like they'd rather than like us if you talk about it like that, they will exhibit that behavior and it was something that I had to change actively in myself because I was like the reason that Mighty I had to own it and be like, the reason the team hasn't performed the way I want them to is because it's me, it's my fault.
7:45
And so I had to re-engineer, high talked about everyone, like it would be really easy for us for me to be like, how can these your motive not have to know how to, you know, set up a pixel.
How can they not know how to set up a landing page?
Like it's not that hard to set up as a pure between here and here.
Like it takes technial, 3 minutes.

If I talked about gym owners like that, my staff would start acting that way on support calls with gym owners, and then we wouldn't have world-class customer support.
But instead, I'm like we're here to serve them.
That's the point, like, of course that like, they don't know that they're not supposed to know.
That's why they're paying us for help, right?
8:17
It's the same thing.
If someone doesn't know how to like, how vegetable, like if romaine lettuce is a bits of her, carrots are a vegetable or fruit or whatever.
Right?
If someone makes that kind of comment and like someone and like, one of your trainers like laughs about it or makes fun of them.
Like, like, like, that's where you have to address it and be like, don't talk about them like that.
8:37
Like, of course, they don't know.
Like, that's why they're paying us like if they knew, they wouldn't pay us.
Like, that's the point.
Like if they knew they wouldn't need us like, that's Like we're trying to help them and so it's really like speaking from that and then living it by example.
So not only the words, but the actions that you follow up with and so like, you need to be 2, X, 5, X, what you want your team to be in terms of the service in terms of the Care, in terms of the actions that you take in order to make your clients feel amazing and then they will follow suit at half the level that you will start with, but it starts with you.
9:12
So let's love hope you guys have an awesome.
Monday Mania, Monday, Mastermind, Monday.
It's coming up.
I'm so excited.
And if you are on the fence about your lunch, you should do it only









0:00
Hey guys, real quick.
So Leyland are definitely working on our social media presence.
If you guys haven't noticed and we're just breaking now into LinkedIn.
All right.
It's not as bad as I thought it's actually a pretty awesome so far and you guys have been really cool in there and people are sharing our stuff a lot.
So if we aren't connected on LinkedIn, it go ahead and let's connect and let's rock and roll.
0:17
And the total room cumulatively was doing over 500 million dollars a year.
Welcome to the game, where we talk about how to get more customers, how to make more per customer and how to keep them longer in the many failures and lessons.
We have learned along the way.
I hope you enjoy and subscribe.
So I was at a mastermind with seven other entrepreneurs and the total room cumulatively was doing over 500 million dollars a year in revenue and so this was kind of a cool meet up of very high-level entrepreneurs.
0:48
And you know, everybody kind of went up there and shared the things that they were doing well.
And you know, between things were eating and having a time and what was You're saying to me is that in the entrepreneurial world so many entrepreneurs, have all these weird sticks about like their food and their exercise and their hydration and they're what, you know, aren't glasses, they wear and their finger toe shoes and their bio hacking and just all this weirdness.
1:18
But I actually came from the Fitness world and all that stuff is complete make-believe bullshit and so it's really good for selling people stuff but it's complete.
Complete farce.
So anyways, I the whole time.
These guys are sitting there and they're like, oh no, I only keto there.
1:35
So, I only do intermittent fasting, right?
And, and I'm sitting there listening to them.
I'm like, you can Twizzlers and cookies, and ice cream.
And they're like, what the, you know, what are you doing, right?
And by the second day, they see that.
I literally continue to eat this way, like, an asshole and they're like, what do you, what are you doing, man?
1:54
Like how does this work?
And so between all the stuff that we talked about business-wise, While it was lunchtime, I was like, all right, this is this is kind of how I've been eating for 17 years and I was in better shape than all the guys there and believe it or not, a bunch of those guys.
2:12
Ended up telling me months later that they had all gotten in shape based on the presentation that I gave them, which is a different way of eating.
And so, I've been doing this for almost 20 years, I've been in shape that entire time I have not not had a six-pack since I was 13 or 14.
2:30
And I eat ice cream every day.
Yep, every day and I drink alcohol and I eat cookies and I do all the things that people want to do.
All right?
And so what I'm going to take you through is a very special little thing that I put together which is actually an adaptation of what I presented to these guys at this little meet up, all right?
2:52
So buckle up and I think that you will enjoy this.
So the first thing that everybody has to understand is what body If you are and what body type you'd like to become, right?
And so, I kind of put this on a little Matrix of high fat, low fat, low Muscle, High muscle.
3:08
So you could be, you know, high fat, low muscle, and you'd have a very feminine figure, right?
You could have low muscle low-fat and be Skin and Bones, right?
You could be high fat, High muscle and just be big, right?
You could be low fat and high muscle, which is what a bodybuilder is right?
3:27
And you know, there's various pieces along this.
This curve.
Right?
And so once you figure out where you are, let's say you're skinny, right?
And you want to get big right?
Then you would have a line that you can pretty much draw directionally to the place that you want to go, right?
3:44
So if you're going up that way, that means you need to increase your number of calories and you need to increase your volume, right?
Those are the two things that you need to do.
Because if you're going in this direction, right?
Then this, these are the Two directional arrows, this guy and this guy that you would need to adhere to, right?
4:05
So you basically plot the same hot hot increase calories, decrease calories, decrease volume increase volume along the same plot line that you had high fat low fat, High muscle, low muscle, right?
Don't get to spec caught up in this.
I just like to have visuals because that's how I think.
4:22
All right.
And so if you know where you are and you know where you want to go, then you can know what you need to do together.
You increase your calories, and increase your volume in.
There you go.
Go.
Now here's the thing that got them all, tripped up and then I said, hey guys, do you guys want to know why all your diets are the same and they were like what I was like.
4:39
Yeah, crazy, I know.
And so right now and not, including alcohol, there's three main macronutrients, are you got protein carbs and fat, all right, now, if you're eating a normal balance meal, that's what something like this would look like right.
You have kind of an even distribution of protein carbs and fat and your mail.
4:57
Right?
Right now, what Is whenever you do a diet, right?
So let's say you do Kido, all right?
Well, if you're doing keto, all you're doing, is you're going to be removing this orange thing and having just you basically eliminate your carbs, right?
5:13
And so you eat, 1/3 fewer calories.
Make sense.
If you have a low fat diet, you're eliminating your vet, which is this yellow guy, right?
And again, you're eating 1/3 fewer calories.
If you did a portion control diet, you would eat equal.
5:29
It's of the same three things, but just less of them overall.
And so you would you guessed it, eat fewer calories.
And if you did an intermittent fasting, you would go from eating three meals a day, deeding two meals a day and guess what?
You would be eating fewer calories.
Sorry about the camera being crazy any.
5:47
So, this is the thing that's happening right now, right?
Is that you're eliminating calories?
That is what is going on in every diet that you possibly do, all right?
And so all these guys get all like, oh no, I do really well with low carb.
I do really well with high fat.
Harlow, whatever.
It doesn't matter.
Like it's all horseshit it just calories, it's all the matters.
6:04
Okay.
And so this was driving me nuts, which is why I started making this little put together for you guys.
But this is why every other dies the same, right?
And here's the, here's the fun.
One for you.
If you struggled, and you had a diet that didn't work for you.
6:19
Here's why let's say, you did keto.
If you did keto the wrong, the right way, it would look like this, right?
You would cut out your carbs, right?
And then that calorie amount, Mount is eliminated from your diet and then over time you lose weight right now.
This is what a lot of people who said, akihito didn't work for me.
6:36
It's like because you started drinking butter, right?
You started eating Ribeyes for breakfast every day?
Well, no shit.
There's a lot more calories that you took in.
So the amount that you cut out did not compensate for the amount of excess protein and fat that you added into your diet, the ended up actually netting, you more calories than you would need right?
6:54
And that's why didn't work for you.
So that is why these diets don't work.
So what I will tell you now is what actually has to happen in order for it to work in reality.
Okay.
So these are the only three things that 99% of people need to know in order to figure out what they want to, how they want to eat, how they want to look.
7:14
All right.
You just got to know one how many calories you need to eat to how many grams of protein you need.
Eat and three.
How much volume you need to do?
I'm not going to talk about number three today.
I'm just gonna talk about one and two because that's what 99% you need even think about anyways.
Alright so here's the simplest way to Figure out number one, all right.
7:33
Now there's a million, there's a million little formulas that you can use here, all right?
But the basic one is your body weight times your goal, very simple.
So if you're 200-pound guy right, you wanted to maintain, then you'll probably be eating between 2600 and 3,000 calories.
So, 200 to do times, 15 would be cool, 3,000 calories, right?
7:53
That's if you wanted to maintain on the high side.
Right now, let's say you wanted to lose weight and let's say you wanted to go a little bit more extreme than it would be 200.
Oops, too. 200 times 10, which would be 2,000 calories, right?
Tada very simple.
All right there's a million different ways to try and calculate this and none of them matter.
8:13
All right, because controlling what you ingest is easy, understanding how much you expel in calories is very hard and so, it doesn't matter.
Anyways, all right.
Most Nation real quick.
If you are a business owner that has a big old business and wants to get to a much bigger business, going to fifteen hundred dollars.
8:33
Plus, we would love to talk to you and if you like that or like to hear more about it, go to acquisition.com, you can play anywhere on the page and talk to one of our team and see if we can help you get there.
So the thing is is step one is you determine how many calories supposed to eat based on your goal.
8:51
And the thing is, if you started this and you're like, man, I wanted to lose weight and you don't losing weight at a rate that you would find fast enough.
You can always just decrease it's not that hard, right?
Very straightforward.
So you multiply your body weight by the the number here so you can see here.
9:07
It's from Seven all the way up to 21 if you want to have extreme weight gain to be your body weight times, you know, a high up number over here, if you want to have Weight loss would be a low number over here and that's it, right?
If you everything in between.
So I said, if you wanted to have a pretty fast weight loss, then you'd be your body weight times 10, right?
9:26
Very simple.
Now now that we've done that we go to step 2.
All right?
You gotta figure out how much protein D.
And this is the part that everyone gets kind of trippy on, right?
Because it was showing you the whole point of this, some put this together for you and then you can have all the ice cream in all the cookies and all the alcohol you ever dreamed of and still have a six-pack.
9:45
All right, forever for good because it's my belief that if you're if you're going to do this, right?
If you're going to play the game, you have to do it in a way that you'd be able to do it forever, right?
If I can't do something for the rest of my life, then I don't see a point in doing it.
Who cares about being in shape for eight weeks, right?
When I want to be in shape for the rest of my life, right?
10:02
No One's Gonna remember you for being the in shape that that time period.
They're going to be like, oh yeah, you always struggled with his way and he was always trying new crazy things, wouldn't it be nice to just solve it for good?
Right.
Right.
Okay.
So protein, which is the second number here, your body weight times.
10:18
One in G, is about what you need to have for protein per day.
Very simple.
All right, so if we're 200 pounds, then you need 200 grams of protein.
Now, here's where it's kind of cool.
You're like, well, and here's the big as life.
A can possibly give you 100 grams of protein is To one pound of lean meat.
10:37
All right, so if you needed have 200 grams, that would be two pounds of lean meat.
And so for me, the world's simplest, you know, diet of all time and by died it's like this is just how I live is that I eat two pounds of meat a day, all right?
And like that's crazy, it's not really.
10:53
You get used to it right?
And you just stop eating the crap that you probably right now, right?
So two pounds of meat can be two pounds of shrimp, could be two pounds of Tilapia me, two pounds of and not have to be the same thing.
You could have a quarter pound of four different things, you know, excuse me, a half pound of four, different things you could have tenderloin.
11:14
You know, you have skirt steak, you have flank steak like, those are very lean.
Steaks, actually, doctor say sorry, flank steak saline.
You could have top round.
You could have top sirloin, like those are all very lean steaks.
All of these are just very lean proteins.
All right, chicken breast, right?
11:30
There's a million of these.
But the point is, is that a lean meat is lean meat, and They're all about the same in terms of grams.
All right, so if you needed to have 200 grams of protein, then you would have two pounds of lean meat and that's what you would eat for the day.
11:45
Alright, wait, don't worry.
You're like what about the cookies and ice cream.
I'm gonna get there.
All right, so Now, we have to figure out if we know how many calories were eating per day and we know how much protein reading that we need to figure out what's left over.
Alright, so here's how you put it all together.
12:02
One is we calculated our calories for our goal.
So if we said we wanted to lose weight and we were 200 pounds and we did 11 shirt because that we want to do moderate weight loss, we would eat 2200 calories a day.
Awesome Second Step here, we calculate protein for our body weight.
12:20
So if we were 200, Pounds.
We have 200 grams of protein, great, which is going to be two pounds of lean meat.
Simple.
All right, step 3.
We're going to calculate our calories from our protein.
All right, so roughly roughly, all right.
12:37
So if you want to be all sciency, 4 calories per gram is how many actual calories are in a gram of protein.
But when you eat a source of protein, like, a chicken breast, there's also some fat in it right, even when it's super lean, there's still some And so what we do, what I do, my back of a napkin, secret super method is you just multiply it by 5?
12:59
All right, the reason I do that is so that I can count for a little bit of fat that's going to be carried along with it.
All right, so if I'm going to have my 200 grams of protein times 5, it means I'm going to need about 1,000 calories, they're going to come for my protein sources.
Alright, great.
So now what I'm going to do is I'm going to take my step for my 2200 calories subtract my thousand calories of protein and I've got 1,200 Calories of whatever the hell I want.
13:24
Pretty cool, right?
And so, every day, here's the secret to having the body want for the rest of your life, eating cookies, every day and making every entrepreneur that you go to the master Minds with feel like a moron because you have six pack in your eating ice, cream and cookies and Twizzlers and all the things that you want in this world, while they are telling you about why they're biohacking, right?
13:44
And why, they're burning so much fat right now.
Except they look the same every year, right, right?
Here's the key.
You eat the 1200 calories of whatever the hell you want, and you can do it every day.
You can change what you want to eat in those 1,200 calories every day if you feel like it.
But the key point is that the Cornerstone of the diet is that you get enough protein in.
14:02
So you get your protein in first and then you fill up to the lid and whatever else you want.
Now, you may find out that a white potato is more filling than nerds ropes.
I would know this from first hand, but if you don't have a compulsive need to eat right, which I don't, then you can control yourself and eat whatever the heck you want.
14:20
Right?
I tend to not be that hungry as a person in general and so I like to have more appetizing foods and I'd rather eat less of them, right.
Some people love to have huge volumes of food in which case, you'll probably eat more Whole Foods, right?
You'll probably have more potatoes and rice and all that kind of stuff, right?
The point is that once you just know those two numbers, how many calories you eat, how many grams of protein you have, you can eat for the rest of your life.
14:42
Never go on or off a diet ever again.
And here's the cool part, you can split up those meals whatever way you want, all right?
You can eat them.
You can be, like, I can have five meals a day.
You can have three meals a day.
You could have one meal a day, it doesn't matter.
All right, crazy.
I know.
14:58
It's like, it's almost like they've been trying to sell you your whole lives.
I know.
All right.
But the reason this is so cool.
Is that you can't fall off, right?
There's no like Diet.
Like you can eat whatever the hell you want.
Like, it doesn't matter.
You want to have ice cream every day you guys from every day, right?
And so if you're like, oh, like you can't, you won't feel like you're cheating on a cheat day because you have ice cream every day.
15:19
Right?
The best Way to get people to become obsessed with food, is to get them to restrict themselves from doing stuff because then they splurge and, you know, do a ton of it.
But if you get extra day, it stops being special, Vicky cookies, every day.
It stops being special, right?
And so this is how I've eaten for almost 20 years.
15:35
This has been, you know, the secret behind it.
And I get very tired of seeing the entrepreneurial World get fooled with Shenanigans of stuff that does not matter.
And so, that is, that is why I wanted to share this with you.
It's also like the number one question I get which is like, hey, what do you what do you eat every day?
15:53
This is what I've eaten every day for almost 20 years.
And all I do is I just the, you know, the goal up and down.
If I want to, you know, if I wanted to gain weight, I would eat the same two pounds of protein.
I would just have more extra calories, that's it, right?
16:09
If I wanted to have it.
So you basically have this base of protein that just protects your muscle, right?
And then everything else is just variable of How many calories extra you want to eat?
And you can eat it whenever you want.
I want to make sure that I got all my little notes here that I remembered.
But the big Point here is that all this stuff works because you can't fall off, right?
16:28
You can't cheat because nothing is forbidden, right?
And no one is immune to a calorie deficit, right?
If you eat nothing long enough, you will lose weight.
Everyone like, like, some people lose weight faster or slower.
But everybody loses weight and deficit period.
Right?
16:44
And so that's it.
That's the that's the Food portion of what Alex eats every day.
And if you're an entrepreneur and you're like, man, I wish I could, you know, you're obsessed with all this biohacking and all the all the supplements to try and try and lose lose fat faster, but you're, but you look the exact same years later.
17:02
Then it's possible that maybe the stuff that you're doing doesn't work and it doesn't matter.
And instead you should take a page out of this and what's kind of funny is that I know just as much if not more about Fitness stuff than I do about business stuff, Tough.
But I haven't talked about in a long time and I don't want this channel to be a fitness channel.
17:21
I just get really, really tired of of, of the shenanigans and the tomfoolery that I see in the entrepreneurial space around this, and people speak in these absolutes and they're completely false and so anyways, I know that Mosey Nation.
You guys are intelligent and hopefully shredded and jacked in the future.
17:41
And I want you to be able to hashtag never skip dessert, while also having a six pack, and that is why I made this video for you.
So, So keep being awesome.
Lots of loved enjoyed this at sub.
If you didn't love you either way.
Could you guys next video?
Bye.








Company0:00
Most Nation real quick.
If you are a business owner that has a big old business and wants to get to a much bigger business, going to 50 $100.
Plus, we would love to talk to you and if you like that or would like to hear more about it, go to acquisition.com, you can play anywhere on the page and talk to one of our team and see if we can help you get there in some of the keys to our continued growth and success.
0:22
Welcome to the game where we talk about how to get more customers, how to make more per customer and how to keep them longer and the many failures and lessons, we have learned along the way.
I hope you enjoy and subscribe.
Good morning, happy Saturday.
I'm really excited for this podcast video because I've actually had this concept on my mind.
0:43
This, this, this piece probably for the last two and a half weeks.
I feel like it's been like, in the back of my mind like percolating and whatnot and it's Combining with like four or five other ones that I like felt it this morning.
As I was eating breakfast, I was like all right, today's the day.
I'm gonna make it so originally I wanted to call this, why?
1:01
I don't go home for the holidays and there's probably going to be some things that I say that are a little bit controversial, but there are things that have absolutely been some of the keys to our continued growth and success, and I thought you might want to hear them.
1:17
And so, I put the title, is this for, at least for right now, as success equals ingrained intolerance And so, one of the reasons that I don't go home for the holidays, is that a lot of people haven't haven't grown?
Since I left, right?
They haven't had 10 years of growth, they've lived the same six months, 20 times, right?
1:37
Since I was gone and when I go back, they want to meet me in my past.
And so, they want to speak things over me that aren't Who I Am anymore, and then because it's difficult for them to to The word connect, right?
1:55
The, their perception of who I used to be and who the person is sitting in front of them how they reconciled.
Thank you reconciling.
Those two things is really difficult for a lot of people because it's breaking the Box.
They want to put you in.
But the reality is that most people don't change entrepreneur's.
2:14
Do because we have to write, we call it growth.
Instead of change for the outside world.
For the non entrepreneurs.
Your stay in their same box every day.
It's It's hard to calculate.
And so I'll go home and they'll say, oh, like my dad says that.
2:30
So say you have a, you have the shortest fuse out of anyone.
You just have such a short temper.
And anyone who is in our company, my wife, like, I mean, anyone who knows me and spend time with me, would probably not say that.
And, and so, I will be, I mean, very aggressive in combating that immediately, because I be like, don't speak that Over me, that's not true.
2:53
That's not who I am.
And it makes people really uncomfortable and so there's a lot of times if I go see an uncle, you know what I mean?
If I'm at a holiday event and then they're like, oh Alexander, you've always been a little bit loose with the alcohol but I don't even drink anymore.
3:09
You know what I mean?
Like you're speaking about my past and it makes people really uncomfortable and I would implore you to meet those things head-on.
And the reason that I don't like going home for the Holidays, because I have to be on guard because when I when I leave I feel like I have to like, wash myself of the things that people were trying to speak over me and it's constant.
3:32
It's uh, nits unending.
Its incessant, right?
They're constantly trying to put me back in the box.
That makes sense to the right.
And I refuse to have that happen.
And so, when I have these conversations, it's passing comments, it's little things.
3:49
It's never because most people aren't confrontational, right?
And So it's never like you are like, you don't know me, like it's not like that but it's just like, oh, you know, how you always are.
And they'll say, even with like a smile, like, it's like, it's a good thing but like you have to catch it because you know how it makes you feel when you hear it.
4:06
You're like, that's not true.
That's not me, right?
I'm done with that.
That's in my past, right?
And so like, this is who I am, and I have to take like a week to detangle and then, basically, re speak over the things that I am or that I choose to be Right.
4:23
And so it's one of the main reasons that I don't go back for the holidays and I really, really don't like it.
And I definitely don't like spending any portion of extended time there is because it feels like I'm going backwards.
And and what, you know what?
We are.
All as a community trying to accomplish is not normal and we just have to come to terms of the fact that it isn't normal.
4:44
It's okay that it's not normal, but it also means that normal people aren't going to like it, right?
And so like the the higher up, we go in business.
Honest, I think at least this is just my subjective understanding or how I'm how I'm perceiving it.
As I go through it, the more intolerant we become of people who try and I mean, it's even tones.
5:05
Like, I'll be like, don't speak to me in that.
Tell them, even if they're saying they're anything like, it seems disrespectful.
It bothers me.
And, like, you become more and more aware, because you're like, let me teach you how to treat me, right?
And sometimes you have to do that and especially when it's been a long period of time, you have to teach people how Like to be treated now and a lot of times it's a lot different than it was when they first met you, right?
5:28
And it's the hardest with family because I'll be really real with you.
There's a lot of people that I'm connected with that.
I probably would never see again.
If I didn't have a blood relation and I manage our space very well and so if we you know we go back it's only going to be for a short period of time because there's no other reason besides the fact that we share a biological bond that I would ever see you because you haven't, you don't have the same goals, you don't have the same values, you don't want to.
5:52
Do the things I want to do when we see each other, you make me feel worse.
Why would I see, right?
Just being very real with you guys and maybe this is something that I look back at this video, five years from now, and I'll have grown more, and I'll have more perspective.
But that's that's where we are now.
6:08
Now, total total pivot like sometimes, you know what, I'm not going to Pivot like I'm going to.
I'm going to dive a little deeper in this.
Hopefully he's you guys don't mind like Being so intolerant of this stuff is like, is so key to being able to like grow I'm telling you because and that's why, that's why.
6:28
There's no we keep such quiet space, right?
Because it's like the only place you don't have to have your guard up constantly fending off.
With other people are trying to tell you about yourself, right?
And so you can kind of build it while it's while it's in its infancy and you're not as strong yet in these new attributes that you're trying to have.
6:46
I was talking to a high level entrepreneur yesterday, right?
And he's like, ah I mean I'm just horrible details and I was like don't speak that of yourself.
I was like because your business might need you to be good at details when you go from 10 to 20 minutes, right.
Don't say that.
7:02
And he was like, you're right.
I was like, yeah, you choose your choosing to not be good at details, right?
Do you really think that if your kids were going to die, like, you need to look learn to remember things to be able to do it.
Well, yeah, I'm like, all right, then you're choosing not be good at it.
That's your choice that your belief right?
And so like if you identify these things like Man, I'm getting really deep on this, I know, but like the identities.
7:23
So fluid like we can change in an instant like Tony Robbins, talks about this stuff all the time.
Like like we can like the only the only moment that we're actually able to live in is right now, right?
And so, all of the things that we had before us are only stories that we can either choose to replay because they're positive attributes or choose to ignore.
7:43
If they're negative attributes in a lot of us just stay in these Loops of speaking.
These things over ourselves that don't even survive.
Us right.
One of my favorite sayings in the world.
Probably one of my favorites at like one of the most profound sayings is we questioned all of our beliefs except for those that we truly believe and those we never questioned it all and I always I love that because it just makes you aware of.
8:06
Like I love catching myself on a belief that I've always had that I believe so thoroughly that I never actually thought to question it because that's how much I believed it, right?
It's just been there.
And so like the highwomen Work we do the more we kind of uncover these beliefs about what's possible.
8:24
What can we do?
How can we grow?
How quickly can change happen, right?
I mean if you look at our business hopefully you guys enjoy your Saturday morning, okay, if you look at our business, right?
Like we pivoted from a done-for-you model to the done with you model that we have now in April of 17.
8:45
Right?
And so from April of 2017 until today, right?
That's like 19 months, I think, right?
We've gone from zero, to arguably the biggest company like in the brick and mortar gym fitness world and we're like two or three times the size of anyone else who's like the second, runner-up and 2019.
9:05
We're going to probably three to four x that I can say that pretty with a lot of certainty.
And so like how quickly are you able to achieve what you want to achieve?
Eve, is it supposed to take a year because you're choosing to believe that it's supposed to take a year?
Right, how quickly can you onboard?
9:22
Someone, let me give you another story.
I was.
So we're about to do a very big launch for our Legacy group.
I can't tell you what it is, but a friend of mine launched a new service category in his business and it blew up overnight.
9:37
He had a huge explosion of traffic.
He was running like some ads and they just took off, right?
You couldn't do anything about it and so he hired Thirty people in 14 days.
First customer, Esteem 30 people in 14 days, right?
And so when we had our queue for planning, right?
9:55
Our core, our fourth quarter planning, we had our customer service director and and Lily, I love you to death has nothing to do.
But like this was what happened during that during the actual meeting, she's like I feel comfortable saying that I can bring four people on every month between now and next launch date.
Right?
Which would, you know, get us to probably 16 or so people 16 to 20 right by the launch date which is going to be like 3 or 4 months away.
10:16
And so then I told that story about my friend, And who just done this, he hired 30 people in 14 days because he had to write.
And so a lot of times, the necessity is one of the biggest things that allows us to break our beliefs because we have to, we have no other choice.
Look, guys.
10:34
You guys already know that.
I don't run any ads on this and I don't sell anything.
And so, the only ask that I can ever have you guys that you help me, spread the words we cannot more entrepreneurs, make more money, feed their families, make better products and have better experiences for their employees and customers.
The only way we do that is if you can rate and review and share this podcast, so the single thing that I have to do is you can just leave review, but taking 10 seconds or one type of the thump, it means the absolute world to me.
10:58
And more importantly, it may change the world.
Else.
Right.
And so I love thinking and that's why when we have scripts and whatnot and the the show rates, double based on the fact that, you know, you actually are going to leave a location and you're not going to be able to sell that person.
11:14
The tonality of how you're speaking to the prospect even though the words are the same.
The fact that it's just what you believe, that changes the outcome of the influence on the other person is like so cool to me.
And so the question is like, how can we trick ourselves right into believing what we need to believe in order to grow faster, right?
11:35
I made this.
I did this Experiment three years ago where I put on like 35 pounds of muscle and six weeks, right?
And I started and they asked me to write an article is muscle and strength and I did it natural.
You can choose to believe you or not, but I did.
And it was it was there by pounds of muscle but it was 35 pounds and there are a lot of those muscle within six weeks and I started the article off by saying like what if you actually had to gain 35 pounds in six weeks and get and at 100 to your batch, what would you do?
12:04
Right?
And so I try to put this conflict these confines on myself and I was like, I probably wouldn't just lift, you know, twice a week.
I ride for that lift.
I probably lift a like once or twice a day and then that's what I did.
And then I got really, really strong really fast.
I added 100 pounds to my pitch in six weeks and I always natural, right?
12:24
And I did that because of the confinement like the confines that we put ourselves under and so sometimes I wonder like, what things are we allowing to be spoken over ourselves by others first.
And then second what things are we?
Speaking of ourselves?
That we don't even know that we're doing and so constantly questioning like those things that we speak over ourselves as been.
12:44
Honestly, one of the biggest things that has allowed us to grow.
And so I know that I haven't been as taxable in the last few content videos.
I hope you guys don't mind, it's just been what's on my mind, we had Chris and Robin Barnett who flew out here because they want a competition that we were holding in secret.
13:04
And anyway, sir Christian, Robin Barton came out, and they were like, we feel like we're stuck, right?
We feel like we're in a bottleneck and like, we just can't, we're just trying to break through and when I talk to them about it, I the whole time they were here for the whole day, I didn't tell him a single tactical thing to do differently with their business, not one, but we identified was the things that they were speaking over themselves in the things that they were choosing to believe about how quickly things can happen, right?
13:33
And so I'll give you an example.
I hope they don't mind.
Robin is Chris's wife didn't want to be in the gym anymore.
She's like, it's not my passion, you know, I kind of like now we're comfortable like I kind of want to do my own thing and so and it was causing some strike from their relationship mostly because like, you know, She fell but, you know, the truth to him, that he had to keep doing it for the, he felt guilty that she normally there's just kind of both sides of it, right.
13:58
And so they were like, what we're going to let Robin go, you know, she's gonna leave in four months, right?
So we're gonna get four months and then she'll get out of the business and I was like why didn't she just get out today?
Like she doesn't want to do it.
You don't want her there, like why don't you just get out today?
Like why are you choosing to believe that it needs to take four months?
14:16
No, I guess it doesn't.
It was like, right?
And so a lot of times like I've just this is just been recently for me.
I've had a lot of conversations with guys who are doing 5 to 12 million a year in their businesses and a lot of them have been doing this a lot longer than me and they're like, how do you freaking grown?
14:36
So if like, how are you hitting the numbers?
You're hitting.
How's the Bro?
3 that you guys are having like, how is it possible?
And like, we've really just like, that's right.
Not to be weird about this, but like we've I've just chosen to believe it's possible, Right?
We've really just chosen to believe it's possible and a lot of times like, if you talk to them and like you look at it's like you see these guys who are really, really, really high up in the business World.
14:59
A lot of times they do, talk very non-taxable very much mindset stuff and I think it's and I used to really not appreciate it, but now I think I'm appreciating a little bit more because the reason that a lot of people aren't successful is because of the beliefs that they have.
Because if you can remove and break those beliefs, a lot of times, they will go find the Things that are necessary right to win.
15:19
And so and the higher up, you go the the cleaner people keep their space and the reason they do that, the reason they keep it.
So quiet is so that they can pinpoint anything that comes in their area, right?
Anything that's going to break or chip it them or just like bother them in any way to keep this bubble around them.
15:39
And then what that does though, is that it gives them such clean perspective, including Vision on, what's going on.
Because a lot of times when I have These guys, like I said, we're doing, you know, five six, ten million a year and they're like, what's going on?
It becomes really obvious.
It's really, it's really apparent.
15:56
I'll give you another example.
I had yesterday, I talked to a guy who's doing, he's doing half a million a month right now, and he has a split between two business and she's got one business does like four hundred thousand a month.
He's got one that does 100,000 a month and he's like well the big you know the form of thousand dollar month, business is my old business, it's the one that it's got all the complexity and Hate.
16:16
Customer all this stuff, right?
And then he's like, and then this business is really simple.
It's super profitable.
I'm running like three times the margin.
I run in that business and and he's like so I just I think I just can't figure out how to grow and also do you really can't figure out a girl?
16:34
He's like yeah just like I got so much stuff going on and I was like yeah you should probably just get rid of the thing.
That is a big headache for you and do the thing that you really like doing.
I was like, do you think if you got rid of all of the attention?
That that One thousand one thing is sucking up, you be able to double the hundred thousand and one things like yeah, like easy when I was like cool.
16:53
Then why don't you do that, right?
And it becomes really apparent and obvious to you on the outside.
Like I mean these guys aren't dumb, you know?
I mean he's doing 698 like he's not stupid, it's just the beliefs that we truly believe are the ones that we don't see.
Right?
And so it's really interesting.
17:09
Like I think all the time about like I want to be wiser, I want to have more discernment and if you really if you start to dissect, Like, what is wisdom, right?
Wisdom is being able to see is that is the two people are looking at the same situation.
The wiser person sees things that the other person doesn't and so it's Vision.
17:29
It's being able to see what other people's phones.
See.
And a lot of times they're just unseen change that.
People have already chosen to tie themselves up with right and we're having a lot of Gemini's.
I've had just recently a string of gym owner should be stopping like man.
We're just stuck at sixty thousand a month.
Like I don't know what this bottleneck is.
17:46
And I always respond, I'm like it's not the business, right?
It's you and it's and it's and I should probably respond more specifically.
It's a belief that you have that, you have an identified that's holding you back.
A lot of times it's just because you're choosing to make less money like no joke, a lot of people choose to make less money.
18:05
So people like off we have gimenez right now who are asked like, hey like I've got this campaign it's crushing it.
I think I'm going to turn it off for next month, right?
Because like we have a lot going on and I'm like if you want to choose to make less money, that's your choice, you know?
18:21
And so, we make these choices.
Like, if you, if you order, articulate them differently, you probably think they were ridiculous and I had every Listen, I've had just in the last two.
I've talked to foreigners last two weeks that are doing 5 million or more per year.
And each one of the conversations ended with like, well, when you put it like that, I sound like an idiot and I was like, well, are you?
18:42
It's like, well, no, no.
It's like, then you should probably change the way you're doing it, right?
And so, it's just these emotions in these believes that get in our way of, like, what is seems so obvious, and it's just because some, we are emotional beings, right?
We are, we make decisions with emotions and we try and logic it later, but when you look at things, We a lot of times, some of the, some of the, the answers are obvious, right.
19:03
Well, I've got this trainer that I've had for two years, but they're such a pain.
They never want to do anything other than anything that's new, but I have some clients that that's the like, mm?
Okay.
Do you think that if you had a new trainer that was like, bought in that you would be able to grow more.
So, red it is, is the fear of losing these few clients that are attached to this one trainer is outweighing the potential growth.
19:25
You would have from the key player that you know you need in order to make the model work.
Right, and then when it's phrased that way, it becomes obvious.
Yeah.
I got to let him go.
Duh.
But you don't have the perspective it and so sometimes you just need someone on the outside.
But anyways guys, thank you for spending Saturday morning with me.
19:42
This was just something that was on my mind and I just like, it was like, stirring in me.
But be mindful of the things I speak people speak over you and the tone that they do it and just like if you feel weird after someone says something stopped the conversation, catch it, and then address it and be like Please don't speak to me like that.
20:00
Please don't say those things about me.
It really bothers me.
I'm really working on this, where I've worked a lot on this and I don't, I don't appreciate it.
It really bothers me and if that person cares about you, they will change.
And if they don't get him out of your life you don't need that.
Right?
20:15
And and the most important person to make sure that you're doing that with his you like if you were the one who saying man I'm just not good at details man.
I'm just I'm just I hate employees.
Good Luck.
Running a business.
Like I hear something like these are things I over here even in our group like employees are idiots.
20:33
And like do you really think that that is a good belief to grow and repeat inside of yourself if you want to grow and scale a business?
Probably not right?
But be mindful of the things that you're saying because and then ask yourself like does this belief certain and if it doesn't get rid of it.
20:51
So anyways I hope you guys have an amazing weekend.
Love you all.
Thank you guys for for Your attention.
I know what's your most valuable resource.
So thank you.
I hope I gave you a good return on it and I hope you guys have an amazing, amazing day.
All right to love








Company0:00
What's going on, everybody?
I'm bringing some more books, but I wanted to say that, if you haven't checked out Hunter million-dollar offers, I would definitely suggest that you start there.
I've gotten some solid feedback and it couldn't be happier with its.
Number one ranking on Amazon for direct marketing and over 5,000, five star reviews.
So, thank you guys so much for that.
0:15
It's 164 pages.
I really can help you out.
It takes about four hours to get through, check it out.
On Amazon, the Kindle book is 99 Cents.
The audiobook is Lowe's, they'll let me put it on for it.
So I think it's 12 bucks.
So enjoy that and let's start.
The podcast is to is to have freedom, right?
0:30
So we want to not work or not have to work and have money coming towards us.
Welcome to the game where we talk about how to get more customers, how to make more per customer and how to keep them longer and the many failures and lessons, we have learned along the way.
I hope you enjoy and subscribe.
In this video, I'm going to show you how to take an active business and make it into passive income, right?
0:52
So the goal that most of us entrepreneurs have right is to is to is to have freedom, right?
So we want to not work or not have to work and have money coming towards us.
And the thing is what I have learned is that you can make anything passive and you can make anything active and one of the difficulties for entrepreneurs.
1:10
When you switch from entrepreneur to investor, is that you want to take your passive things and make them more active in order to increase your returns.
And that's a very tempting.
Anything to do because we're entrepreneurially and we can see where the margin is getting lost, right?
But if you always chase time, then you'll always be able to make whatever it is.
1:26
Like if you chase time, always then eventually you'll end up with all your time and you should have some leftover that is coming towards you, right?
And so I'll give you a quick example.
So, Jim launched, two years ago, I think mates, it made 17 million.
I mean, according to our quality of earnings, we made 17 million in profit in 2019, 2018, 2019 season, 2018.
1:47
And this year, we'll probably do eight million cash in profit.
So you're like, whoa, you cut in half.
Here's the difference.
When we did 17 million, I was the business.
It was 100% Alex's face wrapped with a monetization structure wrapped around it.
I was taking calls.
I was doing all of these things.
2:03
I was definitely CEO.
I was definitely in front of the marketing.
I was also the product.
I was doing all those things, right?
Right now, the business basically generates half the profit, but it involves me for about 90 minutes a week and so my dollars per hour.
They hire because now I also have all these other things that I can do with the time that has earned back for me.
2:23
And so, what I want to walk through in this video is kind of the process and how to do it and when to do it.
And so what are the issues that I see people starting out?
And when I say starting out there, you know, making a million three million etcetera is that I'll get messages from them and they're like, dude, I think I'm ready to Outsource my business and I'm like, but why?
2:40
Like I don't think you've gotten to the I mean it may be maybe somebody who's at a zillion you know?
So this to me like why are you doing that now?
But I think Me.
I might answer it be like, I've achieved the wealth that I that I want.
I don't need to gas it anymore and now it's really using a different metric for Success which is like, how much can I spend?
2:56
You know, how much time I spent with my life, my wife, how much time going to spend whenever I want in the gym, working out eating the stuff, I want to eat etcetera.
Right?
How can I have other metrics for Success spending time?
You know, meeting people Etc and doing stuff like this which I never did while I was growing the business not in this way, right?
3:13
And so anyways, the thing that I see people do is they try and I jump out of the CEO seat too soon, but what I want to do is give you a mass model for how to do it when it's right, right?
Because ultimately if you can turn your active income into passive income, I just love this quote.
You get paid on what you do.
3:30
You get Returns on what you own, right?
Jim launched as an Enterprise is far more valuable or my fitness companies because there's a couple, there are far more valuable now than they were, when I made 17 million dollars in profit because then no one would ever buy it, right?
Because No One's Gonna buy me, right?
It's just a bruise personality Grant, whereas now is an Enterprise that Its Revenue by providing value to customers on a consistent basis.
3:50
And I have nothing to do with it and as a management team in place etcetera, right?
And so, as we make these transitions, right, going from CEO to owner, you have to go from active to passive.
So this is the mental framework, that that it took me a really long time to discover when figuring this out.
4:06
Alright, so think about your trajectory as an entrepreneur, right?
So first you start, you do everything, right?
And then all of a sudden you start delegating out the things that are the lowest value TimeWise, right?
If you can pay someone In ten dollars an hour or 15 dollars an hour to do, you know, ten dollars, ten hours a week of your work then you get 10 hours back and then you can put higher value skills in those 10 hours and then make more money and then fundamentally that's literally what entrepreneurship is just arbitraging time over and over and over again.
4:30
And then leveling up your own skill set.
So that with the time that you get back, you can provide you can do more valuable things.
And that's I think one of the bigger issues that I see a lot too is that people will Outsource their time and then not fill their time back up with higher value skills, right?
Now, if that's what you want to do for lifestyle-wise, that's cool.
But like in terms of the game if you Seek to grow.
4:47
Then you need to re re put more things in your stack and take the extra 10 hours and do something even more valuable.
Maybe it's marketing again or learning a new channel or improving the product or whatever it is.
It's more valuable than maybe Frontline support right or whatever.
And so the idea here is going from active to passive.
5:06
And so, as I was saying, when you replace that role, right, what you did is you got time back, right?
And so if you do that enough times, you're always, you know, doing the First thing, but here's what's kind of funny and this is the mental framework that I want to give to you.
Imagine.
5:22
Like, let's say, you look back at what you were doing a year ago and it probably should look different than what you're doing today, right.
Hopefully if you're if you're growing your business, what you're doing, then versus what you're doing now is different.
And so if you look back to what you were doing then and you see the progress that you made to what you're doing now then rather than saying, okay, well in 12 months I'm gonna be doing all these things and all these things are gone.
5:42
If you can actually jump two steps forward, then your business could be 100 And growing at the same pace of this.
Now with somebody doing both of these things that you were doing and then you just owning it.
Real quick guys.
If you can think about how you found this podcast, somebody probably tweeted it told you about it.
5:59
Should it on Instagram or something like that?
The only way this grows is through word of mouth and so I don't run ads, I don't do sponsorships, I don't sell anything.
I only ask is that you continue to pay it forward to whoever showed you or however you found out about this podcast that you do the exact same thing.
So if it was a review, if it was a post, if you do that, you mean the world to me and you throw some good karma out there for another entrepreneur.
6:23
All right, and I know you're like wait what does he mean?
I'll try and explain this again.
So this is like if you can understand this concept it will set you free and allow you to turn your active income.
Businesses into passive income things that you get Returns.
On these become assets that become celibate.
6:38
One of the number one issues that people have is like, you can't sell personality brains.
You can't sell their own businesses because they're so integrally involved in them, right?
And this is one of the mistakes, a lot of people make, especially smaller entrepreneurs is there like you know, my business makes let's say three million dollars a year, right?
And in that process, It.
Well, if it would cost, you know, a million and a half to get all of the leadership and Executives in order to do all the stuff that you're doing, which is which is very realistic.
7:01
You might need 45 high level leaders to do that stuff.
Then your business is actually making a million or a million-and-a-half in profits.
It's actually half as valuable.
So you're doing a million and a half dollars a year of payroll work because you're getting paid for that and then your business is returning, you an extra one and a half million.
7:19
So your your total as a person or netting, three million dollars.
But the Enos is generating 1.5 and you are generating 1.5.
If you can delineate that concept it will serve you very well in business and especially with the concept I'm saying right now.
So the idea is what we want to do is take two steps forward from where we're at right now, not one because if you take one step forward you delegate what you're doing now and then you start doing the next thing, right?
7:42
That you need to do but if you do get what you're doing now and then you get someone else to do the thing that you should be doing next.
Then you can take a step back and now you're owning the business while this person.
Now, does the thing that you were doing before and that is ultimately how you can take your active thing and turn it into passive.
And now you're an owner who looks at the Enterprise and then was crazy about this is that you can actually see the weaknesses.
8:03
Your own business far better.
When you're outside of it, looking in and see, you can see the marketplace better, you can see what your customers are saying better.
It's you just get so much more perspective and then you really become the chairman of the board.
And then you're really meeting with the CEO and you're talking to see about their direct reports, how they can improve as a leader and what they need to do in order to kind of like and help them cast The Vision for the company, that's really it.
8:27
And the thing is the vision doesn't change that frequently.
And so you need to be smart about why you're choosing to go in the direction you are.
But once you've made the decision, there's Not a lot of change that has to happen, right?
It's really like how can we execute consistently to get there?
And so big picture to wrap this puppy up, if you want to go from business running to business ownership one.
8:48
Don't do it too soon.
And this is the probably the number one mistake that I see people make is that they do it too soon to if you are going to do it then if you can think about what you get paid on versus what you do Returns on, then you can separate what you do versus what you own within the value that you have in your own network.
Like you are valuable because you have skills I own about like I love this quote, I'll say it again.
9:10
Poor people do the wrong things, rich people do the right things, wealthy people own the right things and so if you can think through that within your own life, it's like, well, I need right now.
You're probably doing the right things and you own some of the right things, right?
But you're doing both of these things you're getting paid here.
9:25
You're getting paid here and getting returns here.
So we want to put someone in place to do the things that we're getting paid for and then continue to keep the things that we're getting Returns on a mind.
You at some point that means that my you might lose half of your income.
If If it's 50/50, right?
If if your business makes you a million dollars a year and then you make a million dollars, you're working your business and the business and its you two million.
9:45
Then you quitting right quitting and and hiring somebody else to do this thing because you take two steps forward.
If you do that, then all of a sudden you'll get a pay decrease, but your dollars per hour will go up your Enterprise Value.
Go up because now it is something that is sellable that operates without you, all right.
10:02
And so they're actually means that your net worth increases even though the the quote profit of the business decreases and then here's what's cool.
At once you've done this right once, you've eliminated the step and now you just own the thing that you get Returns on.
Now you can focus on how can I how can I increase Revenue here?
Trying to put more fingers on my on my ready, right?
10:19
How can I increase the revenue that I'm making here without me being involved?
Because it's all about the constraints that we can put on ourselves.
So if I can increase the revenue without me doing anything, how would I do that?
And then you ask better questions and then you get better answers and then that is ultimately how you can grow the wealth of the business without you spending more time.
10:37
We're making more trade-offs that you don't want.
To make because you got in this game for Freedom, right?
And so, anyways, hope this value before you hit subscribe because it was check out the next video that comes up because I'm sure it's sweet.
And if you hated this, then I would ask that you can you can also tell me that you hated it and I will send you love you.
10:54
The right.
So anyways, keeping awesome lots of kitchen next video.
Ah,








0:00
Real quick.
Because you guys already know that, I don't run any ads on this and I don't sell anything.
And so, the only ask that I can ever have you guys that you help me spread the word so we can have more entrepreneurs, make more money, feed their families, make better products, and have better experiences for their employees and customers.
And the only way we do that is if you can rate and review and share this podcast, so the single thing that I have to do is you can just leave review will take you 10 seconds or one type of the thumb, mean, the absolute world to me.
0:25
And more importantly, it may change the world of someone else.
My mentor sold his company for three billion dollars and I asked him, how should I set up my wealth?
Welcome to the game where we talk about how to get more customers, how to make more per customer and how to keep them longer and the many failures and lessons, we have learned along the way.
0:42
I hope you enjoy and subscribe.
My mentor sold his company for three billion dollars and I asked him, how should I set up my wealth in this video?
When talks about it is one of the many components that he broke down for me, in terms of how I should set up my wealth and my investment as an entrepreneur, all right?
1:00
And so everything going to break down is based on what that conversation was and what he explained to me.
Alright, so right off the top, he was like, listen, there's only two things you can do with your money, you can either buy stuff with it or you can lend it to people and get interest on it.
That's it.
1:16
All right.
So once you understand that, those are the only two things you can do, then you can start analyzing your decisions, appropriately.
He's like from a risk perspective.
All right.
These are the ways that we decrease risk for the Investments especially if you're lending.
The first is that we make sure that you are the top of the Caps deck.
1:31
All right, cap stack just means the stack of capital.
So if you have multiple people who are lending or own something, who gets preferential treatment, alright?
So a preferred creditor or somebody has preferred stock means that if something goes bad, that person gets paid out first, right?
You can either A liquidation preferences.
1:47
I when you get into that stuff but if your top of the cap stack, so for example if you do lose your job and you can't pay your mortgage anymore, the bank is the one who gets your house because they are the preferred creditor so you don't get your house.
Your bank at your house even though you put money into it, the bank put money into it to and they are the preferred creditor so they get your house even though you lost the money.
2:06
Right?
And so that is the first element of risk.
The second one is like you want to be able to see at all times.
What's going on?
And so that's called transparency.
All right, so that's what kind of reporting.
Do you have?
What kind of relationship do you have?
How clearly, you know, have you have access to the books.
This is why publicly traded companies, for example, you have lots of transparency, right?
2:23
So the second way you decrease risk is through transparency.
The third is through liquidity.
All right, so this is speed to money our money transferring from money to money, right?
Is liquidity.
And that means that you can get in and out of position very easily, very quickly or you can, or you can translate one asset into money back into it very quickly.
2:43
And that also is an element that decreases risk if you have to hold on to Nothing.
And you want to get rid of it and you can't.
That means it's not that liquid.
Which means you're at higher risk, right?
And she's like, so this is what I'm thinking about when we're lending money.
Now, the second thing is, what are we going to look at for the investment, right?
2:59
There's four pieces to what you need to look at for, for all your Investments.
The first is, what is the yield right is, is this thing going to pay me month over month the month?
So for example, if I bought crypto that's not going to pay me anything, right?
What that's going to do is increase in value or Hope is that it's going to increase in value.
3:18
That is one of those.
The greater fool Theory which is you buy and then you hope that there's somebody else in the future is going to buy it from you for more money, right?
And that's appreciation.
So you have Equity growth.
The next is the yield which I mentioned earlier, which is do I get cash flow.
So, if I had a real estate property that would give me cash flow, if I owned a business, that would give me cash flow, whereas if I'm buying an asset and hoping it appreciates like crypto or like gold or whatever, those are the things that were hoping that increase in value.
3:41
The next is is it tax-advantaged?
All right.
And what I mean by that is if you have two different investments in one of Them has a better tax structure based on laws, then that would be a better investment.
So this is why it's a variable because if you can have two things and one of them has this characteristic than it would make it a better investment, right?
And is there a way that we can structure our investments so that we get a better tax treatment and the answer is yes, right.
4:01
And then finally is Preservation of capital, right?
Which is How likely you might lose my money, right?
And what I was, what I can tell you is, of all the guys that I know who are worth half a billion, a billion.
This, this individual is all his for 3 billion or more.
4:17
Is that there are far more far more and they just repeat it over and over and over again.
So if this is repetitive, then take it in because I've been dealing with it, you know, on their side too.
Is that it's way more about return of capital then return on Capital.
They're far more concerned with making sure that they keep their money, then that they grow the money.
4:36
And I think that Having this defensive.
First strategy has been something that I've seen over and over and over and over again.
And you listen, Charlie Munger, you listen to Warren Buffett.
It's always never lose money, right?
It's always never lose money.
And that's always the first and second thing that they're thinking about because any number, no matter how big it is.
4:52
X 0 is still 0.
So you can erase an entire, you know, lifetime of excellent Decisions by one, very poor decision, which is why mitigating downside is so important.
And this preservation of capital, kind of relates to these three things that I mentioned earlier.
All right.
Right.
So now that he played this is the foundation is like you're an entrepreneur, all right?
5:11
And so you're going to have buckets of wealth and this is how we're going to set it up for you.
Alright.
So the first is I have acquisition.com.
All right which is our portfolio company.
That's where all of our companies sit in.
All right, and so for those you don't know us at the time of this making we're doing about 85 million dollars a year between our portfolio companies, all right.
5:30
And what happens is that cash, then cash flow is generated, right?
Every every day, every week, There's Josh has been generated from these businesses because those are the types of businesses that we like to work with.
So we're not, there are businesses that generate, you know, losses for long periods of time and then they try and sell later.
5:47
Like, software companies tend to be in that we owned one software company but the vast majority of our portfolio is is asset light, High cash flow generating businesses.
All right now there are three buckets that this cash goes into all right.
The first and simplest bucket is indexes, all right?
6:05
And the reason we do this, For us specifically, is that they are passive, all right?
And they are truly passive, all right?
I don't have to worry about Coca-Cola and how it's going to run.
I don't think about it.
I'm not on their board meetings.
I'm not giving them in sight, right?
I let I let Uncle Warren.
Do that for me.
But indexes are the the first probably first and 50% bucket for us in terms of where I love this and there's some advantages to indexes that I'm going to share as that that that you get that most people don't know about, all right, especially people who don't have as much money.
6:36
Yeah.
All right, that's what we're trying to solve with this channel here.
All right, so indexes and the reason we do this is because a super passive and be it's because I'm bullish on the long run that I think the economy's going to go over the long term.
And so I want to just preserve my capital and not have to think about it.
So I can immediately, I look at the cache and this is something that people don't talk about.
6:55
So if I can allocate all my money, almost immediately every single month, then I get so much more growth over my portfolio for my entire career.
Because if every, if let's say, I only did Real Estate, For example, well, there's a There's a time delay to allocate cash flow in real estate.
7:11
You have to go find deals, you have to review the deals and then you have to, you know, make your offer, secure, the deal negotiate and then you have to fund the deal and there's the whole escrow period.
There's all this there's time to, like, right?
And so during that period of time is when that money could have been growing, but it's not, right?
And so, just from a, from a context of respect for you, like the speed of allocating Capital also can increase the return.
7:32
So I'm not saying do things in a rush because one of our money rules is mistakes, level Rush decision.
All right, so we do Don't want to do that, but it's just that, but there is a mathematical component to allocating Capital quickly.
All right, Hey guys, love that.
You're listening to the podcast.
7:48
If you ever want to have the video version of this which usually has more effects, more visuals, more graphs, you know, drawn out stuff.
Sometimes it can help hit the brain centers in different ways.
You can check out my YouTube channel.
It's absolutely free.
So check that out if that's what you are into and if not keep enjoying the show, So index is our first big bucket here.
8:09
The second big bucket is multifamily, real estate.
All right?
And the reason we do this multi specifically people, like why don't you do single family home?
Because I have to buy like two houses a day if I was going to do single family homes, like just from the amount of cash flow that we generate.
And I'm not saying that to posture, I'm just saying, realistically like it would, it would become an entire business, how we could do that, but then he would become a business, but that's not my main business.
8:31
This is my main business or you're running our portfolio companies.
So that's what I need is spending my time doing.
Not trying to buy, you know, homes and bird-dogging and things like that.
That's just not my thing.
So I'd rather buy 300 units at a time and an alligator Capital that way.
Now, here's the specific reason for us why we use multi is that if you can designate yourself as a real estate professional, which is 750 hours or more per year than you're able to take your depreciation of your assets, like buying a big, you know, real estate thing and appreciating its your regular income so let's say I buy a building for ten million dollars, all right, and let's say I make 10 million dollars This year, I'm just using simple math numbers.
9:08
Okay.
Now I might be able to take an accelerated depreciation of about 40% on this against my income.
So this now, I only get taxed on six million dollars.
All right, here's why this is cool because the four million, right?
That I'm saving is probably gonna see me about 1.8 million 1.8 million dollars in taxes, and that goes straight to my net worth as 1.8 million dollars that I can now put into indexes, or I can put into building, you know, whatever it is right.
9:32
And so because of that, I actually am able to grow my well that even faster rate because this is tax vintage if you remember this guy, right?
And so that is why we like multifamily.
Now here's something cool that you may may or may not have known about but when you're looking at indexes, for example, one of the things that's awesome about indexes is that you can actually loan money or get loans on your indexes at about one and a half percent.
9:57
All right, that's crazy, low interest rates and the reason is because it's a secured loan and typically you can take about 50 to 60 percent There we go of your indexes.
So let's say I had 10 million dollars here, I'm just using simple math.
Alright, then it means that I would be able to take five to six million dollars of this and only pay one and a half percent on that.
10:16
And I could buy real estate I could buy whatever I felt like doing using that money and basically pay nothing on it.
And so for context you know 1% of five million dollars is 50 Grand.
All right so you have five million dollars by can't, make fifty thousand dollars a year or 75 thousand dollars a year if it's one and a half percent on On that money in a year that I probably suck at investing and that's okay.
10:38
But like you get the idea right?
Like if I can make even 10% right on my five million dollars that I would make 500,000 dollars and it would cost me 50 to 75 percent fifty seventy-five thousand dollars per year to carry that money right?
Great deal for me and that is why I like indexes a lot to us because it actually allows us to still reinvest in the other things.
10:57
With super, super low cost, low risk money.
All right.
Now the third bucket here, Is Cash / spec.
All right, and technically cash, inspector different things, but I'm just going to put it here for sake of explanation.
11:12
And the reason he told me to put this here, he's like, there's always going to be things.
He's like your entrepreneurial.
He's like, Joey's have little deals that come up and you want to have some dry powder which is the term they use on the sidelines so that you can deploy that opportunistically, right?
And like, for example, I think I recently told you guys about a two and a half million dollar debt, note that we wrote that will probably make three Four hundred thousand dollars on in about 90 days, right?
11:35
So, I'm going to give two and a half million dollars and then they're going to hold it for 90 days.
And then I'm going to get 300 thousand dollars back.
Plus my original money and it only that I only get those types of deals because I always have cash on me.
And so people know that I always have decent amounts of cash and so they will hit me up and be like hey can you find this deal?
11:51
Can you can you know underwrite this this this note or whatever it is and because they know that I have a lot of capital on hand.
I have these opportunities that come towards me, right?
And so with that, I can generate, you know, pretty good returns.
On having this stuff.
And I just like having me personally for my peace of mind having a certain amount of cash on the sidelines, right?
12:10
And so this was the investment strategy that he outlined for us.
This is kind of our wealth strategy in terms of big picture of how we allocate our money so the money gets generated.
Boom, it goes here, we basically split it between indexes and multi-family.
We can always use our index has to generate more.
12:29
We can usually take loans against that if we want to if we want to deploy.
Stuff and get even better returns or whatever.
And then finally, we have our cash and speculative stuff and I tend to have little bit more cash because I am an entrepreneur and because I'm an entrepreneur I like to have that liquidity available to me at all times, all right?
12:48
And you'll notice here that this is not a very high risk portfolio.
And the reason for that is because all of my, my real net worth is being generated here.
Right here we go.
All my net worth is being generated in this bucket, right?
This is Vast majority.
13:03
My net worth has been created in that and that is where all my risk lies.
Now you could make the argument and this is what, you know, he made me.
He's like it's not that high risk because you know what you're doing, right?
Is like an, that's the easiest way to decrease.
Your risk is to know is like diversification is a hedge against ignorance as Uncle Warren says.
13:19
And so he's like, you know, what you're doing here.
And so it's not actually the wrist but it's still the vast majority of your net worth, which is why we can quote beat the market by big by big amount because we're actively involved in each of these companies, we have Niche expertise in these industries.
We know how to grow them at a much, much, much faster rate than what the market does, but this is much more a preservation of wealth strategy than a, especially these three buckets here than a than a true true growth strategy.
13:45
But this is how we set it up for me because I'm an entrepreneur.
And this is kind of how my risk, you know, looks in my life.
And so I hope you enjoyed this video.
The reason that I make this video in the reason this channel exists is because we're trying to grow our portfolio to a billion dollars a year in revenue.
14:01
And the only way we can do that is by reaching more entrepreneurs and helping them out and then hopefully getting the opportunity to invest in their businesses and for everyone else who is an entrepreneur, my goal is to help you grow your business and not sell you anything at all.
So, I've got something really cool that's coming out soon.
I'm really excited about spent a lot of time on it, but I hope you guys got value in this video.
14:19
I'll see you in the next vid.
Keep being awesome.






0:00
Real quick.
Because you guys already know that, I don't run any ads on this and I don't sell anything.
And so, the only ask that I can ever have you guys that you help me spread the word so we can have more entrepreneurs, make more money, feed their families, make better products, and have better experiences for their employees and customers.
And the only way we do that is if you can rate and review and share this podcast, so the single thing that I have to do is you can just leave review will take you 10 seconds or one type of the thumb, mean, the absolute world to me.
0:25
And more importantly, it may change the world of someone else.
One of the goals of any business is Is to maximize the amount of Revenue per customer regenerate, right?
Welcome to the game where we talk about how to get more customers, how to make more per customer and how to keep them longer and the many failures and lessons, we have learned along the way.
0:42
I hope you enjoy and subscribe.
In this video, I'm going to talk to you about one of the questions that I get most frequently and that I one of the problems I have to solve again most commonly in some of the companies that we take on in our portfolio.
0:57
So one of the goals of any business is to maximize the amount of Revenue per customer regenerate, right?
And a lot of times you want to have what's called, I got accommodating buying curve.
And so, what that basically means is at every rung, right?
1:12
If someone is wealthier, you want them to buy more and spend more money with And if someone has less money, want them to still buy from you, but potentially Buy For Less, right?
And so this gives way to a lot of these crazy product and service listings where people have, you know, a hundred different services and products that they offer, because they want to have the ability to serve everyone at the maximum degree.
1:38
The thing is, is that most times that will create so much operational complexity and create so many little appendages, right?
Right.
Little sticky things that are stuck onto the side and bolt it on and Globs and duct taped onto a business that it becomes incredibly distracting for all of the employees.
1:55
Because the thing about all these different things, and here's a funny one, is that most times.
If your employees don't understand all the different types of things, you sell in the price points, you sell them at your customers, for sure.
Don't write.
And so, one of the things that we will do when we're looking at a company, is we will simplify the product offering and instead trying to reach the Maximum buying threshold / Prospect by changing the payment terms.
2:22
All right.
Now, in a perfect world, if everyone had absolute information and everyone was unbelievably well trained, and you had a great infrastructure.
All that stuff, then yes, the more products and services, you offer in theory, you would make more money but we don't live in that theoretical world.
2:40
Most of the time and most small business owners are not that good at operating rights.
The number one issue, they have their super disorganized.
And they feel like they're spinning the reels all day, their team completely has no idea what which way they're going, they change things all the time etcetera.
And so in an effort to combat that we have used this process over and over again and it has worked very well.
2:59
All right, so it is as follows.
We sell two things.
All right, and I've done this in virtually every business that I've ever owned, we sell two things, two products, or two services.
And this is once we're going from 1 to 10 million.
Alright, 0 to 1 million.
3:15
You saw one product or one service, one Avatar, all right, that's it, one channel, one product, one Avatar, that's it, right?
But once you're going from one to, you know, 123 ish million, and you're trying to go to 10, you introduce the second product line.
3:30
All right?
And so here's how this works.
If you have two things that you sell, you'll have a front-end thing and you'll have a back-end thing.
All right, now we can still have a massive accommodation in the buying curve based on the payment terms that we introduced.
3:49
All right.
So for example, people will look at their monthly expense more than the total contract value.
All right.
That's a huge money hack giving you right now.
This is a wealth hack.
This Is something that will build make you a fortune in your life.
4:05
If you can properly understand this, people do not look at the length or the total contract, they're signing.
They will only pay attention to what is it going to cost me every month?
Because no one is good with their money, all right?
So they only look at the cash flow expense month, over month over month, and they just think, can I make it happen?
4:24
Yes, cool.
I'll sign.
They don't think about the total contract value for you as a business owner.
The contract value matters, almost more than anything, right?
Right.
Right?
So I'll give you a quick hack on this.
Total sidenote tangent for you.
Life hack Pro tip.
If you want to extend the contract value that you have, I have a saying which is the bigger the head, the longer, the tail, all right?
4:46
And so what that means is the more you can get someone to pay upfront and relative to The Upfront cost of signing up or what they paid down the lower, their contract renewal recurring payment is the sticker will be.
So, I'm going example.
If I had someone sign up for $99 a month, for whatever, doesn't matter, right?
5:04
That that price point might be medium sticky depend on the Value that I have.
Now imagine I had someone pay five thousand dollars down and $99 a month after that.
How much more sticky would.
It be significantly more sticky.
Right now, the beauty is, if you have one of these up front type payments, you can also use that to liquidate your ad costs, cover cover, you know, your commissions for the salesperson cover, The Upfront, fulfillment, and onboarding, which is going to cost, more for a new customer than an existing customer.
5:33
And so you can build all that in.
If you know that the thing that you are selling has very high gross.
Ian's, then you can still have a lower cost as long as you know that the person is going to stay for a long time.
And So, based on how you structure, the pricing, you can actually get some, you can use the pricing actually get people to stick longer.
All right, so Pro tip complete that is it moving back to the original thing that I was talking about.
5:56
You guys love that you're listening to the podcast.
If you ever want to have the video version of this which usually has more effects more visuals, more graphs, you don't drawn out stuff, sometimes it can help hit the brain centers in different ways.
You can check out my YouTube channel.
It's absolutely free.
So check that out if that's what you are into and if not keep enjoying the show, So in one of our portfolio companies, we actually had, this is a really in-depth discussion that we had to make a decision about, all right.
6:23
And so they had a different, you know, Mentor person.
Whatever advice told them that they should have three products, right?
And they should have, you know, low medium and high product and then based on, you know, with the salesman, thought the salesman would sell them the low medium or high in my experience.
6:40
It is not that effective and that is because the salesperson can't decide, which of these things they are trying to sell most of the time.
And so what we have found is more effective, is you give the salesperson the one dream to sell this thing is going to solve this person's problem and we make it the most valuable thing that we're trying to sell.
6:58
Because at the end of the day, you do want to solve the customers problem, right?
We do want to actually make sure that we're providing value.
And so rather than having a diet a medium and a great, right?
Simply Having one thing that solves all the problems Problems and then based on the customers budget, we can decrease how they pay.
7:18
All right, so hear me out.
So let's say that we want to do a this is a six-month implementation of whatever kind of solution you sell, right?
If you have a six month duration you can have the person, a pay, the entire thing up front.
So that would be for somebody who has the highest budget, right version 2 would be a split pay version.
7:40
We might be three payments right with at 20% higher, right.
And then finally you might have a have a have a you know a six pay or whatever over that period of time, right?
So 1 2 3 6.
Now here's the cool thing.
The more payment options you provide the higher conversions are that's proven.
7:59
Alright.
So the more options you give someone to pay the more people will buy period.
Now you might not make more cash flow because if you give your sales guy more options than they might use those kind of default, Into the lower ones, right?
But if you have one thing to sell, then they only have one thing to convince the person up because a confused mind, doesn't buy.
8:19
If you have too many options, the salesman won't know what to sell in the prospect, won't know what to buy.
And so, I prefer, when I'm brick coming into a portfolio company.
I'm thinking, what is this true problem that we are solving with this business?
For what Avatar?
And we make that the main thing and we communicate it clearly in the scripting and the salesperson has Clarity on what they are selling in there.
8:40
Always solving the same thing.
And so the question becomes no longer, which of these things are you going to buy?
But once you are buying, how would you like to pay?
And so, then the discussion is around what payment plan is best for them.
Rather than what product is best for them.
8:57
And so by doing that, you can get people to go between different payment terms.
That is not going to change whether they're going to buy, but if they're unsure about which product is going to best suit their needs, and the salesman doesn't know because the end of the day he's just trying to sell the most expensive thing.
You'll have way more confused people who leave unsold, alright, so this is a single tactic that you can use to execute within your business which is why I'm a big fan of making offers people.
9:19
Cannot say no to is that you can focus all of your sales and all of your persuasion attempts on selling the one thing which is getting them to say yes.
Once they say yes we can we can reach the, we can accommodate their wealth, and their budget, based on the payment terms that we provide.
And if we have done our, we have structured, our offer properly, the offer in and of itself should already be very high gross margins.
9:39
Which means Whether or not the person pays a thousand dollars a month or a hundred dollars a month, it's still almost all margin for us because of how we structure the thing that we are selling.
And so we are able to capture higher higher ltvs by getting the people who have more money to prepay the thing up front.
9:57
That is how we do it.
And with those people, you'll be able to ascend into the second thing faster, because they've already prepaid that thing and then you can solve the next natural problem in another sales conversation.
Rather than trying to pick all of the things in one conversation, which makes it incredibly difficult to do.
10:15
This is just for everyone.
Again, a broad brush stroke of statements for most entrepreneurs who are not very good at operating their businesses or operations is not their strong suit and her below 3 million dollars a year.
Alright?
So anyways, mozi Nation, there's a lot of people were broke.
I don't want to be one of them, which is why I make these videos keep being awesome.
10:32
I love you and I'll see you guys next bit.
Bye.0:00
Most Nation real quick.
If you are a business owner that has a big old business and wants to get to a much bigger business, going to 50 $100.
Plus, we would love to talk to you and if you like that or would like to hear more about it, go to acquisition.com, you can play anywhere on the page and talk to one of our team and see if we can help you get there.

The idea that you might have heard of my Grant Cardone interview was rich people, sell wealthy people hold Welcome to the game where we talk about how to get more customers, how to make more per customer and how to keep them longer and the many failures and lessons, we have learned along the way.
I hope you enjoy and subscribe in today's video.
0:35
I want to talk to you about why the rich get richer.
And the real reason behind it is probably not what you think.
And this was a video that was requested by my Instagram.
Following added an ask me.
Anything in my YouTube producer was like hey man I think one of the biggest things that's shifted since I've been working with you is just like your car steps on time Horizon.
0:55
And so what I want to do is kind of share some of the thoughts and Frameworks that have worked well for me and apply them in three or four different kind of scenarios.
And so right off the bat, I think from a money perspective, the idea that you might have heard of my Grant Cardone interview, was rich people, sell wealthy people, hold and more specifically wealthy people buy and build.
1:17
And the difference is that when you sell you inherently shrink, or your kind of switching through an inefficient vehicle because you get taxed.
On a sale, right?
And so you have to switch your equity for another version of something, right?
That you can make money on.
Whereas when you buy and build, you can consistently expand.
1:34
And so, most of the people who I know who are wealthier, just continue to accumulate net worth Equity Etc rather than selling.
Now, like I said, I mean, the only time that you really want to sell is if you think the party is over or you no longer have interest in the thing and that's kind of a separate thing.
1:49
But purely from a financial perspective, it makes more sense to consistently buy and build.
And so, I wanted to hit a couple quick quotes before I dive in that have been meaningful for me in terms of framing this perspective, first off is in terms of games.
2:05
So I prefer to play games where if I wait, I win.
And so I think it's a useful perspective and thinking about what things we pursue and how we pursue them.
And so there are two types of games, there are infinite and finite games and the games that are worth playing in life, in my opinion, like health wealth relationships, marriage, Etc, are all infinite games.
2:24
And so, this is the Difference and where people get in trouble is when they start playing infinite games with a finite perspective.
And so finite games are games where you have known players agreed upon rules and outcomes where you have a clear winner and loser, right?
And so the point of the game and this is important of a finite game is to win and so if you have a baseball team, you have nine players on both sides, there's rules that are agreed upon.
2:45
And if, you know, at the end of the game, the person with the most runs wins, right?
And so that is a finite game, an infinite game is a game where you have known and unknown players.
No agreed upon rules.
And the point of the game is to keep the game going, all right?
Which means that the point is, to continue to play.
3:03
And so I think when a lot of people lose and this also applies to Warfare, right?
So a classic example Sonic's Simon sinek gave was how when the u.s. went to Vietnam.
We were applying a finite game where we were trying to win the war whereas the Vietnamese were simply trying to survive and continue to play and the infinite perspective will always beat out a finite perspective because A subset.
3:26
And so in general, and this is a third quote is he who has the longest time Horizon wins.
And so, the nice thing is that we can adopt this perspective in business and essentially, I don't want to say guarantee Victory but guarantee not losing which in many cases, by default becomes a win.
3:44
And so, I think that for myself adopting this perspective, I don't think I'm going to sell another company again.
Like like in terms of big picture.
I didn't start some of my earlier companies with the same perspectives of I have now.
And I think that that's part of like, leveling up in the game and so my hope is that I can share some of those perspectives with you so that you don't necessarily have to make the same mistakes.
4:06
And if you don't know who I am, my name is auction Mosey own acquisition.com.
Our portfolio of companies does about 85 million dollars a year and I have nothing to sell you.
And so, the first kind of place I want to apply this concept of the infinite versus the finite, is the strategy of business.
And so, I wrote down a couple points here that have been kind of That I've made that I think will be meaningful for you.
4:27
So the first is that the point of marketing, if you have a more infant perspective, is to get people to buy so that we can figure out how to make the product amazing.
Right.
If people aren't buying again and again or telling friends about us or our products then we will literally have to Market our way through brute force and expand again through brute force of selling, selling selling.
4:48
But the moment we stop that process, our business will tank.
And so if we have a infinite perspective of like the point of the The game is to keep the game going.
Then we are willing to trade off the short-term growth for ego and status in order to learn how to improve the products and services that we have such that, we get them to a point from a little bit of marketing and selling, so that we can make a sale to get a customer, rather than get making a customer to get a sale.
5:15
All right.
I'll say that, again, the point in the beginning, especially is to make a sale to get a customer, which is a long-term relationship of someone who buys again.
And again, rather than Getting a customer to make a sale, which would happen like one time, right?
And so, it's a flip in perspective, in terms of how we approach the game of business overall, and if we have an infinite perspective of like, we're going to keep playing this game over and over again, then we no longer have this rush.
5:41
And one of my other favorite sayings is mistakes.
Make a Russian mistakes, love a rushed decision.
And people make tons of mistakes in business purely, because they arbitrarily cut their time Horizon.
I have to hit this monthly goal.
I have to hit this weekly goal.
I have to this quarterly goal rather, than if I just Did this one thing right over the next year or two, then it would make it virtually impossible for me to fail or that this business would not grow because businesses, in general, continue to grow in both income and value over time with the exception of the times, where they don't and which saves, they usually drop to zero or close to it.
6:12
And so it's better to take the time to get it right and not be in a rush and then have all the wind behind you because you've taken that time.
And here's the beautiful thing, is that most people will never do this, which gives you this Strategic Advantage because most people think in finite terms and so I'll give you a different example from a marketing perspective.
6:32
So when you're selling a customer, right, the short-term finite thing is like, I need to get them to say yes, because I need this money right versus what am I saying?
Yes to by selling them, right?
It's just a different way to frame the conversation in terms of like, is this really what I want.
6:48
And then from an audience perspective in the short term, you see, lots of guys build tiny, little bits of audience and then immediately try and liquidate, you know?
Or monetize Their audience, rather than thinking, like what will happen if I just continue provide Goodwill for 10 years.
And one of the perspectives that I've learned about Goodwill is that one Goodwill compounds faster than revenue or money because you fundamentally fix the value equation in your favor because your price is zero.
7:14
And so everything that you deliver from a value perspective is above and beyond that.
Now, I would say there's no monetary price, but the price of content, or consumption of content is time and attention.
Oh, and so provided.
You are a better source of value for their time and attention.
7:29
They will continue to buy with their time and attention from you again.
And again, and that will actually compound faster, people recommend your stuff, people tell other people about you and then your influence will grow faster.
Now, if they feel like you're withdrawing from that Goodwill bucket, where you're depositing value too quickly, then their return goes down on their time and they'll be less likely to spend you become less viral from an audience building perspective.
7:53
And so, one of the, the pieces that I like about this perspective, is that it means that you give give give, give give give comma get.
And so it's a little bit different from what the way I kind of earlier understood it, which was, like always having a Cadence between giving it asking, which I think is a transactional way of saying it, which is not necessarily bad.
8:13
But in terms of a longer term perspective, I think you shortchange yourself because if you can, if you can assume, let's say that when you give give give ask You get let's say you know 10% of the people from your audience to buy something that's cool but then the growth kind of slows down right and you have to rebuild it again and then ask again, right?
8:34
Because you have withdrawn from your Goodwill bucket but imagine this let's say that your every time you give you grow by whatever 10%.
Right.
Give give give and ask versus give give give.
And now you're getting 10% on this bigger.
Nut, give give give.
8:49
And then my hand continues to grow beyond the screen.
And then say one percent of people just give you back, you just get you don't even have to ask you just get in response and like imagine what it looks like to be the rock, or what it looks like to be Conor McGregor or what it looks like to have massive amounts of influence at a certain point.
9:08
There so much influence in there, so much of an audience that is behind you that things just start getting thrown at you and you don't need to ask at all.
And so at least this has been our first directive that I've shifted in terms of like how to think about marketing overall, It's also, by the way, why?
9:23
I think most of the biggest brands out there brand, rather than doing direct response.
And I think that that's a shift that happens with a lot of direct response marketers over time, is we think short in the beginning, everything is direct response and then over time we continue to extend our time Horizon between giving and getting and the longer we can separate how long we give before we get the bigger, the advantage comes to us compared to our competition.
9:46
All right?
And so, that's just a couple of perspectives that I think about from a, from a A business perspective and strategy is like I want to set a strategy where if I wait I win and what happens is if you can extend your time Horizon you can decrease.
Your downside risk to virtually zero because you know that if you do this thing long enough, you will eventually win.
10:06
And so those are games that like you can never lose money from an investment perspective.
In terms of Shifting simply how you see your time which is also why Warren Buffett and Charlie Munger say you know, if you just thought I was only going to buy 20 companies for the rest of my life.
You would think about it differently and that's fundamentally the The big shift that happens, I think between the rich and the wealthy.
10:26
And so what I want to do is apply the same concept towards employees now.
So in the beginning, you know you think about I just need to have our put a butt in a seat, right?
I have this fire.
I need to put it out versus thinking a little bit longer time Horizon, which is man.
This is going to take a lot of time to train this person.
10:42
We have to onboard them and if I think that they're not going to be a long-term fit then they might leave.
Now, I don't want to take this out of context.
There are times in a business's growth where Going to have people who are better suited for That season, that's not necessarily what I'm saying.
10:57
It's much more so long.
The values that this person is going to bring and live through in the company is that going to reinforce our culture?
Or is it going to detract from it?
Will clockwise you guys already know that I don't run any ads on this and I don't sell anything.
11:13
And so the only ask that I can ever have you guys that you help me, spread the words we cannot more entrepreneurs, make more money, feed their families, make better products and have better.
Experiences for their employees and customers.
The only way we do that is if you can rate and review and share this podcast, so the single thing that I have to do is you can just leave review but they can 10 seconds or one type of the thump.
11:33
It means the absolute world to me.
And more importantly, it may change the world for someone else.
And so, this is kind of a long-term perspective is, I'm willing to wait a longer period of time in discomfort in order to interview 25 people rather than 5 to get the right person.
11:50
And this is one of the frames that's helped me with hiring Talent, which is I have to have this person.
And if I don't feel like I have that, that feeling with someone, I don't hire them anymore.
I used to say like I think this person is good enough like I think they could maybe do the job.
12:06
Whereas now it's like I've recognized that I'm like, If I don't know, I know and that's been very, very fruitful for me in terms of finding talent and and leveling up the people within the business.
And so this is a different one that I will share with you.
That has been just unbelievably valuable which is most business owners especially in that 325 million dollar range.
12:30
And if you're below that this would probably apply to you, is that the business that you have or all businesses in general are a subset of the amount of accumulated knowledge.
In the entire employee base.
And you being an owner operator, you're still an employee of the business, right?
And so, that means that everything that is done.
12:48
In the business is a subset of one brain.
If you know how to do everyone else's job better than them or you trained every person in the position that you have.
And if you're like shoot, that's me, that's okay.
There's a transition that ends up happening, which is what I'm sharing with you, all right?
So because you taught everyone and you know how to do everyone's job better, it actually still means that only one brain is responsible for all this growth, right?
13:09
And And at some point bending on the size of the brain and skill of the brain, you're going to get capped, right?
And this isn't an ego think it's more.
Like, you will eventually get capped remember long-term time Horizon.
And so if I know that, then I know that the only way to truly scale, the business is to have more brains contributing to the overall potential of the business, right?
13:27
And so, that means that I truly have to bring in people who are a smarter, than me, and be better than me at certain things.
Like, if you can, actually do everyone's job better than them.
You should be frightened, right?
And on some level people are like, well, if I don't know how to do the job, then it means that I am exposed.
13:44
And the answer is, yes, you are.
But every level of Entrepreneurship, is a new way of learning how to give up control, because you cannot have, you cannot want both freedom and control, think about it.
If you control everything, then it means everything requires you, which means you are not free.
14:02
Interesting, right?
And so if you want to have a business, that quote runs without you, then it means it does not need you, which means that it needs other people, which means that you have relinquished control of those people.
So, just a different thought in terms of like, how to frame employees and why it's so important to be more patient in the interviewing process think longer.
14:19
In terms of this is, do I want to continue to deal with this person with the next decade?
Rather than next day, right?
And and the business will always grow to the cumulative knowledge of everyone else in the business and if it's just you who knows how to do.
Everything then it's only limited by one brain.
Right?
14:35
And so the final shift I want to make here and in this little conversation is actually there's two more, one is relationships and this in the last one I'll do is Health but I don't talk about relationships briefly.
So if we're thinking about mates, right?
14:50
Like the actual, you know, people that we want to date, I think that would serve me well during the the dating period that I had.
And I see a lot of guys and girls make the mistake of settling with someone as good enough for now and the analogy that I like to bring this to is like you move into a new house and you're like, oh I got to get furniture, you know what?
15:12
Let's just go grab a, you know, a 50 dollar cash off, Craigslist, will put it in, put it in and we'll get a nice one later.
And then five years later, you still have the same Damn couch.
Right?
And so, a lot of times there are these couches which are people in our lives were like they're good enough for now and then you realize you've built your life with this person that you don't even, you never even thought, was that good to begin with, and you simply rationalize their existence as like, they're there for now.
15:32
When and, if they end up being there for a very long time, because it's much more difficult to remove something than it is to add it.
So we need to be usually much slower on the adding and much faster on the removal, which is the concept of, you know, higher fast.
Sorry, hire hire, slow Fire fast, right.
15:49
And so from a dating perspective, am I dating this person's out of convenience because I am unwilling to be lonely in the short term or because I think I'm going to marry them and I will tell you that it was very useful.
For me is that when I was in my dating you know phase of life, I went on a lot of first dates and I was just very quickly like am I going to marry this person?
16:09
But I think I could marry this person and I would really only go on as many dates as was necessary to rule out the person as no, I don't think I would marry them which also gives kind of birth to some of the ideas.
He has around like sleeping around and things like that which is like well, you know, if I don't think I'm gonna marry this person then, what am I gaining from this?
16:26
And is it fruitful for me, in the long term?
And so a lot of times we're making the same trades between for things and so I like this little illustration I made it a tweet that got a lot of shares and so fear is short-term pain.
Regret is long-term pain.
16:45
Comfort is short-term, game.
Fulfillment is long-term gain.
And so the idea is, we want to trade fear for fulfillment.
We want to trade the short-term pain, for the long-term gain rather than trading, you know, Comfort right to trading to get Comfort, right?
17:04
And so, as I think through that perspective and I think it applies to business that applies to relationships, it applies to a lot of things.
And I think, if you can make that simple shift, in terms of the relationships, you have with friends and and mates, it will serve you in the long run.
Like, how many friends do you have in your life that are like, they're they don't really add anything.
17:23
And what scares me is that if I extrapolate that relationship with the next 10 years, I ask myself.
Who am I going to be with this constant influence in my life?
Well, I'd be better or worse.
And so, a lot of times, I think, in order to prune the tree started, in order for the tree to grow, we have to print it.
Which means we have to cut off the branches.
And I think the longer I played the game, the less tolerant I become of The tract and are not really aligned with the long term and the more willing I am to suffer in the short term for the long-term game, right?
17:52
And so, the last thing that I want to quickly hit on, is his health because obviously, I was in the space for a long time and I get a lot of questions about it.
And so I think my perspective has shifted a lot over time around this because, well, I've done, I've done it for almost 20 years now.
18:11
But if you can't eat this way for a decade, there's no point in Doing it for a day.
And so, if you can just approach diets and work out with that same perspective like you will get the greatest returns from compounding and consistency over time.
And so, it's much more like what is the 5% that I can do every day that will that I can do forever and simply sticking to that if you have to cut out dessert, for example or if you you know like drinking whatever, I don't necessarily condone that.
18:39
But I'm just saying like if you're like I love this then cool.
Like if you're not going to do something forever, That's not going to.
Basically if you have to cut things out that make that make you enjoy life, then it's by definition, not a sustainable strategy for you.
18:55
And so there's no point in even starting it because you will set yourself up to fail, right?
And so an interesting perspective on this, that, you know, has developed over time for me, is that?
Like, if you work out, you know, 90 minutes, five days a week, you will end up giving up like Fifteen twenty percent of your actual living hours in terms of like waking hours are productive hours.
19:21
Probably a little less than that, actually, but you get the idea right.
If you're awake, 16 hours a day, then that would be whatever.
So, whatever, whatever the tenant 10% of your of your life, right?
Am I going to get a life extension of that same amount, not necessarily from that amount of time?
19:39
You might even just break even on it.
And so if you're doing it for life, extension men, there are better ways to do it, which would be walking.
And steps taking a baby aspirin and not smoking.
Like, if you do those three things, you'll get all of the benefits of life extension, but It's just a question of like, why am I doing this to be in with?
19:56
Is it?
Because I want to look a certain way which is fine and totally okay?
20:12
But Simply Having the perspective of I'm doing this. because I can do this forever and I think that it will allow you to cut out a lot of these short-term BS because like, think about this, and I used to use this in selling conversations when I was selling weight loss back in the day, which was If you look back on your life and you were in shape for six months three times in your entire life, who cares, right?
20:41
And so the goal is to have a strategy that will allow you to continue to do it for good and if the strategy in the short term is something that you can barely sustain, then there's really no point in doing it in the long term and I will also share something with you which is like the people who look the best.
20:57
If that is your goal like doing it and if you don't like doing it it's far better to just find something you do enjoy doing even if it's not ideal for body composition.
So it's like if you just like doing cardio cool it's not ideal for body composition but if you like doing it it's better than doing nothing right?
21:16
And that goes for any, you know, if you like climbing better than weightlifting.
Cool.
You know, I mean like keep doing that.
Can you do it forever?
Probably not but like you can do it for a very, very long season.
And so I think if you just reframe the perspective on all of these Things back to the original statements.
I have just like if I can't do it for a decade, there's really not a point of doing it for a day.
21:32
If I don't think I would see my purse.
This person in my life in a decade, there's really not a point of seeing them for a day.
And if I'm thinking about this from a business strategy perspective, Will I, if I do these actions, will it increase or expand me in a decade?
Or will it cut me down?
21:50
And so I think that if you can approach those things and that was the reason that the YouTube producer brought this up.
He's like, dude, the first thing you said was, all right, well, let's see if we can, you know, grow this thing over the next five or ten years he's like literally no one has ever said that and I find that interesting and silly because like it takes a long time to get good at something.
22:09
And so, why would I put such a short arbitrary timeline?
Of like, I have to grow in 90 days or I'm out, it's like, it's just not realistic and I'm, I'd rather play games where if I, wait, I win.
And so that was just a perspective shift for me that has served me very well.
22:24
I wanted to apply the new handful of scenarios for you to hopefully provide value.
And like I said, if you don't know, I am, I'm Josh Ramsey on acquisition.com and hopefully enjoy the next video.
Bye.








0:00
It was an Asian.
What's going on?
Continuing the VIP special edition behind-the-scenes fireside chat from grow with video, from people who paid lots of money to be in the room and answer their questions live and so you will have the second half and we're starting now.
0:16
Welcome to the game, where we talked about it, get more customers how to make more per customer and how to keep them longer in the many failures and lessons.
We have learned along the way.
I hope you enjoy and subscribe.
I know that you guys spent a lot of money on coaching and learning and I don't want to see masterminds necessarily but education furthering your education.
0:36
Constantly you talk about that about a lot on social media as well.
What's the best way to go about finding The right coaching the right mentors the right ways to continue your education.
I mean I'm just in stocks I'm sure Alex thinking it too which is just like there is no one Mentor or person or program like there you're going to have to do 10 20, 30 40 and so I actually think it's the fact that everyone has it is unrealistic expectation.
1:07
That one Mentor, one coach or one whatever is going to solve all their problems.
Perfect Solutions don't exist and so there's not one No one Silver Bullet, it's like 1,000 lead bullets to help you become the kind of person want to be a help you build the business that you want to have.
And so I think that putting all of the pressure on like some coach who you know, they are a human who is faulty as well to help you achieve what you want to achieve.
1:29
I think it's unrealistic and so I would just say erasing that and not even thinking how do I find the right coach, but it's what are the skills that I need to acquire right now?
And then probably putting together a group of people that can help me achieve them.
So much better when I can just take credit for everything.
1:52
The.
So I'll give you a quick hack and then and then I'll maybe rephrase the question.
So the quick hack is when I want to acquire a skill, I pay.
Whatever is required to get the skill.
And so I remember when I need to learn Facebook ads, and this is like 2013 and I didn't know how to do it, and I didn't want.
2:14
By course, I wanted someone to teach me how to run it for my specific business and so I reached out to a guy who had a course, he's like, why don't some of my time and I was like, America is like everyone sells or time I was like, just say a number internet.
Mean like you sell your time you made the time for the course anyways.
So he's like I mean it would have to be like $750 an hour I was like okay and so and I didn't have much money like I really like this is not like when I had a ton of money it was a lot to me.
2:40
And so every week he would show up for an our and he would try and run ads for my business and I would be like, don't click anything.
Tell me why your why you turn this off, or what you would do and why you're like, give me the thinking, process behind it.
2:56
And then by eight weeks, which was eight hours, I learned how to run Facebook ads.
And so it ended up costing me whatever. 750 times eight is so 5,600 bucks or whatever and it was such a better Roi for me than anything else.
And so I feel like we've done that a lot of times, which is like, how can I pay To get access to someone even if it's unreasonable because I believed that I would get enough leverage to have a personalized solution for me, and it was worth the 10 times the cost or 100 times compared to like a udemy course for that thing.
3:28
And so that's kind of like the hack from a larger perspective.
I think that a lot of people look for like, what Leila said the Silver Bullet when, I think it's much more of a directional question, which is do, I think that this will get me closer to my goal and what I'm currently doing it.
So I think if we think in those terms of it, Am I getting closer?
3:45
I'm getting further than this is kind of what I was alluding to earlier about.
Like you don't have the perspective from which to make the judgment on.
Is this person going to be the one that I'm missing, right?
Make the best bet you can.
And so if let's say you need to get here, you might give this way.
And then like this way, and this way, but as long as you're directionally funneling, towards that point, you are your vision your wisdom.
4:04
Your ability to perceive and make judgments will improve as you gain more insight from the education and experience that you're going through.
And so I I've said, This publicly, I think that everyone should invest as much of the money that they have available to them, after their living expenses into buying as much information and skills as possible until you until your income is is so overwhelming that you cannot spend it trying to get more information.
4:32
And that's because, like, skills with the ultimate hedge against inflation, like doesn't matter whether we're trading Bitcoin or seashells, like, if you are valuable, people will pay you.
Yeah, it's tough.
Kind of a little bit of a segue into your guys's relationship, your marriage.
4:50
You guys have a unique story where you kind of started off as business partners technically technically you started out on a date but it immediately turned into business partner relationship and then kind of turned into a marriage a literal proposition.
Yeah.
So walk me through like how do you prioritize your marriage now while being business partners?
5:12
That's an interesting question.
If you like take one step back a lot of people ask, how do you prioritize your marriage?
Because they assume that work and life are separate.
Sure.
And so, I know that's like the cheesy, whatever.
But we're we don't look at it like we're working together.
5:31
We look at it.
Like you're on this Mission with what we want to do with our lives together.
And so like doing this and being on meetings and then having like it's all one team.
Yeah, there's no separation and so it doesn't feel like there's a need to prioritize the marriage when the marriage is always the Cornerstone of all of it.
5:53
That makes sense.
Yeah, not everything is built upon the foundation that we have together in terms of like in our life.
Because that's what we wanted to build.
That's how we wanted to do things and so Doing it justice by doing what we do everyday.
Well is kind of prioritizing marriage because that's what we both said.
6:10
We want of our lives together, probably say something.
No.
No, I have a fundamental belief that there are no rules and I don't believe any single relational Dynamic is.
Sorry and he's relational Dynamic is unique in its own way like my relation with you is different than your relation with any other person in this room because when shooting people.
6:32
And so in that way A, I think every marriage is unique.
And so, one of the things that I do not, like, rather than talk about what I do, like about our marriage, one of things, I don't like that.
I see in the space, overall is a lot of people talking shoulds.
You should do this.
You shouldn't do this.
This is how it should be blah blah blah.
And Like, fuck that.
6:51
You don't.
I mean like this is, this is our marriage.
We do it, the way we wanted to.
And if someone is like that, fuck them.
They're not getting married to us, you know what I mean?
And so, and I remember when I was a mom, when I was I remember when when I was dating before Layla wish I only did it because Zoom all time.
7:15
I know and I was I am so and I ended up ending things with someone and I was like, you know, this is, you know, I'm just looking for more of something like this.
And I ended up being probably not socially adapt and telling her all the things that I was looking for that she was not Which one / swimmingly and she said something that was supposed to be an insult, but I didn't take it that way.
7:42
She said, well she was like, well, good luck finding that and I was like, well I only have to find one.
So like I was on this podcast and someone was like, I believe marriage is a compromise and I was like, I believe that's a belief.
So like I don't think like, I think you you want to make sure that and we've talked about this publicly, there's three things that in my opinion, create the dynamic for a successful marriage.
8:05
Number one is that you have a shared Mission which is what do we want to do with our lives?
Number two is, what are our values?
How do we want to get there?
So we may have really similar missions with with our lives but maybe the values in terms of like how we want to get there might be somewhat different, I think, Gary Vee and well.
8:22
Now that's a bad example, okay?
But you know, I love Carrie, that's not why, but he probably has a similar mission right in terms of what you want to do, impact on SportsCenter as we do.
But the values that he's going to do are unique to Gary and we have some slightly different values which makes it unique to us.
And then the third is I'll write or similar interests.
8:41
And so I think if you find someone who wants to do the shit that you want to do in terms of big shit.
Epic shit.
And then they want to get there the same way.
You want to get there.
And what you're doing in the in-between time is stuff that you both enjoy.
Then I think that it's tax, the chips in your favor to have what we would consider an easy marriage and again people are like marriage is hard.
9:02
Like I also forgot to believe.
Yeah, I would ask that.
I think a lot of it is just the studs, right?
Which is like When we first got married, I think it was actually the first couple years were harder because of a lot of the projections that we accepted from other people on to us which is oh well you guys work together.
9:18
You need to have one date and week.
You I mean they had some really interesting opinions on lots of things and you have to not talk about work, a date nights and you need to make time to do these things.
And you need friends that are like this and you need all this to make a successful marriage and you need to talk to each other this way.
9:34
And the more that I got away from believing any of that.
That and the more that I just accepted that our marriage is going to be whatever, we design it to be and whatever we like, and that we should be more people should listen to their, it's almost like listening to your intuition and do part carving your own path, rather than listening to the one that somebody else is trying to project onto you, the more that you can do that the happier we'll be and who gives a fuck what it looks like.
10:00
And so like, I don't know the last time that we like our anniversary was last week.
You know, we did on that day.
We on board to Caleb and had dinner with him.
And you know why we have an anniversary?
Airplane.
We were both.
Like let's do that though.
Like and there's no upset people, like you must be so secretly.
10:16
Know, like that is genuinely what we both want to do.
We're like we have so much time together and every day, I mean is amazing together and we tell each other that all the time we're like I'm so lucky to have you and so I think that you just can't judge yourself and also don't put judgment on others.
10:32
What their marriage looks like.
That's the one thing I would never judge somebody else's perish because they do date nights and they do want to do something special for the anniversary and they do want to have a big wedding.
That's great but I'm genuinely so So happy for them.
That's just not what we want to do.
Yeah, you can't answer it better than that.
10:49
So, all right, so I feel like that's kind of there's elements in there that were maybe like about time management, to some extent.
I know a lot of people in here, run multiple businesses and they may be also have families or whatever, but it could talk about time management particular with running multiple businesses because that was a question that we got a lot of as well.
11:11
I think if I were to like, zoom out a little bit and wonder how to think it's a thing which is just is very hard to be the CEO of multiple businesses, those rods gonna go.
Like it's, I mean, I've tried and it's, it's very hard.
So I just, I mean, I would first ask myself why?
11:30
Why do you need to be the CEO of multiple businesses?
I agree.
No, I mean, like, there's there's trade-offs, you know what I mean?
And so, I was talking to Kayla about this earlier but like, if there's a pair of shoes and their $500 and I want the shoes in a pay, the $500 and I have the shoes here like are you upset that you pay the $500?
11:53
I'm like, no, I want to shoes and some people look at a price tag on the things they want to achieve in life in the goals they have and they have a price tag attached to them and if you're willing to pay the price to get the thing, then why would I be upset?
Set about a trade-off I made the trade because I thought that the trade that I made was what I wanted.
12:12
Now you can reassess the trade that you make and think okay I need to course correct.
But like if you want to work 12 hours a day then fucking work 12 hours a day.
And I think there is where you need to find a spouse.
But you say, this is how I want to live my life, is that the kind of life you want to live?
12:30
And so I think a lot of people do this kind of like trying to meet in the middle thing and then both people are unhappy and I think it's much better to just be this is kind of like picking with companies.
It's like you only need to pick one I mean more.
So with us we get to pick more than one company but you only get to pick one spouse and so it's like you want to be the most unreasonable about all the things that you want to do and turn as many people away as humanly possible.
12:52
Because if you can imagine somebody who would accept you, exactly as you are.
And so, I think, one of the things that I love the most about Layla is that she has never tried to change me.
And that is only her, you know, I mean, like everyone else had like, you know, it'd be really great if you, you know, if you dress like an all of these types of little itty bitty things trying to make these little mini concessions, right?
13:15
And one of the things that she's said publicly, she's like, I never tried to change, Alex, it's like good luck, but at the same time, A lot of us make these concessions because we believe we should, or we have to, or to part of marriage or part of life.
And I just don't, I don't believe that.
And I think that if you want to live an exceptional life, then that means that you while we're live as an exception and if you want to live an uncommon life, you cannot have common views.
13:41
I think that when I think about like, the marriages that, I see where people laugh, like the longest lasting marriages, something I've observed is that they accelerate each other's growth and they amplify who the other person is.
They don't condemn it, they don't degrade it, they don't try to change it.
13:58
They amplify more of each other and they help the other person expand into more of who they are.
And, like, I know that I knew that it made sense with Alex, because when I met him, he only encouraged me to be a better version of myself and a bigger Of myself, which for a man to do that for a woman is not common nowadays and it wasn't what a lot of guys that I had dated done and so I think like when it comes back to like the time management thing I think a lot of the times it's unfortunate people people are constantly trying to fit the expectations of others and that is why their time is limited.
14:30
The trying to fit the expectations that their spouse has what life should look like.
But they have different expectations so it feels like a compromise and it feels like they have to manage their time.
Well, it's like maybe the expectations weren't set correctly.
In the first place for what this marriage should look like, or what I want life to look like.
And so it continues like this constant battle and so I think that if we could relinquish expectations and then neither I think almost in those situations right where you're in it and you're married and you know already there it's relinquishing expectations of the other person because I don't think it's fair to put expectations on the other just like you know Alex's I don't change them, it's really I don't put expectations on him.
15:07
Yeah.
It's almost like if you if you have shared Mission values and like been if you live in a way that other people might not agree with it doesn't matter because you both agree with each other.
And that's what they're not on the road with us.
15:24
They don't have to buy ticket.
Awesome.
So this is one of my favorite questions.
You guys speak non-stop in Frameworks and mental models.
And I believe personally, that that's a big reason for your guys, to success on social media.
15:43
Can you talk to me about Why that is where you find a lot of the Frameworks and mental models and I know that you're both Avid learners but like who are the people that you look up to most in that where do you like where you Gathering these from?
How much of them are your own Creations versus others?
15:59
Just like talk about that for a little bit?
I just learned from Alex, so I create mental models to organize the world because the world stresses me out.
And so I want to understand it better.
16:15
And I think Like I mean the mission like Meyer our personal missions, document, share the best practices building world-class companies and it's what I think about all day long.
The moment I got into business it was, it became my first love and everything else became second.
It's like, I draw pictures of business.
I write all my words are written about business.
I make videos about business, I talk on stage about business, I literally do business all day, so it's what I love.
16:34
And so, the Frameworks were an effort to seek to understand and in terms of understanding, it's trying to break down things into their foundational units and strip off.
What a lot of people put the lipstick in the makeup in the wrappers around.
Just so what does this mean?
And Socrates said that wisdom begins to the definition of terms and so a lot of times we use words that we don't understand and so if I were to say what is the lead on people like I need to get more leads.
16:58
I'm like what is that?
Like, you know, like a person.
I'm like, no, I don't understand.
Explain more is a subscriber and you too, Bolin didn't Instagram, follower Ali, what makes an Instagram follower lead to naughty, YouTube subscriber.
And so, we do ask these questions and I'm like, huh?
I don't know.
17:15
It's all of a sudden we start realizing that.
We use these words that we never begin to understand it.
So how can we try and put a goal?
And something we can't even Define.
And so, all of these were processes to try and understand how we are going to do things better.
And so, the, the things that I try and seek with a, I'm work is that there's really only two foundational eunuchs to make a framework when I would say, you know, good one, is that it is valid.
17:38
Meaning there's a high enough number of circumstances where it is correct where it will predict.
And number two, is that it is useful.
And so an example of something that is just valid, but not useful, would be.
If I said some things work and some things don't that is valid.
It is not useful, right?
17:54
And so, it's not a very good model and so on the flip side, a lot of marketers.
A lot of you guys in this room create Those were your like, here's the Seven Seas of awareness, right?
And these are all the things that Prospect is thinking before they buy first, they have to be agitated and then they have to seek, and then they have an information, you know, like they and what you're doing is you're projecting a thought process into someone that you have no idea what they're thinking about.
18:17
There's no way to measure that.
And so it's basically made up and so a lot of us teach a lot of people I would say in general, teach their audiences false models and so it really just confuses people because they use words that people don't understand.
They talk without defining the terms and then they say things that have no way to measure.
18:34
And so in that instance, if I was like, here are the seven seas of awareness or blah, blah blah, maybe it's useful because someone's going to follow these steps.
But I can show you an example of like, what if I just buy this thing with one click?
Oh, it's not valid done.
And so the idea is, how can I create a model that is both valid in as many circumstances?
18:52
He only possible and useful in all of the circumstances to create a result.
And so, like, for example, the book that I'm writing right now, it just suddenly, our leads I'm 58 different models. 50 different versions of the single model that is now going to be the central model of the book.
And so there was the value equation 100 million-dollar offers which took me a really long time to develop and like you know, not comparing the two want to be very clear but you know if you listen to Richard Fineman or Einstein, when we talk about formulas they say they're like their elegantly simple.
19:24
And so you know equals mc squared is a really simple equation, but it took all of this math to get Get down to this one thing.
And so I think that a lot of people just throw shit up on a board and say, oh, that's what it is, but they haven't thought, like, can I break this?
And so when I try and make models and I think the reason that they gain more Mass Appeal, is that people like that applies to my circumstance that applies to my circumstances whereas if someone can easily break it, then it just limits the utility of the model overall or the validity of the model depending on the thing that we broke.
19:53
And so, you know, in the leads, for example, it started with What is advertising, right?
We talked about advertising and what does that mean?
What's the difference between advertising and marketing with social marketing and promotion?
Hmm, right?
20:09
And so if we Define these terms, then we get really clear on what we're trying to solve and then we can actually begin to I think gain wisdom and that's because you know to end it with Socrates again wisdom Begins the definition of terms.
So I think if we Define what we're trying to accomplish, we Define the words that were using and then we try and break it in as many ways as possible.
20:27
And ask ourselves, is this, valid is this useful, then we can begin.
Make models that everyone else can use.
So I'll add some context to that just my observations, which is, you know, Alex, started building out models.
When we first start, Jim watch and so people here might be like, holy crap.
20:42
How do I build models like Alex?
Because when I first started making content, he was like, you should take all the stuff that you teach the team and have taught the teams internally and turn it into Frameworks and models.
Now, it's like I do that and I really would compare myself with one of my models.
Look like shit and yours are great.
He's like, I've been doing this since we started Jim launch.
20:59
And It was because, you know, he started practicing when he was every month, or in the beginning, every two weeks.
He would essentially teach a new framework to the gym owners, and that was where he, I give you.
If you go back and he watched, I think this is for everyone, because we compare ourselves, right to like your earliest YouTube videos, here, early as podcasts, right?
21:19
They listen to Alex and he watches content like that was when he was really first doing it, but you've been doing it for six, seven years now that he's been breaking things down to And so I think just to add, like context for people, this isn't science going to happen overnight, and it is hard to think through, and like, I'm lucky because I just get to be with him all day and like, assimilate it.
21:39
And so, it's become something that I've been really trying to put effort into in terms of teaching, people as well.
But I think just for like anyone who's Sous here right now, if you're thinking like, how do I simplify all that like make those Frameworks?
Because honestly, if you make good Frameworks like Alex, does like, I mean, he spent like want to say, like five days on your iPad in your office, like, really trying to make that frame of leads book and I was like, fuck you?
21:59
No, it's a lot of time really took five days.
Yeah, I really took five days, so just you can't compare yourself when he's put in that many hours.
Kind of going back to what you said when you were talking about people, just like, making up things that sound cool, like acronyms that aren't a real word, the whatever, what are, what is some incorrect advice that you hear regularly that you want to out for the benefit of everyone listening?
22:35
There's probably somebody, I just recently had this experience and if you are watching this, I know yours and if you are watching this I love you.
And I love you to death and you said the same is terrible.
Yeah and so we were at dinner and it's a couple that we're really good friends with well again yeah.
There you go.
22:54
And I know we were we were chatting and I was like, you know, I'm thinking about, you know, putting a you Discord Community together.
You know, as as talking about it means like because you can you should and he was saying it like a truth.
You have your you want someone like says, like, a quote stream certainty.
23:10
Right?
And I remember listening to that me, like, that's the stupidest thing I've ever heard.
I was like, what?
Shit?
Because I can hit Layla, I shared.
I was like cuz I can't drink Drive.
I should like, I was like, well, I just broke.
Take that model you don't know.
And so I think a lot of us like you hear these quotes that sound good, but they're totally borscht like Porsche and so like and this it gets more difficult because you have to audit your mind, you have to audit what you're consuming.
23:33
Because a lot of people take things as truth that are not and it's very hard and so that one of the shortcuts we do is just go to somebody who's maxed out a skill and listen to Warren Buffett investing because he's probably thought about this enough that we don't have to apply that filter because it's difficult and I think Grant Cardone said Don't listen to Millionaires and I think that there's, you know, some truth to that Is a lot of people like I got to do some shit to make money.
23:55
Now you're not going to make a tremendous amount of money, but you'll be able to like live really comfortable and probably be in the top 1% because most people just do nothing, you know, but you know, big picture in terms of other types of advice, that that is Affiliated.
I would just say most advice is wrong.
24:12
I think most vices wrong also because it's given out of contact with kind of like bring it back to earlier, like there's plenty of any one piece of advice, could be right or wrong depending on the person you're giving it to and depending on their preferences.
So it's like, you know, I'm very cognizant of like, you know, even with the companies that we have in the portfolio, if I'm giving them advice, I take into consideration.
24:31
Like what are their core values?
Because there was one company, for example, that, you know, they said, how are we going to increase volume on our sales team?
And we were looking at their sales availability, and we're like, oh well clearly we need to increase our sales availability and then we're like, we immediately both went into, like, here's what we did it.
Jim launch and then because it's a similar dish company and then I said, actually, you know, I don't think that would work at something because you Is really value something that I don't say which is work-life balance and so you don't have people work 10 to 12 hours a day.
24:58
I do that.
I do do that, right?
And that's one of our values for like people are like driving really hard and so I said, I actually think that we should do split shifts and maybe you could have someone do six hours here, six hours here, you stack them and they like, they'll be perfect.
And so I think it's, you know, it's just taking into consideration the goals of the person that you're giving advice to, I think most people, I think the quote is experts will tell you how they Did it where as a master will tell you how you should do it.
25:26
And I think that a lot of the times you have people are experts, telling people do the steps 1 through 10 that I did, right?
And I hear that a lot and I think that people should take everything with a grain of salt.
I hope people take everything I say with a grain of salt.
Everything else is with grapes, all everything.
25:41
They hear, hear it with a grain of salt because it's just different based on your situation.
Hey guys, real quick.
If you're new to the podcast, I have a book on Amazon called 100 million-dollar offers that over eight thousand, five star reviews.
It has almost a perfect score, you can get it.
Or 99 cents on Kindle.
25:57
The reason I bring it up is that I put over a thousand hours in the writing that book and it's my biggest gift to our community.
So it's my very Shameless way of trying to get you to like me more and ultimately make more dollars to that later on in your business career I can push the partner with you so that's my give.
Go check it out Amazon, and back to the show.
26:16
So given that context, how do you create content?
And how do you, how do you teach in a one-to-many?
Format like writing a book or posting on social media?
Knowing that it's I think that there's one factor which like if you listen a long for media especially like I've tried to be very intentional with this in like long form content which is I say if you are in this specific situation and then I'll say here's some exceptions to this like I just made Made a presentation about meetings which kill me, I'm sure it's going to blow because nobody wants to talk to you about meeting, but I love talking about it.
26:52
So, basically in that I'm saying, you know, like they're totally exceptions to this, 95% of people is applies to you.
There are five percent that you will absolutely fucking crush.
It never having a meeting.
And so I think it's just important always in context because if you don't give context to say, like there are exceptions what I'm about to say, then you kind of sound like arrogant or egotistical it's like oh this is the end all be all and I think we've Learn that through Jim launch takes, we've had times where we've given advice and then we didn't add Nuance to it.
27:21
We didn't say, hey, it's for these five situations.
And if you're in these three situations, don't include yourself and people have made the wrong decisions for their business.
Yeah, I was gonna say one thing that drives me, you know, nuts in general, is, you know, talk somebody or someone being me and be like, hey, my business coach said that, like, I should always be in charge of the sales team until we're over a million dollars a month and I was like, well want me to give you examples of companies That that's not true.
27:47
You know what I mean?
And so it's the have-to's and the shirts and the must that always that those are the things that drive me just bananas.
And so I think a lot of times if you can just take everything is this might work or this might have a higher probability of getting X outcome for people who are in the circumstance who want this thing, which you know, it's really nice to talk in the masses in generalities are generalizations because everyone just wants to not think, but if you want to crush it, it then you need to do the thinking and most people don't would because thinking is hard, I think something on top of that is just like a tactical piece is actually a piece of advice that Caleb gave me, which was the answer the questions in the comments that are asking like, what about this situation?
28:32
I think that's powerful because then you can showcase that and you can even create another piece of content off that comment where you answer that question about that Nuance piece to your content.
So when you guys were talking earlier about skills that you're trying to home, one of those kind of related to what we're just talking about is to sermon wisdom.
28:52
Obviously experience is time, can help contribute to that.
How do you fast-track that?
I know the humor in that but like like what you see are focused on honing it, there must be like, is it just an awareness that you have towards that being an objective?
29:13
I think there are like I think there are certain feelings that I start to get in my gut when I know that I'm doing an old pattern.
I'm like, hold me really wants to do this, and old me, did do this.
And so it's just having that extra pause of thinking.
Like am I making this decision?
29:28
Because I want to make the decision or Because I think it's the right decision.
Let me ask you this for the audience.
Have you guys ever had this thing really cool?
I want to do that and you're like I know I shouldn't ever had that feeling it's listening to the other boys and I think it's just over and over and over again flexing that muscle and then being aware enough to reward yourself when that second voice was right.
29:53
And I'm grateful because Layla, and I kind of sit in the yin and yang in the business and so and we almost purposefully Express more polar characteristics within the business because those are the roles that we sit in.
And so I, I was on a call today with a company that we're thinking about onboarding, and I asked all the questions I had, and then I thought, Leaving my Laila had on and ask all the Layla questions.
30:17
I don't know.
She would be asking right now and so I think like we have this ability to think and I've used this before.
But like, for me, I talked to my 85 year old self a lot, which is creepy.
But I imagine myself at 85 and I feel like I'm a pretty accurate description of my head of like, what I will think at that point and I ask that person questions.
30:37
And first off that guy just makes fun of me all the time just asshole, but because most I was like it.
Doesn't matter player.
Thanks useless, but I know that that person has my best intention long-term in in hand more than any other person on planet Earth.
30:55
And so I ask that person questions about what I should do in the present and a lot of times, they get a much more even Keel answer of like, I think this is what you should do.
And I think it's listening more to that person than the person that I am today.
Yeah.
So, Another one that you had mentioned was patients, which for anybody, that's an entrepreneur, that's probably one of the most difficult character traits to develop right?
31:26
Especially in a world with so much opportunity.
There's so much going on every new speaker that comes up tells you something else that you should be done, right?
So how do you cultivate patience?
I'm probably not the best one to answer the question because honestly, every time I see somebody, Else zigzag and I see somebody else jump to the next new thing and I see somebody else go from 0 to 3 and 0 to 3 and 0 to 3 but never take it 0 to 10.
31:54
I'm just saying they're being patient and like knowing that I'm like, sitting in my suffering and I'm like fucking winning like that's what I think every time and so I think I've trained myself to think like the more patient I can be I just know how hard it is.
You patient how hard it is to wait and how hard it is to delay gratification and so I To be a strategic advantage.
32:16
And so, it sounds terrible.
But like, I just look at all the people of with so much High activity and so much lack of patience so much like constantly like taking the Goodwill out of Their audience and immediate gratification selling like cheap tacky shit.
And I see that I'm like you're losing because you're constantly just like cashing in the short term and you're never going to get that long-term you never going to hit the long term goal you want.
32:42
And so I think it's if you can kind of in green that into your and set.
You changed your perspective on it, right?
And I think that if you want to change, if you want to achieve a goal, you have to change either your perspective or your procedure, right?
So it's how you do things and how you see things I tend to start with how I see things.
32:59
And so I see it as weakness, and I see it as something that I feel it is deter you from your long-term goal and you're almost putting off your long-term success because of your lack of patience.
And so the more I trained myself to think that way and see that way.
I think the more patient I become and the I feel it's become a strategic Advantage because I do see that most of those people when they're doing those things.
33:22
And I've never getting the gold that they really really want because they have these compulsions or these urges that he like can't resist in the short-term, right?
Would you can't resist, it's just you're telling yourself, you can try.
It's just a habit.
You have to break.
And so, I think for me, it's Shifting the perspective and then Alex probably talk more about procedure.
33:40
I was just a people mistake activity for progress and so if you were to think, you know, I I could have just put a hundred thousand dollars in Bitcoin for example 10 years ago and that would be it write one single just just as an extreme example right?
33:56
And then nothing else would literally nothing else.
I would have done from networks a would matter right?
And it doesn't feel fair but it's also reality.
And so 99% of the decisions that we make are relevant for the ultimate outcome that we're looking at.
And I think it's really trying to figure out where do I have the most leverage?
34:12
And then being very patient on pulling that that one lever, that one Big move.
And most of the people that I see that are very far in life have very low activity, but when they do take an action, they go all in or they make a very significant bet on that on that action because they know that they have limited bandwidth.
34:32
And so they know that in order for that actually to be successful and to yield them, the result are looking for.
They have to be very strategic with how they place the BET, right?
So they put way more of their time in the thinking about the BET, and so they can replace the activity with the thought process.
So, rather than me, Frenetic thinking, you know, it's the sharpening the axe analogy, but most people don't actually do that and so I think that that that fundamental shift because wealth is a is a relationship with time and so people who have tremendous wealth have a Mastery of time because money is a transactional unit with time, you can trade your time for money, you can take money for time, right?
35:11
And so, on a micro level.
They know how to manage their day-to-day time and then a macro level, they base, their long-term conclusion on assumptions that are very probable and so I'll give you an example, you know, with acquisition.com.
35:27
So I was.com is built on, you know, 45 foundational assumptions.
Assumption one.
Is that Leyland?
I will be more popular in the future than we are today.
Number two is that we can grow businesses in the range that we are looking for in that period of time.
35:45
Number three is that the marketplace for the businesses that we were serving grows and does not shrink for some reason like e-learning doesn't disappear overnight or service.
Businesses, don't magically disappear could happen.
There's go to your nose, right?
And so if if those things are true, and the fourth one would be that us building a personal brand would Pond with companies that are the type that we want to work with it would translate into that.
36:11
And so those four assumptions are true.
Then it's simply a matter of time before we get to a billion.
And so I had a, I'll give you, this is like a real world example, a very close friend of mine is a genius product, developer best product I've ever met.
And he said, I really think you should turn acquisition.com into a forum and you'd have tons and tons of SEO and that would build tons of traffic.
36:33
And you're already a huge domain Authority because I we've got Tons of great length and all that stuff, and it would just totally blew up your traffic.
And it really took me a long time.
To think it was gonna be a big Endeavor as it was going to really turn into a software form rather than use Discord use the site to do that.
And so I thought about it for like two weeks like really felt like really it was almost all I talked about for like two weeks and then I ended up saying, no, I'm not going to do it.
36:57
And the reason for that was because Four sections that, I based us getting to a billion on are true or I believe them to be true.
And I cannot do this and still get there.
And so I think if we write down what are the assumptions were basing this decision on and and if they if they are true, do I believe that the high likelihood of them being true?
37:18
And then all I have to do is add the one recipe, the one ingredient that no one else wants to add, which is time, then we can be patient because we're very dedicated to the high probability bet but it just it's difficult because Every day new opportunities come up.
And I tell the story about the woman in the red dress, in the Matrix.
Because the thing is, is that, you know, everybody here knows how to tell if you're making a hundred thousand dollars a year.
37:37
You know how to turn down a 10,000 dollar opportunity.
It's really hard to turn down another 100,000 opportunity.
And so the thing is that as you level up the woman in the red dress becomes more and more attractive because when you're a ten million dollar entrepreneur you get 10 million opportunities.
When you're 100, my dog entrepreneur.
37:53
You get 100 ml opportunity so you are ability to turn things down, also has to level up because you got used to saying no.
A 10K things but not 100K things and so that is a wall that entrepreneurs will continue to hit they level up their business.
Then all of a sudden they get distracted again because they don't know how to say no to this girl as shiny object.
38:10
And so, I see those as like the real world translations of What patients means in action.
So, I just want to thank you guys for coming.
I have one more question for you, which is about personal branding.
Obviously, you guys really step into personal branding and the last year and like, 02, you know, all that it is now.
38:35
And so walk me through the that decision process because obviously, you guys don't make decisions easily, you don't take them lightly.
And you're very principled and how you go about making your decisions.
And so, obviously, this was a very big, very big deal.
38:53
I know that you spoke with grants and you've invested a lot of time and energy and resources and understanding how to build your brand more.
And so just kind of walk me through what that process was like.
And what some of just, some of the biggest things you've learned throughout that process.
So it's all Kylie Jenner become a billionaire at age, 20.
39:12
And I felt like I sucked and I was literally, Depressed for like a day and I was like what why do I suck so much?
And they say comparison thief of Joy.
It's also the fuel for greatness, I agree but I saw that and as a quick I'm just going to do a quick tangent and then I think I'll give a good answer but when we were talking earlier about patience If you thought a personal brand, if you could wait five years and just did nothing but build the personal brand would then, yield you an audience that would make you a millionaire or deck a millionaire since millionaire.
39:47
Would you do it?
Most people would say yes but their actions don't match that and it's because it's just too easy to.
Also do something else and so they just attract himself, not go rather than saying if this is something is true.
If I were if do I believe is a high probability, that would be unreasonable.
If I did these activities for five straight years.
40:05
That I would not achieve X, it would be unreasonable that if I did this level of activity, this level of volume, because I have all these, this evidence that supports that this level of activity, in this little volume with this level of skill would yield this result.
If I did this for five years, I could achieve far more than everybody else.
Who's gonna be switching back and forth and having short-term Pops that are ahead of me but long-term slow.
40:24
And so, I think that, if we can, if we make decisions like that, it makes patients a little easier.
Circling back to why we did the personal brand.
So, Kylie was a big influence.
Conor McGregor is a big influence.
The Rock was a big influence.
40:39
I saw these people building, shoot friends and then overnight have a billion dollar company and you know, for me, I think, okay, if someone is making more money than me than their better, that better at business than I am in some way and I need to learn what it is and the common theme for them was that they just build a massive media channel that had it's free, you know?
40:57
I mean, it was just free, it's insane to me.
Ben what I really think about it.
Still like we get paid to build a company right now which isn't I still it's insane.
The equivalent of two million dollars and had spent right right now we get it still continued to grow since like 80 million impressions of months, at $25, a CPM.
41:13
Which we pay twice that when we, you know, we're running ads like two million dollars a month for free and then we get paid by the platforms for doing it, which is like again ludicrous.
And so I had all that but I still do want to be famous.
I talked to Dean gracioso, you said, if the price that I have to pay to make the impact that I want to have is Is Fame and these downsides.
41:31
He said I'd pay that price every day that really hit me so like shit.
Okay.
And then I didn't know that work B2B and I found about no mid-cap listen I found about Neil Patel and if they had built these brands that drove B2B stuff and so that kind of checked off all the boxes for me was like okay You really want to do this because our life's going to change a lot because, you know, we went from pretty much being unrecognized, which I really wanted to be rich an anonymous and that was, you know, that was the goal and we achieve that and it was a conscious decision because it's one thing that you can't go back from like once you become famous enough or whatever, you can't go back, like people don't forget you and so it wasn't, it's an irreversible decision and so we did think about it a lot.
42:13
And then we started Yep, we want to do it because the impact that we want to have at the end of the day is like we want to document each other best practices building world-class companies and I wish that Bezos had made a vlog from 1997 until today, documenting everything that he had done.
And so I thought like would it be cool?
42:29
Wouldn't it be a fun life to go for something like that and document the whole thing?
And so that's kind of like the big epic chick epic shit, that Layla?
And I were like, that's a mission.
We can both Get Behind These are the values that we can use to get there.
And this is the lifestyle that we want to live along the way.
Uncle as we were growing the businesses.
42:46
There was just a really big gap in the kind of content that we wished had been there.
And so for myself like as we were growing dommage, we were actually exiting it.
I kept thinking myself like that.
I have put together so many things for our internal teams.
And what I realize is that if we want to build acquisition not commonly want to actually really have an impact.
43:06
I wanted to balance out and I want to make content what I did.
Because Alex always say, you know, I would say, well, I don't understand this stuff's important.
He's like Hey, look.
You don't make any fucking content on that shit.
Like how would they know?
They only consume my stuff.
And so I think for me, I actually and maybe speaking to people that aren't necessarily as much on the marketing and sales side.
43:25
Maybe the other sides of business, which are probably far and few between at this conference, Heather.
You know?
I think I just see that there's a gap in terms of understanding other pieces of the business that maybe aren't a sexy and they're very important in terms of how you can scale the business.
43:43
And continue to grow it.
And so for me, I personally wanted to put content out there because I wish I had had that when we were going to lunch and just going back to Alex at the end, I think it's you get to a point where you say, what's the kind of impact I want to have at the end of my life and what do I need to do now to get there and the people that I look up to the most put things out there because they think the world should have it and they think it should exist.
44:10
And so I know for myself and for Alex to a lot of is like we're making things that we wish that we had had and that we think should be out there in the world.
And I know that some of the stuff I make is not going to hit and it's not going to be massive, but like I'm Make it for myself and for the 20 or 30,000 people that see it and it like completely changes the game for them.
44:30
And so I think that there has to be an element of it that is important to you outside of the business or the money because I think that he would feel very empty if there wasn't somebody sounds.
Yeah.
Awesome.
Thank you so much guys.
Everybody give it up for Alex and Layla or Mosey.0:00
What's going on?
Was a nation.
I'm super pumped for the pockets.
You guys are about to listen to.
This is one of my favorite talks.
If not my favorite talk that I was, I was able to give this year.
I was fortunate to give at grow with you live.
This was my keynote.
I made a very custom presentation for this and it centers around content and brand which is something that I really love a lot.
0:20
And if you guys are enjoying the stuff that you've seen across all the platforms, it actually breaks down, every tactic that we have done to grow over a million person active audience within six months, And so it's everything we do from, like, how we structure tweets to how we make videos.
And really the heart of the message, you'll hear the second half, which is what I really think is the heart and soul of how you build the brand.
0:42
And I think this is the big, and the biggest mistakes that I think most people, especially the aspiring entrepreneurs, the people were starting their businesses, the people who are, you know, just getting going here making content, and not getting it to hit what they are missing.
And I just, I can't wait for you guys to listen to it.
This is part one of the two-part series buckle up and enjoy.
1:00
Oi.
Welcome to the game where we talk about how to get more customers, how to make more per customer and how to keep them longer in the many failures and lessons.
We have learned along the way.
I hope you enjoy and subscribe.
So I was telling Sean backstage, I said, my promise to you is that this will be the worst presentation you have ever heard the best presentation ever heard or somewhere in between, so that is my promise for you guys today.
1:22
So, let's kick some butt cool.
So Bret and Shawn asked me to talk about a topic that is not my expertise.
I'm being super real.
I'm mostly, no not for this stuff.
So we're going to be in for a ride together, so I'll just kind of share with you some of the things that I've learned over the last six months.
1:40
So How I built a million-plus organic following in the last six months.
Good news is, if you can do it like this, anybody can do it.
All right, so just transparency on this.
Like I built all my companies off paid ads, Affiliates cold outbound teams or referrals and that is usually what I'm asked to speak about.
1:59
I have never built an organic brand, this is my first time.
So I just like to get those disclaimers out ahead of time.
And so what I have to share may not work for everyone or in fact, To be true at all but it worked for me this time so that's what I'm going to share.
2:15
Okay, so just take everything with a gigantic grain of salt that I say all right because a lot of you guys are probably better at this stuff than I am.
So that's probably you guys here.
There's me on the side.
Watching you guys be much better than me at video and so without further Ado 1 million fans six months in 60 minutes or less.
2:36
So this morning I don't know if you guys do this but like morning of I We do so cold, I redo everything again because my God, this is shit.
I have to redo it all and so I broke it into three sections to make more sense.
So, Section 1 is, why did I do this to begin with?
2:53
And why you might think it's a good idea to, to what and how and how much like what do we do to actually create that?
And then third is observations because I had no other better heading for it than that.
That's what it is.
Okay, so let's rock and roll so quick back story.
3:10
I'm going to go through As fast as possible.
This is me when I start my business career sleep on the floor.
I signed my first lease something that floor for the first nine months, was able to get it to that picture on the left in a year.
Then I open a new location every six months after that, and then over the next 18 months.
3:27
I met Layla.
And we did Jim turn around.
So we basically fly from place to place to place, and fill, Jim's up.
And there was a Hands-On sales model.
I had at our Peak 8 sales guy, turn around eight gems every month that became tenuous It's Logistics Ali and we're like I wonder if there's a better way and so from there we package Drive key for a better Jim model into a licensing business.
3:48
And so we were able to grow Jim watch which is a B2B business to two and a half million bucks.
A month.
Prestigious 21.7 a month, which is B to B to C.
That was an affiliate based business and it was weight loss and supplements.
So you Commerce and we skilled Ellen to 1.6 million a month which was B to B to C.
And we just recently sold that for forty six point two.
4:06
And we just sold that one last year as well, which I'm not allowed to say the number, but there you go. and then we started acquisition.com which right now is about 13 million a month which is cool and I appreciate it so that sounded weird.
4:25
So, right now we grow three million dollar-plus internet, businesses, and 230 million dollar-plus sellable.
Businesses, that's kind of what we do now.
And so hopefully you're probably asking this question just like, what does this have to do with growing video are growing with video Jack Shit?
But I started making video content with three goals.
4:45
So number one was to attract internet business owners doing three million dollars or more, who aligned with our values.
Number two is to help all businesses below.
Our minimum deal size to just grow to the deal sighs that was kind of the idea like how do I just get everybody's at a million to 3 million or 100 K to 3 million?
5:02
Whatever you get everybody up above that level so we can hopefully work with them and then three to create a place where I could document you're the best.
Practices of build a world-class companies from my experience.
And like we're not the Elon musk's and the basis is and and all that, but I wish that those guys had documented what they had done like how cool would it have been to see like the Vlog of Amazon in 1996 right now, stick with that event and like, every day is like, yep, almost lost the company today.
5:30
Like, six months later almost lost the company.
Again, I thought that would have been awesome so I thought you know, Didn't.
I did a really poor job of documenting everything up to this point.
And so I was really committed to like all right for this next phase.
5:46
I really want to do a better job of it, so that's the idea.
All right.
Whoops.
And ironically when we started doing that lo and behold business is doing through million dollars, more started, reaching out to us, which was awesome.
Right success.
So I guess this might have something to do with video but believe me when I say that known as surprised as me about this kind of organic stuff in general because I've never I've done it before.
6:09
So we're on this ride together.
Alright, so here's the goal of the presentation, give you a few lessons that I've learned to take you, from wherever you are.
Do a little closer to where we want to go with this presentation.
I'm so good at concept.
There's the little man.
Okay, great.
So disclaimer again, never done this.
6:25
I also didn't want to be famous or known for very long time.
There's me saying I want to be rich and famous but several experience has changed my mind.
So I'll walk you through this really quickly.
So when Kylie you remember this one Kylie was announced that she was a billionaire.
Well, that's what I felt like that day, like what am I doing wrong and then the rock, you know, killing it and then boom.
6:49
He's got a two billion dollar plus tequila brand that he was able to launch off his organic audience.
Conor McGregor 600 million.
With proper 12 has probably grown by since now.
Huda now is a billion dollar brand.
And so I can be a little slow sometimes, but I can kind of read the writing on the wall.
7:08
So there's the writing on the wall.
But I didn't want to build an e-commerce brings all those re Commerce physical products Brands and I was like, that's not my body.
I've already did that.
Once it's not like it's not my favorite of the businesses that we've done.
So I still kind of like drag my feet a little bit and that's what I heard.
This guy no made capitalist.
7:24
You like teaches people to not be US citizens, that's not the point.
But so you can not pay taxes.
But anyways that's what I heard a podcast with this guy and he was like oh yeah I got about 3,000 applications month.
I was like holy cannoli.
I was like well I had 3,000 applications month.
7:41
I would I'd make it least $1 if that were my life and so I realized it could work for you to be not just e-commerce stuff like that's neat and then I heard Neil Patel was doing 100 million bucks a year doing a B2B agency Services.
All off inbound.
I was like okay this might make sense and so again I still was like all right so does work for B2B organic stuff works but I still didn't really want to be famous that was not my vibe and so I met up with your friends of ours Lisa indiangrass COC.
8:09
And we had a conversation that was kind of the last straw here.
So I was like, dude being famous, sounds terrible.
He was just telling us about like somebody, like shut up his house and threaten his kids, and I was like, that sounds fucking awful like, why?
No, no, thank you.
I'm good.
I'll just pass on grass and so he's like, if getting harassed and attacked at the price, I have to pay for the, it would say it's supposed to say impact.
8:36
That was perfect for the impact that I want to have the night pay that price every time which totally takes away from the impact of that message.
But I was like, shit, he's right, you know what I mean?
Like you said, if that's the price, I have to pay to make the impact, I want to have, and I pay that price every time I'd like fuck.
8:56
All right, I need to, I need to stop being a bitch.
All right, so a team Months ago, I started a YouTube channel.
Some of you guys may, see anybody seen this YouTube channel.
Those the nation.
And so I built to expensive Studios to launch.
9:13
This thing, I started making three videos a week.
Sidenote important lesson that I learned on a vacation that really shitty one did better than my really fancy one which then taught me that what's inside the content matters more than the rapper.
So for anybody who's like worried about getting started about making look right.
9:31
I don't think it matters.
I mean I think it matters a little bit but it's 80/20 so focus on the 80.
All right.
And so I continued my very steady growth for, for that period of time.
Just great recommend.
9:48
But you know, the first 12 months we went from 600 to 70,000.
Subscribers was cool.
And so things were going smoothly until one day.
I had a chat with Grant Cardone about branding and it reminded me that all the lessons that I learned in business applied to all this organic stuff.
And so I was on this call with him and I have the full video on my YouTube channel if you want to check it out.
10:08
Yeah, he was like, bra.
I'm not going to try.
He was like, brought bull of your Instagram.
I was like, okay, like pull up my Instagram.
He's like, I got 10 times.
The content is you 10 times is eyebrow.
10:23
Its volume bro, volume.
And I was like, that's deep.
And so I was like, you know, I should probably do more which is a lesson that I have learned over and over and over again in business.
10:39
And I'll tell you one more story about later, but like so many times, we're doing the right stuff.
We're just doing way way too little of it.
Like I'll tell you a quick story, which is not on this presentation, but when I started my first gym, I was told that I should put fliers out and so I went, you know, I'm like really you know, full of piss and vinegar.
10:57
So I'm going to go do it.
So the business owner told me it was more successful, me etcetera.
And so I went I put the As out and then like nothing really happened.
So I met back up with him a few weeks later and he was like, hey, how the Flyers work and I was like, you know, I got one guy who called me and said I fucked up his car.
11:15
That was it.
He's like what was your test eyes?
It was like, I was like, why?
Me too?
I put 300 out.
He's like There are tests size 5000.
He's like, that's what we test with is like, and then we do 5,000 a day.
11:32
Oh, Noted.
And so it was just a really good lesson and that happens with phone calls.
Like, yeah, I'm doing, I'm gonna, I'm gonna start doing cold calls, you make 10 calls every three days.
When you're feeling motivated, rather than 200 miles every day, like, it's Clockwork before lunch, you know, I mean, the level of effort difference is not like 2X or 4X.
11:54
It's like 50 x.
It's a lot bigger, and most people dramatically underestimate the amount of volume and effort that is required to get to where you want to go like dramatically.
And so those are so Lessons that this repeated and I was taught yet again in a different sphere that I'm not familiar with that.
12:11
This was true.
I'm also wearing the same shirt.
So I decided to take his advice and dramatically increase the amount of content we created and how many places we displayed it, right?
And so before I tell you, who wants to guess, how many pieces of content, we started putting out weekly after that call 25 10,000 less than that.
12:31
I would be so much more famous if I put 10,000.
Now, what was that?
David good, guess.
Look wise you guys already know that.
I don't run any ads on this and I don't sell anything.
And so the only ask that I can ever have you guys that you help me, spread the words we cannot more entrepreneurs, make more money, feed their families, make better products and have better experiences for their employees and customers.
12:53
The only way we do that is if you can rate and review and share this podcast, so the single thing that I have to do is you can just leave review but they can 10 seconds or one type of the thump.
It means the absolute world to me and more importantly, it may change To the world for someone else.
So we went from seven pieces of content, we got it three on YouTube and I just repurpose the same three on a podcast to 8080 content pieces a week.
13:17
And for scale, if you remember the first line that I showed you a before, the top of that is that purple line from the first graph I showed you.
And so, this is what happened in the six months.
We added 300,000 subscribers on YouTube, 7,000 followers on Instagram, still have really cracked that one 350,000 on Tick-Tock, 150,000 buyers.
13:38
It's on Amazon for the book. 350 thousand followers on Instagram, 100,000 on Twitter and 400,000 downloads a month on the podcast, cool, right?
So basically, a million-person audience within that six months and because I'm more a business guy than I am influencer Creator.
13:59
This is what I care about.
So, the next traffic result for us is web traffic went from basically non-existent to about 100,000 unique clicks a month to the site.
Just Organically pretty cool.
Number two is, the subscribers are tell you before and then this is one, that's really cool for who here runs paid ads and I get a, okay, some of your cool.
14:17
So this this will resonate with you.
So, in the businesses that I had at a twenty five dollar CPM, we were getting two million dollars a month in exposure for free.
Not only not free.
We're getting paid to do it.
Shit's crazy.
Like I'm I'm beside myself still, cause I think it's insane.
14:33
So, the fact that this opportunity exists right now is literal Insanity to me like we're getting paid I paid now to mark it.
Like what a world right?
And so the business result from that is that we get about 400 companies a month that apply for acquisition.com so we can help them scale.
14:50
And in that time period We Grew From 7 million a month to 13 million a month.
And disclaimer on that.
Is that part of?
That was just the, the companies themselves grow wasn't like new companies, but still a lot in six months.
And so, if you're anything like me, you're probably thinking, well, that's really great for you, Alex.
15:06
But what about me?
Which is how and how much?
All right?
So here's where you come in, all right?
Start with how much.
So just a reminder here in terms of time I'm not like a Creator full time so it's like 93 7 is probably the amount of time that allocates words this and so money-wise.
This cost me twenty thousand dollars a month to do.
15:23
All right.
You can scale this down, however, you want.
I also don't have a tremendous amount of time that I allocate towards it.
So, I have to compensate with that with money.
You could probably do this on your own.
I just, I, this is how I do it.
So, we have a Twitter editor, a YouTube editor, a LinkedIn, editor podcast, editor and an IG, and Tick-Tock editor.
15:38
All right, and there's two of us.
So times 2, so it's actually 40 thousand a month for the both of us.
Okay.
The amount of time that it takes me is two days per month and four hours per week.
And that is that is what I dedicate towards this.
And so quick recap, I have a daily mind dump, which I'll show you how I do it in a second because we're going to show you, I'm going to show you the whole model.
16:00
I do a weekly.
Twitter of you took me like four hours because Twitter is actually really important to how I do all the stuff, which I'll explain later.
And if you guys are on Twitter, I actually my favorite platform but we do one day a month.
Recording, and then for shorts and then one day a month, it's usually like a half day.
16:15
I'll do like 48, YouTube videos, the ones that are direct to camera, and that's it.
That's the, that's the jam.
So that's the how much, that's what that's my investment.
That's my cost to do this.
And so here's the how and so this is the content creation model, all right.
That's the big Visual and those are the Bold bullets.
16:32
Fantastic.
Let's start with the first one, so test record inject contextualize distribute.
So, the old way that I used to do content was I would just have this ongoing email thread to myself.
I'm going to have like notes or like a chain to yourself because you probably get ideas.
You're in a conversation.
I should make a comment on that, right?
16:48
And then you email it to yourself.
That's how I did it for a long time.
And the new way is the Twitter way, which is being blocked by the thing, because it formatted weird.
But I post all of those ideas as tweets on Twitter, rather than just sending them to myself.
And so all of a sudden, what used to be my inbox is actually just my like, tweet thread, all right?
17:06
And so I tweet about five Times a day ish.
And the nice thing is that Twitter is a very forgiving platform, so it's just, like, stream of Consciousness and it takes notes, you have to pick video, you know, videos or captions, or I like it, because it's just thoughts.
Like that's, I love Twitter so much for that reason.
17:23
And so, I'll post this stuff.
And I'm like, okay, those are the ones that people thought were interesting.
And then the threads become long format, and the tweets, become short format.
Pretty simple Step, 1.
Second step is recording right wire.
Doing both.
I realize it because you're like, why are you do short stuff?
17:42
I was kind of against shorts and then I realize that I've never actually consumed anything from Gary Vee that's long.
But I like Gary Vee a lot.
Oh, my god.
Well, I guess that work.
So that's why I do both right.
And so I think it's a width and depth thing, I think the shorts give you a lot of brass, I think the Long's give you a lot of depth, right?
18:01
So, this is everything that I know about about how to make content that quote goes viral.
I watched a long like interview with mr.
Beast, my big practice of trying to learn stuff, is go to the person who's the best at it, and listen to them, because they've already reorganize the information for you hack.
And so he's like, listen all these Guys make this all complim with the tags, the hashtags.
18:19
And then, you guys saw that, this is not me.
If ending you, I have no idea what I'm talking about.
Remember big grain of salt, but he said, it's just CTR times.
Watch time, that's it.
You got to get people to click, you got to get people to watch, I was like, okay, that makes sense.
He's like, and that's what YouTube wants.
They want people to be interested in the content to get the click.
18:36
And the make sure that the content fulfills, the promise of the thumbnail cool.
I was like I can do that.
And so this is the general format that I've used for the Long's which is like a hooker question that I'm answering.
Usually a story that's relevant to answer.
The question, a framework that I've applied to repeat that process and then an explanation of why I think it works.
18:55
That's it.
And if I want to make longer stuff, it's just that process with multiple stories repeating that over and over again.
The shorts is a hooker, question, a hammer, which for me is my tweet, I put the Tweet as the next thing I say, because I already know it converts.
And then I have an example in an explanation and so this is an example.
19:13
So, it's like 20 ways to guarantee poverty or 20 ways to stay poor, right?
I mean, this thread got a lot of shares.
Cool, 28 rules reprogram.
My to be rich in 22 minutes so I have to change the, you know, the headline and stuff.
But the content was identical.
I just did it in a video, right?
19:28
And then the short ones that do well, it's like, all right.
Over here from a Navy, SEAL blah.
Authenticity is just a fancy word.
Boom.
I just make a short version of the same thing just saying the Tweet.
Next one is inject.
So we grew the podcast actually recently for my 20,000 a month, to four hundred thousand a month, and a big part of that was just having called a And sounds really dumb but I wasn't doing it.
19:49
So do it.
And so the way that we did it was we recorded two versions of each of the call to action.
So like, call to actions other channels lead Maddox.
Share a tag.
If you have a lower ticket product, I don't but like are you you know?
For me I can have a book signing at sense, you know, leave a review if you want to ask for clients or, you know, send a question.
20:08
So I would just report two different ctas for that and then I just inject them into the content.
So this is what it might look like.
So it's like you have your CTA one. 10th mid-roll content and off.
That makes sense.
So, we started doing that with the podcast and it started to grow a lot.
20:24
And now we're actually doing it in the rest of the forms of content.
So you'll see that for me because this has been working.
So this is me doing this walking the talk, all right, the point directions Etc.
Okay, contextualize, so anyone seen this one before?
20:39
And one see this like mean that went viral.
So it's like everybody kind of a pure somewhat differently even though it's the same person depending on the setting that you're in, right on You look a certain way LinkedIn.
You look a certain way, tender look a certain way, Ida sales guy who was on Tinder and and he would close every one of his dates on buying our supplements so that he could get, he was like, it always covered dinner Savage anyways.
21:03
So you have to make the stuff contextual and so this is what we do.
So this is the same video, right?
Is that same Navy SEAL video?
I made earlier, right, so that's a real, that's a tick tock and then that's the YouTube Shore.
So it's the same thing.
You just, you just make it match the Um same way you would make your Facebook look different than your Instagram look.
21:21
Different than your LinkedIn, Etc.
As long as just make a contextual, I think it does a lot better because have you guys seen people just like, take literally the exact same thing and post it on the wrong platform.
I just think it just hurts it and it's just not that much effort to make a contextual alright, last one distribute then we distribute them.
21:39
All right, so we go from seven times a week to 80 times a week and distribution that was the result over that six-month period.
Which was a lot of growth.
Awesome.
And so we 10x the inputs and we got 10x the outputs surprising, so quick recap, all right, content, creation model test.
21:58
First thing you do make your brain dump into something that's actually generating content.
So this take, this is NetZero time for me.
I was doing it and I just started doing it publicly.
Number two is that once I have the stuff that's winning, I record it.
I record the threads as long as I record the tweets of shorts from there, the Injects the call to action so that I can direct the traffic whatever way I want to direct it right for and big one on this last injection thing.
22:23
Like, if you don't do this because I wasn't, you get all of these Impressions and like eyeballs and stuff and you get followers, but like you don't drive a result, which again, sounds silly that I wasn't doing this, but I told you the beginning, you guys are better than I am at this.
Number four was contextualize it.
22:39
I just think it works a lot better.
And then finally, you cut it and increase the volume.
Cool.
It makes sense of our great fans.
Fantastic.
So was that helpful?
Okay, cool.
So that concludes section to how much and how Fantastic observations.
22:58
I was going to call it musings but then I thought no one would know that Matt.
So I just gave you the like traditional lip service on a Content generation model, it's kind of boring and I don't think it's that interesting which is why I tried to get through it quickly because a lot of people will describe that, as the reason that we grew a lot and I don't think that's why, but I'm presenting it because I would end up getting a zillion questions.
23:25
And so that's why it's there.
I think the real reason that we were able to grow.
So I'm going to put like my real hat on for a minute.
Is that there's an unspoken question at every person's mind that has to First be answered, which is, why should I listen to you?
And I think it's one of the most profound questions and I think it influences how people share how people take your content.
23:44
Everything.
It's the frame that the content is consumed in, so I'll give you a real world example.
Imagine you're talking to a guy, you don't know anything, you just like talk about business and you're like oh that's cool.
And then like two seconds later it's like do that.
Guy's a billionaire, all of a sudden you're like, right, the frame matters a lot.
24:04
Elon Musk makes it a tweet that's like I'm on the toilet and it gets like 500 million shares, right?
This guy's hilarious, right?
It's because it's Elon, right?
And he has a brand that he's established and there's context there.
And so, I think that we should have this question answered for ourselves and our prospects before creating content, all right.
24:25
Right.
And so imagine for a moment that I had done this whole presentation up to this point and I had a 1000 person total audience between all of those platforms.
Same presentation, how different would that feel Right.
Just imagine.
24:41
Do you on stage?
You don't know me and I have 1000 people on Instagram and that's it.
Same presentation.
You would receive it differently, right?
Right.
I would because I would think it was stupid pointless, preachy better than now full of shit and if you're so good, why don't you do it?
24:59
And so we have to answer the question, why should I listen to you?
And I think a lot of you are making content from a week frame and that's just what I see, that's just me.
Witnessing it like you know, it's like the 18 year old relationship coaches, you know what I mean?
They're the real, you know, they're out there.
25:20
Some of you are here, you can write, you know, or it's like the business coaches that are doing five thousand dollars a month.
So besides all the stuff that we shared earlier, the real reason, I think our audience is growing is that we're talking about stuff that we have evidence to support.
25:36
Like that's the real, right?
So all the shit I said earlier.
Sure you can do that.
That worked for me.
You might not like Twitter.
I like Twitter because easy for me, it's not easy.
Or you don't do it, right?
Which is why this worked for me this time, right?
That's the context.
25:51
But I think this stuff is the more kind of Eternal stuff.
That's why I was kind of like excited to get to part 3.
And so I think it's about having the evidence for your others and most importantly for yourself.
Right?
We built these other companies.
First before ever talking about how to build companies.
Our guys, hope you enjoyed part.
26:09
One of the keynote is very special and I hope you guys got some tactics that you can immediately use in your business terms of how to operationalize content in a way that is sustainable for you to build your business and start generating inbound leads to sell the stuff that you have.
26:24
All right?
Next up is part two of this and this one is is really from the soul.
So I kind of actually transitioned the talk at this point.
Going into part two from what I heard part 2 is the thing that everyone One.
I mean, it was the thing that everyone kept quoting at me and you can see my tone shift because you'll see that, everything that I just talked about, in terms of the operations, that's the day-to-day, that's the execution, that's the implementation, but if you have the wrong heart behind it, if you have the wrong fuel, that's making it no one will.
26:51
Listen, and so beat, stay tuned for part 2.
That's coming out ASAP for you guys, and I can't wait for you to listen to it.
One.
I mean, it was the thing that everyone kept quoting at me and you can see my tone shift because you'll see that, everything that I just talked about, in terms of the operations, that's the day-to-day, that's the execution, that's the implementation, but if you have the wrong heart behind it, if you have the wrong fuel, that's making it no one will.
Listen, and so beat, stay tuned for part 2.
That's coming out ASAP for you guys, and I can't wait for you to listen to it.0:00
I give a custom keynote presentation that I made specifically for grow with video live and it was all around brand and content marketing.
Which if you've seen lately, Leyland, I have accumulated over a million additional followers and under 6 months using the content strategy that I've never revealed before.
0:17
And the second half of this presentation is, in my opinion, I think the best stuff from the presentation because we transition from the tactics to the strategy, from the the doing - to the beingness of building.
A brand and I think the real Secret Sauce to what is led to the tremendous expansion in our audience, in a very short period of time.
0:38
And if you're looking to do something like this, I think a lot of people are looking at it wrong and I think it's really costing them a lot.
And honestly just backfiring, I want Mo Z Nation to crush it.
I want all of us to rise together and build the best businesses in the world and it starts with the brand and the promises we make in, keeping our promises.
0:53
So enjoy.
Welcome to the game where we talk about it, get more customers how to make more per customer and how to keep them longer in the many failures and lessons.
We have learned along the way.
I hope you enjoy and subscribe.
So, how do I make content from?
Just starting out.
Excellent question.
1:09
So there's two frame shifts that I think has to occur.
Do then talk how I versus how to and give versus get.
All right, so let's start with the first one.
So who here hates this, how to live, an amazingly happy life and get everything that you want?
1:25
From somebody who is doing this part time and is still cutting hair, right?
There's nothing wrong with cutting hair, but it probably wouldn't make you an authority on this matter.
That makes sense.
Some of you are doing this and wondering why it's not working like, I mean, my stuff so much better, it honestly doesn't matter, it doesn't matter because if I had a thousand people and state like, oh my followers, and I made the same presentation, you wouldn't give a shit Like, I'm trapped like real, right?
1:52
And so there's a better way, I think.
All right, so this is Alex's crazy, content, creation model, trademark pending step.
One do shit step to talk about what you just did.
I know.
And then do bigger shit.
2:09
This is a complex model and, uh, we're getting to.
So here's how it looks in the real world.
All right.
Hey, here's what I did versus.
Here's what you should do.
Feel the difference.
This is what I did for you.
Awesome doesn't work for you.
2:24
No sweat.
Here's 20 of my clients.
This is the stuff that I'm doing with them right now.
Rose you a struggling with some skin condition.
We started giving her magic pills and look at her skin.
Now it's amazing, right?
But like this is what it might not work for you, but this will work for her and this will work for him.
This is work for my clients, right?
2:41
Not what you should do.
As soon as you point out, people hate you.
Because it sounds like you're preaching.
It sounds like you have an ego and I just don't think people like that.
And so, I think it's also switching from how to, to how I so, how to build a massive social media.
So, following to how I built the following that I have feel the difference, it's really small but really big in terms of how people interpret your message because it's like I appreciate, I think that what happens is when you say it that way, you're like you're pulling back and saying like, hey I hope this serves you in some way.
3:19
Like this is like me opening the kimono.
This is stuff that's working right now for me.
Whereas the other way, you're at the pulpit commanding giving demand, you know, demands and commanding people.
And I just don't think people like that.
I mean, how many people their entire Instagram, famous people shaking their finger at you.
It sucks.
3:35
I hate it.
And so I think it's really speaking on your truths rather than claiming to know the Truth is a point I probably make later, but I'll bring it up now, is that?
Everyone is unquestionably an expert on your own life.
No one can question that.
If I say I had a meal for breakfast this morning, I'm on fucking touchable, you know, it's kind of lame, but, but from the from a faculty, like no one can challenge me on that.
3:59
Like, this is what I eat every day.
No one.
See me like, fuck you Alex harming the planet, right?
They're not going to say that because like That's real, that's true.
Known can touch that, right?
But as soon as I say you should have oatmeal for breakfast.
4:16
Fuck you, right?
It's this big of a difference but it makes all the impacts in the world in terms of how people receive the message.
So question who here makes the content because they want to become famous and feel good about themselves who is making stuff because they want it to be received and help the audience, right?
4:35
And so the thing is, is you have to feed them and not you and I think if you can make that shift, Shift.
I think in my opinion, it will be more effective.
And so if you look at the biggest influencers in the business space because this is the space that I'm kind of in.
You look at these guys, I mean, shoot half, these guys are talking here so congrats the the event.
4:54
It's awesome.
Very honored to be on stage with them.
So that's the ACCC em at work.
The Alex crazy content creation method at work by the way do shit talk about the shit you did.
Which one of these guys made money from their social media following Made the money, they have from the social media following, right?
5:14
And so, how many of these people needed?
The followers?
Not ride.
People, like I want to be the next this.
It's like, if you want to be the next at then you got to walk that walk, right?
And so you probably won't be respected as an authority on business until you've achieved Mega success the same reason.
5:31
You look at your competitors, like that guy sucks.
It's like they're looking at you Right.
And it's because why should I listen to you?
And so, here's the good news because you're like, well, shit Alex, what do I talk about?
Here's a good news, you can become a niche, specific Authority.
So rather than going like, here's how to live an amazing life, right?
5:50
That's like you've got to be Jesus.
Jesus can do that Jesus.
Can you can't do that.
Jesus can do that, right?
So you got to go from here to like I'm really good at helping people.
Build ATM businesses.
I'm really good at how people flip houses in Phoenix.
Right?
Because in that little ocean that little Pond, you can be king because you got a convenience 20 guys.
6:10
Got a walk, the talk right.
You gotta do what you're doing, you talk about, you're doing that's it, but you can win in that little Pond and I'll show you how to scale from there in a second, but you can do that.
Alright, and so this is me when I started.
So I had a couple powerlifting records and I liked working out and so the stuff that I did then was about what I was doing then and so you can't read it.
6:32
But it says how to get rid of stubborn fat on your arms.
And stomach, that's the content.
I was making that and whose Irrelevant for just the members at my gym, but that was my way of adding value and already had a rapport with them.
So they're like, if I'm going to learn about this, identical topic from a hundred different people.
6:49
I just rather learn about it from you because I like you and I had values-based Rapport not expertise.
Like I had General expertise because I look the way I looked.
But beyond that I'd have a PhD so like I did a ton of research.
I read the same articles and just try to make it entertaining.
That was it.
7:05
It and I didn't become a mega famous for that, but this made me money.
This made me enough money to, you know, grow the company that I had at the time.
And so from there, I leverage that to grow my first gym and then the gyms after that, right?
And then from there, once the gyms grow, I started making content about how to grow Jim's, why?
7:22
It's a fucking knew how to grow Jim's.
I wasn't like how to scale your SAS company.
You mean like how to reach a billion dollar valuation?
Like I was like, I don't know, but this is what work for my gyms and people like dude.
This stuff works like I know because I'm doing it.
I need this.
7:38
How I do it.
Like I know it works.
This is how I do it.
Of course it were.
I'm doing it.
Here's what's fucking crazy.
So many people are talking about shit and teaching stuff that a they have never done and be the are repurposing.
Someone else's content and making a shittier version of it.
Some of them are you?
8:02
And that's the thing is is like when you're talking the theoretical and trying to teach something it's how to rather than how I.
So if you do the thing then you just talk about what you just did.
Now later on, I think it's the the capture capture, don't create documents on create concept, but I understand that that takes resources, like, it takes money to get people around you to, you know, document your life and all that kind of stuff like that.
8:27
That's expensive.
But I think just even doing Recaps.
If like, this is the stuff that's working right now for us in this context, people are like, thanks.
You didn't have to do that.
Thanks for sharing that stuff that's working for you rather than how to and know, if you do it that way, you will not gain a mega following at first, but you will accomplish it, which will set you on the path for you to be broader later.
8:52
So, the gym Secrets podcast, became the game that I published from the gym on Secrets book, which is how to build a profitable.
Jim 280.
Lat, First book and the difference in scale was pretty tremendous.
That's my job on secret book but I still think it's phenomenal book by the way to that book and that books done that in less than a year and that other books been out like four years and so it's not bad.
9:15
It's just sequence people.
Try and go out of sequence.
They try and say like why am I not Tom Billy you.
I can't I'm doing everything time Billy's doing except for building Quest.
Oops.
That's why what he says is relevant, you know?
9:34
I mean, because the thing is, is like we want everybody here.
Most people, seek truth.
Would you say if you were, like, raise your hand, if you seek truth?
Okay?
So the easiest shortcut for the brain to seek, truth is to look at someone who's the most extreme version.
And then saying, okay, I don't have to apply a lot of decision-making filtering here because now I can just absorb this because I can just take this as fact because if Warren Buffett says, this is how I should invest.
10:02
I feel okay about that Source.
Even if he's like, save your money spend less than you earn.
In fact caught dollar cost average of the SP and don't buy gold right like he says that stuff in your like, okay.
Now the stayed home teacher, who's been saving all of her money could say the exact same thing but she just forgot to build Berkshire Hathaway And so the thing is, is that and I'm actually very against the whole confidence, Mantra of like people being like, gotta believe in yourself, you gotta pee.
10:35
You have to do things so that you have evidence that you can support.
Why you are good.
You guys are great.
And this is like my favorite line from The Matrix.
Its, I think, in the second or third camera, which one it is.
10:52
But more if he's up there and he's like, I feel truthfully unafraid not because of the path that lies before me because the path lies behind me.
I think it gives a lot of spiritual strength that because I got asked on the interview, they're like, how are you so certain I was like, you talk about these things like with so much certainty.
11:13
I was like well that's just how I've done it like in its that.
Depth of experience and knowledge that like, no one can question that we built those things that's truth.
Those are the real numbers.
And so, as long as you're not fudging your numbers, right?
And you just say, like, this is what it is, then of course, your fucking certain, right?
11:33
Because I think confidence is self-delusion it's trying to make up for what you don't have evidence for.
And I think it's a much easier practice to stop pretending and start doing the stuff that you should be certain about.
And then you don't have to have bravado, you can get up like you can walk on stage and people are like that.
11:52
Guy built the biggest Kangen Water Empire out there, nobody calls in the front and he built that.
He doesn't have to have confidence for people to listen to him.
They will want to listen to everything that he says, if that is what they want to do, because they'll just go to the person that's done the thing that they want to do, so that they don't have to apply a lot of effort and thinking, and they can just say I'll do everything this person says, right.
12:17
Most people cannot separate information from source.
So what we do is we just seek out good sources.
I think wisdom is built from separating information from Source, a fool, can give you a very wise piece of wisdom or information or a lesson, but it's much harder to do that.
12:35
Real quick guys.
If you can think about how you found this podcast, somebody probably tweeted it told you about it.
Should it on Instagram or something like that?
The only way this grows is through word of mouth and so I don't run ads, I don't do sponsorships, I don't sell anything.
I only ask is that you continue to pay it forward to whoever showed you or however you found out about this podcast that you do the exact same thing.
12:55
So if it was a review if it was a post, if you do that would mean the world to me and you throw some good karma out there for another entrepreneur.
The shorthand for most of us is just go to somebody who's an absolute Authority in this thing.
That has unquestionably.
A reason that I should listen to them and then just listen to them.
13:11
The downfall of that is that you start taking stock advice from your hairdresser.
I'm not bashing hairdressers right now.
There's just top of my, all right?
And so you're like, I trust you, what else?
You got and then they start talking about things that are not their expertise, and then that's when you get in trouble.
And so the same degree as you probably have an audience.
13:29
That's are asking you questions, right?
Anybody have an audience.
Ask them questions, raise your hand.
Okay.
If someone asks you a question, that is not something that you have authority on.
I think you gained more Authority by saying I don't have authority to speak on that.
And then you get more respect because because this is what happens damaging admissions are the single greatest thing that build trust.
13:50
If I say I suck at marriage advice, I suck at, you know, giving happiness advice, I suck at whatever.
But I'm really good at making high returns in the stock market.
How much more believable at that?
Is that then I make really good returns in the stock market and I'm really good at marriage and I'm real and and and when you admit Deficits whatever comes after the admission of guilt or the admission of deficiency is believed more.
14:20
So if I say hey I really suck at a lot of things but you're going to believe what I suppose.
I say, right here.
That's a sense of structure for persuasion and you can use that in all of the content that you have forever.
It's also great for negotiating.
And so, anyways, I say all this to say, it's the path that lies behind you, not the path that lies in front of you, that will give you the certainty that you want to gain the influence you.
14:42
Desire.
And so my Evolution for me was Fitness First and I just talked about this is what's worked for me.
People like Alex, how do you eat Twizzlers and cookies all day and have a six-pack and I'm like a genetics be.
I live in a gym and see I eat this way, right?
15:02
And we were like, oh, so I can have cookies to and have a six-pack and I guess and that was relevant for me.
Some people are like super vegan, Superstars, awesome, and they're going to talk was relevant for them.
And the people who follow, Like that.
I Vibe with that cool, right?
And so I'm not going to be the best nutrition expert in the world, but in terms of like my little little fiefdom, I can rule that, right?
15:22
And then I moved out because I started doing well, then people start asking me.
Hey, how are you growing your Tim?
I was like, well, that's how I grew my gym.
We're like, what about business and gentlemen?
I don't know.
I've never in an e-commerce business.
I don't know about manufacturing.
I don't about software.
I don't know any of that stuff, but I'm not a girl Jim.
So it only talks about that and the amount of people that, that was relevant for.
15:42
This money but for that audience, fucking everything.
Right.
I mean, and just for context here, there are riches in niches like that company made a lot of money just tagged, like, it made a lot of money and it didn't make me famous at all.
16:01
And so, again, the question is, do you want to be rich?
Do want to be famous returned to serve you.
You're trying to serve the audience.
And then the last one is like now we've been able to leverage that initial success to build an e-commerce, brand to build a software brand to sell those, and then now we have a portfolio.
And so now because we have businesses that span a lot different areas.
16:18
I can say these are the Frameworks that we used to build all of them.
I hope this serves you.
And then people can take that.
And as anybody used any of the Frameworks that we've and foremost Nation, anybody who's in there?
If anybody uses Farmers to make more money, one person who probably not.
16:35
So a big part of that is that you just get better over time and so I said this quote and when it got shared a lot it's like you're not making as much money as you want cause you're not as good as you think you are.
I'm just being real.
Like, I don't know, I could have done like the here's my 17,000 content model.
16:52
You know what I mean?
But like The real shit is that you're probably not that good yet. , And that's okay.
Like the only person beating you up is you and so the only way to get better is volume and the only way to get even better than volume is volume times time because volume you can write this down.
17:11
I don't have this in the presentation but this is like the equation of Life Volume or at least business volume times time equals skill.
You got to do it.
A lot of times for a long period of time and you will get better.
That is a promise you will.
17:27
If you suck today, you will suck less tomorrow and eventually one day you will look up and suck.
So little that you will actually be good and then people will ask you, how did you become an overnight success?
And then instead of saying here's how you cold call say, here's how I did it.
17:46
I hope this serves you, right?
And you can build that trust that way.
Great Alex.
So how do I make money if I'm just starting out?
Fantastic alright:, jeez.
Always about the money.
I'm getting called is awesome.
So here's a couple observations here.
18:01
Give away the secret cell, the implementation.
All right.
If you want to build an Enterprise, that is valuable.
This is how you do it.
You can sell info, there's nothing wrong with that.
But if you want to build a brand, give away the secret cell, the implementation.
All right.
18:18
Because people are, like, you can give the whole Farm away.
People still won't do it.
One percent of people will do it.
My business model, relies on the 1%, who do it.
I mean, so like I Bank on that but only 1% are gonna do it.
So most people need help, most people need encouragement, most people need accountability.
18:34
Most people need somebody who's going to act as their virtual Google because I don't want to type it if it's true.
Right?
And so one of the side notes that I have here is that if you're not afraid of what your Giving away that you're giving away too much, you're not giving away enough.
And so every time I've written a book or I've made like a presentation that ends up going live.
18:55
I always think to myself like Oh God, I'm sharing everything.
What will they do?
They won't need me anymore because I give them this information.
They can, they don't, they'll just keep living their lives, and I will become obscure.
And nothing, and I will, and I will die, right?
That is what it feels.
19:10
I mean, you're you catastrophize, but but that's real, right?
It's the it's the opposite though, right?
And there's so many things, I feel like that, I that I've at least realize for me is a lot of things are the opposite way you expect.
It's like you only gain your life.
19:26
By giving it like you only get trust from others by trusting first, you only get value back by giving you first.
And so if you're afraid of giving away all the secrets that you have, I promise you, if you make content that does not contain the secrets, 99% of people who are the people who are never going to pay you anyways, 99% of people will just think you suck.
19:51
Because you give nothing so you just make fluff because you're so afraid of giving good stuff away.
The thing that most people consume is they make one, they're consumed one video and they make a judgment.
And say, I will never consume a video from this person again.
What a waste of time.
And so like my big fear With every piece of content is I would rather make fewer pieces of content, because I'm so afraid of somebody taking 20 minutes to consume something.
20:15
After watching a bunch of my stuff watching that one and not actively deciding to stop watching but just just don't get enough for the time that they're like, I'll just watch something else.
They don't say like fuck Alex.
They just pivot a little bit and slowly you fade away and so I would rather have quality over quantity but quality quantity.
20:37
T beats just just quality, right?
But I would personally, this is me.
I would personally prefer to have better stuff and give away as many Secrets as I possibly can to get people to start taking steps towards you.
Because what also happens is, if someone goes and use the stuff from the YouTube channel and grows from a million dollars a year to three million dollars a year or five million dollars here, they don't have questions on whether or not, we can provide value because we already have, right?
21:02
And then makes the sales process dramatically easier.
Because you say, what brought you here today?
They're like well, you Maybe two million dollars a year.
I love you.
You're like awesome.
Want to get to 10?
No, I'm sure.
Like how do I know it's going to work?
Because it already has right?
And you can take that as totally different.
21:19
Totally different frame for the sale.
Okay?
And so, make your free materials better than everyone else is paid materials.
I heard this from Tony Robbins and I think it's really true, but I think the real real is that most of your stuff is not better than their paid stuff.
21:35
And so that's why it doesn't work.
Okay, so talk about you really know which is your specialty which is your individual thing that you have experienced that no one can challenge your truth, all right?
And so finally, you want to play games where if you, wait, you win because Goodwill compounds faster than money because the longer you can delay, the ask the bigger, the ask can be the longer, the runway, the bigger, the plane that can take off of that.
22:03
And so, I promise you and this is again gigantic.
A grain of salt with the limited experience that I have doing organic because I've only done directed jugular paid ads cold calling you know affiliate stuff, straight pitching I've only done that but I can say that this brand is very special to me because I enjoy we're building and I'm in no rush to do it and you have time.
22:31
And so the longer you can wait and keep walking with people the longer.
The compounding works in your favor.
Favor.
Like it's no coincidence.
That the biggest people in the business space, don't need anything from their audiences.
Right?
Because I think that that compounding process gets interrupted when you do a hard pitch.
22:50
That's my opinion.
I could be wrong.
That's my opinion.
And so the idea is how can we how can we sell without selling right?
And I think in that way, the compounding will happen faster than the revenue would have otherwise increased if you started trying to make the money fast.
23:08
And so the longer you can delay that the better it's going to be and then you can understand why all these guys play the infinite game.
I've never even wanting to do that right hook because it's like, but next year, I'm going to have 5 times the audience and then a year later, they like, but next year, when I have five times the audience, right?
23:24
Because as soon as you shoot your shot, you dramatically decrease the Goodwill.
And so I think that I've at least adapted and this is maybe just a different way of saying it.
I know Gary's got jab.
Jab jab, right hook.
Just a personal observation that I've had is that you can go, give, give, give, give give give get Bet you don't even have to ask people, just start handing things to you because if you deposit enough Good Will in there, it just starts coming back.
23:53
And I know that sounds crazy but like the amount of people that damn you like, Hey, man, can I give you 10 grand for 10 minutes and like now I don't do that.
Like about 20 G like now, I don't do that.
But the amount of times people inbound they're like, hey, can I have you on my podcast?
And I have you on my stage, can I all these things are happening because you're not asking for anything and it makes people feel uncomfortable.
24:14
It's like it makes people feel really uncomfortable.
They're like how can I Pat buy something from your like you can't like and I'm like use the shit get to three million then we can partner right?
But that's it.
You know, I mean there's nothing else and so I think that if we can make that pivot and have that patience but like for thinking really big picture, the reason most people aren't successful as they just can't fucking control themselves.
24:40
Like that's it, it's impulse control.
And so there's three things they did this research study that said that The ultra successful people have three common.
Traits number one is they have a superiority complex.
They think they're better than everybody.
They think they can do bigger things.
Second is it they are if crippling insecurity of not being enough I like down hits me and then the third one is impulse control.
25:03
So they know where they want to go.
They have a weight, they have a way drive to not be a failure and they stay focused on it because of impulse control.
And so the idea here is, if we can do that We will be more successful and the reason that most people don't make money as they can't wait 12 months.
25:19
Like I have this I have this 18 year old, who is my neighbor and I said, I'm going to have you sign a contract that says, I want to be a millionaire.
I was like, you gotta wait five years and you can't make any money between now and then, would you do it?
It's like yeah, I would every single person can do that.
I guarantee you, if you delay your ass for five years and used to provide a value to people for five years, you have bigger fucking audience, knew what to do with.
25:40
And you'd be a millionaire in five years, probably happen a lot faster than that.
But if you committed, You doing it for five years, you would, but guess what?
No one can do it.
And that's why most people are successful.
And so we come to these events and you have the models and all the stuff, right?
But people still eat cookies in there, trying to lose weight.
25:58
And so it's a concept of local versus global which is there's a local benefit to eating cookies, you feel better, whatever?
The global benefit goes down though because you don't get the six-pack you want, if that's the goal and your kept counting macros, if you get the idea.
26:13
Right.
And so most people cannot sacrifice local benefit for Global.
The sales guys don't want to put the notes in the CRM.
Even though the benefits the entire organization, Because it's a local cost, right?
And so as a side note for operations for business operations, supposed to bring Global benefit in Access of the local cost.
26:35
And so when we're trying to achieve the things that you're trying to do, right, the local benefit is just make the ask fast.
The global benefit is the longer you can weigh the bigger, it can be.
And so for me, I'm like, why not wait as long as humanly possible.
So, I'll wrap this up speak from strength, share your experiences to add to the body of knowledge, the problem with a lot of the social media, Stuff and books that are out there now is that the the barrier to entry in terms of what it takes to publish content is so low.
27:03
It's almost not visible, right?
So low and so everybody can produce content back in the day, the only way you produce content was like, after 30 years of being a research, your like, this is my entire life's work in one book so I can add to the body of knowledge.
We were like, wow, thank you for that and that's how that's how content was made, right?
27:22
And if you wanted to do a direct, you know, a marketing piece You had to edit it and put it on a piece of paper and look at it every single way and know that you're going to pay 50 cents for every single person who's going to receive it.
And you better be damn sure.
It's beautiful.
But it's so easy.
Now to publish that most stuff is shit.
27:40
Most stuff sucks and is a wool total waste of time.
So just try and talk about the stuff that's not a waste of time that you actually know.
So you can add to the body of knowledge.
If you say, hey this is what I did.
Consider yourself a mini researcher.
Like these are the experiments I ran in my business.
These are the experiments, Iran My weight loss clinic.
27:57
These are the experiments I ran in my Plumbing business.
Just talk about the experience because no one can question that second is that teaching on principles is difficult until you've achieved a material amount the field?
Because there are others, who will teach it with more depth of experience.
It's very difficult to teach business unless you're very successful business because there's just another person who someone will listen to more, right?
28:17
But no one can question what you have done and if you have done nothing, then do something first and then talk about it because not everyone is an expert on everything.
You are unquestionably an pert on your own life so you can share it, all right?
And then wait 10 years,0:00
Most Nation for years ago.
Weyland, I did a podcast which is actually one of our first podcast we ever did together.
That we were both invited to to talk about our marriage.
And I always feel uncomfortable talking about our marriage, within the context of like, something to emulate for a couple reasons, one, because we're young, and we've only been married for five years.
0:20
And I think there's a massive, you know, Himalayan grain of salt, but, you know, our advice can be taken for.
So, what we share in this podcast, or the things that work for us, and And so you know, there are elements of our marriage that are unique.
You know we met pretty much under a business context.
0:35
Layla already love to business and so we wanted to business together as a result of that.
I didn't, you know, have a romantic relationship and then try and get her to love business.
That was kind of our shared mutual interest at the onset and we run our marriage a little bit uniquely.
And so if you don't have a spouse that's in business, that you would like to be, I think it's worth listening to.
0:53
And if you have a spouse that you are in business with an obviously, I think it would definitely be worth listening to and we're posting this because it's the response to a lot of questions that we get.
And so this is our attempt to try and answer some of the questions that we get from you guys which is how do we manage our life.
How do we manage the dynamic between being Partners?
1:09
How do we be husband and wife?
And also you know, CEO and Co o and all the kind of Interest Keys between those things.
So buckle up and enjoy.
We loved each other, but it was like not, like we weren't like in love until we like intentionally went all in on the relationship to like kind of add-on from there.
1:28
Like, how do you build a relationship on top of business?
You take the same principles that make a business successful.
Like communication.
Cadence what you talk about.
When you talk about it, having organization and structure in it, you put that relationship.
Welcome to the game where we talk about it, get more customers how to make more per customer and how to keep them longer in the many failures and lessons.
1:47
We have learned along the way.
I hope you enjoy and subscribe.
All right, everyone we are back.
We've got an exciting couple for you today.
We're on with Alex and Layla or Mosey.
Guys.
Thank you so much for coming on with us.
How are you doing?
We're doing great.
2:03
So it's a new Monday.
So it start to the week.
We just got back from traveling.
So awesome.
Awesome, you guys do.
A lot of traveling.
Try not to us as well.
We enjoy our own time when we get it.
Yes, definitely.
Let's face it.
2:21
I love my own space as well.
So I'm curious because most couples are we talked to have the relationship first and then they had the business in later on.
You guys actually do the complete opposite.
So how do we fast and very fast?
Yeah.
So how did you when, when you so much of the focus initially was on the business?
2:39
How did the relationship then build off of that?
I think it came from a place of respect, I guess.
Alex, definitely to say that and then opening ourselves up to loving each other.
Like, we loved each other, but it was like not like we weren't like in love until we like intentionally went all in on the relationship and then to like kind of add-on from.
3:03
They're like how do you build a relationship on top of business?
You take the same principles that make a business successful.
Like communication.
Cadence what you talk about when you talk.
About it, having organization, and structure in it.
You put that in a relationship.
This evening, even was like roles roles responsibilities, like within the business and the rules responsibilities within the relationship.
3:21
And so, like, we outline, like, what is your perfect day look like for you, what would your husband need to do in order for it to be a perfect day for you?
And I think a lot of us are afraid to ask that or even more.
So afraid to say what we really want, you know, maybe you do want to have sex twice a day and yet unlike get a hand massage at night and all your meals cooked for you and delivered to you at your table, like, Like a lot of us are like me, ask, what's only such a dick if I said that because we're afraid of asking for it, but then when the other person doesn't know, you know, what's ideal.
3:50
Cuz I know that anything that Layla would ask me, like, sure, just give me the cheat codes, you know?
I mean, like this is what like, these are your buttons, like you get into, you know, what I mean?
And so that was a huge step for us but like we're like, we're such Advocates of loving logically because both of us had, you know, probably like a lot of people, you know, relationship in the past that we're like, Chemistry and like emotion, like all this, you know, whatever.
4:15
And this is both of our first relationship that was not at all like that.
And it was really, really based in like a deep friendship and like when we got married, like it was not romantic.
I just looked at her one day and I was like, I think we should get married.
She was like, I think we should too and then I got her.
4:34
Like, and we were married is like, so like that was I was literally happened and like, from the day that we got married until now Now, our relationship has like massively blossoms, compared to what it was on the day of our action marriage, because we're both like, oh shit.
When we make that decision below, we're big Believers that.
4:55
You don't need time, you need information to make decisions and we had the information that we needed to make a good one.
I let I want to go back to that part that you talked about, because I think it does huge.
Is, what would your ideal day look?
Like, like, what would you want from your husband, or wife?
5:10
Because I think when we do that ideal, Day exercise, we like to call it ideal everyday.
You often think about like, well, what, what do I want?
Just for my day, but you don't include that other person.
And I think that's huge because they don't know what's in your brain.
They can't read your mind.
5:26
So if you say like, oh, I want this or I want such and such, but you don't include, I want my husband to or I want my wife to.
They aren't going to know if you don't make the ask.
And I think, like you said, it is a little scary, sometimes to put like our deepest darkest desires out Out into the world like that.
5:43
But again, it doesn't necessarily mean that that person has to up and do everything that you just wrote on the list.
You're letting them know.
Here are some of the things that I would absolutely love, you know, to be able to do with you on a daily basis and then you kind of work those things in so that it makes sense for both of you.
6:00
Because I mean there's probably things that he would love to do and an ideal everyday and I might have absolutely no clue whatsoever.
What those look like if he doesn't tell me, you know, I might be like, yes, I know I'm pretty well.
It's like you said, like the It's like so much.
And, you know, I love how you said the same principles and applying business supplying, your relationship, because I took a lot of the business experience I had in brought it into our relationship and like, you has mentioned the Cadence in the communication.
6:25
That is just made everything else so much easier because most people think while we fall in love and it all just works, it's like no way you've got to have the structures and some of those things in place to support you in making it work.
Yeah yeah I love that.
So you guys got married and then things kind of blue.
6:41
You up like you said, right before?
I guess you started to kind of grow and really things are just going hot.
What was the Super Speed level?
So how what are some of the things that you've implemented with each other on the personal side?
6:57
To make sure that you're not constantly.
Letting like the business, take over all the time, honestly, it's pretty easy for us because it is a routine out.
First thing is in the morning.
You know, we have our coffee together.
We write down the three things, we're grateful for the things we do to be a better person that day and we usually share those with each other and we do that over coffee and that's usually like once we do that then we share like what we're going to do with for that day.
7:26
Like what do you have on your list for today?
What do I have on my list?
So we do that every morning and then we work out together right after that.
So after we've done that, we live together.
We have a home gym.
So it's fun because then we get to like talk about something that we both love doing which is like and Just do it with each other, which school, and jam out to the music.
7:44
And then we go.
And he works in here, which is our guest house.
And then I work in the house and then we don't talk until lunch, which lunch, I'll usually pick him and be like, hey, it's ready and then he comes in and we eat together.
So we have every week, we make sure to have every meal together, so then we have lunch together.
8:01
It's usually like 40 minutes and we talked about maybe what we've done so far that day.
Anything we need to like each other no of cetera.
And then we break again.
And then we have dinner usually start.
Like 6:30 prepping for dinner.
And then our whole thing with dinner is, if you put your phone away, and then once we eat dinner, usually we do not work after that.
8:21
So that's something that we did in the beginning.
We would work after dinner.
Until we like the see the computer because it's work is always going to be there.
But like you don't know, like there will always be work to do, but you have to make time to do other things.
8:37
So we'll spend time together afterwards, going to walk watch a movie.
Read do whatever.
Just talk sometimes.
Just sit on the balcony.
So, we actually spend a lot of time together, so, I'm curious.
How do you, how do you make that happen?
When you have a company that's growing so fast like, you guys have, I was going to I was going to add to the first.
8:58
Well, there's two things that I wanted to cover one was like the topics of conversation and interest in the other one is what you just asked the reason we stopped working after dinner was because when we started the business we were Less Advanced business owners than we are now.
9:16
And they're just gets to a point where you're like there is so much work to do.
That one person will make no dent in it.
And so at that point it's like what things can we delegate?
9:31
What things what skills can we teach other people?
So that we don't need to be the one doing them.
I mean it's like you know Richard Branson isn't running these companies even I mean bug And so it's really kind of taking it from that that that angle and then to Circle back to Italy was saying before.
9:47
I honestly, I've really hard time helping entrepreneurs, who don't understand honest who aren't married to their spouse and us, obviously, maybe there's best don't work with their spouse because it's such an integral part of, like our relationship.
10:06
When we said love logically like, I think there's a reason that people like, man, this really makes sense on paper.
Right?
We really made sense on paper and then we just believe that chemistry could be created with repeated action, right?
But like, we both like Fitness.
10:22
We both liked business, we were both Persian.
We both had the exact same like life story in terms of like she was raised by like a single dad.
The second half of her life had a lot of like basically transition from being raised by your mom to being raised by her dad which is the exact same story I had.
10:37
At the same age, we just kind of nuts, then we both travel to California.
The on a whim to go get into fitness.
So like we had the same story and so it made a lot of sense on paper.
And most people when they meet us there, like you guys are really really similar and I think it's a good thing like abstract but like when you're similar, things are really easy like, like the stuff I hate it and I don't have that.
11:02
Like she likes Fitness, she likes sales.
Like we don't some people like don't talk about business at dinner, like it's bullshit.
That's like our lives and what else I guess?
Yeah.
I guess that is like topics of conversation and like separating things.
We just look at it like life.
So I guess like we don't limit any topics because like our mission is what we're doing right now.
11:23
My power, our purpose in life is 100% alive in our business and there's nothing more exciting for us.
So it's like, oh, let's go, like, do something that's fun and creative outside of work and we're like work is fun and it's hard to go from driving like a NASCAR don't like going to a like No riding a moped and that's what I feel.
11:44
Like when we talk about other conversation, topics like doing with such high-level things.
Now that are so fun that it's like want to talk about wallpaper.
It like what like what are we going to talk about?
Hey guys, love that.
You're listening to the podcast.
12:00
If you ever want to have the video version of this which usually has more effects, more visuals, more graphs, you know, drawn out stuff.
Sometimes it can help hit the brain centers in different ways.
You can check out my YouTube channel.
It's absolutely free.
So check that out if that's what you are into and if not keep enjoying the show, Yeah, I'll say we found some other thing too because initially when we were working with entrepreneurs, sometimes they'd be single or the wouldn't have families.
12:24
What we found is that we can I have all these couples gravitate to us and a lot of us because just like you guys said it's this is there.
So integrated to each other and you know that point about wanting to do something else.
I think so much of this comes from like non entrepreneurs.
12:42
Like they don't enjoy their job, they live, you know, for the weekends.
But when you become an entrepreneur, it It really is Take Your Passion.
Figure out how you build a business out of it, that allows you to live that life and then you do that every day, rather than thinking, like you got to do something else to get away from it.
12:58
So I love that perspective.
Yeah, well, I'm speaking from somebody who was originally not in businesses when we first started I can see I have it can see both sides of it because I used to be the person was like I don't understand what you're talking about.
So this is not really a topic of conversation that I wanted to chat about it dinner.
13:14
But now that I'm in the business, it is very hard to.
Just not talk about the thing that we love or like we have a great new idea and we want to share it with each other.
So we've kind of integrated our lives and businesses together.
So we do talk about business a lot, but we also will move from a business topic to talking about the kids or talking about something else random in the same sentence.
13:36
So it just kind of fits for us.
And I mean I love that you guys say that unapologetically because I think there is this kind of stigma about like all.
Well, you should separate your business and your life.
And you know, when you're at dinner, you should be talking.
About life things.
It's whatever works for you.
I mean we all create our own Destinies.
13:53
Yeah.
Those are just rules made by people who like making rules and getting you know it's just it makes your partner to and what are some of the things you have expectations of for if we eat dinner together?
14:14
What are some of the things you would like to do in the evenings?
You know, obviously, Can kind of take things with an ebb and flow and if it's like, oh my God, we've been talking business all day and I just want to talk with you, that's okay.
Like you don't have to nothing has to be set in stone, I think and people get so caught up in those all.
14:31
It's got to be a routine and it's got to be we have to do with this certain way.
So I want to go back to something.
You said, you guys are so similar and we're opposites, which one what we found out was that that worked out well in business, because I'm the big picture person.
She's the operations person with you guys being so similar.
14:46
Do you ever run into issues?
Choose where like you're kind of thinking the same thing, you need an outside perspective or how did you figure out roles if you were so similar with some of that the role of Parmesan cheese are doing the same things and then we divided roles and it was basically like Alex is going to do the marketing and be face of the company, create problems.
15:08
And then I was going to in the beginning, I started the operations.
Now, I really think it's kind of how you look at it, right?
Because Many people would be like.
Okay, so then, you know, we're really similar, you would probably not be good at operations.
15:23
I don't think I'm gonna like actual systems processes operations.
No, I've actually had to learn because what, I am good at is people, and so odd higher than people think you have to do it.
Like my sister, for example, is now our CEO.
Oh and he does all that stuff, right?
And so I would say I took the strength that we both kind of had which is like Vision we both like he I would say that's his like biggest thing, right?
15:47
Right?
I could see the vision of the company and the culture on the inside, like the infrastructure that we need to support the Fulfillment of vision.
You guys are familiar with Marcus Lemonis and the prophet.
Yeah, love him.
So something interesting that we just realized recently was you know, he talks about people process product hmm at least at our company.
16:05
The way that I so we had like there's me there's Layla and the me means our Co L and so I mean he's also my sister-in-law, it was Leila's older sister and so it really works.
Layla's people Mimi is process analysis product.
16:22
And so that's kind of how it's becoming like Leon.
I share the title of CEO or co-ceo because I think what we did is we took the role of CEO and kind of just split it.
And so we both kind of work halftime or will like normal CEOs might work like you know more than I do think they don't work.
16:41
No but I mean it doesn't feel That was over time in this normal time but like you get yeah yeah you know it's a leader of a company supposed to create the vision and lead the people and so we joke that you know his is like create the vision of Mines likely people.
17:18
She is internal company where I am to our external clients.
So like she really does lead all of The Intergalactic, all of our whole team, all the Departments and whatnot, and I just do the same thing external.
Yeah, I think it's great that you guys have figured out your best drinks, like, the way that you work together, the way that you've decided on rolls, I mean, this is just proof that you don't have to follow any model you make up what works for you for your business and for your life.
17:45
So thank you guys for sharing all of that with us.
Us.
Before we wrap things up, I would love to hear.
If there's anything particular you would like listeners to take away from from your story, or your experiences here today.
I didn't say like the number one thing is that like we put a lot of effort into our relationship in the beginning, because we knew that one we were like, well, we're not in love because we're not 100% transparent with each other, so we should probably just be 100% honest even if our efforts at times.
18:13
Mmm, so we did that.
And then the second thing is that, like, we worked on a relationship.
Just like we worked on the business like in the beginning it requires a lot more work now it's kind of on autopilot since routine but we put in the work we read books, watch movies, we started putting routine in place that we had never done before.
18:29
You know, we did all that stuff and I think that a lot of people just say that it's, you know, it's that person or to the sides like it's the energy that you have together rather than it is either one of you don't know if you want to add anything.
Yeah, it's just the price funny because now everything seems really smooth for us alone but Like when I think about like even when we met like, as soon as we wake up, I would start working.
18:53
I would get up before her sometimes and just like go with my laptop and like that was it.
And now it's like we have a whole, you know, choreographed, you know, morning that neither of us really Brave.
It seems second nature now.
Like, why would I not do that?
But before and like now we cook because I was a mutual interest that we like doing that was like fun for us to do together because I don't like doing a lot of things.
19:19
You know, we had like fine thing, but like now we know like on the weekends we usually go try and find like a weird new recipe or something like that.
And we'll go to the grocery store doing stuff.
Like, it's just like a fun experience but like, it's just actually practicing those processes which has made it easy, but definitely would Leila said, establishing them early on was painful at times being honest.
19:37
Like hey I think you're a dick something and be like okay where does that come from?
Why did I act that way?
You know, whatever the kind of Bring it down, which means you have, to be honest to yourself, like he was like, hey, I think you're really cold sometimes.
I was like, Probably yeah.
19:56
Like thinking I love that.
I love that a lot.
I mean hey you got to be 100% honest.
20:14
All right you guys it's been another amazing episode with Tom and Ariana your hosts and lifestyle Builders and we want to extend a huge.
Thank you to you Alex and Leah for coming on and sharing your story and just a bit.
Of the behind-the-scenes with us today.
Thanks for having us.
And for the listeners, I want you guys to remember, it's your life, your business, your way.
20:33
We'll see you next time.0:00
Hey guys, love that.
You're listening to the podcast.
If you ever want to have the video version of this which usually has more effects, more visuals, more graphs, you know, drawn-out stuff, sometimes it can help hit the brain centers in different ways.
You can check out my YouTube channel, it's absolutely free.
Go check that out if that's what you are into and if not keep enjoying the show, what's up everybody?
0:20
Happy Saturday, man, I've got a good one for you today.
I am.
This is even one where I looked at Layla and I was like, IMA have to take a walk on this one.
Kind of came to me.
And I was thinking about it and it's just like, man, it's just one kind of philosophy.
0:35
So we have, we have Fike, five core, tenants at gym lunch.
I rather than go through all of them will take one of them is and its own it.
That's one of the five core tenets that we have, and if you are curious about what why you'd have those you make core tenant so that you can always reference them back for yourself and for the employees that you have.
0:58
So you can say like this is how we make decisions.
Visions, right?
And you can always look back at that and be like, this is who we are, right?
So own, it is one of them and, and this is so good.
Okay, so a lot of people get really upset about their customers who sign for a 12 month membership and then quit after three months.
1:18
Right?
Right.
And I'll hear the same people Trying to get out of franchise agreements that are five-year-long right and saying This is BS.
I haven't gotten the value.
They didn't give me what they promised, they would give me, right?
I'm being real talk.
And so one of the things that one of the ways that we've so we have honest ridiculously ridiculously like almost zero turn on our highest level groups are most expensive group we basically zero turn and if you were to tell like if you were to ask, anyone are somewhere ask us like How are you growing this?
1:54
That are you going this fast?
All the stuff is that honestly I think it's just because I'm incredibly insecure deep down and I have this huge fear of rejection and so I don't want anyone to not like me and I don't want anyone to feel like I'm not giving them what.
2:09
I what I said I was going to give them and it's like it's a serious fear of mine and probably rooted in security, but um but it's but I want.
If you can shift your perspective from thinking from Well, I just got the contract.
2:25
Were done to like we just got the contract.
Oh, shit.
Now we have to fulfill on this, right?
So, and, and this man is so, okay, so we live the way.
I see my relationship with the gym, Lord scroop.
I see it as a week-to-week.
2:42
Like, you guys are on week to week with me.
And like, unless I perform, unless I provide value, like everyone's gonna leave right now.
Obviously need to be Discerning, you need to be wise, you need To protect yourself with a contract that goes without saying obviously, right?
And you have agreements that are there, but if you ever rely on your business because of contracts, you will lose always.
3:04
Because at the end of the day, people will do what they want to do, right?
And like your, if you rely on contracts, your life will be a living hell.
Because then people are like well, if you like you trick me know that, like if you live on contracts, your life is going to be about contracts.
And how about you?
3:20
I don't want my life to be about contracts, right?
So now, You can go even deeper with this.
Okay.
So when like I married Layla, I honestly had this feeling.
We both have the conversation, like, literally the day like the night of our marriage and I was like, I was like, I was like, we can't mess this up.
3:37
I was like, this is it.
I was like, you're the one I committed to like, if anything, I was like, I was like, like I just don't, it's like if we ever have issues.
I was like we had to confront immediately.
So, because we're in this, right?
And so like, if you treat your marriage, right, you've got that contract, like I got a contract.
3:53
You gotta be with me, right?
And you treat your marriage, like you treat your customers.
I got a contract.
You have to stay here, you have to pay me, you will lose and it life will suck, right?
But if you consider as week-to-week, like I consider us day-to-day and I used to make that joke when we were dating for like, are you guys committed like in a relationship, is right before, your very eyes, like we're month to month, she hated it.
4:15
But, but the joke for me, serve the fact that like, like, you're only as good as your last paycheck, right?
You're only as good as your last And the moment you rest on your laurels, the moment you get lazy, is the moment.
Someone else who's hungrier will take you, right?
And that could be someone who's hungry who takes your wife right now.
4:33
Obviously, we have commitments.
We have shared principles that we never want to.
Like we believe in.
I don't get biblical on you, but like, like we believe when you get married, you stay married, right?
That's like that's the goal in that.
You can always make it work with anyone, right?
That's our belief.
That was one of things that we checked on each other before we got married.
4:49
Right?
But that being said, if you look at What the Bible says, right and this is just marriage but the marriage and business are so similar because you have to do the stuff sometimes, you don't want to do and got to be consistent.
I do every day.
You can't just say, hey, great job this week, and they're not say anything for two months to your customers.
5:05
Right.
Same thing with the marriage.
I can't just be like hey babe, thanks for making dinner once a month and she makes dinner every single day, right?
She crushes it.
She's awesome Layla's of freak.
She's amazing if I could run our business away.
Well, she kind of runs her business, but the point is if you're losing customers You're like all these people are flaky.
5:25
No one commits.
No one I like and you want to get into victim mindset of like the lamenting customers right there people and people will always be self-serving.
You can always count on it at a mentor tell me that.
He's like, if you always predict that people will act in their own self-interest, he's like you'll always be right?
5:48
And I've always thought about that, I was like, wow.
So you want to predict the future Act?
The way our protect them predict that they will act in their own self-interest.
Forget what they say about principles, forget what they say anything.
And so, what you want to do, if you like, which is why you should always align relationships so that how their best interest is with you, right?
6:07
So like I have to make Legacy so freaking good that their best interest is staying in paying me, right?
I'm being super real with you.
And so, if your customers right at your gym, keep leaving and you keep saying no one's like no one.
Honors their word anymore, no one doesn't he like yes, man.
6:25
Like you probably didn't honor your word, right?
Because you're no longer in their best interest anymore.
And they tell you that by leaving, right by having high turn rates, that's how they tell you that.
That's how the market tells you that you're not being good enough, right?
Hey, Mose, an Asian quick break, just to let you know.
6:43
We've been starting to post on LinkedIn and want to connect with you.
All right, so send me a connection request.
A note letting me know that you listen to the show and I will accept it.
There's anyone you think that would be should be connected with Tag them in one of my or Layla's posts and I will give you all the love in the world.
All right, so let's get back to the show.
7:01
And so, despite you despite signing the 12-month contracts about signing the 18-month contract, whatever it is, we've week-to-week live workout to workout because the real contract that they have with you is for today, and the moment that one of your employees gives them lip or says something or says something rude or doesn't show up on time or the bathroom looks like shit or the music is the same playlist.
7:25
They've heard every single time they go to your gym.
They're gonna leave.
That's it.
They'll come up with a reason.
They'll say they got busy though.
You know, like work or they're moving.
They'll come up their friends.
A doctor or nurse.
They'll get the fake note, it doesn't matter.
7:41
Someone wants to leave the relationship the leaf.
If your wife wants to cheat on you, she'll find a way, right?
So you don't want that.
So, it's like, I gotta make this so good that you don't want to look anywhere else.
You think you be crazy to look anywhere else, right?
7:57
And they'd be like, I want I want my wife to go out and like someone's like if some guys like hey, like, you know, come on up.
She's like, like, you know what I have at home like, like you're a fool.
You drive mean, if you think that that's going to get me, right?
Like your game is so low, you have no idea what I have, right?
8:15
So they see a gym advertisement for something else.
They're like, you have no idea.
My gym.
Like, you have no idea how my trainers treat me.
You have no idea how I feel when I walk into that gym every day, right?
How those people can make me feel.
And so, if you think about your relationship with your customers, as you're only as good as yesterday, you're only as good as today.
8:38
That's it.
That's all you've got.
And so, every time you have to resell them, like I sell Layla every single day on being with me every single day because I love her to death.
And I want, I want this to be awesome forever.
I do.
And I know that, I know that in order for that to happen, I can't just appreciate her once a week, I can't even appreciate.
8:58
Once a day I tell her every like every moment on baby.
I love you.
I'm like you're awesome.
You're so good as I give me an HR team so well I could never do this without you and it's true, right?
And so if you look at no, here's another one ready for it, you've got your employees.
9:14
Everybody's got their employees, every complains about there.
And put my employees don't work hard enough.
They don't care about my customers, right?
They don't care.
Well, how are you showing up as a leader?
How invested are you and them?
Do they feel like, Like my trainer left with all my customers, they left with that, they left with it because it was so bad with you that they had to look somewhere else, right?
9:36
It was so bad that they had to leave.
And so it's like how how can I make this exchange right Fair exchange?
How can I make this exchange even abundant exchange as in they get more than what they get from I give more than I get.
Right.
How can I make this an unfair advantage?
9:52
That's how you have a value discrepancy that discrepancies keep people.
People were like, people don't Chipotle because it's worth $7 people go to Chipotle because they pay Seven and they get a twenty dollar meal, that's why they go to Chipotle, that's the secret.
So I'm all about raising prices but I'm all about being ten times more valuable than my price which is three times more expensive than everyone else.
10:15
Right?
And never ever, ever, ever, ever taking it for granted, I don't take your attention for granted.
I don't take the fact that you pay us every week for granted because I know that there's always somebody who's going to come after me.
Me and try and be better than us.
And I have crazy and Security in thinking that like tomorrow we could all be over and I never want that to happen.
10:38
And so if you think about that with your customers, you will always be ahead of your competition.
Like, we're constantly innovating because I'm like, shit, everyone's going to copy my stuff, everyone's going to copy the stuff, I came up with last month, I got to make new stuff, I got to make new stuff, right?
And when you're, when I'm concentrating on my customers and I my competition right there.
10:58
Make that shit, right?
Because I want them to stay and I'm thinking, I'm only as good as my last paycheck, right?
I'm only I can only provide for Layla if I provide for you, that makes you money for real.
Anyways, so this is a walk-in talker.
11:17
I thought I would just give you a little little Saturday morning, love, as I get some fresh air and SoCal and joy.
Soak in some of the SoCal.
Whether I love you guys.
So So, you guys will have, amazing marriage.
Amazing business, amazing relationship with your customers.
11:32
Amazing released with your employees don't ever think about what you've done because they don't people.
Don't humans don't write, we don't remember what we did.
We don't remember all those things like every time, I can't tell you how many times my love, my wife is taking the trash out.
I always remember when I take it out, right?
11:49
We always remember what we do, but we forget what everyone else does.
And we forget that they forget what we did.
And we think that it's wrong that they forgot when Fact we just have to do more again today, right?
Because you can't say anything else and I can't change how they're going to think.
And so you can either lament how human beings are.
12:06
Or you can react and win and just adjust, right?
You can just adjust.
So, all you gotta do is just know that everyone's going to forget.
No one will honor their vows.
And if you think about life, that way you will never be surprised in business.
12:22
If people leave you, then take it as a sign, I'm doing something wrong, right?
If there's some, you know, Ending the marriage, take the designs to be like, she doesn't appreciate me.
Think about how I can appreciate her more, right.
How can I make things better for her?
So they what she wants to stay, right?
So she gets excited.
She like she doesn't like she's no energy and we're like, okay, cool.
12:41
Well, why do we have energy?
Why don't I make her dinner once you know what I mean?
Or what like whatever, whatever that person's Love Languages, not get too deep in it.
Like on the marriage side but like you got to fill their needs customers and employees to like especially especially since we're selling service.
12:57
Most of us are selling.
Risk.
And if you're selling service, you need to fulfill the person's needs.
Otherwise they're not going to fulfill the needs of your customers, right?
And so are you investing in them?
Do you want them to grow or you giving them the things that they need to move on and become rock stars?
13:13
So anyways, I love you guys.
I hope you guys are having an amazing, amazing day and weekend.
Hope you found this valuable, as always, thank you very much for your attention.
I know that you have many things to spend your attention and eyeballs on, and I'm honored that you decided to spend the last few minutes with me.
Me on Saturday morning.
13:30
Lots of love.
Guys, if your gym owner and you haven't joined, I promise we can help make you a bunch of money and make this business a lot easier for you.
So Me on Saturday morning.
Lots of love.
Guys, if your gym owner and you haven't joined, I promise we can help make you a bunch of money and make this business a lot easier for you.
So









0:00
Most Nation real quick.
If you are a business owner that has a big old business and wants to get to a much bigger business, going to 50 $100.
Plus, we would love to talk to you and if you like that or would like to hear more about it, go to acquisition.com, you can play anywhere on the page and talk to one of our team and see if we can help you get there.
0:17
If you can expose someone to a stimuli and get a consistent outcome, a lot of marketers and sales people like to talk about the internal thoughts at someone's house.
Like first, they need awareness and then they need blah, blah blah, and then they need.
And so they're basically just make up they reversed.
Engineer fictitious steps of someone's mental thought process.
0:33
When they have no evidence to support.
What I was thinking at all, welcome to the game.
Where we talk about it, get more customers how to make more per customer and how to keep them longer in the many failures and lessons.
We have learned along the way.
I hope you enjoy and subscribe.
I don't find it useful because it's not useful.
0:49
Like, what are the things that are useful, is your, the things that are observable that we can drive action towards that, that we create an outcome and then we have a feedback loop.
And so if we have those things, then we can move.
The variables and get closer to where we're trying to go and the feelings.
Although I recognize that they exist, they're not helpful in trying to edit what our activities are.
1:10
I would say there it is that I feel like less energized or things like that for sure.
Not about like the big picture of like I don't believe that this cause is not worthy but I do think a lot of people have that to where they're like what I'm doing is meaningless.
Right.
And then I get into, I think everything is meaningless and then we can just create whatever meaning you know we choose to because if we don't believe in a cab It'll end meaning, which a lot of people disagree with that's fine, but if you don't believe in capital and meaning, I think that's very freeing because then you can create a little and meaning for whatever you want.
1:36
And so if you believe you can then choose to architect your own life in whatever ways that you D meaningful and make the activities you do aligned with that.
Meaning the difference between capital M, meaning and little and meeting, and this is kind of like the basis of nihilism, which people have like a very negative view point around, which I'm not entirely sure about why.
1:53
But like capital and meaning means that like, this is the meaning of life period.
Like, for everyone, this The meaning of life.
Whereas, if we say that, there is no single agreed upon meaning of life, and then people say, well, then, that is your big meaning of life, and I guess you're right.
I believe that there is no, meaning, that is the thing that I that I believe and I'm like, well then that is the capital of and sure that's my capital in meaning is that there is no meaning.
2:15
What's the implication of?
That means now that we have meaning making machines in our brain, and so we get to create and Destroy meaning as we see fit.
And so, if we choose an activity, and we deem that goal meaningful, because we think it's more interesting, or it energizes us, Then we can ascribe meaning to that and do more of it.
2:32
And what's nice about not having capital and meanings that that can shift, right?
That might be good for a season and then it can shift.
I will say that the downside of not having capital M, meaning, which I consider to be religion, off-the-shelf, is that it's more difficult, because you have no one who saying here's the big box of rules, you can read it.
And then that way, you don't have to make the decisions about it, but I think it's more difficult but in ultimately more rewarding, if you have reasoning behind, why you believe what you believe, because then you have to independently come up with your own conclusions about those things.
2:58
It also makes it Mal.
Table, so that if you get new data or new evidence, then you can change your mind, which a lot of people again have difficulty with.
But like, if you change the information, then it would make sense that if it materially changes the outcome, that you the way that you believe about something should change.
3:14
And I think a lot of people identify with their beliefs, as a part of themselves, rather than, as what I prefer to call them, which is assumptions because they work the same way.
With the difference in belief in Assumption not a lot, right.
The only difference is just what we call the word and so assumptions are based on Things that we've observed in then we assume something as a result.
3:33
And so, I would say that beliefs are just assumptions and but when you call them that they become less tied to your identity, if you have an assumption, you don't say you challenge my assumption.
It's like way I challenge.
My assumption.
Oh, that's great.
I was assuming this, it must be this and then they become much more flexible and then we don't tie Ari goes into them and I think ultimately serves more people better in the long run.
3:52
I feel passionately about my viewpoint of the world mostly because I struggled and I was in so much pain for such a long period of time.
I'm only sharing. this, despite the fact that I get attacked for sharing this because there are people who this does resonate with Luke wise, you guys already know that I don't run any ads on this and I don't sell anything.
4:10
And so the only ask that I can ever have you guys that you help me, spread the words we cannot more entrepreneurs, make more money, feed their families, make better products and have better experiences for their employees and customers.
The only way we do that is if you can rate and review and share this podcast, so the single thing that I have to do is you can just leave review but they can 10 seconds or one type of the thumb to means the absolute world to me.
4:31
And more importantly, it may change the world for someone else.
When there is no required, meaning then a lot of language changes which is should must need have to like all of these things, no longer exists because there is no capital M meaning.
4:48
So I don't should have to must need to anything.
And so a lot of the expectations that we bury ourselves into that weigh us down are just implied, shoulds have to use musts and so if all of those disappeared then in a lot of ways, it's very liberating.
And so for me in business, And it allows me to take actions even though I know that I shouldn't or must not or other people would judge me for not doing it the way that they thought I should do it because there are no rules, which is why that was the preface to the book.
5:18
It's like there are no rules.
We can live our life, whatever way we want to live and that's okay.
I read a YouTube comment the other day it's like, hey, you know, you talk a lot about being sad and like, how have you been able to X, Y, and Z.
And I don't identify with being a sad person.
5:33
I think I have been said in the past.
But I also don't think that there's a problem with being sad and so I think that there's just so much power in acceptance.
It's like so many people make themselves miserable because they think that they shouldn't be who they are.
And they shouldn't feel how they feel.
5:48
And so much of the medication that gets prescribed right now is because someone's like, oh, I'm anxious.
And why do we feel like someone shouldn't be anxious?
They are human.
Why do we feel like we shouldn't feel sad?
We are human.
Why do we feel like we shouldn't feel frustrated or angry?
We are human.
And so, I think it's one of the most, like, interesting things are phenomena where if you have a line, which is the normal human, In existence and you have points above the line, and it points below the line, you have the media writer, you, the, the middle point, and people want to not feel the things below the line, and then we ascribe or label the things below the line is bad and things above line is good when all of it is.
6:20
And so, I think that if we just accept that and accept ourselves and accept the feelings that we experience as things that we experience like rain and weather and sunshine, it's not like brain is bad, not like Sunshine's, good just is I like happiness is good.
Or happiness is bad, or sadness is bad.
Or sadness, is good.
6:35
A just label it that way and I think the label was create more suffering than anything that we ever actually experienced.
So when you're sad, do you try to not be sad?
No, I actually don't think about it much.
And a lot of people spend a lot of time and effort trying to figure out how they feel because they want to then judge or label themselves, as I'm doing well, or not, well, like a lot of effort goes into shiny.
6:56
Like, how do I feel about this?
I mean, my follow-up question.
Be like, why do you care?
Why does it matter?
And that's why when you ask way long ago about, like, how to how much do you think feelings matter?
I don't think the matter at all.
Like what would the case for feelings mattering be?
Then why do you believe they exist?
It's a good question and it gets really interesting because it's like, how I experienced a feeling that I label in my head is sadness, is it the same way you experience the thing that you live?
7:20
It's like, seeing green and I see green and you see green what if all of our greens are different, right?
I mean it's it gets very interesting like that but I think that I experienced something.
And if we were to just measure it based on like brain activity and like heart rate, I would say that I become aroused in the literal sense from experiencing, what I would deem is Oceans.
7:35
And so if we were to describe it or Define the term in that way, I think I experienced emotions.
And so, I mean, I'm fairly confident, experience emotions if we were to try and measure it that way, that's how I would say.
Yes, I do experience them.
But the question is just like, how important are they?
And then it would be like for what if it's for accomplishment, not very important for Fitness.
7:52
Not very important, you know, if if we're saying how important is a motion for love, which is another emotion, right?
It becomes like a more fish, trying to go to a morphus but then you say, okay, well, for defining Of by what I'm willing to endure to continue to keep something.
8:09
Then how important is it?
Well, it depends on how much I've conditioned myself to accept this thing.
So, like, if I want to stay married, it's probably far more effective to condition someone to stay married because that is the external consequence of a good marriage as you stay together, right?
I'm just saying, like, we're just purely measuring from from external circumstances and so I think trying to measure in to find things, is what I actually geek out on and I really enjoy.
8:29
I think most people get bored to tears when I talk about the stuff, so I don't talk about it much, but that's the stuff that like, When we keep peeling back layers of like, why do you think you're able to get out of the, you know, a difficult place in your life?
Or why do you think you are able to go through these things?
A lot of it is because I believe that I will redefine terms and so we'll have some instance or something that I should do and I will redefine it.
8:53
Or I'll say, I don't should I can just accept it and that's why the biggest refrain that I have in my head.
For like, my own mental illness.
It's just like, and that's okay, period.
I don't wanna go to that thing.
That's okay.








Company0:00
Mosey Nation.
I was just on the co-creators of chrismon commands podcast over 5 million subscribers, and they had some very non business but business and money mindset questions specifically, for me, those guys are doing a few million bucks a year and felt very bored.
And so it was a half half coaching half Consulting call, and we talked about some really cool stuff.
0:19
One mindsets are on money to the difference be millionaires and billionaires and how they think about it, how to use money as a measuring stick.
The right way and ultimately how to turn in security and to motivate Ovation as fuel for the pursuit that you have both happiness wise and also wealthwise enjoy.
0:36
This is also part 1.
What I had done up to that point and up until maybe a couple years ago was I wanted to beat my father so badly at his game that he could not claim that I had not one and so every aspect of my life has been built to be impenetrable, welcome to the game, where we talk about it, get more customers how to make more per customer and how to keep them longer in the Failures and lessons.
1:00
We have learned along the way.
I hope you enjoy and subscribe.
I want to get to the live stuff.
I definitely have a lot of questions.
Just personally about what, you know, I'm confused if we should start with business earlier preferences, you do it.
Alright, let's do it here.
Okay, this is this is the burning question that I have.
1:17
I make, you know, a fraction in order of magnitude less than what you make.
But I really feel that I've solved my money problems with, with rare exception.
And so, I am.
I'm curious when I hear you talk.
Cuz you, you say all these things and I have the same experiences like I've given a lot of money for me to charity and it is felt morally, right?
1:37
But I don't feel it in the same way, like, I know it's the right thing to do, but I'm not feeling it.
So my question for you is I guess there's two big ones one.
Why continue to use money as a measuring stick?
Is it it like I, you're like, I'm gonna have a billion dollars or this, that me other thing.
1:52
Why has that remained?
And then to what are the Milestones of money or things that you've been able to spend money on that have Really increase the quality of your life and some that haven't because I'm seeing increasingly that, it seems like there's fewer and fewer things that I can spend money on that increase the quality of my life.
2:09
So that I got, well, what am I doing?
You know, I'm just gonna play video games with my friends which is sort of a complete waste of time if I'm trying to make money but his is fun while I'm doing it.
Right?
So, which we want to make money to go have fun.
So then wait what?
So let me see if I can answer the second question first because it was the one you just the marginal utility of money.
2:29
Decreases massively over time, right?
So the additional your next million dollars, makes significantly less impact on your life than your first million dollars, right?
And the first hundred thousand dollars in my opinion has but you know, 80 80 to 90% of the utility you got for my oh yeah, first undergrad, right?
And then everything after that is really, really diminishing.
2:47
In terms of its return.
There are two things that I get that I get value.
From one is I like flying private?
It's totally, it's not private.
I was gonna say first class, If the world is way better job, Steven Klein has about, forty nine, thousand dollars more per flight, so, you know, you can get it there, we're not at that level yet about.
3:10
So, I'll tell you.
So you can do it for.
It's about four to five thousand an hour.
So, if you have a three-hour flight, you're looking at 12 to 15 grand, and if you got six to eight seats on the plane, you know, if you're taking it fits, you and two or three other people, all of a sudden, it's like two or three thousand to take it.
Like, it can be, I'm not by no means, am I saying, it's like, you know, I'm just Saying that like I like it.
3:31
I do think it's a use Warren Buffett's word.
I do think it's indefensible but at some point I'm like what what?
Why even what am I accumulating more money to do right?
There's right and so it is 100% a comfort thing but what and Layla Consolidated this statement I won't talk more about private flying but she said what it did was it transformed travel from a nuisance into a positive experience and so going from economy to First Class it's still a nuisance.
3:58
It's still a pain.
Right.
It's just a little less of a pain but it's still a net negative in my opinion, flying private, I would say borders on and may actually be a positive experience because you literally just drive your car to the plane.
You walk on the plane, you've got Flay and lobster and then you get off the plane into your car and you drive to where you're going and there's no security.
4:18
There's no, there's no other, there's no babies.
There's not like there's, it's just, it's nice.
So that's the one thing that I would say and the other one is I like buying places with fuse.
So we're in a were in a Las Vegas.
Is Penthouse right now, and it's beautiful, you know, I mean, like, I look outside and I feel like I genuinely gain perspective because I see everything and I see the amount of wealth that exists in the world and I think it helps it only helped me from a perspective standpoint.
4:43
So there's the two things that I think that have been.
I would say very expensive that I have gotten actual value from.
But beyond that very, very, very little marginal utility of extra money.
The first question I think you asked, was why use money as a measuring stick?
And why do I, why do I say the billion thing?
4:59
So, I have absolute commitment to getting there and I have no emotional investment towards achievement.
I don't care.
It's more that it's kind of like Gary Vee.
He's like, I'm going to try and buy the Jets.
It doesn't really matter.
It's more just about the game and I think that it might be self-aggrandizing for me to even think this way, but I think it's probably true because I'm human.
5:19
I think that people will listen to me more if I'm a billionaire then if I'm just a hundred million are, you know, and that's probably just my own insecurities or whatever.
And I think that I think That will get their based on the math.
It would be unrealistic for me not to get there unless unless I'm massively blow something, you know what I mean somehow.
5:39
And so just on the math of just literally the pure cash.
We have not even the businesses that the capital of those generate if we just sat that in 10% when I'm 65 off a billion dollar so my do a billion dollars today will be 10 billion dollars in so you know.
Yeah, think about that.
5:54
But anyways, inflation does so sorry.
Can I can I come in?
Because I kind of want to, I want to ask this.
A simple.
It's going to sound similar but it's I'm going for something different which is so I don't know.
I'm not trying to say your exact net worth.
Let's just say you have 40 million dollars or fifty million dollars in the bank cash right now.
6:11
I've probably I'm probably closer to the mid-30s.
It depends on you, okay?
But like in investable, a 75 million years, sure what motivates you to do work, you don't enjoy or do you just not only do work that you enjoy because I could imagine having 35 million dollars in the bank.
6:29
And going, I'm only going to spend my time doing things that are fun and the second something is not fun but can make more money.
I'm just not going to do that thing because I don't need more money.
And so I'm curious.
Do you have that philosophy?
And if not, what is it that gets you to do the thing?
That?
Yeah, so this is interesting in our stressful or not.
6:45
From this is interesting, I believe that humans need challenges to enjoy life.
And so then it starts to become a my living by my values.
Because am I the type of person who, because one of my biggest fears, I remember saying this over and over again is that I never Become soft.
7:01
I never want to feel like if everything were taken from me, I could not build it again.
And so for me, I feel very sheshe, Foo-Foo whatever word you want to use for, not wanting to do certain things.
Now that being said to your question, the vast majority of my time or 100% of my time, I pretty much spend doing stuff that I find enjoyable or stimulating to a certain degree but I won't shy away from something if it's if to get to the thing, the next thing that I want to do, I have no Difficulty in attacking it, but I think.
7:32
When is it happening to the question that you have?
And this may be interesting for you, I don't know what level you guys are at business-wise, but when I talk to seven-figure entrepreneurs, right?
They're talking about tactics, they're talking about, hey, we did this order a bomb.
We did this change in headline or we'd switched in this new platform.
7:49
ITS Tactical each figure guys.
They're usually talking about processes that they're putting inside of their business, you know, they just had a million a month or mine after many months more in there, and they're like, that's what they're, that's what they're thinking about.
All the people that I know who are, and I think, I think we'll hit.
I think we'll cross 100 million in Revenue by probably end of q1 next year, maybe Q2 next year.
8:09
But the conversations that I have with all the guys that I know that are at that level and above, it's all about people.
And so I was having this conversation with a friend of mine and he was like, yeah.
All the business owners that we serve and they have a big platform.
He's like, they just always there.
Always like, how do I get more traffic?
I don't get more traffic and I we both were laughing and I was like, I would just say go hire Someone who knows how to get traffic and then if and we both cried our trip but that's kidding me.
8:35
That's how I think about stuff now.
And if I were to start a new Endeavor, I wouldn't build a business.
I would assemble a business.
And so it's like, I know we need one of these, one of these, one of these and put it together, and say, go Pursuit on my behalf.
Here's the incentive for all for everybody and and that's how the business would grow.
And if it doesn't grow, then I would swap people out until it until it was growing.
8:54
And so the thought process change, but I think you do have to go through it and maybe that's a Believer story.
I'm telling myself but It's the guys that I knew who have achieved that did go through each of the steps so that they could, they could cross check and be like, I know this guy's full of it and I know this guy knows his stuff so that you can simply make better judgments on other human beings.
9:11
With with decreasing error rate, you still have one but just fewer errors.
I want to thank you.
Want to Circle to this, because I actually really need to figure out the hiring thing, but I do have one question because I agree that people need is a weird word, but I would say thrive on challenges and the challenges are rewarding.
9:29
And fulfilling, do you find that you diversify them amongst monetizable challenges and challenges that don't make money?
Or do you focus mostly on challenges that make money because I could imagine again 35 million to the bank.
You go, I'm going to learn to play piano.
I'm going to build a homeless Center that makes no money at all in Las Vegas and I'm going to try to invent something.
9:49
I'm going to do the challenge of inventing a new way to improve solar energy and maybe I'll be a billion dollars but maybe it'll just solve global warming and I won't make any money.
I also know people who are serial entrepreneurs in everything, they do is in the pursuit of wealth.
And so I'm curious.
10:05
What, how do you pick your challenges?
I guess what, what drives you so money is not the driver.
I just love the game of business so much, I just love the game of business.
I loved and was obsessed with Fitness.
I both will State records.
I was, you know, me, like, I was in good physical competitive shape, right?
10:22
Still are saw the quads before we started, but when, as soon as I got into business, It's the love that I have for Fitness, just paled in comparison to just like how obsessed I was and how much.
I just I just love spending every hour that I could and like my free time now.
10:39
Like right now I'm going through a course on on Deal structure.
I was like, this is great, you know?
Like I'm just like, I love it.
Like I truly love it.
And so, in terms of challenges, the way that I have skinned, at the challenges, for me, at least, in my current season is pursuing bigger goals than I did before monetarily, but with massive constraints, right?
10:59
My actual like mental Target is, I'd like to do 100 million in profit a year.
So that's my that's my between all the portfolio companies, right?
That's my next Target.
And so, if I do a hundred million in profit per year, I don't want to do that as a slave.
I would like to do that as an owner advisor and working two to three days a week with them and I say work.
11:20
So for me the work is like meetings.
So that's meeting with the CEOs of the companies meeting with a handful of leadership, that's what I consider like, work work.
And then the rest of my time is Is, you know, making the YouTube stuff, writing the books, making the courses that were going to be publishing doing podcasts like this.
11:36
These are all just.
This is the, you know, I enjoyed enjoyed the Saturn.
Nice.
Yeah.
So so well, the reason is the reason I ask is because I could imagine people who are listening who who are very enviable of your life.
The fact that you are an advisor who buys businesses who has more money than almost anybody on the planet.
11:54
Like they want to get where you're getting but maybe they don't feel the same way you do when they first pick.
Entrepreneurship.
So maybe they were a great athlete, who doesn't find the business books, exciting, or whatever it is.
Maybe they're incredible musician.
Who when they try to go into the online course world.
They find it a grind.
12:11
Have you had any success with yourself with other people learning to love the game?
Or do you find that?
It's kind of like, how some people like art and some people like sports and you like it, if you like it and you don't if you don't.
So, if businesses your game, you're set up for success and if it's not, then you don't get to be Alex from Rosie.
12:28
Yeah.
So first off, I just want, like, for the audience, you even say the 35 million thing.
I literally feel pangs of insecurity that it's not that much money, just so, you know, really?
I just want, like, I just want to give her for like that.
12:43
Like, I'm like my God.
It's not over 100.
I'm such a poor person.
Finally, I hope.
No one hears this like, I was like, I can tell you the thoughts that I'm having what we're talking about this.
Wow, why I respect your self-awareness in your willingness to share that happy to tell you all the things that Just flop within me.
13:00
But the the other part which is if you don't inherently love the game, right?
So my perspective on this is shifted, which then makes it hard for me to even talk because I think about some things to say five years ago, my wish I just never said anything but then it's like then I wouldn't speak anymore and then whatever and so my view point on it is that I do think that there's a lot more luck than I used to give credit for.
13:22
And the luck is not from outside, circumstance of, like, things happening in meeting people, but more luck of the draw, the initial draw of like, what were mine.
Genetics.
What was the initial upbringing that I had were the stimuli was exposed to?
That gave me these proclivities.
Because if you think about it, from a large number standpoint, right?
With a large enough pool of people, which most people just about everybody who's within a system where the money is involved, right?
13:41
If we just if we just said only capitalist systems, sure, they're still a billion plus people are 2 billion plus people that are I guess, including India, three, you know, half the world's population is in the capitalist system of some sort, right?
And so with that many numbers, lots of people will work hard but the people who have a proclivity and Work hard and have some level of natural talents words, it will just exceed Excel better and faster.
14:05
And so, I think that everybody can be in the top 1% that I believe which means you 125 million vessel assets.
I believe everyone can do that in their life span 100% but most people don't have the character traits in the discipline to do that.
Now, is that lock?
Is that, you know, who knows?
14:21
But the question that my closest friend, dr.
Trevor Kashi.
Who's a scientist in to save your stuff all the time.
He's like Is it useful to ask the question because it's not under our control at all?
He's like so you might as well tell yourself that you do have a natural proclivity to being in business if you want to be successful in business.
14:44
Real quick guys.
If you can think about how you found this podcast, somebody probably tweeted it told you about it.
Should it on Instagram or something like that?
The only way this grows is through word of mouth and so I don't run ads, I don't do sponsorships, I don't sell anything.
I only ask is that you continue to pay it forward to whoever showed you or however you found out about this podcast that you do the exact same thing.
15:04
So if it was a review, if it was a post, if you do that, you mean the world to me and you throw some good karma out there for another entrepreneur.
My question is only, like, what do I do if that I'm just making up an example, but what do I do?
If I'm incredibly talented guitarist, who wants to start a business where I'm teaching people music?
15:23
And I've been trying for two years and it's just not working.
Hmm.
And I don't, I don't think I have that proclivity.
Can I acquire that, I guess you could.
I think you'd probably be smarter for that person to go, find someone who loves that game.
And then the only skill, you have to have is how to, how do I make have the perspective from which to make adjustment?
15:40
That this person actually is good.
And then do I have enough skill in negotiation, so I can make a favorable deal for myself.
And so, if you can do those two things, you can be Justin Bieber, who's not a business guy, but it's still extremely wealthy.
Eminem is not a business guy, still ensuring a healthy.
So I think your there's still ways to play it without necessarily having business.
15:57
Be the game which I find kind of interesting too because I'm not Kylie Jenner.
You know what I mean?
And trial he's younger than me and Wealthy than me which I'll tell you another one.
When I found out she was a billionaire and she was younger than me.
I literally like had a day where I was like I just felt like I felt Although ourselves oh no I liked it.
16:14
It was like I suck.
It's like why am I not end?
So I'm just telling you like these Securities Run Deep to get here.
Sure.
Well you know you had an Instagram post and I really appreciate this is one of the reasons I want to talk to you, your candidness.
Yeah.
Lovers an Instagram post where you said you were in text conversation with a friend and you said something to the effect of like the bigger the hole in your heart, the bigger the stuff required to fill it.
16:38
So I have millions of dollars read what you will into That I think I just I appreciate you saying it and and separately for, if you have, have you ever done anything like therapy or psychedelic medicine or anything like that and have you found it, have you found it helpful because I mean I appreciate you sharing all of your knowledge but and then when I hear those things as well, I mean dude I can I I can totally relate to that smaller number values and I guess it's some point.
17:08
I'm appreciative that the stubbornness in meek.
Quit and went, this is fucking stupid like 100,000 subscribers, a million subscribers 5 million.
There's like when I get that diamond play button at 10 million then people will see me differently and I hear that same and as his business partner and best friend in a mixed blessing.
17:29
Hi guys, it's friend.
I'm like that's great and as the business part, I'm like, remember when you had all those insecurities?
Yes, it's taking the taken, the wind out of my sails.
It's taking them to myself.
So, yeah.
Have you have you addressed it other than filling it with Success and achievement.
Have you have you have taken other ways of looking at that, that internal feeling.
17:46
Yes and how has that gone?
Like what what is what is Sue's door are out there?
I will see that.
I think time does The Sting of pain but you know, over a long enough time Horizon.
But for me I don't think pain, the pain changes when we look back on it until we understand it.
And I think that's, I think, for me defining, what the objective was for quote therapy, or self work, or whatever, simply as my I seek.
18:12
I understand and I think it becomes far less intimidating to go explore some of these things.
If you're like, I'm just I'm not, I'm not here to change anything like you're telling yourself, right?
You're like, I just want to understand it, right?
And so for me, the conclusion that I've made and candidly this is also just a story and that I might just be telling myself so hey, who knows.
18:30
But the story that I tell myself at least is that I had these massive insecurities about my father's approval, right that?
So that was the thing that was withheld for me my child Hood adulthood, I mean in for context my father called me, and he pretty much said, all the things that I had done up to, you know, every, every decision that I had made was not a good decision after I decided to Veer off the path of the job, right?
18:56
Everything after that was a bad decision and it was only when I had literally made more money than he'd ever made in his entire life that he said, You Know, You're Gonna Want to hear this and I stepped out.
It was like what I meant like dinner.
He was like, I'm sorry.
And I was like, for what he was like, you know, for For saying that you shouldn't have done this and I was like, okay, and and he was like, no, I think it was like, but for the record, he's like, if it had been 30 years ago when I was coming up, I would have been, right?
19:25
Yeah.
And I remember thinking to myself, One.
If I cared about your opinion, I wouldn't have done it.
And so I had to I'd break the sting of your approval when I was literally on my balcony, thinking about killing myself in my Consulting career, that was what was the painful enough to force me to make the change where I was like, well if the alternative is death then I can at least disappoint my father that was really what it has to come to like, it sounds ridiculous but that is what I had to and that's why you probably often hear me measure a lot of decisions against death because it helps me gain.
19:58
Perspective on what is important.
And so, for me, I was like, well, I'm guaranteed to be to be miserable forever.
And if I'm going to be miserable forever doing this, that I might as well die.
And if death is what this is then I might as well choose this and live with the disapproval.
And so I explained that and the piece that I think I delivered that I think stung, but I think the audience might appreciate was like as a, you know, that moment I was talking to my house.
20:18
You know, that moment when people get on stage and like, I just want to thank my mom and my dad for always being there and always being supportive of me.
I was like, I'm not going to say that as I because you weren't.
And so you probably hear I've always liked, I still have the anger.
That's there.
Yeah, but what I had to realize was what I had done up to that point and up until maybe a couple of years ago, was I wanted to beat my father so badly at his game that it would be that no one that he could not claim that I had not one.
20:51
And so every aspect of my life has been built to be impenetrable and so it's like I don't want to just be in shape.
I want to be so Jeff that no one says that I am not in shape.
I don't want my wife to be just a girl.
I want her to be incredibly hot.
Incredibly cool.
21:06
And fucking good at business and making money, right?
I want And I can't just make money or have a living or just being a top 1%.
Like I want, I want so much money in the real reason is because I just want everyone to leave me alone and not hurt, right?
Yeah.
Yeah, that's how I built my defenses up.
21:23
And so it was it was to be just an unheard-of all machine, but it was just because deep down, I was, right?
And so, yeah, the game that I did was to play a game that he had built for me.
And so now the question that I had to ask myself, is what game do I want to play?
21:39
And so, it's been, it's been Illuminating for me to try and redefine my own game.
And I think that for me, my, my decision acquisition.com is the first business that is spawned from my desires rather than from the games and the, the variables that were set out by, you could say, Society, dad, whatever that I had to win, right?
21:59
And so, the new games that I'm trying to play are to Die.
The person who gave Of the most.
And so those are the things that feel aligned with my values.
Not the values that I was trying to prove to other people.
Yeah, I mean I this is a your your conversation interview but I just did MDMA with my dad.
22:21
All right.
So that's like a you yeah.
Ended.
Its, it was not exactly the same.
I would say everything that I hear about you, I have like an order.
I'm it's the same for me, but an order of magnitude less, you know, but it was that competitive best thing going on and, and the Deep seeking of approval.
22:38
And, you know, he told me the same thing when I turn my business, which has And and and and understanding him it was because for him it didn't work in his in his era that wasn't how you did things.
So I totally relate and and separately will try to convince you to do MDMA.
22:55
But for now for now I actually must you want to stay on this.
I wanted to sort of talk about a little bit about the book that you've got and offers and stuff like that.
Is that did you want to stay on this pain?
No.
Go for it because I want to Circle back to business, but it feels really shallow convertible were talking about.
23:10
So I like you I'll bring up a topic.
That's a tie with how shallow you guys.
I'm happy to talk about money when you like I like I enjoyed making money and all the things about it so I'm happy to know this is this is my life man.
I love going in and out.
Like I love sitting up here and talking about like to this had this whole game is bullshit.
23:28
Like this is all silly and it doesn't matter and then fucking screaming when I'm losing it.
How do I get better at this game?
So that's, that's how I live and that's everything.
But in terms of the game, in terms of the offer, one of the like learning listening, You is if you're very pithy, you've got a lot of useful Frameworks that are helpful and one of them that as I watched a video was the, it's like an equation for what an offer is.
23:52
And I don't want to mess it up, but essentially on the top part of it, you know, better than I do.
I'll let you introduce it.
Yeah.
So I think the contribution of that book that maybe the marketing Community, our business Community as a whole like if it were summarized into one thing, you would probably be that equation which is the value equation.
And the reason that it actually came to be was because I was trying to, I was actually this came to me like three years ago.
24:13
Ross building our supplement company.
And when I was doing research on supplements, it turns out that supplements.
So there's twice as much revenue as supplements is.
There are in gems as a whole and I was like, how can that be right?
Because like, Jim's obviously help.
We more people get in shape.
I was like, but but if that works, but the market place values with the market place value.
24:32
So it was like that was kind of the data point that set me on this kind of little path to figure this out.
And so and and trying to compare, like why is this thing?
They both still have the same.
Why is this one worth more?
Why do people pay more for this than this?
And so it came with these four variables and then organize them to an equation that became a fraction which was the value equation.
24:52
So, if we're, if I think we have a video too, so people can see this, right?
So if you, if you draw a line in the middle the screen which is just the fractional line, there's the top of the equations, the numerator and over everybody's remember from grade school, right?
In the denominators of one another.
Okay, so the first part of the equation is dream outcome, which is what is the experience of transformation that a customer is going to go through that?
25:11
We are pro that rather we are promised Saying that they're going to go through, right?
And so this is more to speak that.
In general.
If you have, if I'm talking to men for example and I say I can help you make a million dollars versus I can help you be handsome.
Right, in general, most men will value making a million dollars more than being handsome and you can see that by the size of the men's Beauty Market Compares them making money market for men, right?
25:35
So, it's not that all things, but just in general, this category of items will be higher valued than this category of items.
And so that is the only purpose of this.
First one is what is the experience that we're actually going to be giving and how much value that confer to the ultimate price?
Will charge.
So, it is variable number one.
Now, if two things are the same outcome, let's say it's weight loss, right?
25:56
And I've got a nine dollar ebook and I've got a fifty thousand dollar liposuction surgery, they both have the same outcome.
Why is 150 thousand and one nine dollars because of the other three variables.
So, variable number two, now that we're talking about two two types of solutions to the same in the same vehicle, right?
26:13
Or so the same same destination, but different ways of getting there.
So number two is perceived likelihood of a achievement and to use the liposuction example, if I have two doctors, right?
And one of them has done, what has not done a surgery at they're fresh out of medical school in the other guys, done, 10,000 surgeries and they're both going to do a liposuction surgery, which of these guys would we be more likely to want to work with which of them would be?
26:38
Would we be more likely to want to pay more the tenth out?
We probably ask this guy to pay us to be his first patient, right?
And he wasn't even funnier is that of these two people?
It'll probably take this guy longer so it has nothing to do with time.
He's we're gonna get more work out of this guy's probably harder for this guy.
26:54
That is for this guy's, does it in his sleep but still our perceive likelihood of getting what we want when we buy and the important point is that it confers value to the prospect prior to the purchasing decision.
So the knowledge that this guy's done 10,000 versus the nauseous guys done, zero actually provides value.
27:13
In that can be translated, into increased pricing power to a prospect.
So when I, when you You start your business and your and you've done in 100.
Testimonials I used to joke.
I was like, oh, that because we raised our prices over time and I was like, well, that was my Hundred testimonial price.
I was like, this is my 4,000 testimonial price, because the likely that you achieve this, it would be unreasonable for you to believe that our solution will not work, right?
27:36
So those are the first also seems to be especially in the Internet.
It's almost I don't it appears exponential right when you I guess there's when you're number one in the category and and people just trust that it's you given the time as finite, especially if there's any time Liposuction doctor, he's not just charging three times.
27:52
Like he's Tashi, insane amount of money more in, his clientele are willing to pay for it and part of that is because of the, the delicate dance of desire, right?
The supply demand curve, right?
But we can get in that way.
Yeah, so number one for everybody is dream outcome with the experience was the thing that we're providing.
Number two is the perceived likelihood that the prospect believes that they believe that they will achieve it upon purchase, right.
28:13
Same thing.
If you get the nine dollar ebook, what do you think the likelihood is that?
You can lose fat in your stomach?
Probably pretty small.
You get liposuction.
Ian, what percentage likely do you think that you're going to actually lose fat on your stomach?
Pretty fucking high.
So you mentioned you mentioned testimonials is this is this the variable most influence by marketing then in terms, like if you have a sales page on the Internet, is this is that what the sales page does is it like, tries to confer certain marketing so many ways, the whole That Word of Mouth does not have for a business.
28:38
Because if you think about what just word of mouth is, if you have three friends, who read the book, write said the book was good.
I don't need to have a sales pitch for the book because you already have a perceived likelihood of achieving, a desirable result from reading.
The book.
Right, just itself.
So it fills the whole if you don't have Word of Mouth, but yes, I tell my friend to read it.
28:56
This whole just pull, just read it and you ready to get dirty silly out, that value part of the equation for them.
But yes, 100% to your point.
Yes.
For people who for a New Prospect who doesn't who you are at your marketing or messaging your sales, your stories, your positioning in the marketplace.
Overall is gonna be the thing that's going to confer the perceive like that of achievement.
29:13
So there's the top two.
Got it for us as business owners and entrepreneurs and marketers.
Our goal is to increase this the highest of our ability Right?
We want them to have a beautiful experience, a beautiful beach in Maui that they're envisioning themselves on and up very high likelihood of achievement.
If they buy this thing, they're going to get them out right now.
29:29
Come the other two parts of the equation which is the bottom half these are the detractors.
These are things that take away increased out increased risk, alright.
So the first is time to light so between one I purchased when I'm going to experience the result is.
So as a fun, anecdote for anybody, if you want to create value in the marketplace, look, whatever else is doing and provide the same thing in half the time.
29:49
Easiest way to provide value, right?
But for most people and I want to demonstrate this, right?
So if we had a weight loss example, I use weight loss, doesn't understand that if you were to click a button and by a thousand dollar thing for weight loss, and you're a guy and all of a sudden, you look down at your abs, are your stomach and there's just a six-pack there.
30:07
How unbelievably valuable would that thing?
Be wild?
Oh, yeah, right.
And if you are marketing agency, which I feel like a lot of the marketing world and lots of people have their smas or whatever it is right, if someone's signed up.
As soon as their credit card, ran their phone rings and they pick it up while they're on the phone with you, after just buying and it's like, hey, this is Marc.
30:26
I heard about your company, I just saw some your advertisements.
I'd like to, you know, I'm interested, they be like, holy crap.
And the thing is that the only thing that changed that might still happen, 60, 60 days from now.
But how much more valuable is the service or the product if it happens fast, right?
30:42
And so the goal is that time is a huge component of value fast beats free.
The reason Spotify was able to Go over, even though there is this huge rampant piracy in the market was that it was fast.
That's how they beat free.
And I've got a friend of mine who has I think I probably have 20 locations now, who created like the MVD rather than the DMV in New Mexico and so they got license to the state to provide DMV renewal Services as a private company and their whole shtick is you come in, you pay fifty dollars, you pay 50 bucks to not have to wait, that's it.
31:19
It that's the entire value prop and they kill them.
Yeah, that's TSA PreCheck.
That's all hundred percent.
It's so I'd I wish there was more of that.
It's one of the easiest value things to think of as an entrepreneur is like, how can I do this thing faster.
So, that's the third in the in the in the value equation and the fourth and final is effort and sacrifice and I didn't talk about this as much in the books.
31:38
I'll be able to give the listener.
Something that's unique here, is that effort sacrifice, I see them as two sides of the same coin.
Effort is things that a prospect has to begin doing that.
They were not doing That they do not enjoy as a result of the purchase.
So this might be, if I had a marketing agency, all of a sudden, I've got to start working leads, I have to make ads that I have to give this person.
31:59
I have to make creative, I have to have weekly meetings with the team and blah, blah blah, and all this other stuff that comes as a consequence of the purchase, right?
The flip side sacrifice are what are the things that I enjoy doing that?
I no longer am able to do as a result of the purchase and so a lot of times they're flipped out of the coin like if I'm Susie and I got to wake up early I got to go to the gym now because I'm trying to lose weight.
32:21
Well, I used to sleep in, so that's a sacrifice.
I'm no longer able to sleep in the effort is that I don't have to wake up.
So it's kind of two sides, the same thing but I like I like delineating that you because I think you think differently about things when you when you hear both sides of it.
And so the idea for us is business owners is how can I get the effort and sacrifice as close to zero as humanly possible?
32:41
Because in theory and as I've kind of evolved in the business world, I used to spend the beginning, part of my, entrepreneurial career always focused on the top side.
Always have a bigger promises figure claims.
Lots of testimonials, right?
That was it was all the marketing side of it, right?
But as I got older and we started making more money and I started observing the people who are making far more money than me.
33:01
And the companies are a much bigger.
It became realizing that the way that those guys were providing value was on the more competitively defensible side because anyone can make claims and anyone can have testimonials and Big Marketing and great copying words and stuff.
That's the easy part.
33:16
The hard part is actually having the operational.
Vantage of figuring out the way to provide the thing, faster and provide the thing without effort and sacrifice on behalf the Prospect.
And so, that's why the, in the book I took a ton of the section getting the bottom 20, which is like, in theory for us as entrepreneurs.
33:33
If we could have anything on the top side of the equation, that's positive, but the effort and sacrifice, and time delay was instant, right?
As soon as they purchased it, it was instant.
You would have an infinitely valuable product.
And if you think about like Amazon Netflix, each of these each of these Uber However, each of these companies, has this value proposition in all of the, of the effort and Amazon in there, in there, in there, re investment strategy has been on decreasing effort, and sacrificing and decreasing time to like making things faster.
34:01
Yeah, so I went as well as I'm going through this.
I was thinking of our own business and I love it when I find ways that, I don't know if it's cut, the gordian knot or like, find out.
Oh my gosh.
If I just, you know, frame it differently.
One of the things that I was coming up against at least in my head, if it's not a limiting, belief is the Physics of transformation.
34:21
And so, like, take weight loss for instance, you know, you're doing gym stuff and you can always promised 7-minute at 6-minute.
ABS, can you talk about designing a product that fulfills these like it would seem that finding an offer that did it a bigger thing, more reliably faster and more like that.
34:39
That's just hard to do so operationally and in sort of creating these products.
Like I know I know how I might love to talk about what I do, but how do I make that a thing?
What are the Is that one does in order to actually devised a product that you can realistically handle being talked about in this awesome totally.
34:56
So in the book, you know, the the sexually go over this and so hopefully it's not repented for you guys, but the audience haven't forgotten Something cover this so I think I think thinking about product Improvement is really hard because what does that mean?
Right, but just thinking about what are the problems every single problem in as nuanced details.
35:14
I possibly can about the customer experience both perceived and actual that the customers.
Going through from the from before they start to use the product all the way through the end.
And after the result are experiencing the result of the product every single micro step that occurs on that process.
35:29
How can I lubricate that?
How can I make it faster and easier for them so that when they get to that they just click cheat code and they move through right and so with services this is probably easier right but this is where great product and design comes into play is like, okay.
35:46
Well, I'm use if you have software right?
It's like how many clicks do I need to get?
Get here.
Is there a way that we can reorganize the ux so that we can do this in fewer clicks?
How can we display the information differently?
You know what I'm saying?
You're like, how can you make it?
So the effort in sacrificing trips are training their team in all of that stuff is decreased and minimized so that ultimately the experience is improved.
36:07
Hope you guys enjoy the first part of the two part interview with those guys.
Charlie and Ben are really awesome dudes.
And I think you guys will really dig.
What is coming into part two of this worry.
Dive even deeper.








0:00
Real quick.
Because you guys already know that, I don't run any ads on this and I don't sell anything.
And so, the only ask that I can ever have you guys that you help me spread the word so we can have more entrepreneurs, make more money, feed their families, make better products, and have better experiences for their employees and customers.
And the only way we do that is if you can rate and review and share this podcast, so the single thing that I have to do is you can just leave review will take you 10 seconds or one type of the thumb, mean, the absolute world to me.
0:25
And more importantly, it may change the world of someone else, if it breaks out, how I learned how to consistently.
Only generate leads independent of platforms and the key piece that I was missing in multiple different platforms, going to tell you five key stories that are my life that a massively impacted, how effective my marketing was as a result of the exchange, welcome to the game, where we talked about it, get more customers how to make more per customer and how to keep them longer in the many failures and lessons.
0:48
We have learned along the way.
I hope you enjoy and subscribe.
So a few high-level observations before I dive into this, the first thing is there's a setting in our community called, do the boring work and a lot of times we don't confront the work that we that must be done because it's not exciting or sexy and it feels somehow like it's beneath us, you know, prospecting and doing a hundred dollars a day can feel tedious, you know, posting and repurposing the same content across lots of different resources, can feel tedious, you know, reaching out to people, you know, and asking if they know someone who might be interested in your products or Services might feel tedious.
1:22
Or creating, you know, a hundred isn't add variations with different Hooks and headlines can seem tedious.
It's very easy to understand very hard to do mostly because people don't have the discipline and the work ethic to go through the board work which kind of leads to the second one here which is that there's a saying between my closest friend and I dr.
1:39
Kashi violence is the answer.
Sometimes when you have this outcome that you must achieve in your life because of the goals and insecurities that we have set upon ourselves that just being violent with the level of activity that we are doing.
Ultimately get us much closer than, you know, the nuances and the skill that sometimes we like to project and pretend matter more than just physically doing a Shear higher volume of work.
2:04
Number three is that if you do more than you are doing right now, you will get more than you currently have.
And that is a promise, and you can take that to the bank.
And number four is do what matters most first.
So right now, you probably have lots of things that, you know, fill up your day in the morning, all that kind of stuff.
But the things there are only four activities that will actually generate more business for you.
2:22
Period that is new.
All right.
Number one is reaching out to people, you know, there were two is posting to an audience that you know number three is reaching out to people who don't know 101.
And number four is is advertising, right?
There's the four, only four ways you can get new clients, right?
2:39
And so, if you're not doing one of those four things, and you're struggling to get customers, you're not doing lots of those four things as your primary activities, then that is probably one of the reasons that you don't have the amount of customers that you wish you have.
All right?
And so what I want to do is take this quick moment to introduce.
Reduce an equation that I've thought a lot about, but it's v x as X date.
2:57
So, volume tone skills have is time and this is kind of a flywheel that feeds itself and which, and I'll get to the actual like wording behind this, but essentially, the more volume you do, the better you are at and longer you do it.
The more throughput you will ultimately have the more outcome, the more clients, the more sales, the more leads you will ultimately have from doing.
3:18
All right?
So let's dive into this in a little bit more.
So in other words and this is based on Like pure foundational principles of logic, right?
The more we do the better, we get the better we did.
The more we do, because we like it because we're better at it right?
In the lumber we do something, the better we get the better, we get the longer, we do it, the longer we do it, the more of what we did compounds on itself and this is the same reason.
3:40
Why if you start doing cold out, bouncer.
Start building a pipeline starts, a compound on itself and you start doing business over a long enough period of time, they're just becomes.
This is larger and larger audience of people who know you for doing this.
Thing, right.
And I'll show you a couple examples and some of the stories examples we have today that will show you how compounding massively affected my life.
4:01
And so in this way each of these, three variables, volume skill and time feed each other but it all starts with doing.
And so these are the three we're going to focus just on volume today because I want to be mindful of your time.
And so I'll tell you a quick example of this.
So this is probably a decade ago.
4:18
I'm starting my gym, first business, I own a real business, Diane and Sometimes like I should run flyers.
I was like, okay, cool.
So I went out I did, you know, a bunch of flyers and, you know, didn't really work for me.
And so, you know, a few months later, I was talking to a friend of mine who had, you know, multiple successful locations you doing well and I was like, hey, you know, I did, he's like, you should do flyers.
4:41
I was like, nah, I did that.
It didn't work for me is like, well, you know, what was your, what was your test eyes?
And I was like test eyes.
What do you mean?
He was like well how many do you test before you?
You know?
Oh about girls like let me not put 300 out and he was like 300 like total.
4:57
And I was like well yeah, he's like I don't even test for less than five thousand Fliers and all of a sudden I was like, whoa.
He's like yeah, he's like I'll put out a hundred thousand Flyers a month he's like and I'll get a half a percent or percent back.
He's like who walk through the door?
5:13
He's like, yeah, but hundred thousand fliers of percent back.
I get 30 people a day.
Walk in my store and I was like holy cow my understanding.
Standing of the sheer volume for the activity that I thought wasn't working was just dramatically under what it really was supposed to be.
5:31
And in that moment, I had a belief broken about what volume really means.
This happens all the time and I'll tell you a couple other examples in a second, but like this happens all the time.
Even like Fitness stuff.
People are like, man, why can't he get jacks?
And I'm like, you know, why can't I grow my arms?
It's like, alright, well, how many sets of arms you do every week and they're like, why train arms twice a week.
5:50
I'm like, what are you doing?
I'm like, well, you know, like three sets ten times.
Like, is it like, for a week?
Like, so six total sets.
They're like, yeah, I'm like, well, try 12 sets, six days a week and I guarantee your arms will go out there.
Like, seriously like yeah, imagine that the more you do, the more you look like you can do.
6:07
So I'll give you a different one that I had.
This isn't it in a paid ads example, which is similar to Flyers just a different platform.
Hey guys, love that you're listening to the podcast.
If you ever want to have the video version of this, which usually has more effects, more More graphs, you know, drawn out stuff.
6:24
Sometimes it can help hit the brain centers in different ways.
You can check out my YouTube channel.
It's absolutely free.
So check that out if that's what you are into and if not keep enjoying the show, I had a an agency owner who is walking who's talking to us in within our software company and he was like, Hey, you know, my leafless Doling out.
6:43
I can't seem to scale above a certain mouth, it was like, okay, well, you know how many pieces of creative are you putting out, you know, per week.
And he was like he was he confidently answered, right?
So he was like, he's like he's like that we have on point.
He's like, we're putting out like five to ten pieces of content week and I was like per week, he's like, yeah.
7:01
And I was like div and I scrolled over I shared my screen of my creative.
Moment, it was like we're testing 30 pieces, every three days.
He's like what I was like.
Yeah, it's level of output, quantity of output.
7:17
The level of most people dramatically underestimate how much work it takes to make money, right?
The thing is, once you understand and for most people, and this is the point that I'm hoping somebody who's like housing on their first customer wants to start a new channel.
If you already have one working, is you usually need to do a lot more because yours s.
7:35
Equation, your skill level is low and you have no time that has compounded for you.
So you must compensate with extraordinary volume so that you can learn the skill.
And then begin the compounding process that will give you the throughput or outcome that you desire.
And so, a lot of times you got to do a lot more in the beginning to get the ball rolling, all right?
7:54
And when I was talking to Grant about his, his overarching content strategist, I came in, you know, how many pieces, what's the framework that you use?
And he was like brow.
And this is actually this was in a difficult.
Ahead of them this.
Not on the channel.
He's like, bro, someone trying to sell you a framework.
He's like, they're just trying to sell you something.
8:10
He's like it's about 10x and he said that it and he wasn't saying it in a pejorative way.
He meant it genuinely.
He's like, dude, he's like we just take Massive Action.
He's like we just try and be omnipresent.
He's like, look at your Instagram.
Look at my scripts, we pull him up and he's like, I'm hosting six times a day.
8:28
He's like, I'm posting 15 times a day on Twitter and she's like, you just pull up every one of them.
Compared them to mine.
He's like, he's like I'm just doing way more than you.
And I was like, man and he's been doing it for 10 years longer, right?
And so that was a huge Epiphany for me.
8:43
And then for me, I switch from one time a week. 21 times a day and here's what's crazy.
My growth organically 40 axed from a 7x increase in effort.
So there is a multiplicative effect here because sure, we did more but we got better at the doing and then the more we did, the more each of those other pieces fed one another, right?
9:04
And so again all of this Starts with the doing and taking a lot more than most people anticipate to get the result and get going.
And so this is a different Nuance on volume.
This is more level of effort, but I think it Bears mentioning because for this concept to kind of sink in, I want to hit it from a couple different angles.
9:23
So this is the number one video or at this time is one of the number one videos on the channel and I made this like a month ago and the thing is, is like, and I realized that quality most times This quantity, right?
And the thing is is but quality and quantity Trump's just quantity, right?
9:42
Or just quality.
And so this particular piece of content took me 20 hours to actually put the slide back together and then two days of travel to go film and then gone lo and behold ends up being you know the number one thing on there and to me I was like well that's not really surprising.
I spent a ton of time on this and so it was just and like I'm just saying if I get reminded of this, at all levels of the game, you know what I mean?
10:02
And so I'm making these videos because like, as I'm learning it, I'm sharing it so that hopefully it provides some value to you.
Like it just takes a lot more work than most people think like Layla.
This is 45 years ago when we were re filming an entire content portal.
So she had probably recorded God.
10:19
I don't know 70 or so videos with, you know, trainings and everything and she got down.
And she was like I don't think these are that.
Good and cheers.
And I was like, like she's like I just, I don't know.
I don't know if they're like getting the way.
I want them to be there.
Like just not as crisp and we Out there and I was like Dhoom Again, she looks at me and she was like yeah you're right because the thing is just like and I've said this before and I'll keep saying it, like your work looks on you more than you work on it.
10:47
The thing we're developing is our character because that's the Ultimate Prize that we get at the end of the race.
Right?
We can't keep this stuff than we have with us.
And so we're doing this work to become better people, right?
And so, if you do it again, it's no, it's nothing, bad about it, you're just like cool, I get more practice and doing the thing and my sis is going to get better.
11:05
In the throughput equation.
So even if you did the same in terms of volume of output, the skill on the equation, the S is going to be higher.
So you're still going to actually still get more throughput even if you do the same effort again, right?
And so, that's why the level of effort and giving a shit for lack of a better term.
11:21
And really working, like, violence is the answer doing the boring work and putting the time under the bar in to use a finis analogy is what is required and most people dramatically underestimate the volume.
All right.
And so I'm going to tell you this last one to wrap.
This prep this little piece up which is I wrote this book, right?
11:40
It took me basically like a year, right?
It it took me two weeks to write, it took me a year to edit it and right now I get DM's everyday like what is the second book coming out?
And so right now I'm on the fifth version of book to end to end.
I had a completely copy copyright at edited from a professional editor and that was version 1 and I've since Made for More version since then, but the thing is, is the difference between that level of effort is why.
12:05
Many times, I think things don't work out is that most people put, like, a 7 out of 10 effort or an 8 out of 10 effort.
And then, look at somebody, who put a 10/10 effort and, and think, well, I didn't put that much less effort in, but you don't realize the difference between 88 and attend.
Might be five times the work, but also the different scene in Aden.
12:22
It 10 might be 100 times the outcome and to the actual net outcome.
On the incremental, increase in work is still worth it.
That's what's crazy.
Is that if it takes five times, the effort to go from an 8 to a 10, Might get a hundred times, even though you needed five times more work.
12:39
And so this is one of these beliefs that I have ingrained in myself with, in how we do business.
But I'm sharing it with you because most things that most people make suck most products suck, most marketing sucks, most businesses suck, and most people suck at the things that they think they're good at, right?
12:56
And it's because they don't even know how to work, even know how to do it.
And I'll tell you this final story throughout this up when I was a legal intern in a past lifetime.
At a chemical company called Arc Emma in France, believe it or not, I work there in the legal department and this older more experienced you know senior lawyer of in the department kind of like tap I was like I'm going to go back to work and she like tap my shoulder and she was like you don't even know how to work and I was like what do you mean?
13:21
And she was like you're so young.
She's like you don't even know what work really is.
And it just hit me and it struck me like, to my quarks.
I was like, how could you tell me that?
I don't know how to work.
But here I am 10 years. 15 years later.
I think Stuff like, man, I had no idea what work even looks like, because I don't even know how to focus the way.
13:40
You know, I didn't know how to eliminate distractions.
I didn't know what it looked like to just put rep after rep, after rep after rep in to just get that thing, just right.
And the Beautiful Thing, especially when it comes to marketing stuff, is that, when you make those each of those posts, each of those outreaches, each of those calls, each of those ads that you run make, you better, they increase the S.
14:02
And so, in that way, the V, the S and the T, the I'm the skill in the time, work on each other and then yield you a higher throughput because they are multiplicative not additive and that's like the one thing that if I can drive this home is that most people just do so much less volume than they think.
14:18
Because and then they look at the vehicle that they're using.
And think, why is this not working?
When the reality was that you were not working because you did not know how much work really was required to get to where you wanted to go.
And so with that, in other words, most times you just need to do more than what you're currently doing in a lot more.
14:35
Or of it.
Okay.
So if you don't know me like I said, my name's Oxfam ozi own acquisition.com or business investors are portfolio.
Does about 85 million dollars a year and I have nothing to sell you those Nation keep rocking.








0:00
Most Nation real quick.
If you are a business owner that has a big old business and wants to get to a much bigger business, going to 50 $100.
Plus, we would love to talk to you and if you like that or would like to hear more about it, go to acquisition.com, you can play anywhere on the page and talk to one of our team and see if we can help you get there.
0:17
If you can expose someone to a stimuli and get a consistent outcome, a lot of marketers and sales people like to talk about the internal thoughts at someone's house.
Like first, they need awareness and then they need blah, blah blah, and then they need.
And so they're basically just make up they reversed.
Engineer fictitious steps of someone's mental thought process.
0:33
When they have no evidence to support.
What I was thinking at all, welcome to the game.
Where we talk about it, get more customers how to make more per customer and how to keep them longer in the many failures and lessons.
We have learned along the way.
I hope you enjoy and subscribe.
I don't find it useful because it's not useful.
0:49
Like, what are the things that are useful, is your, the things that are observable that we can drive action towards that, that we create an outcome and then we have a feedback loop.
And so if we have those things, then we can move.
The variables and get closer to where we're trying to go and the feelings.
Although I recognize that they exist, they're not helpful in trying to edit what our activities are.
1:10
I would say there it is that I feel like less energized or things like that for sure.
Not about like the big picture of like I don't believe that this cause is not worthy but I do think a lot of people have that to where they're like what I'm doing is meaningless.
Right.
And then I get into, I think everything is meaningless and then we can just create whatever meaning you know we choose to because if we don't believe in a cab It'll end meaning, which a lot of people disagree with that's fine, but if you don't believe in capital and meaning, I think that's very freeing because then you can create a little and meaning for whatever you want.
1:36
And so if you believe you can then choose to architect your own life in whatever ways that you D meaningful and make the activities you do aligned with that.
Meaning the difference between capital M, meaning and little and meeting, and this is kind of like the basis of nihilism, which people have like a very negative view point around, which I'm not entirely sure about why.
1:53
But like capital and meaning means that like, this is the meaning of life period.
Like, for everyone, this The meaning of life.
Whereas, if we say that, there is no single agreed upon meaning of life, and then people say, well, then, that is your big meaning of life, and I guess you're right.
I believe that there is no, meaning, that is the thing that I that I believe and I'm like, well then that is the capital of and sure that's my capital in meaning is that there is no meaning.
2:15
What's the implication of?
That means now that we have meaning making machines in our brain, and so we get to create and Destroy meaning as we see fit.
And so, if we choose an activity, and we deem that goal meaningful, because we think it's more interesting, or it energizes us, Then we can ascribe meaning to that and do more of it.
2:32
And what's nice about not having capital and meanings that that can shift, right?
That might be good for a season and then it can shift.
I will say that the downside of not having capital M, meaning, which I consider to be religion, off-the-shelf, is that it's more difficult, because you have no one who saying here's the big box of rules, you can read it.
And then that way, you don't have to make the decisions about it, but I think it's more difficult but in ultimately more rewarding, if you have reasoning behind, why you believe what you believe, because then you have to independently come up with your own conclusions about those things.
2:58
It also makes it Mal.
Table, so that if you get new data or new evidence, then you can change your mind, which a lot of people again have difficulty with.
But like, if you change the information, then it would make sense that if it materially changes the outcome, that you the way that you believe about something should change.
3:14
And I think a lot of people identify with their beliefs, as a part of themselves, rather than, as what I prefer to call them, which is assumptions because they work the same way.
With the difference in belief in Assumption not a lot, right.
The only difference is just what we call the word and so assumptions are based on Things that we've observed in then we assume something as a result.
3:33
And so, I would say that beliefs are just assumptions and but when you call them that they become less tied to your identity, if you have an assumption, you don't say you challenge my assumption.
It's like way I challenge.
My assumption.
Oh, that's great.
I was assuming this, it must be this and then they become much more flexible and then we don't tie Ari goes into them and I think ultimately serves more people better in the long run.
3:52
I feel passionately about my viewpoint of the world mostly because I struggled and I was in so much pain for such a long period of time.
I'm only sharing. this, despite the fact that I get attacked for sharing this because there are people who this does resonate with Luke wise, you guys already know that I don't run any ads on this and I don't sell anything.
4:10
And so the only ask that I can ever have you guys that you help me, spread the words we cannot more entrepreneurs, make more money, feed their families, make better products and have better experiences for their employees and customers.
The only way we do that is if you can rate and review and share this podcast, so the single thing that I have to do is you can just leave review but they can 10 seconds or one type of the thumb to means the absolute world to me.
4:31
And more importantly, it may change the world for someone else.
When there is no required, meaning then a lot of language changes which is should must need have to like all of these things, no longer exists because there is no capital M meaning.
4:48
So I don't should have to must need to anything.
And so a lot of the expectations that we bury ourselves into that weigh us down are just implied, shoulds have to use musts and so if all of those disappeared then in a lot of ways, it's very liberating.
And so for me in business, And it allows me to take actions even though I know that I shouldn't or must not or other people would judge me for not doing it the way that they thought I should do it because there are no rules, which is why that was the preface to the book.
5:18
It's like there are no rules.
We can live our life, whatever way we want to live and that's okay.
I read a YouTube comment the other day it's like, hey, you know, you talk a lot about being sad and like, how have you been able to X, Y, and Z.
And I don't identify with being a sad person.
5:33
I think I have been said in the past.
But I also don't think that there's a problem with being sad and so I think that there's just so much power in acceptance.
It's like so many people make themselves miserable because they think that they shouldn't be who they are.
And they shouldn't feel how they feel.
5:48
And so much of the medication that gets prescribed right now is because someone's like, oh, I'm anxious.
And why do we feel like someone shouldn't be anxious?
They are human.
Why do we feel like we shouldn't feel sad?
We are human.
Why do we feel like we shouldn't feel frustrated or angry?
We are human.
And so, I think it's one of the most, like, interesting things are phenomena where if you have a line, which is the normal human, In existence and you have points above the line, and it points below the line, you have the media writer, you, the, the middle point, and people want to not feel the things below the line, and then we ascribe or label the things below the line is bad and things above line is good when all of it is.
6:20
And so, I think that if we just accept that and accept ourselves and accept the feelings that we experience as things that we experience like rain and weather and sunshine, it's not like brain is bad, not like Sunshine's, good just is I like happiness is good.
Or happiness is bad, or sadness is bad.
Or sadness, is good.
6:35
A just label it that way and I think the label was create more suffering than anything that we ever actually experienced.
So when you're sad, do you try to not be sad?
No, I actually don't think about it much.
And a lot of people spend a lot of time and effort trying to figure out how they feel because they want to then judge or label themselves, as I'm doing well, or not, well, like a lot of effort goes into shiny.
6:56
Like, how do I feel about this?
I mean, my follow-up question.
Be like, why do you care?
Why does it matter?
And that's why when you ask way long ago about, like, how to how much do you think feelings matter?
I don't think the matter at all.
Like what would the case for feelings mattering be?
Then why do you believe they exist?
It's a good question and it gets really interesting because it's like, how I experienced a feeling that I label in my head is sadness, is it the same way you experience the thing that you live?
7:20
It's like, seeing green and I see green and you see green what if all of our greens are different, right?
I mean it's it gets very interesting like that but I think that I experienced something.
And if we were to just measure it based on like brain activity and like heart rate, I would say that I become aroused in the literal sense from experiencing, what I would deem is Oceans.
7:35
And so if we were to describe it or Define the term in that way, I think I experienced emotions.
And so, I mean, I'm fairly confident, experience emotions if we were to try and measure it that way, that's how I would say.
Yes, I do experience them.
But the question is just like, how important are they?
And then it would be like for what if it's for accomplishment, not very important for Fitness.
7:52
Not very important, you know, if if we're saying how important is a motion for love, which is another emotion, right?
It becomes like a more fish, trying to go to a morphus but then you say, okay, well, for defining Of by what I'm willing to endure to continue to keep something.
8:09
Then how important is it?
Well, it depends on how much I've conditioned myself to accept this thing.
So, like, if I want to stay married, it's probably far more effective to condition someone to stay married because that is the external consequence of a good marriage as you stay together, right?
I'm just saying, like, we're just purely measuring from from external circumstances and so I think trying to measure in to find things, is what I actually geek out on and I really enjoy.
8:29
I think most people get bored to tears when I talk about the stuff, so I don't talk about it much, but that's the stuff that like, When we keep peeling back layers of like, why do you think you're able to get out of the, you know, a difficult place in your life?
Or why do you think you are able to go through these things?
A lot of it is because I believe that I will redefine terms and so we'll have some instance or something that I should do and I will redefine it.
8:53
Or I'll say, I don't should I can just accept it and that's why the biggest refrain that I have in my head.
For like, my own mental illness.
It's just like, and that's okay, period.
I don't wanna go to that thing.
That's okay.








Company0:00
Mosey Nation.
I was just on the co-creators of chrismon commands podcast over 5 million subscribers, and they had some very non business but business and money mindset questions specifically, for me, those guys are doing a few million bucks a year and felt very bored.
And so it was a half half coaching half Consulting call, and we talked about some really cool stuff.
0:19
One mindsets are on money to the difference be millionaires and billionaires and how they think about it, how to use money as a measuring stick.
The right way and ultimately how to turn in security and to motivate Ovation as fuel for the pursuit that you have both happiness wise and also wealthwise enjoy.
0:36
This is also part 1.
What I had done up to that point and up until maybe a couple years ago was I wanted to beat my father so badly at his game that he could not claim that I had not one and so every aspect of my life has been built to be impenetrable, welcome to the game, where we talk about it, get more customers how to make more per customer and how to keep them longer in the Failures and lessons.
1:00
We have learned along the way.
I hope you enjoy and subscribe.
I want to get to the live stuff.
I definitely have a lot of questions.
Just personally about what, you know, I'm confused if we should start with business earlier preferences, you do it.
Alright, let's do it here.
Okay, this is this is the burning question that I have.
1:17
I make, you know, a fraction in order of magnitude less than what you make.
But I really feel that I've solved my money problems with, with rare exception.
And so, I am.
I'm curious when I hear you talk.
Cuz you, you say all these things and I have the same experiences like I've given a lot of money for me to charity and it is felt morally, right?
1:37
But I don't feel it in the same way, like, I know it's the right thing to do, but I'm not feeling it.
So my question for you is I guess there's two big ones one.
Why continue to use money as a measuring stick?
Is it it like I, you're like, I'm gonna have a billion dollars or this, that me other thing.
1:52
Why has that remained?
And then to what are the Milestones of money or things that you've been able to spend money on that have Really increase the quality of your life and some that haven't because I'm seeing increasingly that, it seems like there's fewer and fewer things that I can spend money on that increase the quality of my life.
2:09
So that I got, well, what am I doing?
You know, I'm just gonna play video games with my friends which is sort of a complete waste of time if I'm trying to make money but his is fun while I'm doing it.
Right?
So, which we want to make money to go have fun.
So then wait what?
So let me see if I can answer the second question first because it was the one you just the marginal utility of money.
2:29
Decreases massively over time, right?
So the additional your next million dollars, makes significantly less impact on your life than your first million dollars, right?
And the first hundred thousand dollars in my opinion has but you know, 80 80 to 90% of the utility you got for my oh yeah, first undergrad, right?
And then everything after that is really, really diminishing.
2:47
In terms of its return.
There are two things that I get that I get value.
From one is I like flying private?
It's totally, it's not private.
I was gonna say first class, If the world is way better job, Steven Klein has about, forty nine, thousand dollars more per flight, so, you know, you can get it there, we're not at that level yet about.
3:10
So, I'll tell you.
So you can do it for.
It's about four to five thousand an hour.
So, if you have a three-hour flight, you're looking at 12 to 15 grand, and if you got six to eight seats on the plane, you know, if you're taking it fits, you and two or three other people, all of a sudden, it's like two or three thousand to take it.
Like, it can be, I'm not by no means, am I saying, it's like, you know, I'm just Saying that like I like it.
3:31
I do think it's a use Warren Buffett's word.
I do think it's indefensible but at some point I'm like what what?
Why even what am I accumulating more money to do right?
There's right and so it is 100% a comfort thing but what and Layla Consolidated this statement I won't talk more about private flying but she said what it did was it transformed travel from a nuisance into a positive experience and so going from economy to First Class it's still a nuisance.
3:58
It's still a pain.
Right.
It's just a little less of a pain but it's still a net negative in my opinion, flying private, I would say borders on and may actually be a positive experience because you literally just drive your car to the plane.
You walk on the plane, you've got Flay and lobster and then you get off the plane into your car and you drive to where you're going and there's no security.
4:18
There's no, there's no other, there's no babies.
There's not like there's, it's just, it's nice.
So that's the one thing that I would say and the other one is I like buying places with fuse.
So we're in a were in a Las Vegas.
Is Penthouse right now, and it's beautiful, you know, I mean, like, I look outside and I feel like I genuinely gain perspective because I see everything and I see the amount of wealth that exists in the world and I think it helps it only helped me from a perspective standpoint.
4:43
So there's the two things that I think that have been.
I would say very expensive that I have gotten actual value from.
But beyond that very, very, very little marginal utility of extra money.
The first question I think you asked, was why use money as a measuring stick?
And why do I, why do I say the billion thing?
4:59
So, I have absolute commitment to getting there and I have no emotional investment towards achievement.
I don't care.
It's more that it's kind of like Gary Vee.
He's like, I'm going to try and buy the Jets.
It doesn't really matter.
It's more just about the game and I think that it might be self-aggrandizing for me to even think this way, but I think it's probably true because I'm human.
5:19
I think that people will listen to me more if I'm a billionaire then if I'm just a hundred million are, you know, and that's probably just my own insecurities or whatever.
And I think that I think That will get their based on the math.
It would be unrealistic for me not to get there unless unless I'm massively blow something, you know what I mean somehow.
5:39
And so just on the math of just literally the pure cash.
We have not even the businesses that the capital of those generate if we just sat that in 10% when I'm 65 off a billion dollar so my do a billion dollars today will be 10 billion dollars in so you know.
Yeah, think about that.
5:54
But anyways, inflation does so sorry.
Can I can I come in?
Because I kind of want to, I want to ask this.
A simple.
It's going to sound similar but it's I'm going for something different which is so I don't know.
I'm not trying to say your exact net worth.
Let's just say you have 40 million dollars or fifty million dollars in the bank cash right now.
6:11
I've probably I'm probably closer to the mid-30s.
It depends on you, okay?
But like in investable, a 75 million years, sure what motivates you to do work, you don't enjoy or do you just not only do work that you enjoy because I could imagine having 35 million dollars in the bank.
6:29
And going, I'm only going to spend my time doing things that are fun and the second something is not fun but can make more money.
I'm just not going to do that thing because I don't need more money.
And so I'm curious.
Do you have that philosophy?
And if not, what is it that gets you to do the thing?
That?
Yeah, so this is interesting in our stressful or not.
6:45
From this is interesting, I believe that humans need challenges to enjoy life.
And so then it starts to become a my living by my values.
Because am I the type of person who, because one of my biggest fears, I remember saying this over and over again is that I never Become soft.
7:01
I never want to feel like if everything were taken from me, I could not build it again.
And so for me, I feel very sheshe, Foo-Foo whatever word you want to use for, not wanting to do certain things.
Now that being said to your question, the vast majority of my time or 100% of my time, I pretty much spend doing stuff that I find enjoyable or stimulating to a certain degree but I won't shy away from something if it's if to get to the thing, the next thing that I want to do, I have no Difficulty in attacking it, but I think.
7:32
When is it happening to the question that you have?
And this may be interesting for you, I don't know what level you guys are at business-wise, but when I talk to seven-figure entrepreneurs, right?
They're talking about tactics, they're talking about, hey, we did this order a bomb.
We did this change in headline or we'd switched in this new platform.
7:49
ITS Tactical each figure guys.
They're usually talking about processes that they're putting inside of their business, you know, they just had a million a month or mine after many months more in there, and they're like, that's what they're, that's what they're thinking about.
All the people that I know who are, and I think, I think we'll hit.
I think we'll cross 100 million in Revenue by probably end of q1 next year, maybe Q2 next year.
8:09
But the conversations that I have with all the guys that I know that are at that level and above, it's all about people.
And so I was having this conversation with a friend of mine and he was like, yeah.
All the business owners that we serve and they have a big platform.
He's like, they just always there.
Always like, how do I get more traffic?
I don't get more traffic and I we both were laughing and I was like, I would just say go hire Someone who knows how to get traffic and then if and we both cried our trip but that's kidding me.
8:35
That's how I think about stuff now.
And if I were to start a new Endeavor, I wouldn't build a business.
I would assemble a business.
And so it's like, I know we need one of these, one of these, one of these and put it together, and say, go Pursuit on my behalf.
Here's the incentive for all for everybody and and that's how the business would grow.
And if it doesn't grow, then I would swap people out until it until it was growing.
8:54
And so the thought process change, but I think you do have to go through it and maybe that's a Believer story.
I'm telling myself but It's the guys that I knew who have achieved that did go through each of the steps so that they could, they could cross check and be like, I know this guy's full of it and I know this guy knows his stuff so that you can simply make better judgments on other human beings.
9:11
With with decreasing error rate, you still have one but just fewer errors.
I want to thank you.
Want to Circle to this, because I actually really need to figure out the hiring thing, but I do have one question because I agree that people need is a weird word, but I would say thrive on challenges and the challenges are rewarding.
9:29
And fulfilling, do you find that you diversify them amongst monetizable challenges and challenges that don't make money?
Or do you focus mostly on challenges that make money because I could imagine again 35 million to the bank.
You go, I'm going to learn to play piano.
I'm going to build a homeless Center that makes no money at all in Las Vegas and I'm going to try to invent something.
9:49
I'm going to do the challenge of inventing a new way to improve solar energy and maybe I'll be a billion dollars but maybe it'll just solve global warming and I won't make any money.
I also know people who are serial entrepreneurs in everything, they do is in the pursuit of wealth.
And so I'm curious.
10:05
What, how do you pick your challenges?
I guess what, what drives you so money is not the driver.
I just love the game of business so much, I just love the game of business.
I loved and was obsessed with Fitness.
I both will State records.
I was, you know, me, like, I was in good physical competitive shape, right?
10:22
Still are saw the quads before we started, but when, as soon as I got into business, It's the love that I have for Fitness, just paled in comparison to just like how obsessed I was and how much.
I just I just love spending every hour that I could and like my free time now.
10:39
Like right now I'm going through a course on on Deal structure.
I was like, this is great, you know?
Like I'm just like, I love it.
Like I truly love it.
And so, in terms of challenges, the way that I have skinned, at the challenges, for me, at least, in my current season is pursuing bigger goals than I did before monetarily, but with massive constraints, right?
10:59
My actual like mental Target is, I'd like to do 100 million in profit a year.
So that's my that's my between all the portfolio companies, right?
That's my next Target.
And so, if I do a hundred million in profit per year, I don't want to do that as a slave.
I would like to do that as an owner advisor and working two to three days a week with them and I say work.
11:20
So for me the work is like meetings.
So that's meeting with the CEOs of the companies meeting with a handful of leadership, that's what I consider like, work work.
And then the rest of my time is Is, you know, making the YouTube stuff, writing the books, making the courses that were going to be publishing doing podcasts like this.
11:36
These are all just.
This is the, you know, I enjoyed enjoyed the Saturn.
Nice.
Yeah.
So so well, the reason is the reason I ask is because I could imagine people who are listening who who are very enviable of your life.
The fact that you are an advisor who buys businesses who has more money than almost anybody on the planet.
11:54
Like they want to get where you're getting but maybe they don't feel the same way you do when they first pick.
Entrepreneurship.
So maybe they were a great athlete, who doesn't find the business books, exciting, or whatever it is.
Maybe they're incredible musician.
Who when they try to go into the online course world.
They find it a grind.
12:11
Have you had any success with yourself with other people learning to love the game?
Or do you find that?
It's kind of like, how some people like art and some people like sports and you like it, if you like it and you don't if you don't.
So, if businesses your game, you're set up for success and if it's not, then you don't get to be Alex from Rosie.
12:28
Yeah.
So first off, I just want, like, for the audience, you even say the 35 million thing.
I literally feel pangs of insecurity that it's not that much money, just so, you know, really?
I just want, like, I just want to give her for like that.
12:43
Like, I'm like my God.
It's not over 100.
I'm such a poor person.
Finally, I hope.
No one hears this like, I was like, I can tell you the thoughts that I'm having what we're talking about this.
Wow, why I respect your self-awareness in your willingness to share that happy to tell you all the things that Just flop within me.
13:00
But the the other part which is if you don't inherently love the game, right?
So my perspective on this is shifted, which then makes it hard for me to even talk because I think about some things to say five years ago, my wish I just never said anything but then it's like then I wouldn't speak anymore and then whatever and so my view point on it is that I do think that there's a lot more luck than I used to give credit for.
13:22
And the luck is not from outside, circumstance of, like, things happening in meeting people, but more luck of the draw, the initial draw of like, what were mine.
Genetics.
What was the initial upbringing that I had were the stimuli was exposed to?
That gave me these proclivities.
Because if you think about it, from a large number standpoint, right?
With a large enough pool of people, which most people just about everybody who's within a system where the money is involved, right?
13:41
If we just if we just said only capitalist systems, sure, they're still a billion plus people are 2 billion plus people that are I guess, including India, three, you know, half the world's population is in the capitalist system of some sort, right?
And so with that many numbers, lots of people will work hard but the people who have a proclivity and Work hard and have some level of natural talents words, it will just exceed Excel better and faster.
14:05
And so, I think that everybody can be in the top 1% that I believe which means you 125 million vessel assets.
I believe everyone can do that in their life span 100% but most people don't have the character traits in the discipline to do that.
Now, is that lock?
Is that, you know, who knows?
14:21
But the question that my closest friend, dr.
Trevor Kashi.
Who's a scientist in to save your stuff all the time.
He's like Is it useful to ask the question because it's not under our control at all?
He's like so you might as well tell yourself that you do have a natural proclivity to being in business if you want to be successful in business.
14:44
Real quick guys.
If you can think about how you found this podcast, somebody probably tweeted it told you about it.
Should it on Instagram or something like that?
The only way this grows is through word of mouth and so I don't run ads, I don't do sponsorships, I don't sell anything.
I only ask is that you continue to pay it forward to whoever showed you or however you found out about this podcast that you do the exact same thing.
15:04
So if it was a review, if it was a post, if you do that, you mean the world to me and you throw some good karma out there for another entrepreneur.
My question is only, like, what do I do if that I'm just making up an example, but what do I do?
If I'm incredibly talented guitarist, who wants to start a business where I'm teaching people music?
15:23
And I've been trying for two years and it's just not working.
Hmm.
And I don't, I don't think I have that proclivity.
Can I acquire that, I guess you could.
I think you'd probably be smarter for that person to go, find someone who loves that game.
And then the only skill, you have to have is how to, how do I make have the perspective from which to make adjustment?
15:40
That this person actually is good.
And then do I have enough skill in negotiation, so I can make a favorable deal for myself.
And so, if you can do those two things, you can be Justin Bieber, who's not a business guy, but it's still extremely wealthy.
Eminem is not a business guy, still ensuring a healthy.
So I think your there's still ways to play it without necessarily having business.
15:57
Be the game which I find kind of interesting too because I'm not Kylie Jenner.
You know what I mean?
And trial he's younger than me and Wealthy than me which I'll tell you another one.
When I found out she was a billionaire and she was younger than me.
I literally like had a day where I was like I just felt like I felt Although ourselves oh no I liked it.
16:14
It was like I suck.
It's like why am I not end?
So I'm just telling you like these Securities Run Deep to get here.
Sure.
Well you know you had an Instagram post and I really appreciate this is one of the reasons I want to talk to you, your candidness.
Yeah.
Lovers an Instagram post where you said you were in text conversation with a friend and you said something to the effect of like the bigger the hole in your heart, the bigger the stuff required to fill it.
16:38
So I have millions of dollars read what you will into That I think I just I appreciate you saying it and and separately for, if you have, have you ever done anything like therapy or psychedelic medicine or anything like that and have you found it, have you found it helpful because I mean I appreciate you sharing all of your knowledge but and then when I hear those things as well, I mean dude I can I I can totally relate to that smaller number values and I guess it's some point.
17:08
I'm appreciative that the stubbornness in meek.
Quit and went, this is fucking stupid like 100,000 subscribers, a million subscribers 5 million.
There's like when I get that diamond play button at 10 million then people will see me differently and I hear that same and as his business partner and best friend in a mixed blessing.
17:29
Hi guys, it's friend.
I'm like that's great and as the business part, I'm like, remember when you had all those insecurities?
Yes, it's taking the taken, the wind out of my sails.
It's taking them to myself.
So, yeah.
Have you have you addressed it other than filling it with Success and achievement.
Have you have you have taken other ways of looking at that, that internal feeling.
17:46
Yes and how has that gone?
Like what what is what is Sue's door are out there?
I will see that.
I think time does The Sting of pain but you know, over a long enough time Horizon.
But for me I don't think pain, the pain changes when we look back on it until we understand it.
And I think that's, I think, for me defining, what the objective was for quote therapy, or self work, or whatever, simply as my I seek.
18:12
I understand and I think it becomes far less intimidating to go explore some of these things.
If you're like, I'm just I'm not, I'm not here to change anything like you're telling yourself, right?
You're like, I just want to understand it, right?
And so for me, the conclusion that I've made and candidly this is also just a story and that I might just be telling myself so hey, who knows.
18:30
But the story that I tell myself at least is that I had these massive insecurities about my father's approval, right that?
So that was the thing that was withheld for me my child Hood adulthood, I mean in for context my father called me, and he pretty much said, all the things that I had done up to, you know, every, every decision that I had made was not a good decision after I decided to Veer off the path of the job, right?
18:56
Everything after that was a bad decision and it was only when I had literally made more money than he'd ever made in his entire life that he said, You Know, You're Gonna Want to hear this and I stepped out.
It was like what I meant like dinner.
He was like, I'm sorry.
And I was like, for what he was like, you know, for For saying that you shouldn't have done this and I was like, okay, and and he was like, no, I think it was like, but for the record, he's like, if it had been 30 years ago when I was coming up, I would have been, right?
19:25
Yeah.
And I remember thinking to myself, One.
If I cared about your opinion, I wouldn't have done it.
And so I had to I'd break the sting of your approval when I was literally on my balcony, thinking about killing myself in my Consulting career, that was what was the painful enough to force me to make the change where I was like, well if the alternative is death then I can at least disappoint my father that was really what it has to come to like, it sounds ridiculous but that is what I had to and that's why you probably often hear me measure a lot of decisions against death because it helps me gain.
19:58
Perspective on what is important.
And so, for me, I was like, well, I'm guaranteed to be to be miserable forever.
And if I'm going to be miserable forever doing this, that I might as well die.
And if death is what this is then I might as well choose this and live with the disapproval.
And so I explained that and the piece that I think I delivered that I think stung, but I think the audience might appreciate was like as a, you know, that moment I was talking to my house.
20:18
You know, that moment when people get on stage and like, I just want to thank my mom and my dad for always being there and always being supportive of me.
I was like, I'm not going to say that as I because you weren't.
And so you probably hear I've always liked, I still have the anger.
That's there.
Yeah, but what I had to realize was what I had done up to that point and up until maybe a couple of years ago, was I wanted to beat my father so badly at his game that it would be that no one that he could not claim that I had not one.
20:51
And so every aspect of my life has been built to be impenetrable and so it's like I don't want to just be in shape.
I want to be so Jeff that no one says that I am not in shape.
I don't want my wife to be just a girl.
I want her to be incredibly hot.
Incredibly cool.
21:06
And fucking good at business and making money, right?
I want And I can't just make money or have a living or just being a top 1%.
Like I want, I want so much money in the real reason is because I just want everyone to leave me alone and not hurt, right?
Yeah.
Yeah, that's how I built my defenses up.
21:23
And so it was it was to be just an unheard-of all machine, but it was just because deep down, I was, right?
And so, yeah, the game that I did was to play a game that he had built for me.
And so now the question that I had to ask myself, is what game do I want to play?
21:39
And so, it's been, it's been Illuminating for me to try and redefine my own game.
And I think that for me, my, my decision acquisition.com is the first business that is spawned from my desires rather than from the games and the, the variables that were set out by, you could say, Society, dad, whatever that I had to win, right?
21:59
And so, the new games that I'm trying to play are to Die.
The person who gave Of the most.
And so those are the things that feel aligned with my values.
Not the values that I was trying to prove to other people.
Yeah, I mean I this is a your your conversation interview but I just did MDMA with my dad.
22:21
All right.
So that's like a you yeah.
Ended.
Its, it was not exactly the same.
I would say everything that I hear about you, I have like an order.
I'm it's the same for me, but an order of magnitude less, you know, but it was that competitive best thing going on and, and the Deep seeking of approval.
22:38
And, you know, he told me the same thing when I turn my business, which has And and and and understanding him it was because for him it didn't work in his in his era that wasn't how you did things.
So I totally relate and and separately will try to convince you to do MDMA.
22:55
But for now for now I actually must you want to stay on this.
I wanted to sort of talk about a little bit about the book that you've got and offers and stuff like that.
Is that did you want to stay on this pain?
No.
Go for it because I want to Circle back to business, but it feels really shallow convertible were talking about.
23:10
So I like you I'll bring up a topic.
That's a tie with how shallow you guys.
I'm happy to talk about money when you like I like I enjoyed making money and all the things about it so I'm happy to know this is this is my life man.
I love going in and out.
Like I love sitting up here and talking about like to this had this whole game is bullshit.
23:28
Like this is all silly and it doesn't matter and then fucking screaming when I'm losing it.
How do I get better at this game?
So that's, that's how I live and that's everything.
But in terms of the game, in terms of the offer, one of the like learning listening, You is if you're very pithy, you've got a lot of useful Frameworks that are helpful and one of them that as I watched a video was the, it's like an equation for what an offer is.
23:52
And I don't want to mess it up, but essentially on the top part of it, you know, better than I do.
I'll let you introduce it.
Yeah.
So I think the contribution of that book that maybe the marketing Community, our business Community as a whole like if it were summarized into one thing, you would probably be that equation which is the value equation.
And the reason that it actually came to be was because I was trying to, I was actually this came to me like three years ago.
24:13
Ross building our supplement company.
And when I was doing research on supplements, it turns out that supplements.
So there's twice as much revenue as supplements is.
There are in gems as a whole and I was like, how can that be right?
Because like, Jim's obviously help.
We more people get in shape.
I was like, but but if that works, but the market place values with the market place value.
24:32
So it was like that was kind of the data point that set me on this kind of little path to figure this out.
And so and and trying to compare, like why is this thing?
They both still have the same.
Why is this one worth more?
Why do people pay more for this than this?
And so it came with these four variables and then organize them to an equation that became a fraction which was the value equation.
24:52
So, if we're, if I think we have a video too, so people can see this, right?
So if you, if you draw a line in the middle the screen which is just the fractional line, there's the top of the equations, the numerator and over everybody's remember from grade school, right?
In the denominators of one another.
Okay, so the first part of the equation is dream outcome, which is what is the experience of transformation that a customer is going to go through that?
25:11
We are pro that rather we are promised Saying that they're going to go through, right?
And so this is more to speak that.
In general.
If you have, if I'm talking to men for example and I say I can help you make a million dollars versus I can help you be handsome.
Right, in general, most men will value making a million dollars more than being handsome and you can see that by the size of the men's Beauty Market Compares them making money market for men, right?
25:35
So, it's not that all things, but just in general, this category of items will be higher valued than this category of items.
And so that is the only purpose of this.
First one is what is the experience that we're actually going to be giving and how much value that confer to the ultimate price?
Will charge.
So, it is variable number one.
Now, if two things are the same outcome, let's say it's weight loss, right?
25:56
And I've got a nine dollar ebook and I've got a fifty thousand dollar liposuction surgery, they both have the same outcome.
Why is 150 thousand and one nine dollars because of the other three variables.
So, variable number two, now that we're talking about two two types of solutions to the same in the same vehicle, right?
26:13
Or so the same same destination, but different ways of getting there.
So number two is perceived likelihood of a achievement and to use the liposuction example, if I have two doctors, right?
And one of them has done, what has not done a surgery at they're fresh out of medical school in the other guys, done, 10,000 surgeries and they're both going to do a liposuction surgery, which of these guys would we be more likely to want to work with which of them would be?
26:38
Would we be more likely to want to pay more the tenth out?
We probably ask this guy to pay us to be his first patient, right?
And he wasn't even funnier is that of these two people?
It'll probably take this guy longer so it has nothing to do with time.
He's we're gonna get more work out of this guy's probably harder for this guy.
26:54
That is for this guy's, does it in his sleep but still our perceive likelihood of getting what we want when we buy and the important point is that it confers value to the prospect prior to the purchasing decision.
So the knowledge that this guy's done 10,000 versus the nauseous guys done, zero actually provides value.
27:13
In that can be translated, into increased pricing power to a prospect.
So when I, when you You start your business and your and you've done in 100.
Testimonials I used to joke.
I was like, oh, that because we raised our prices over time and I was like, well, that was my Hundred testimonial price.
I was like, this is my 4,000 testimonial price, because the likely that you achieve this, it would be unreasonable for you to believe that our solution will not work, right?
27:36
So those are the first also seems to be especially in the Internet.
It's almost I don't it appears exponential right when you I guess there's when you're number one in the category and and people just trust that it's you given the time as finite, especially if there's any time Liposuction doctor, he's not just charging three times.
27:52
Like he's Tashi, insane amount of money more in, his clientele are willing to pay for it and part of that is because of the, the delicate dance of desire, right?
The supply demand curve, right?
But we can get in that way.
Yeah, so number one for everybody is dream outcome with the experience was the thing that we're providing.
Number two is the perceived likelihood that the prospect believes that they believe that they will achieve it upon purchase, right.
28:13
Same thing.
If you get the nine dollar ebook, what do you think the likelihood is that?
You can lose fat in your stomach?
Probably pretty small.
You get liposuction.
Ian, what percentage likely do you think that you're going to actually lose fat on your stomach?
Pretty fucking high.
So you mentioned you mentioned testimonials is this is this the variable most influence by marketing then in terms, like if you have a sales page on the Internet, is this is that what the sales page does is it like, tries to confer certain marketing so many ways, the whole That Word of Mouth does not have for a business.
28:38
Because if you think about what just word of mouth is, if you have three friends, who read the book, write said the book was good.
I don't need to have a sales pitch for the book because you already have a perceived likelihood of achieving, a desirable result from reading.
The book.
Right, just itself.
So it fills the whole if you don't have Word of Mouth, but yes, I tell my friend to read it.
28:56
This whole just pull, just read it and you ready to get dirty silly out, that value part of the equation for them.
But yes, 100% to your point.
Yes.
For people who for a New Prospect who doesn't who you are at your marketing or messaging your sales, your stories, your positioning in the marketplace.
Overall is gonna be the thing that's going to confer the perceive like that of achievement.
29:13
So there's the top two.
Got it for us as business owners and entrepreneurs and marketers.
Our goal is to increase this the highest of our ability Right?
We want them to have a beautiful experience, a beautiful beach in Maui that they're envisioning themselves on and up very high likelihood of achievement.
If they buy this thing, they're going to get them out right now.
29:29
Come the other two parts of the equation which is the bottom half these are the detractors.
These are things that take away increased out increased risk, alright.
So the first is time to light so between one I purchased when I'm going to experience the result is.
So as a fun, anecdote for anybody, if you want to create value in the marketplace, look, whatever else is doing and provide the same thing in half the time.
29:49
Easiest way to provide value, right?
But for most people and I want to demonstrate this, right?
So if we had a weight loss example, I use weight loss, doesn't understand that if you were to click a button and by a thousand dollar thing for weight loss, and you're a guy and all of a sudden, you look down at your abs, are your stomach and there's just a six-pack there.
30:07
How unbelievably valuable would that thing?
Be wild?
Oh, yeah, right.
And if you are marketing agency, which I feel like a lot of the marketing world and lots of people have their smas or whatever it is right, if someone's signed up.
As soon as their credit card, ran their phone rings and they pick it up while they're on the phone with you, after just buying and it's like, hey, this is Marc.
30:26
I heard about your company, I just saw some your advertisements.
I'd like to, you know, I'm interested, they be like, holy crap.
And the thing is that the only thing that changed that might still happen, 60, 60 days from now.
But how much more valuable is the service or the product if it happens fast, right?
30:42
And so the goal is that time is a huge component of value fast beats free.
The reason Spotify was able to Go over, even though there is this huge rampant piracy in the market was that it was fast.
That's how they beat free.
And I've got a friend of mine who has I think I probably have 20 locations now, who created like the MVD rather than the DMV in New Mexico and so they got license to the state to provide DMV renewal Services as a private company and their whole shtick is you come in, you pay fifty dollars, you pay 50 bucks to not have to wait, that's it.
31:19
It that's the entire value prop and they kill them.
Yeah, that's TSA PreCheck.
That's all hundred percent.
It's so I'd I wish there was more of that.
It's one of the easiest value things to think of as an entrepreneur is like, how can I do this thing faster.
So, that's the third in the in the in the value equation and the fourth and final is effort and sacrifice and I didn't talk about this as much in the books.
31:38
I'll be able to give the listener.
Something that's unique here, is that effort sacrifice, I see them as two sides of the same coin.
Effort is things that a prospect has to begin doing that.
They were not doing That they do not enjoy as a result of the purchase.
So this might be, if I had a marketing agency, all of a sudden, I've got to start working leads, I have to make ads that I have to give this person.
31:59
I have to make creative, I have to have weekly meetings with the team and blah, blah blah, and all this other stuff that comes as a consequence of the purchase, right?
The flip side sacrifice are what are the things that I enjoy doing that?
I no longer am able to do as a result of the purchase and so a lot of times they're flipped out of the coin like if I'm Susie and I got to wake up early I got to go to the gym now because I'm trying to lose weight.
32:21
Well, I used to sleep in, so that's a sacrifice.
I'm no longer able to sleep in the effort is that I don't have to wake up.
So it's kind of two sides, the same thing but I like I like delineating that you because I think you think differently about things when you when you hear both sides of it.
And so the idea for us is business owners is how can I get the effort and sacrifice as close to zero as humanly possible?
32:41
Because in theory and as I've kind of evolved in the business world, I used to spend the beginning, part of my, entrepreneurial career always focused on the top side.
Always have a bigger promises figure claims.
Lots of testimonials, right?
That was it was all the marketing side of it, right?
But as I got older and we started making more money and I started observing the people who are making far more money than me.
33:01
And the companies are a much bigger.
It became realizing that the way that those guys were providing value was on the more competitively defensible side because anyone can make claims and anyone can have testimonials and Big Marketing and great copying words and stuff.
That's the easy part.
33:16
The hard part is actually having the operational.
Vantage of figuring out the way to provide the thing, faster and provide the thing without effort and sacrifice on behalf the Prospect.
And so, that's why the, in the book I took a ton of the section getting the bottom 20, which is like, in theory for us as entrepreneurs.
33:33
If we could have anything on the top side of the equation, that's positive, but the effort and sacrifice, and time delay was instant, right?
As soon as they purchased it, it was instant.
You would have an infinitely valuable product.
And if you think about like Amazon Netflix, each of these each of these Uber However, each of these companies, has this value proposition in all of the, of the effort and Amazon in there, in there, in there, re investment strategy has been on decreasing effort, and sacrificing and decreasing time to like making things faster.
34:01
Yeah, so I went as well as I'm going through this.
I was thinking of our own business and I love it when I find ways that, I don't know if it's cut, the gordian knot or like, find out.
Oh my gosh.
If I just, you know, frame it differently.
One of the things that I was coming up against at least in my head, if it's not a limiting, belief is the Physics of transformation.
34:21
And so, like, take weight loss for instance, you know, you're doing gym stuff and you can always promised 7-minute at 6-minute.
ABS, can you talk about designing a product that fulfills these like it would seem that finding an offer that did it a bigger thing, more reliably faster and more like that.
34:39
That's just hard to do so operationally and in sort of creating these products.
Like I know I know how I might love to talk about what I do, but how do I make that a thing?
What are the Is that one does in order to actually devised a product that you can realistically handle being talked about in this awesome totally.
34:56
So in the book, you know, the the sexually go over this and so hopefully it's not repented for you guys, but the audience haven't forgotten Something cover this so I think I think thinking about product Improvement is really hard because what does that mean?
Right, but just thinking about what are the problems every single problem in as nuanced details.
35:14
I possibly can about the customer experience both perceived and actual that the customers.
Going through from the from before they start to use the product all the way through the end.
And after the result are experiencing the result of the product every single micro step that occurs on that process.
35:29
How can I lubricate that?
How can I make it faster and easier for them so that when they get to that they just click cheat code and they move through right and so with services this is probably easier right but this is where great product and design comes into play is like, okay.
35:46
Well, I'm use if you have software right?
It's like how many clicks do I need to get?
Get here.
Is there a way that we can reorganize the ux so that we can do this in fewer clicks?
How can we display the information differently?
You know what I'm saying?
You're like, how can you make it?
So the effort in sacrificing trips are training their team in all of that stuff is decreased and minimized so that ultimately the experience is improved.
36:07
Hope you guys enjoy the first part of the two part interview with those guys.
Charlie and Ben are really awesome dudes.
And I think you guys will really dig.
What is coming into part two of this worry.
Dive even deeper.








0:0:0:0:00:00
Hey guys, real quick.
So Leyland are definitely working on our social media presence.
If you guys haven't noticed and we're just breaking now into LinkedIn.
All right.
It's not as bad as I thought it's actually pretty awesome so far and you guys have been really cool in there and people are sharing our stuff a lot.
So if we aren't connected on LinkedIn, it go ahead and let's connect, and let's rock and roll.
0:17
Good morning everyone.
I hope you guys are having an awesome day.
So far may I had this, I woke up with this and I was like I'm gonna have to share this one.
So yesterday I had the privilege.
Age of chatting with.
An old friend from high school, he reached out and was like, Hey, you know, we had probably talked since high school so it's been like 10 years.
0:38
How's it going?
Just caught up and whatnot, but he's reaching out about entrepreneurial stuff.
So you got his own business and it seems some of the things that we had in kind of wanted a sounding board and saw that guy.
Sure.
And I thought it was there were, there were some things that were covered that were so Central to a lot of the things that people in this group.
1:01
About in trouble with that.
I was like, well, you know what, this is too good, not to make a video about.
So first thing is, from an outside standpoint.
He was in a partnership that made no sense meaning, if you'd both are doing the exact same thing in a business, there's really no point for you guys, but if you have the same skill set and all you're doing is dividing up work, there's no point in being in a partnership because it will come to a head because at some point you will be able to pay someone to do what the other person is doing.
1:31
And then you will resent that person for taking caffeine from the business rather than just paying the hourly rate that you would have paid that person.
I've walked a bunch of interim owners out of Partnerships.
It's just because it doesn't make sense and eventually it does come to a head.
And so that was the first thing that I was like, hey, here's a red flag.
1:49
This doesn't make a lot of sense.
Second thing was that he had one aspect of his business that was like a cash cow but he had three or four other things.
Under the same kind of roof of his business that were potential, you know, big ones later, maybe opportunities, that kind of thing.
2:11
And so the first thing I said, was forget about all that other stuff.
Keep doing the one thing that's making you money and do more of that because the end of the day, you can have a hundred million dollar business.
It doesn't one thing, there's this fallacy that we have is entrepreneurs when we start out and we think, oh, I need to have a lot of Specs to my business like, no, you don't if anything that's just like a common trait of people who are starting out in business, is thinking Mighty I did this tip.
2:39
So I'm not saying like I'm not trying to be on a pedestal here until like I did this for a long time and I try to Russell and I've had conversations about this.
Yeah.
And one point I think he said he had like eight businesses and he could not pass this Revenue level until you got rid of everything and had one, right?
2:57
One focus.
And so, like this is for all of you guys who were like Oh, maybe I'll start an online business with my gym business.
Don't do that.
That's a second business.
It s Focus do not do that.
Both will go down.
All right, like it doesn't work that way.
That's like some fallacy that like the world tells us about how business works, right?
3:16
One business, one Focus.
All right, like he was in the Contracting world and whatnot and so he's like, roofs are our cash business or cash cow, but we have some general contracting work.
We do some, you know, remodeling stuff.
We're trying to do some like real estate deals and it's just like You can have 100, you a billion-dollar roofing business, just Roofing.
3:35
It's all unique, right?
And if you're this big and you're just starting out.
Why would you have four different emphasis like, don't be a master of nothing, right?
Like, one focus is already enough to have to build beautiful processes around hiding to generate leads, how you nurture, how do you sell heading into the Fulfillment of the teams.
3:51
Have amazing customer service, and then having to get them to give you referrals and get more business from that person, right?
So that was the second piece of advice is.
I was like hey, Take all your focus away, focus on one thing and do it really, really well, right?
That can, that can lead you to, as much money as you want, you don't need more businesses to make you more money.
4:12
If anything, they will take more attention from you and you will make less money.
Third thing is something he said, and he said, I want.
He's like, I just, I just want to get this business so that it, you know, it kind of runs without me and makes money, you know, without me, without me being there.
4:30
And so I told him I was like, Hey total, pipe dream, never gonna happen.
And so it's, I mean, think about this how many people have heard like?
Yeah.
Like like I just want my business to run itself that never happens like, No, real.
4:47
Like think about Jeff Bezos, right?
Most successful entrepreneur right now of all time you think he doesn't work.
Think like, you know, he doesn't go to Amazon every day and think about Amazon stuff all day long, every single day, right?
I think, Steve Jobs, I think about Apple all day long, every single day, right?
5:02
So, it depends on what you're trying to do with your life.
You don't mean, like, you want to leave a legacy or and like, you want to build a business that lasts or you want to have like a, you know, a short-term like sort of trick that makes you money for a little bit and then it goes away.
Because the in a day, like, I asked him, I was like, what you gonna do like, with this free time that you now have, because your business is making money on autopilot?
5:24
What do you do?
Sit on the beach for like, two days and you get sick of it and you get back into it because like, that's how I am.
Are we want to do stuff?
And so, it's this lie that were telling ourselves.
Then we feel like we're, we're failing at business because we're working, you don't have me like, like, it's just, it's this internet marketing, dream of like, look, it's me at the beach, but I spent 10 hours running and split testing ads to show you.
5:49
This ad of me on the beach to pretend to have a lifestyle that doesn't even exist.
Right?
You've heard me say, the business is like a garden, not a machine and it's true.
You got to water it.
You don't have to necessarily be there all the time, but you got to work on it and it's still going to be in your head, right?
6:07
So seldom get rid of that of that dream.
And the last thing was he was like, you know, what should I do?
What should I focus on, right?
And so I was like, listen, right now, you have, you have something you're good at, you're good at, you know, you're good at making roofs, but five core functions, right?
6:27
You don't have any way of generating leads, that's consistent.
You don't have a nurture process, you don't really have a sales process, you have to film it and you have a little bit of referral, right?
That's your business right now.
You have a little bit here these last two and none of these.
I was like, so you should be going all in on these first three.
6:44
How do I generate leads?
How do I generate increase?
What's the process of getting them to take a nap?
I meant with me and then how do I get them to take me over any other roofing company, right?
Which is the sales process.
And so I remember when I was talking with this, he's like, Man, Billy, how much, how much time did you dedicate to learning this?
7:02
And I should, I should be like, all the time.
All of it.
All of it.
And I don't know how it came up or how we transition from that statement to.
He was like yeah man, I mean I do like to party.
I like to, you know, have fun and and I was like, that's awesome.
7:19
I was like, but you're not gonna beat me right?
And by me, I'm not saying me I'm saying like that other guy who's also trying to make his money in Roofing and doesn't right.
Like, I remember two years ago, I wrote down every single thing I was willing to give up in order to win.
7:37
In.
And I was like if I'm willing to give up more, I will win more period, right?
And there was this interviewer, I cameras name who interviewed like 25 hundred gold medal athletes and she's trying to find character traits that that they, you know, that they and they embodied, right?
8:00
And one of them was obviously that they saw, you know, failure is a part of success in terms from a learning standpoint that like they needed to do repetition.
Like that was one of the main things that they believe which makes That's right, most Nation real quick.
If you are a business owner that has a big old business and wants to get to a much bigger business, going to fifty hundred dollars.
8:20
Plus we would love to talk to you and if you like that or like to hear more about it, go to acquisition.com, you can fly anywhere on the page and talk to one of our team and see if we can help you get there.
One of the other ones and the one that I found really, really interesting.
8:36
Was that Winners the greatest of all time, don't care much about winning.
They hate losing.
And so, a lot of people think, like, oh, the best guy in the world, you just must be addicted to winning.
It's like, no, they're not.
8:51
Because when they step on the field, they expect to win.
They're like, like it's almost a relief to win because they knew they were going to win, because they're more prepared than everyone else.
Was there willing to give up more than everyone else was Because they hated the alternative so much.
And so, I don't know why that really resonated a lot with me because like, maybe it does with you man.
9:12
I just hate losing, you know, like like and I think about that every day and like, every time I would, you know, like, you know, for go going out and, and you know what, and right now, I remember you said I used to think of myself, when I had, when I wasn't married and I had no kids.
9:28
It was just me and the gym and submit me this speak to somebody.
But I always used to think To myself, when I would stay in on a Friday night or I'd be reading all day Saturday, or reading all day Sunday, and, like, trying stuff, you don't know me and like, literally working every single day.
Well, as I was like every day, my competition is spending time with their kids.
9:44
Every day that there's time with their wife, I was like, I'm winning.
I was like, I'm getting ahead.
I'm getting ahead and I'm learning right every single day that they rest, I will beat them, right.
I used to think that way and still got to do think that way, but now I have a wife who works with me.
So as we work twice as hard, we don't have any kids.
10:01
So But anyways, he asked something about like, sickle, how long, you know, like how hard how basically, the muscles, like, how hard you work, you know now and then then you know, and I don't know if I talk a lot about like the beginning days of, when we open the gym and by we, I mean me, but like I slept on the floor for the first nine months, and I taught every single session I had no employees.
10:30
I didn't know, I didn't know.
We're supposed to have employees.
I just need you to open a business.
You did everything.
And so like, I would train eight sessions a day, and then I would do the marketing and I'd be making the calls, and that be setting the appointments.
And then, I would meet with the appointment to 8:00 9:00 10:00, and I would just convince them to, please come to my sketchy warehouse at 8:00 9:00 10:00 at night, and then I'll do my sales consultations then.
10:53
And then after that, I would do the billing for the evening and I would take me another hour and a half, and then at that point sometime in there, I would try to go out and get food, which would usually just be In and out, which I had at the beginning.
Like, that was my dinner every day.
And, and people say, like, oh, I slept like four hours every night.
11:10
Like I legitimately slept for hours every night for about nine months.
And like, there's a level of fatigue, that some of you guys know that, I know.
And that, I think that only some people in the fitness industry can understand, which is, it's a fatigue that's in your bones.
That a good night's sleep.
Can't fix right?
11:27
Like I was so tired, like all the time.
Like I can lean against the wall and fall asleep in seconds and I used to think Think to myself, when people would say, like man, I've got sleeping problems.
I'm like, you do not work hard enough, like you not work hard enough and I think what I've made up for, I did not work smart.
11:44
When I started out, I worked hard.
I worked really hard.
I did not work smart and I make up for a lot of the We get a lot more effective now, I don't work as hard as I did.
I just work a lot smarter.
I would say probably I work about 70% as hard as I did but probably like five times smarter than I used to.
12:07
So that's really what it's going to come down to in the end.
Anyways, for you is how valuable your time can become, how skilled you can become.
And that's where a lot of the hard work came in the beginning, is that I had to work hard to work smarter.
And so the things, they're, they're interrelated, right?
Like if you're like, man, I'm working all the time and I feel like I'm not making for this because you're not working smart enough.
12:26
Like you're working hard enough.
That's what's keeping you breathing.
Keeping your head above water, but you have to learn.
And so So to go full circle, he was like, man, I kind of like the party and I was like, that's cool.
I was like, entrepreneurship isn't for everyone, right?
Like you have a choice and it's totally fine.
If you like that, you know what I mean?
12:43
But like, if you were in start-up mode right now and you're struggling or you're not sure where like, where this is going like Something's Gotta Give, right?
And like, it's either going to be the business, or it's going to be your trade-off, right?
13:02
Your sacrifice that you pay in order to get that business that you want.
Now later, maybe it's open.
We don't drink and it has a lot of people think it's a religious thing.
It's not, it's actually a business thing.
We don't drink because I can't afford to have a day.
13:19
I'm not 100% the next morning.
And I like to do things in excess so if I start them and keep going.
And so I don't drink because I know what one day of my productivity is worth and then when I look at that price, tag on the Beverages and on that night, I'm like I would never pay that that price tag of that day of work just to go out.
13:42
It's not worth it to me.
But now thing is it may be worth it to some people and that's cool, right?
But the thing is, is that like, success doesn't care, right?
The market does not, Hear what your idea of work-life balance.
Has, it does not care.
It doesn't write it only cares about how good you are.
13:59
And so, like, there are some real realities that you have to face at some point, which is like how fast I want to get good.
Right, how willing am I to sacrifice things in order to win?
Right.
And for me, I am far, more driven by not losing and not being ashamed and embarrassed then I'm by winning straight up in when I Was in high school and college and the first two years after college.
14:26
Well, and Middle School.
Obviously my my major motivator but did not make my dad ashamed of me, right?
I didn't want to disappoint my dad.
That was my big motivator.
I got over that when I told him that I didn't want to do my good job, and I wanted to start a gym with all of this education that I had, and he was, super excited about that.
14:45
He's not, he was not to come like five years until later.
He was like, okay, I think it was a good idea, five years, right?
And so you end up like learning to get over that kind of stuff.
But but for me, it was always fear failure.
And if anything, if I was going to go ahead and forego that that Advice that my dad had given me.
15:06
Don't do this.
You should stick the course that you have.
You got a nice job, like you've got to, you've got a path ahead of you and you do this for two years to get your MBA blah blah, right?
I had this path and I was like, Well, damned.
If I'm gonna get proven wrong right?
15:22
Well damned if I'm gonna lose right, and, and be wrong and have to come back home with my tail between my legs.
And so that was the that was the hard place that I was like never like never like I will never let that happen, right?
And so when you have something that's in light of those decisions and some of you guys that's like, never will, I have to move my kids out of my house because I can't afford them?
15:43
Can I can't afford the mortgage, right?
Never will.
I be able to not be able to pay for groceries or whatever that thing is?
Is for you, use it and put your blinders on focus on one business, make smart decisions.
And I'm sure in terms of whether or not you should have a partner and just get better.
16:02
Because at the end of the day, until you learn to become a million, multi-million eight-figure nine-figure 10, figure, whatever, that type of business owner.
Like we all have the same hours in the day.
And so the only thing that that differentiates What we get done is our level of skill and so if you are like man I don't know how to make money it's because this is a skill that you don't have yet and so you have to go all-in on acquiring that skill so that you can have what you want, right?
16:31
Be do have I'm sure some of you guys have heard that you have to be the type of person who can do the types of things that can make the kind of money that you want.
So you can have what you want, right?
That's how it works.
Like so everyone's dreaming the rest of the world's dreaming, entrepreneurs, invest in them, so they can get the skills they want and in the beginning.
16:48
Saying you have to work hard to, then, we able to work smarter later.
So anyways, hope you guys enjoy this.
I've a lot for you guys.
Hope this, you guys have an amazing day today.
Friday, I've happy Friday.
Just yeah.
17:05
We we do our weekend's anyways, happy Friday.
Lots of love, guys.
If you're new to the group, welcome, I appreciate you.
And connect with all the other guys, in the group, if you are a gym owner, helping turn your gym around is literally what we do.
I'm pretty sure, I'm pretty sure I'm positive that we are by far, the biggest Any in the u.s. / world that I know and it's because we're pretty good at what we do.
17:28
So I'd like to help you if you are on the fence don't be there's like nine billion testimonials in here.
And at one point you'll have to ask yourself at what point is my disbelief more unreasonable than believing that this could be happening?
This could happen for me.
17:44
So, anyways, lots of guys









00000000000:00
Real quick.
Because you guys already know that, I don't run any ads on this and I don't sell anything.
And so, the only ask that I can ever have you guys that you help me spread the word so we can have more entrepreneurs, make more money, feed their families, make better products, and have better experiences for their employees and customers.
And the only way we do that is if you can rate and review and share this podcast, so the single thing that I have to do is you can just leave review will take you 10 seconds or one type of the thumb, mean, the absolute world to me.
0:25
And more importantly, it may change the world of someone else.
Hey, what's going on everybody?
Happy.
Yeah, happy Monday.
I hope you guys have an amazing amazing day.
I'll show to make a quick video for you because this was on my heart and was on my mind and I was like, man, I got to share this with you guys because if any of you guys have gone through this then I want to, I wish I wish someone had said this to me when I was going through it.
0:50
So for those of you who are new to this group, welcome and I have a lot of people in our group were like, man, how do I recreate the same tribe of, like, Evangelical people who are like, so like bought into, you know, a movement, right?
1:07
And that's kind of what Jim words is.
It is definitely a movement.
Definitely, and, and we have a term called sin.
Moments, which is it's a moment where something that you've heard over and over and over again, in the past becomes real for you.
So it's not that it's new advice but it's something that old advice that becomes real.
1:26
And so a lot of times I don't advise is correct, you just, it just wasn't real for you that moment, right?
And so, one piece of advice, that I know was a cinch moment for me, was Tony.
Robbins says, you have to follow up a shift to be madly in love with your customers, right?
You have to be incredibly passionate about the people that you serve, right?
1:43
Because then you'll do anything for them in your work all day because you really want to solve their problems which and I feel not anxiety.
I feel I feel like it's unfair Advantage for me.
Is that like I love gym owners?
Because like I'm a gym owner, I'm serving my people like all day long.
1:59
I think about how can I solve more problems for your mother's?
Like, how can I make gym owners more money?
You know what I'm like.
Bottleneck is automated lead nature solved it.
Next one's bottleneck is sales great.
We have our sales presentation after that.
We have.
How do I get everyone to ascend?
Awesome.
We have our whole abandoned.
Oops, you don't like all of these things are being soft.
2:15
So I can like continue to solve problems and like, I love it, right?
I dig it.
You guys can feel that little and most people like, well, how can I do that in my business?
And here's the reality, most of the people that I talked to her in the gym business, and this might be you don't care about weight loss.
2:34
You don't care about transforming lives.
What I'm going to say right now may be controversial.
But it'll be true.
That's okay.
And here's why.
I didn't, I I've never been fat.
2:53
I've had a six-pack of the whole life and money to started coming to me from Fitness because people are like, well, how do I become like you?
Right.
And so I was good at training, you know?
I mean I I knew I knew what I was doing and so I can people results and then that's, you know, that's how it worked, right?
3:08
The business group.
And a lot of you guys are in the same boat where you're like, maybe you were passionate about it at one time because you went through a transformation.
But a decade later, Later, you're not really passionate about helping people, like get to the gym, you know, like ah man, sues you mr.
3:23
Work out again.
Like let's let's get motivated for her, right?
Like she cheated again on the weekend, like come on.
Like you can do this, right?
And so maybe this is real, for some of you guys but you're like, man, I'm just not that in love with my customer and so, here are the auctions, right?
3:40
Let's be real.
Here are the options.
You can either close your business.
One two, you can find an avatar that you love.
So for me, I would say, the only Avatar that I really, really was passionate about in the fitness space is getting skinny guy, is jacked, I love that.
3:56
I've got a bunch of testimonies around that and if I went back in time, I probably would have started my Gmail way.
I think that's what I would have done.
And I have an entire like Jim model concept around getting guys.
He needed you act and it probably really crushed it.
I don't know.
I talk to you later about it.
4:12
I'm like after this, I was like, I kind of went over another gym.
But anyway, she wouldn't let me do it.
Yeah, maybe I don't, who knows, but that's besides the point the point is where you're at right now and so if you're like man I've got all these people that if you're like, man, I love transforming lives.
I love I love the impact, I get so excited about it.
4:28
Like I get emotional like seeing these women get control their lives and get confidence again if that's you amazing, you're awesome.
You can turn the video.
But if this not you right in your like I used to be passionate about it.
Not as much anymore or maybe like, or maybe just never work like me.
4:44
Right?
And like you just kind of got it.
You fell into this business.
Here's here's the here's the tentative solution, right?
You need to be exceptional at business and you need to position in your mind.
4:59
You're like, okay, I'm not passion about these customers but I am passionate about being exceptional, right?
I want to be amazing, whatever I do.
And so that means that like I need to be patched about running an exceptional business and being exceptional business owner, right?
And so that means that I'm obsessive about looking at our service looking at the product that we put out like, putting process in place.
5:20
So it's repeatable.
So the scalable and so that we can have a consistent.
Liver will every single time that's exceptional, right?
The people get passionate about and here's here's here's where I'm going to.
I'm going to take this and here's a little story to kind of bring this up.
Hey, guys, real quick.
If you're new to the podcast, I've a book on Amazon called 100 million-dollar offers that over eight thousand five star reviews.
5:41
It has almost a perfect score.
You can get it for 99 cents on Kindle.
The reason I bring it up is that I put over 1,000 hours in the writing that book and it's my biggest gift to our community.
So it's my very Shameless way of trying to get you to like me more.
And ultimately make more dollars to that later on in your business career I push the partner with you so that's my give go check it out Amazon and back to the show.
6:03
So friend of mine done Tran.
He's a he's an Orange County, personal trainer and he his cookie store, so he's frustrated, well, good business guy and he opened a human a bakery and I'm hopefully I'm not, I'm not selling his game.
6:25
So this is not, this is not approved by done by any means.
But I would say this is my external opinion.
I don't think he's really passionate about cookies.
And kicks, right?
Like he's not like you didn't wake up all day.
Thing about cookies and cakes right?
He's a business guy and so he cares about running an exceptional business and there was like besides the fact that he picked that thing was because he's like they're good margins.
6:47
And I think I could make it work.
That was literally he's like, I think I could make to scale and make it a franchise and I was like, that was just whole goal, and that is to school right now, he's doing well, but my point is that he's not, he doesn't wake up every day thinking about cookie customers, right?
He doesn't, he wakes up every day thinking about How can I prove this business, how can I be a better business owner?
7:06
How can I make it more?
Exceptional product.
And so, sorry about the beeping, the background got this trash truck, whatever he is, how can I make an exceptional product that people will Rave about and tell their friends about?
That is so good.
That I don't even need the market, right?
And he doesn't in about 90 minutes, I said it was first a campaign.
7:26
We spent, I think we spent 20 bucks a day and he paid three dollars for every human being who showed up.
At his door, which is insane.
By the way advertising for getting people to come in to eat.
Cookies, is a lot easier than getting people to come in and try and lose weight, just FYI.
7:42
But anyways, it was just like a fun side thing for me.
But the point is, this is that he's not that passionate about his customers but he's extremely passionate about being exceptional.
And so, if you need a shift of like man, I just can't get behind it.
7:58
And you may say that you do you may tell your team that you are but you may not actually be and what It's as we start feeling like frauds, right?
And then you start, not even trusting the own words coming out of your mouth.
Because, and the thing is, it's not that you're trying to be deceptive like purposely deceptive or deceitful, but it's like, in some ways you're just trying, you're trying to deceive yourself, right?
8:17
And that's where that's where things get all janky in your head because you're like, no, I am I'm transforming lives making an impact and like you are.
And that's, that's legit, that's real.
Like, you really are, but it might not be real for you, right?
Like, I don't know what it's like to have by chafing.
8:33
Being in the sun because you're overweight, like, I know what it's like to have that you even get your thighs are too big from squats.
I know what that's like, but I don't know what it's like from when you're overweight, you know?
I mean, it feel ashamed of it, I don't know what it's like to have to wear a coverall.
Like I know what it's like to be.
8:48
The guy who takes your shirt off way too early and makes everyone feel awkward.
I did that when I was in high school and I was socially, didn't understand how like social etiquette worked.
I was like, I'm ripped.
Y'all should take this out.
It's so so it wasn't real for me.
So, if this If this resonates with you and you're like, man, I really wish I were more passionate or maybe you didn't want to admit it to yourself, maybe it's okay to admit it yourself and just be honest and then move forward from there.
9:13
And just say, I'm going to be exceptional at business.
I'm going to run an exceptional business and it's okay.
If you don't, if you're not like jazzed up about getting people to lose weight, be jazzed up about being exceptional, and rest your head on that, be acceptable, business are being exceptional leader.
9:28
Being such a husband being exceptional person who shows up as human being And running exceptional business.
Because the issue is what happens is when we fake it, we don't make it like if you if you try and pretend like you're motivated by that and know you know, deep down that you're not and your staff knows deep down that you're not.
9:47
Then it's just not going to, it's not going to resonate but if you show up and you're like, listen guys, we're going to run an exceptional business, we're going to be world class, we have unbelievable customer service, right?
And we're going to be, we're going to improve in that way.
Then you can be real about it.
And then finally, your words will sink in because people be like now that's legit like he really does or she really does want to be an exceptional Business Center.
10:08
Run an exceptional business and they'll believe that and you'll go from there.
And you'll believe you which at the end of the day is the thing that's the most important is that like, you know, that you're being honest with you.
You.
So anyways, hope that resonates with some of you guys here.
Maybe, maybe I was the only one so that would be awkward, but if if I'm not drop a comment so that you can make everyone else feel, okay?
10:29
If you're like you know what, I haven't actually been that a passion about people losing weight, but I am passionate about owning a business and it's okay.
And then like, like I'm at was that?
Like, my name is Alex and I'm an alcoholic.
It's like, hey, my name is Joe and I don't care about weight loss, but I do care about being Several business owner and one exception business.
10:49
Because if you think about it that way, you actually serve them better because you're not lying.
And then that way you can make a product that you'll be proud of and that they will be, they will enjoy consuming.
So lots of love

0:17
Hey, what's going on guys?
Happy happy hump day.
Hope you guys are having an amazing morning so far.
It's beautiful here in Austin.
Look at this.
It's like beautiful outside because it only just looks like white light right now but it's really nice out.
Maybe we'll go for a little walk.
0:33
So, anyways, when I make a little video here because it's something that was on my mind, this morning when I woke up and I was like, huh, I will share it.
When we were at the, when we had our gym, Lord Summit the end of January 1 of the gym.
Owners names was chasing ski sick and he has to question a kind of stuck with me because it was just so, It's so relevant, you know what I mean?
0:57
And it was something that a lot of people I knew were suffering from.
And so I want to tie tie together a little bow here that I think you'll be able to take home a little nugget from this.
So, when we're at the event, he asked he's like hey, you know, I'm making all this money and Jason's probably made about 150,000 using, just like an additional Revenue using our system.
1:19
I'll be the last, like, four or five months somewhere in there.
And so he was like, Hey, like this.
You know, we've tripled our EFT and we're, you know, I'm making money every month.
So, like what should I do, right?
Which like, maybe, like crack up because it was just like so.
1:37
So, it's like such an entrepreneur question, right?
Is that like, all we want to do is just figure out the equation, and then, we're like, What next?
And the thing is, is like, we have to retrain ourselves because like Once you figure out the equation comes the boring stuff is just doing it again over and over and over again.
1:59
And because the boring stuff is what makes you money, right?
And I'm gonna give you two parallels here.
One is.
So when I, when I was, you know, I have my gyms, like the thing I used to get was, you know, and I'm sure you guys get the same thing.
It's like somebody, you know, a guy walks in.
2:16
I'm like so what you're going to like, I want to look like you.
I don't like awesome.
And so they sign up and then, you know, for months in they'd be like, hey like this is awesome, I'm really loving everything.
But like how long do I look like you and like are like what do I need to change?
2:32
Like going to be taking different supplements?
I need to be like doing you know, more workouts, whatever.
And I was like nah man, like you're working out like you're lifting weights.
You're count your Macros.
Like you're good.
I've just done this bolt cut cycle for 15, straight years, and you've done it.
2:49
For months, I was like.
So right now, I've done 45 times.
I've actually 45 times more time under the bar, then you get so like, yeah, that's all, but like, it's just being consistent, right?
It's nothing.
It's nothing complicated.
It's just being consistent and so business and lifting are really similar, is that they're simple, not easy.
3:09
Simple to understand hard to do, right?
And so, and here's the, here's the loop here.
So if that's how it is, It is in lifting and most of us know that to be true is like like it's not like he's like hey I'm providing exceptional customer service and you know, we're starting to get referrals like what do we do now?
3:30
It's like keep doing it right.
That's it.
And sometimes and thing is it's boring as hell.
It really is because we want to figure out something new want to figure out something sexy, but we're out.
Is that most times what happens is we get into this scarcity zone, right?
3:46
We're like oh shoot, I need to make some money and then you go back to doing the things that That make money, right?
And then you're like, who?
Okay, I'm out of the danger zone.
Now I'm gonna go do fun stuff and then all of a sudden he's not making money because you're like, I want to figure out something new.
Since the ninja is something sexy, something cool.
But like when I was in college, there was a classic entrepreneurship and I took it had nothing to do with entrepreneurship, but everyone had to come up with like make their own business plans, like pitching idea and I kind of thing because that's how college is tell you that business works, right?
4:17
Do you have an idea and you to get Esters and you can have a business plan.
I've never had a business plan because things change, right all the time, but but anyways, we're talking oh, the other, the entrepreneurship class and so everyone thought they needed to pitch something new something crazy.
4:40
But the reality is that like most businesses just like suck at doing things.
Most people don't try and so in order to take, Marketplace right in like absolutely dominate.
You just need to do what you said you were going to do.
Hey, if you're a return listener and you have not rated or reviewed the show, I want you to know that you should feel absolutely terrible about yourself and everything else in the world kidding.
5:05
But it would mean the absolute world to me.
If you guys would go ahead and do that, you don't even have to pause the show, you keep listening and you can just do with your thumb right now.
It'll take you less than 60 seconds.
And like I said, the only way that podcast grows through word of mouth and this is you joining hands with me and helping as many isomers with possibly can because no one is coming to save us, it's just us.
5:22
All right, so please go do that now.
Then let's get back to the shop.
Right.
Like, that's honestly how we've gone from zero to the biggest coaching Company by far by a long shot, like three times higher Revenue than anyone else who's even in the space, right?
5:39
Just because we do what we say we're going to do.
It's all.
It's not like we have a different business model.
There's nothing new right about our model.
I mean, some of the tactics that we have are better and that's the difference is that we do what we said we were going to.
Do you read me?
But the actual things that were promising are not different, right?
5:56
And so that's that's the thing is that most Most people think they need to have a different promise when really, they should have better delivery, right?
And so, like, I used to pull a as an example all the time, but like Chipotle became the biggest baddest Mexican restaurant like ever.
So if they do anything different, it's not like they're like a present or something.
6:14
You know?
I mean, like, they make chicken salsa and rice.
They do the same things, they do them better, right?
And so, a lot of times in business, we want to get distracted and start chasing new shiny objects.
When we already know what makes us money and you just have to do the boring stuff, like, like look at our business, right?
6:32
We saw two things.
We have an acquisition process, which is Jim lunch, which is just like what?
I teach all the gyms we come into Jim launches.
Like we basically create the same model over and over again.
Which is we acquire customers at a profit and then we transition them over to EFT for me.
My EFT is your legacy, right?
6:47
That's a long-term plan.
So like I do the same, it's the same business, right?
So two things out front end and a back end and like, the gyms actually have two levels.
They have two front ends into backends that we teach the second levels and Legacy and explain that but but like that's it, that's all we've done.
7:04
So two things, one front end one back and that's it and the thing is is that it's hard to be consistent.
It's hard.
Seven months in to still get on the sales guys.
And be like, are you working the legs properly?
Are you reaching out fast enough?
Because like we just get bored as entrepreneurs.
7:21
The thing is, is that boring makes you money, right?
Giving exceptional customer service makes you money, right?
Like leading, your team makes you money like having great classes.
Making sure the music is tight.
You know what I mean, makes you money, is it fun?
7:37
No, not at all, but it's a fallacy.
That you just need to get out of your head which is like and kind of to tie this to back to what your Jason station asses.
Like hey I'm making money.
What do I do?
You keep doing it over and over and over and over again?
7:54
Because that's the point of the game.
That's how you win, right?
It's like I'm working out.
I'm getting results.
What do I do now?
You keep doing it.
You keep sticking your Macros.
You keep lifting but we're like, hey man, I want to change my plan up.
I want to get some different periodization in They're doing carb cycling.
8:11
You're losing weight.
Keep doing it right?
It's the same thing, but we follow the same trap that our own customers do.
And so I hope this hope that speaks to somebody because I just want to tell you guys like I get bored out of my mind to sometimes I really do because I'm like God, I want to do something likes.
8:29
Like how did you something new?
What sex is like but but no, but this works, like I would love to advertise something different on the front instead of freak a steady.
I really would.
I did kills me sometimes, right, but it works.
And so I got to keep doing it and I gotta keep doing it.
I gotta keep managing the team.
8:45
I gotta keep bleeding right.
Even though sometimes you don't want to be in like these are lessons that I'm telling you that I've learned that took me so long to learn and I lost so much money because I just I just kept doing different stuff and I already knew what made me money already knew it.
9:01
And I still would do different stuff because I'm like, hey, this works, let's see if this works better, right?
But if you know what works, right?
Keep doing it.
It's being Assistant, right?
So anyways, um, most successful businesses are not new businesses.
9:17
They're doing what all businesses are supposed to do provide exceptional customer service.
Do what you said you were going to do.
Be on time.
Be nice, right?
Simple stuff.
Simple not easy, right?
So anyways you guys hope you're having an amazing hump day.
9:34
I hope this resonated with somebody who's, who's feeling like they need to come up with something ninja, something sexy.
When All you need to do is do the things.
You already know you need to do and just do it.
Even though you're bored, even though sometimes he's gonna drive you nuts, you know what I mean?
Like, all the leads be on top of them, you know, call your customers, check in on them.
9:54
Like, everyone knows this makes you money.
Everyone knows that that like, that is a good business, but we just don't want to do it right?
Because it's boring.
But it is what makes you money.
So, lots of love, guys.
Have an awesome day and I will catch you.








00000000000:00
What's going on, everybody?
I'm bringing some more books, but I wanted to say that, if you haven't checked out Hunter million-dollar offers, I would definitely suggest that you start there.
I've gotten some solid feedback and it couldn't be happier with its.
Number one ranking on Amazon for direct marketing and over 5,000, five star reviews.
So, thank you guys so much for that.
0:15
It's 164 pages.
I really can help you out.
It takes about four hours to get through, check it out.
On Amazon, the Kindle book is 99 Cents.
The audiobook is Lowe's, they'll let me put it on for it, so I think it's 12 bucks.
So enjoy that and let's start the podcast.
Good.
Hi everyone.
0:30
I'm doing this one from inside because it's freezing outside.
And so I wanted to make a little video for you about everyone's favorite topic, crazy clients, but I wanted to look at it in a little bit of a different way than, I think, we normally broached the topic and the reason I wanted to make the video was because I've had, I had someone reach out to me recently, who was a client, and well, I'll just tell you the story.
1:01
So there was a couple of gym owners and they were their partners and they did our gym lunch program, and they ran it a couple times.
I think they made like 40 Grand the first time or third year in their first time.
1:18
They made an another 40 Grand.
The second time, they ran it.
And they ran it more on and off for about.
Well, they ran those first two times.
And at that point is when I launched Jim Lord's.
1:33
So this is the very beginning and I remember that every person that I talked to you up to that point before I spoke with them was like heck, yeah, man.
This like this thing's a bee's knees, like we're all in like whatever you got like I'm in and that was kind of the plan because like the rest of the business model of like how we, you know, did so well and how we were able to do it at scale and just have just run a better model than what's out there right now by a long shot.
2:02
But anyways, everyone else was like, Yeah, I'm all-in.
And this these two clients in particular, email me back this like really really after talking on the phone and say I'm not really sure, you know, after they were literally on the brink of closing their doors, having totally turn their entire gym around their cash flow situation.
2:28
Gotten them paid out of debt all of this stuff, right?
Had happened and like the first two months or three months working with me and Anyways, so they sent, he sent me this email saying, like what we're considering you or versus another, you know, other coach.
2:45
And I was like, okay cool and they're like, well here's a 20, you know, tears, 20 questions that we want you to answer and and and to what extent and then we're going to make our decision and I just remember thinking like wow I was like they're going to be a pain to deal with and so So I said, hey guys you know respectfully I only make the offer once and it's true.
3:13
I only make the offer to join a gym or at one time so one time offer you say, no you say no forever.
And I do that for a couple reasons and I'm going to circle back to the email and kind of the decision-making process around that.
But I make the offer because I know that if I need to give someone nudge that I'm willing to do that because I know it's in their best interest because every gym because I have the stats to back it, Every gym that comes on with us be like, usually, two, three, four x, their revenue within a matter of months.
3:41
And then we 2, 3, 4 x, their take-home really once they take the next step and we can take off their time and then they can pretty much get out of their business within six months.
Not that they are not working in their business, they're working on their business, not in their businesses, my point they become owners instead of like operators so and for anyone who thinks that being an owner, you don't work, you still do you just do the right work.
4:07
Anyways, what was that?
If in that instance, right these people would, you know, experienced tremendous success.
So in an equivalent story, from a fitness perspective will be somebody who came in, you know, with you know, diabetes, high blood, you know, high blood pressure on medication, and you help them lose 100 pounds and get off all their meds.
4:36
And the only difference is that, like you can turn someone's business around.
Pretty quick losing 100 pounds takes time, but And let's just say 40 pounds and you get them off all their medication in 12 weeks or so, right.
And you say, hey, I think you'd be a, you know, a good fit for this next program and finances aren't an issue, right?
4:53
And they're like, well, I'm thinking about you or this other, you know, training facility down the street, and what, you know, what can you do that?
These people can't do, right?
And so here's, here's where my thought process was when I turn these, turn this partnership down, one is If the data that you're working off of them, the client to make the decision right?
5:19
Is that like I've completely transformed your business, right?
Or in the fitness example, like completely transform your life and that's been the only exposure that you've had has been a ridiculously successful experience.
Then.
5:38
The issue is that you have a flawed decision, making process and the reason that I let them go was because I knew that there would be nothing that I could do. that would make them happy because if everything that I had done to that point did not Everything that I've done to that point qualified, the response that they gave, which for normal for most people would be a response that was not normal.
6:09
It was an atypical response, it didn't make sense given the stimulus, right?
Then that's an out Point.
That's a red flag.
That means that when I put data in their actions are unpredictable which means that if I can't predict someone's normal actions, then it's going to be really difficult for me to create a successful outcome for them because our definitions of success or different or at least the state of definition for the same, but their response to that success was not normal.
6:41
And so, the reason I'm telling the story right?
Is that they ended up, you know, emailing back.
And I told them, I was like, listen, you know, I'm going to take the offer off the table, I don't really want to do this.
I don't think it's gonna be a good fit and so they emailed back, you know, I guess now it's Eight months later from when I you know, when we got about a dead, give them a whole new system.
7:04
Everything saying, hey, you know, we want to work with you.
We heard everything is amazing.
Blah blah blah, right?
And it just made me think because It just, you know it just it just brought back the they just brought back all the memories of that how that had happened, right?
7:22
And at the time they would have been like the probably the fit, you know, tenth person who would have joined, Jim Lords.
And now, we have 300 people in Jim Ward's at the time of the making of this video.
Real quick guys.
If you can think about how you found this podcast, somebody probably tweeted it told you about it.
7:40
Should it on Instagram or something like that?
The only way this grows is through word of mouth and so I don't run ads, I don't do sponsorships, I don't sell anything.
I only ask is that you continue to pay it forward to whoever showed you or however you found out about this podcast that you do the exact same thing.
So if it was a review if it was a post, if you do that would mean the world to me and you throw some good karma out there for another entrepreneur. and, The.
8:07
One.
I couldn't accept them because then they wouldn't respect me, right?
Because then I wouldn't have been true to my word, right?
Because then if I go back on my word, one time, how can they respect?
What?
I'm telling them when I tell them not to go back on their word, right?
That's number one.
Number two, I wouldn't have respected me because then I'm like, am I really just a cheap Pony trick?
8:25
Someone who just bends over for a buck?
And then three I couldn't talk with conviction when I you know when we are talking to owners and I'm like this is truly a one-time offer.
I only make this invitation to you one time.
If you do not take it, you don't get to come back.
And so I won't be able to see that with conviction because wouldn't be true, right?
8:44
And the more for those of you who don't know, like who we are what we do, like there's any business principle that has ever carried Me.
Like There's No Business principle that has ever carried me further than just, just being truthful, like, radical honesty when it comes to like, even my marriage.
9:01
I'm like, I don't know what to say right now because I've I don't know what to say right now.
You know what I mean, and even works in like a dating setting.
I know this is like totally non sequitur, but I'm just going to go with it.
You know, you she's so cute girl in the elevator.
I would be like I'm trying to think of something to make you laugh right now.
9:17
Like if you said something like that would be totally true.
And that person would be like wow.
Like that's just like honest and genuine like that's pretty cool but like truth works you know and so anywho like you can speak with conviction when you're speaking about truth and so the truth is it was a one-time offer and so I said no but I wanted to bring this up because You have clients, right?
9:42
And you have someone who you've totally gone, you know, out of your way foreign and had a huge client success, right?
And they act weird, right?
They don't give you the response that they should have happened.
That's a them thing.
9:58
And you need to not let it bug you.
Like I actually hadn't thought about this for months until they just emailed out of the blue because I had peace with it because I was like, hmm.
Their decision making process is broken.
Okay, because anyone else who's give, who's given this data should have made The Logical conclusion to move forward, right?
10:16
It would have just made sense, right?
If I just made you 70 grand, you know what I mean?
Then like all the data that I've given you is like, like this is going to work, you know what I mean, in the stuff that I do works right?
And so anywho you need to give yourself the okay to not work with people.
10:36
And it's for both of your benefit because they're not going to be happy.
Happy and you're going to be miserable because they won't be happy and you won't understand why.
And so you're going to Rack your brain and keep doing things over and over and over again.
Because you're going to be using your decision calculus of what success looks like.
10:52
And if someone else has a broken decision-making process, you can't help that.
And so, I had a couple notes that I wrote down for this video and one of them was kind of about concept of regret.
So I'm going full circle with this but There's a lot of decisions that if I go back out to be like, man, I would have made that differently, right?
11:13
But there are some decisions that 100%, I would have not made differently, but it was because I had a lack of information, but my decision-making process was sound right.
And so when you do go back and look at past decisions, what you want to look at, is the process of the decision making based on the information you had then.
11:34
And so So sometimes that gets me out of a lot of like dark holes have like man I would have done this differently, I would have done this different it's like but if I would have only done it differently because I knew more information then it doesn't mean that I was being an idiot.
It just means I didn't know and so that's something that has helped me.
11:51
I don't know, maybe it'll help you but like there have been some difficulties that, you know, we've encountered business-wise that.
I was like, man.
If I had this information sooner, I would have made a different decision but I didn't because the decision making process with sound is just the wrong data, right?
Or incomplete data.
12:06
And so when it comes to Crazy clients, excuse your fill, excuse yourself, allow yourself to just say, some people are crazy.
And that's okay.
And I don't work with crazy people and and then you can like give this big exhale and be like.
12:25
And you know what's interesting is that like if you if you do start getting better at marketing start joining our stuff, whether you do or not like you're going to generate more inquiries, you're gonna have more people who walk in your door, right?
And when you have higher volume of people walking in your door, the likelihood that you encounter.
12:41
A crazy person is virtually certain right after you have more than 20 people who walk in your door, you're going to get a crazy.
It's like you think five percent of people have like serious issues?
I do right.
And are they reflecting some of that back on you probably sometimes and so like you have to give yourself the the the ability to just move on.
13:03
And say that person is crazy and then keep going because if someone has its broken decision making process, I'm just driving this point home because it's a really important one.
Then you can't help them until they fix their process of decision.
Making because no matter, What happens?
13:18
You will become crazy yourself trying to fix their trying to input data.
That makes sense to get an output that should be predictable.
That is not.
And so that's a great recipe for taking tons of your coaches time, tons of your time, tons of your attention and then ultimately making the business suffer and that is what people refer to as cancers in the business.
13:38
It's just people who are just freaking crazy, you know, and you have to be okay with that.
So anyways, if you have a crazy person in your life or in your gym, I would highly recommend just Them go.
And maybe I'll make a video right after this about Olympic crazy, people go.
But you just, you got to excuse, you just got to let people go.
13:56
And then, the other thing is that you have to be really truthful in most of your Communications, even with that person be like, you know what, I just don't know if it's going to be a good fit.
I feel like, you know, well I'm not going to the under the, how to's on this one but that one time thing was It was just it was a really good lesson for me and I'm really glad I made the decision that I did now months later because the group that we have with, Jim Lawrence is like, amazing.
14:25
And it's all these positive people who just click with me and how we do things.
And I want to keep it that way.
I don't protect them and I will protect my staff.
And yeah, so if you got crazy, people don't worry about it.
And sometimes it's Don't Preach.
If you have everybody who's leaving you then then you might be crazy.
14:43
But if every once in a while you have Who you have a huge result for and then they don't take the natural Next Step sometimes they're crazy and just don't put it on yourself.
So anyways, hope you have an amazing day.
Lots of love and I will.
Who you have a huge result for and then they don't take the natural Next Step sometimes they're crazy and just don't put it on yourself.
So anyways, hope you have an amazing day.
Lots of love and I will.









00000000000:00
What's going on, everybody?
I'm bringing some more books, but I wanted to say that, if you haven't checked out Hunter million-dollar offers, I would definitely suggest that you start there.
I've gotten some solid feedback and it couldn't be happier with its.
Number one ranking on Amazon for direct marketing and over 5,000, five star reviews.
So, thank you guys so much for that.
0:15

I really can help you out.
It takes about four hours to get through, check it out.
On Amazon, the Kindle book is 99 Cents.
The audiobook is Lowe's, they'll let me put it on for it, so I think it's 12 bucks.
So enjoy that and let's start the podcast.
What's up?
Welcome to the gym secrets about how you run your business.
0:45
So what I want to talk about this time is probably the most Central equation to how you can calculate your gyms hypothetical Max talking about and thought about that as we keep growing but you can you can literally calculate exactly where your gyms going to top out if you Just know a few numbers.
1:01
Okay.
So the easiest way to describe this is pi, okay?
That's the way I like to describe it because I like pie, but see I guess I think that's funny anyways, but the easiest way to think about, in terms of the slices of the pie is if you were to like if you were to think about like a peace sign, I think a piece on is the one in the middle, the two down the down, the done on the lower parts, but top left their top, right third.
1:23
And then the middle bottom third.
Okay.
So top right, third and these three numbers are going to be the things that that that are the three pieces that we focus on when we're trying to grow again.
So Jim comes into our world were like, okay, this is how we're going to attack the gym with these three areas, okay?
1:42
So first top right is going to your cold Market or coal traffic Marketing System.
So, whatever things that you do to go out of the world, get people who've never heard of you to come in to your business, okay?
That's the coal traffic stuff.
The second number is going to be the top left which is your warm traffic marking stuff.
2:01
What are you marking to just seek lies to a sent?
Those clients across all and then generate referrals and ultimately retain them and give them a superior experience.
That's all warm traffic marketing.
Most of us don't do anything there which is just leaving tons of money on the table but I believe that another time.
But so your culture epic which you have far less Variety in the you do in your warm traffic plays and then the last thing is the bottom piece of this pie, which Which is attrition percentage, / retention percentage depending on what side of the coin you're looking at.
2:31
I usually talk about official presenters because the equations that will be talking about, that's its number that that percentage will be in of the reboot to use to calculate hypothetical Max's.
Things like that conference, okay?
So what I want to do for you is simply just give you a number example of the power of each of these things, Okay?
2:53
So Here's a normal example of something that other gym that would come to me a CrossFit or a boot camp that has 100 members around and most of them don't know their attrition percentages.
But I'll be like what do you guys average inside us from up and they'll usually say like 10th about that two or three-week.
3:11
Right.
So it's usually about time I'm okay and they're like I've been stuck in a hundred for a year.
Two years.
How long Bank?
Well guess you've been stuck it. 100 and your son have ten people a month irony.
No, based on that three.
Part equation that they're certain percentage is 10%.
3:27
So losing 10% of 100 is 10.
Mm, mm.
There's only about 10 months, that's why they're staying right, that's why they're they're staying solid at that percentage.
So with that number, like we're equipped to do a lot of things.
Now, here's where it gets really cool, let me just demonstrate how powerful that top number is.
3:46
So if you sign up, let's say, you change your inflow from 10 to 20 cents a month, and you keep your attrition percentage detain, You Vince, You don't Jim over the world so it's not going to double overnight.
But over time, it's going to cap out at hypothetically 200 because the moment that 200 the 10% of 200 equals 20, the top number then it will no longer grow.
4:06
So we know that as soon as you double that you can get to 200.
Now here's a sneaky one that people don't think about if you cut your attrition percentage from 10% to 5%.
And you keep your signups the same, so that dinky Little Jim Wright, who who's signing a 10 people per per month, can get to a gym with a hypothetical maximum 200, just by putting a certain percentage by 10% 5%.
4:31
Here's where it gets really cool.
If you really think about this, it costs less To cut attrition percentage by 10% from 10% to 5%, then it does to increase sign ups from 10 to 20 a month.
Let that sink in.
4:46
So, if you're trying to grow your gym, one of the least explored areas is actively trying to retain energy costs.
So little to retain remember, just by caring and sending them like, I just because package gives hindered knows things like that, the little things, just a call once a week for someone who's dedicated to doing that, like it costs, you less pay that person for 10 hours a week checking on your customers.
5:06
Then it does for you to run an attorney marketing campaign and if you're not losing people from your gym, here's a hypothetical like great mental example, to think about this if you never lost anyone, From your gym ever your gym would grow forever, it would have no Max, it would continue to go for your whole life.
That's how powerful cutting that attrition percentages.
5:25
Okay.
And that's why we focus on the most people real quick guys.
If you can think about how you found this podcast, somebody probably tweeted it told you about it, should it on Instagram or something like that?
The only way this grows is through word of mouth and so I don't run ads, I don't do sponsorships, I don't sell anything.
5:44
I only ask is that you continue to pay it forward to whoever showed you or however you found out about this podcast that you do the exact same thing.
So if it was a review if it was A post.
If you do that would mean the world to me and you throw some good karma out there for another entrepreneur.
Now, just as a thought experiment, the reason that so many gyms can start off, strong, or at least, they believe to be strong and they're like, man, we started off so good.
6:07
Some typical first 1/22, you know, we're at.
We are 20 and And then it's just such a slow down there.
Signups number of stay the same.
It's just that when you're losing 10% of eight people, you're losing, you know next to nothing.
One person or zero, right?
They get another 10 people.
6:22
Next month, they get up to 18, they lose 10% of that and lose one point eight.
So now they're down to 16 or 17.
You get another ten or twenty six, you see this growth, right?
But it's an asymptote, if you remember from calculus and math, guys, it just approaches a hypothetical maximum 100.
6:38
That's why they usually, you know, they fluctuate, right?
That's It's so this is sort of the math behind how we look at jobs and we'll go to strategies specifically, how do we attack each piece of these?
But if we're going back to the pie, so that was a fraction right there was a showing sign up, sober attrition percentage, but the third play here that we were that I was talking about was with your warm Market play now.
7:01
It's like, where does that fit?
Is that on the top side of the equation?
Well, we're both, okay.
And they're really important on both sides vision for a couple reasons.
Right.
So let's say you run, you know, an accountability change or, you know, whatever you want to call, okay?
7:18
And you run that type of program, you wrote it to your nurture list, right?
So your email list from that you've generated from coal traffic, so you need to have an email list.
Obviously, here's what that does, one it's going to reactivate old people who signed up at your gym and left first thing.
7:36
Second thing, it's going to allow people who've never been to your gym.
To say that specific problem is something that I would.
I'd like Saul.
So general fitness wasn't something that's compelling enough, that that specific problems enough for them to come out of the woodwork and singing away from the sign up for that.
Okay?
So it works as a sign of play.
But it also works as a retention plate because the more time someone spends money with you, the more problems you can actively solve for them and that you do exactly what you say, you're going to do the more consumer confidence.
8:02
Trust that person's going to have with you.
The more likely they are to stay longer more likely.
They are to refer more people, right?
So It's it works on both sides of this.
Okay.
Now here's here's probably what I think to be the coolest part of why I love the warm traffic place and I call them cash plays or meaning cash plays.
8:22
You know, with me and my guys and it's because they're pure profit because if you think about cost of acquisition and that's why it's not a full traffic sign.
Because if the pay for those right?
Warm traffic, you don't pay for because you already own that media.
One of my movies, the attention.
You own that person's inbox, you own that person's face book page.
8:37
You want that person, cell phone number Or whatever it is, whatever was your contact in the right?
And so if you were to own that media that it doesn't cost you anything to reach them and so if you run a clay and you make six seven thousand dollars, it doesn't even though that doesn't sound super impressive, right?
8:54
If you normally run, 30, 20 percent, marks, whatever Martin's run, okay, I'm pulling this out of here because they very, very dramatically.
Jimmy Jim obviously average.
It runs about 25% Origins that who comes to us actually want to come with usually are running link. 0% but anyway, that's another conversation all the time.
9:13
But let's just say, I think you run a 25 percent margins.
Um, okay, I can't do the math in my head.
Let's say, 30% 30% marched.
That means that you would need to generate twenty one thousand dollars from a coal traffic play in order to net that 7,000 the 7000 you're getting from the warmth of your plate, just doesn't seem as sexy but like it's still seven G's, right?
9:36
It's not bad.
And you do that five six, seven times a year.
And Like it will add up and I can promise you when you run one of these plays and I will send you just take seven thousand dollars out of the like like out of your thinking you look in your pocket like, huh.
That was actually pretty cool because I wasn't that much work because these are already people who know like and trust you, there's no sales process.
9:52
It's very easy to sell these people there.
So yeah, charge my car really really cool but it's one of the most eclectic pieces business.
So when you're thinking about your gym business, you know, do me a favor and think about it within these the three slices of this pie, okay?
10:09
A coal traffic sign.
Ups, what plays you're doing to?
Attract new customers?
That have never heard warm traffic, please?
What you're doing?
What you're communicating to your existing customers to reactivate old leads and then and then upsell it is said your current customers in the higher levels of service and solving more problems for them, which is directly the bottom line.
10:29
And also retains people better And then underneath of that one specific place, are you doing to cut nutrition percentage in to increase retention in your gym because you now understand the value of going from 10 percent to 5 percent is the same for your business as going from 10 signups a month to 20, and it usually costs less.
10:52
So that is the main point for at the gym speakers podcast of today.
I hope that it was useful for you.
I hope it was entertaining and share it with The gym owner friend, Jim Witter, buddy, and I have to talk to you soon.
Alex out.0:00
Real quick.
Because you guys already know that, I don't run any ads on this and I don't sell anything.
And so, the only ask that I can ever have you guys that you help me spread the word so we can have more entrepreneurs, make more money, feed their families, make better products, and have better experiences for their employees and customers.
And the only way we do that is if you can rate and review and share this podcast, so the single thing that I have to do is you can just leave review will take you 10 seconds or one type of the thumb, mean, the absolute world to me.
0:25
And more importantly, it may change the world of someone else.
Hey, what's going on everyone?
And happy days today.
Happy Tuesday.
Happy Tuesday.
So welcome to the group if you were to the group and I've given a lot of more like kind of story based stuff the last few videos.
0:43
And so I wanted to give you guys something a little nugget this tactical.
We have a lot of different ways that we overcome like, I need to think about it, but one of the ones that came up this weekend that when I was at funnel hacker, somebody was out our little round table and was like, Hey how do we You know how do you overcome I need to think about it and for those of you who are already in our stuff, you know how we approach it, but the first thing, the easiest thing to say is like awesome, what's your main concern?
1:13
And so it's like they think I need to think about it means I get to leave and you're like awesome what's your main concern?
And so immediately just bring him right back in and then you get to confront whatever their main concerns are.
Right.
So that's the first thing and I use that a lot of times over and over and over again until you exhaust them was like, so what's your main Turn.
1:30
Well, I'm not sure if I can make all the classes will cool.
Here's the schedule with circle the X and let's figure it out, right?
Because no matter what you're going to do, right?
And if it's the time things, like one, no matter what.
Like I've just done this so many times, no matter what you're going to do, you're going to have to pick a time to work out.
Like whether it's with us or with anyone, like if you're going to work out, you're going to have to have a time to do it and it's either going to be the morning afternoon.
1:49
And luckily for you, we already have a bunch of either of them, so you're fine.
So that's scenario one.
But the main one is well, You know what?
I really, I just don't make decisions on the spot.
I just, I like to sleep on it, you know, I mean, somebody who's really coming at you hard with that.
2:07
And so, one of the things that I like to always say, is totally understand and I actually used to do this all the time.
So you step into their shoes, right?
And so, I used to think that I needed time to make decisions because I assumed that with more time I would have more information, right?
2:24
And then they're like what, you're like?
Yeah, but the issue is that all of the information that you're going to get about our program is for me right now.
Sitting in front of you.
So what's your main concern?
And then it's just like, oh, it's like Piledriver right into the obstacles, faced what they're thinking about?
It's like totally, I'll just repeat it again.
2:41
It's like totally understand where you're coming from.
I used to do the exact same thing and it was because I used to mistakenly think that I would publish a mistake because on the fuck they're wrong.
But I used to think that by giving myself more time how to make better decisions.
But that's what based on the assumption that were going to get more information throughout is that we want?
2:59
And so, They just don't feel like confronting decision cause we're afraid of making the wrong one my right?
Like yeah.
Like awesome.
So then what's the what's the thing you're afraid of happening each making confront the fear and they're like, well, I don't know, most times they won't know because they're like on the spot and so it's like, well, let's just say so you're afraid that you'd give me money and then you sign up and then you'd never show up, right?
3:20
And then you just lose money and then you wouldn't lose weight.
Is that, is that fair to say that would be a worst case scenario and they're going to say?
Yes, right.
And you're like awesome.
So here's how we can fix that.
First off, you said, you know, 500 600 thousand, two thousand dollars, whatever you're selling your thing is, for you said that this amount of money means a lot of money, a lot to you and then they're gonna be like they're going to jump on that they're gonna be like, yeah, it's a lot of money.
3:42
Like awesome.
So How likely it is that you're going to Tha throw it away, right?
You just told me it means a lot to you.
Like, if you were a billionaire you give me a thousand bucks.
I'd probably say yeah if he'd be, if he struggles with accountability this money doesn't mean anything to him, but this money means somebody you're right?
Yes, awesome.
3:57
So then I'm not worried about that, okay?
So then let's do the flip side.
You're worried about, you may be giving us the money and they're not getting the value, right?
That would be the other alternative.
So we train you, for six weeks, we give you amazing, you know, experience, whatever.
But you don't lose weight.
4:13
Is that, is that fair to say?
Yes, because you're special snowflake, totally understand.
Well, that's why we have a service guarantee.
Meaning, if you don't feel like you got the value that you paid for, I was like, I'll give you the money back.
So unfair.
Awesome.
And so just like that, you can basically destruct, like, destroy anyone's.
4:29
Like I need to think about it, excuse because the first thing is, you always push back with what your main concern.
Then you can confront the concern, if you keep going through those and then they can hit this brick wall of, like, listen, I don't make decisions on the spot.
I always have to think about awesome.
You're mistaking, the fact that you need time in order to make better decisions, but better decisions information and only source of information is me right now.
4:48
So let me answer any other questions you got, right?
And then they're still going to waiver and they say okay well let's Just confront with the main issue is this a lot of times we don't want to make mistakes with the decisions.
Right?
Right.
Okay.
Then you go worst case, worst case scenario, you overcome the risk of money of like them, not adhering and then you overcome the risk of, you're not delivering the service and then you're alright.
5:09
So I hope that makes sense.
Little little sales, little sales, I don't know.
Lightsaber, lightsaber tactics for you guys who are new to the game World of the game and welcome.

00000000000:00
Real quick guys.
If you can think about how you found this podcast, somebody probably tweeted it told you about it.
Should it on Instagram or something like that?
The only way this grows is through word of mouth and so I don't run ads, I don't do sponsorships, I don't sell anything.
I only ask is that you continue to pay it forward to whoever showed you or however you found out about this Pockets that you do the exact same thing.
0:19
So if it was a review if it was a post, if you do that would mean the world to me and you throw some good karma out there for another entrepreneur.
Hey what's going on everyone?
Happy happy hump day I wanted.
To make a another little video for you because it was on my mind.
I thought I was telling someone else about the story and I figured I might as well share with you guys.
0:38
So, so some of you guys might know, we were just at the phone hacking live event.
We were some of the speakers for talk about high ticket sales and, you know, we won one of the awards which just like it's called the ax award, which is means you did over 10 million in sales, which is pretty cool.
0:56
I mean, we were excited about it but I mean, it's awesome but the thing that happened afterwards is where I kind of want to bring the lesson home.
So I had a couple people after we, you know, spoke and we were kind of showcased as kind of a success story type thing we're like, hey you know, could you can solve for my business I'd like to do something like this in my space and chiropractors and dentists or blah blah blah all right and people offer to pay us 50 thousand for a single day you're two people come up and offer that for us to kind of coat.
1:29
On their business, help them scale up the surgery.
I take it, whatever, right.
And my wife before I even had a chance to answer the question step forward and said, no, we don't do that.
And I wanted to kind of highlight why it was important and why why that kind of attitude has helped us grow so fast.
1:50
And so what happens is you you know, continue to scale and continue to make more money continue have stuff that works.
Is that the better?
You are the better.
The Opportunities that you have to say, no to our.
And so what happens is, especially entrepreneurs.
A lot of times we see things that were like, man, this would be so cool.
2:06
I got like six businesses in like no time.
Really make money.
But like, I was like, I don't know which one I'm going to do, but I'm gonna invest in all of them and, like, I'm gonna see which one takes off, but like that's fundamentally flawed because you as much marker, make any business take off and any single business can be as big as we want it to be.
And so all you're doing, when you're diluting your attention is, you're diluting your attention and ultimately you're ensuring that none of them will work, right?
2:27
And so We turn down these 250 thousand dollar day Consulting clients because the attention that that would take is going to take more from our business, then it will give us and making decisions in that way.
It's been probably the number one thing that has grown as to where we are.
2:43
Now I can't tell you the amount of guy so I think are much better at all these things, then then we are and don't have the size business that we do.
And it's because they can't focus.
Like they cannot focus.
The can't stick to one thing they do launch after lunch, they switched.
2:58
Product is such Industries.
They switch customer avatars alive.
I was thinking about doing this, no sir this and they just can't stick with it, right?
And if you look at our business, right?
And if you look at our gym model, and then, if you look at her current Jim launch business, it's all about doing the same thing over and over and over again and it's so boring, it's so boring, right?
3:17
All you do is you get really good at doing one thing and then that's it and as much as you want to do.
The next thing all you do is you go back to that first thing, you do it better and you do it better and you do it better, right?
And that's all you do.
Is you continue skills.
The difference with a 30 million dollar business at a hundred million dollar your business.
So right now we're on Pace for 30 million dollar run, right is where we're at.
3:34
Now, if you look at that versus 100, our business, they're virtually the same.
The only thing that changes is that 100 dollar business does more of the same thing.
They just do more instead of having 10 set, five sales a day that you 15 cents a day.
3:50
That's the only difference, they're not doing new verticals or not constantly trying to sell different things.
They usually Cuts focus on the same.
Same customer Avatar and they solve the same problem with the really good solving, this all look better, then that's it.
And so by us turning down these 250 thousand dollar day Consulting deals, I can guarantee you that having that mindset about how you approach your business is, what has been.
4:15
Some of the reason for our success is that we've been able to focus on doing one thing and doing really, really well.
And so I would implore you to not.
Look at if you're a gym owner, not look at online training, not look at meal prep services, not look at Of the many things that you can do that will distract you, you know, doing this JV you're doing this, this 50-50 thing with my buddy who's got this little thing going on the side like there are always things but I can guarantee you that the only set of strings attached and the strings are attached to your attention.
4:47
Hey guys, real quick for those of you guys who are 100 million-dollar offers fans I love you.
I added in a lost chapter that has never been released.
I'm releasing it now transparently.
I'm doing that to build hype 400 leads but you will have the unreleased chapter it talks about your first Avatar and how to segment customers to make more money.
5:05
You can get it by going to acquisition.com, forward slash leads.
It's so free in exchange for email so that I can email you when we launched under Miller, all the leads.
And so that you can not miss out on it.
Because last time I sold out for like eight, Straight weeks really fast.
So that is my way of making sure that y'all get first dibs.
5:24
And that's the most valuable asset you have now your time it's your attention.
And so even if we did do this, 50 thousand dollar Consulting day even if we did do this 50,000 other Consulting day, what would end up happening is That person after that day.
So continue to contact us and still continue to ask questions with still try and take attention.
5:43
And ultimately what that will do is it will rob us and it will not allow us to fulfill on the promise that we made to our initial demo nurse who came to us.
And so if I take that same amount of attention and then I put it towards the existing model we have and Brick by Brick continue to staff, you'll make more and more and more focusing on those fundamentals.
6:03
Then you want anything else.
So sometimes you got to do.
More do less and had a mentor once it's sometimes you got to go slow to go fast and I really believe in that in the Minot and he was a CEO of ten billion dollar company would be 10 billion and my an extended period of time where I was working, really, really closely with him.
6:20
I learned a lot of things from him and that was one of them is that sometimes you have to go slow to go fast, and sometimes you just got to get good at one thing.
And all you have to do, is focusing on doing that thing, more and more, despite being an entrepreneur and wanting to do lots of things.
The ones who make the most money are the ones whose at least, right?
6:36
And by Lee, I'm not saying you don't work, I'm saying, you do the least amount of things and you just do a few things extremely well, so double down on that don't get distracted by shiny objects, the better, you are the better the opportunity you have to say no to.
So keep that in the back of your mind, say no to the meal prep service.
Say no to the online training thing, say hello to the train from afar.
6:53
Say no to the, you know, the little corporate deal that you might be able to set up because they will distract you from the main thing because those are not the end goal.
If you have the gym, we need to do is focus on getting people in selling them.
I'm getting amazing results, get them, send more people to do that over and over and over and over again.
7:11
And then one day you will look up and be really, really bored.
If you like what do I do?
Now, you make money and that's the point.
All right, it's awesome.
A lot of us who just used to struggle and we basically self Sabotage by just putting us more subsonic assembly, rather than just focusing.
Some of you guys right now have multiple things on your plate and you can't focus on it and because of that, you can't win, but imagine if you only have one thing to focus on maybe was one location, you have.
7:36
And you know, you should have done it.
You should only have one, how easy would it be to make my one location?
Super easy because you have all your attention on it, right?
But some of you are making attention with three right man.
I'm making money with three same thing.
If you multiple businesses, you can make it right.
A lot of times because your attention so split.
7:52
So folks in one thing that makes you money do that over and over and over and over again until you're sick of it and then do more of it and I promise you'll make money.
All right.
Lots of guys have an amazing day.
I'll see you guys on the flip side.

Mosey Nation.
I was just on the co-creators of chrismon commands podcast over 5 million subscribers, and they had some very non business but business and money mindset questions specifically, for me, those guys are doing a few million bucks a year and felt very bored.
And so it was a half half coaching half Consulting call, and we talked about some really cool stuff.
0:19
One mindsets are on money to the difference be millionaires and billionaires and how they think about it, how to use money as a measuring stick.
The right way and ultimately how to turn in security and to motivate Ovation as fuel for the pursuit that you have both happiness wise and also wealthwise enjoy.
0:36
This is also part 1.
What I had done up to that point and up until maybe a couple years ago was I wanted to beat my father so badly at his game that he could not claim that I had not one and so every aspect of my life has been built to be impenetrable, welcome to the game, where we talk about it, get more customers how to make more per customer and how to keep them longer in the Failures and lessons.
1:00
We have learned along the way.
I hope you enjoy and subscribe.
I want to get to the live stuff.
I definitely have a lot of questions.
Just personally about what, you know, I'm confused if we should start with business earlier preferences, you do it.
Alright, let's do it here.
Okay, this is this is the burning question that I have.
1:17
I make, you know, a fraction in order of magnitude less than what you make.
But I really feel that I've solved my money problems with, with rare exception.
And so, I am.
I'm curious when I hear you talk.
Cuz you, you say all these things and I have the same experiences like I've given a lot of money for me to charity and it is felt morally, right?
1:37
But I don't feel it in the same way, like, I know it's the right thing to do, but I'm not feeling it.
So my question for you is I guess there's two big ones one.
Why continue to use money as a measuring stick?
Is it it like I, you're like, I'm gonna have a billion dollars or this, that me other thing.
1:52
Why has that remained?
And then to what are the Milestones of money or things that you've been able to spend money on that have Really increase the quality of your life and some that haven't because I'm seeing increasingly that, it seems like there's fewer and fewer things that I can spend money on that increase the quality of my life.
2:09
So that I got, well, what am I doing?
You know, I'm just gonna play video games with my friends which is sort of a complete waste of time if I'm trying to make money but his is fun while I'm doing it.
Right?
So, which we want to make money to go have fun.
So then wait what?
So let me see if I can answer the second question first because it was the one you just the marginal utility of money.
2:29
Decreases massively over time, right?
So the additional your next million dollars, makes significantly less impact on your life than your first million dollars, right?
And the first hundred thousand dollars in my opinion has but you know, 80 80 to 90% of the utility you got for my oh yeah, first undergrad, right?
And then everything after that is really, really diminishing.
2:47
In terms of its return.
There are two things that I get that I get value.
From one is I like flying private?
It's totally, it's not private.
I was gonna say first class, If the world is way better job, Steven Klein has about, forty nine, thousand dollars more per flight, so, you know, you can get it there, we're not at that level yet about.
3:10
So, I'll tell you.
So you can do it for.
It's about four to five thousand an hour.
So, if you have a three-hour flight, you're looking at 12 to 15 grand, and if you got six to eight seats on the plane, you know, if you're taking it fits, you and two or three other people, all of a sudden, it's like two or three thousand to take it.
Like, it can be, I'm not by no means, am I saying, it's like, you know, I'm just Saying that like I like it.
3:31
I do think it's a use Warren Buffett's word.
I do think it's indefensible but at some point I'm like what what?
Why even what am I accumulating more money to do right?
There's right and so it is 100% a comfort thing but what and Layla Consolidated this statement I won't talk more about private flying but she said what it did was it transformed travel from a nuisance into a positive experience and so going from economy to First Class it's still a nuisance.
3:58
It's still a pain.
Right.
It's just a little less of a pain but it's still a net negative in my opinion, flying private, I would say borders on and may actually be a positive experience because you literally just drive your car to the plane.
You walk on the plane, you've got Flay and lobster and then you get off the plane into your car and you drive to where you're going and there's no security.
4:18
There's no, there's no other, there's no babies.
There's not like there's, it's just, it's nice.
So that's the one thing that I would say and the other one is I like buying places with fuse.
So we're in a were in a Las Vegas.
Is Penthouse right now, and it's beautiful, you know, I mean, like, I look outside and I feel like I genuinely gain perspective because I see everything and I see the amount of wealth that exists in the world and I think it helps it only helped me from a perspective standpoint.
4:43
So there's the two things that I think that have been.
I would say very expensive that I have gotten actual value from.
But beyond that very, very, very little marginal utility of extra money.
The first question I think you asked, was why use money as a measuring stick?
And why do I, why do I say the billion thing?
4:59
So, I have absolute commitment to getting there and I have no emotional investment towards achievement.
I don't care.
It's more that it's kind of like Gary Vee.
He's like, I'm going to try and buy the Jets.
It doesn't really matter.
It's more just about the game and I think that it might be self-aggrandizing for me to even think this way, but I think it's probably true because I'm human.
5:19
I think that people will listen to me more if I'm a billionaire then if I'm just a hundred million are, you know, and that's probably just my own insecurities or whatever.
And I think that I think That will get their based on the math.
It would be unrealistic for me not to get there unless unless I'm massively blow something, you know what I mean somehow.
5:39
And so just on the math of just literally the pure cash.
We have not even the businesses that the capital of those generate if we just sat that in 10% when I'm 65 off a billion dollar so my do a billion dollars today will be 10 billion dollars in so you know.
Yeah, think about that.
5:54
But anyways, inflation does so sorry.
Can I can I come in?
Because I kind of want to, I want to ask this.
A simple.
It's going to sound similar but it's I'm going for something different which is so I don't know.
I'm not trying to say your exact net worth.
Let's just say you have 40 million dollars or fifty million dollars in the bank cash right now.
6:11
I've probably I'm probably closer to the mid-30s.
It depends on you, okay?
But like in investable, a 75 million years, sure what motivates you to do work, you don't enjoy or do you just not only do work that you enjoy because I could imagine having 35 million dollars in the bank.
6:29
And going, I'm only going to spend my time doing things that are fun and the second something is not fun but can make more money.
I'm just not going to do that thing because I don't need more money.
And so I'm curious.
Do you have that philosophy?
And if not, what is it that gets you to do the thing?
That?
Yeah, so this is interesting in our stressful or not.
6:45
From this is interesting, I believe that humans need challenges to enjoy life.
And so then it starts to become a my living by my values.
Because am I the type of person who, because one of my biggest fears, I remember saying this over and over again is that I never Become soft.
7:01
I never want to feel like if everything were taken from me, I could not build it again.
And so for me, I feel very sheshe, Foo-Foo whatever word you want to use for, not wanting to do certain things.
Now that being said to your question, the vast majority of my time or 100% of my time, I pretty much spend doing stuff that I find enjoyable or stimulating to a certain degree but I won't shy away from something if it's if to get to the thing, the next thing that I want to do, I have no Difficulty in attacking it, but I think.
7:32
When is it happening to the question that you have?
And this may be interesting for you, I don't know what level you guys are at business-wise, but when I talk to seven-figure entrepreneurs, right?
They're talking about tactics, they're talking about, hey, we did this order a bomb.
We did this change in headline or we'd switched in this new platform.
7:49
ITS Tactical each figure guys.
They're usually talking about processes that they're putting inside of their business, you know, they just had a million a month or mine after many months more in there, and they're like, that's what they're, that's what they're thinking about.
All the people that I know who are, and I think, I think we'll hit.
I think we'll cross 100 million in Revenue by probably end of q1 next year, maybe Q2 next year.
8:09
But the conversations that I have with all the guys that I know that are at that level and above, it's all about people.
And so I was having this conversation with a friend of mine and he was like, yeah.
All the business owners that we serve and they have a big platform.
He's like, they just always there.
Always like, how do I get more traffic?
I don't get more traffic and I we both were laughing and I was like, I would just say go hire Someone who knows how to get traffic and then if and we both cried our trip but that's kidding me.
8:35
That's how I think about stuff now.
And if I were to start a new Endeavor, I wouldn't build a business.
I would assemble a business.
And so it's like, I know we need one of these, one of these, one of these and put it together, and say, go Pursuit on my behalf.
Here's the incentive for all for everybody and and that's how the business would grow.
And if it doesn't grow, then I would swap people out until it until it was growing.
8:54
And so the thought process change, but I think you do have to go through it and maybe that's a Believer story.
I'm telling myself but It's the guys that I knew who have achieved that did go through each of the steps so that they could, they could cross check and be like, I know this guy's full of it and I know this guy knows his stuff so that you can simply make better judgments on other human beings.
9:11
With with decreasing error rate, you still have one but just fewer errors.
I want to thank you.
Want to Circle to this, because I actually really need to figure out the hiring thing, but I do have one question because I agree that people need is a weird word, but I would say thrive on challenges and the challenges are rewarding.
9:29
And fulfilling, do you find that you diversify them amongst monetizable challenges and challenges that don't make money?
Or do you focus mostly on challenges that make money because I could imagine again 35 million to the bank.
You go, I'm going to learn to play piano.
I'm going to build a homeless Center that makes no money at all in Las Vegas and I'm going to try to invent something.
9:49
I'm going to do the challenge of inventing a new way to improve solar energy and maybe I'll be a billion dollars but maybe it'll just solve global warming and I won't make any money.
I also know people who are serial entrepreneurs in everything, they do is in the pursuit of wealth.
And so I'm curious.
10:05
What, how do you pick your challenges?
I guess what, what drives you so money is not the driver.
I just love the game of business so much, I just love the game of business.
I loved and was obsessed with Fitness.
I both will State records.
I was, you know, me, like, I was in good physical competitive shape, right?
10:22
Still are saw the quads before we started, but when, as soon as I got into business, It's the love that I have for Fitness, just paled in comparison to just like how obsessed I was and how much.
I just I just love spending every hour that I could and like my free time now.
10:39
Like right now I'm going through a course on on Deal structure.
I was like, this is great, you know?
Like I'm just like, I love it.
Like I truly love it.
And so, in terms of challenges, the way that I have skinned, at the challenges, for me, at least, in my current season is pursuing bigger goals than I did before monetarily, but with massive constraints, right?
10:59
My actual like mental Target is, I'd like to do 100 million in profit a year.
So that's my that's my between all the portfolio companies, right?
That's my next Target.
And so, if I do a hundred million in profit per year, I don't want to do that as a slave.
I would like to do that as an owner advisor and working two to three days a week with them and I say work.
11:20
So for me the work is like meetings.
So that's meeting with the CEOs of the companies meeting with a handful of leadership, that's what I consider like, work work.
And then the rest of my time is Is, you know, making the YouTube stuff, writing the books, making the courses that were going to be publishing doing podcasts like this.
11:36
These are all just.
This is the, you know, I enjoyed enjoyed the Saturn.
Nice.
Yeah.
So so well, the reason is the reason I ask is because I could imagine people who are listening who who are very enviable of your life.
The fact that you are an advisor who buys businesses who has more money than almost anybody on the planet.
11:54
Like they want to get where you're getting but maybe they don't feel the same way you do when they first pick.
Entrepreneurship.
So maybe they were a great athlete, who doesn't find the business books, exciting, or whatever it is.
Maybe they're incredible musician.
Who when they try to go into the online course world.
They find it a grind.
12:11
Have you had any success with yourself with other people learning to love the game?
Or do you find that?
It's kind of like, how some people like art and some people like sports and you like it, if you like it and you don't if you don't.
So, if businesses your game, you're set up for success and if it's not, then you don't get to be Alex from Rosie.
12:28
Yeah.
So first off, I just want, like, for the audience, you even say the 35 million thing.
I literally feel pangs of insecurity that it's not that much money, just so, you know, really?
I just want, like, I just want to give her for like that.
12:43
Like, I'm like my God.
It's not over 100.
I'm such a poor person.
Finally, I hope.
No one hears this like, I was like, I can tell you the thoughts that I'm having what we're talking about this.
Wow, why I respect your self-awareness in your willingness to share that happy to tell you all the things that Just flop within me.
13:00
But the the other part which is if you don't inherently love the game, right?
So my perspective on this is shifted, which then makes it hard for me to even talk because I think about some things to say five years ago, my wish I just never said anything but then it's like then I wouldn't speak anymore and then whatever and so my view point on it is that I do think that there's a lot more luck than I used to give credit for.
13:22
And the luck is not from outside, circumstance of, like, things happening in meeting people, but more luck of the draw, the initial draw of like, what were mine.
Genetics.
What was the initial upbringing that I had were the stimuli was exposed to?
That gave me these proclivities.
Because if you think about it, from a large number standpoint, right?
With a large enough pool of people, which most people just about everybody who's within a system where the money is involved, right?
13:41
If we just if we just said only capitalist systems, sure, they're still a billion plus people are 2 billion plus people that are I guess, including India, three, you know, half the world's population is in the capitalist system of some sort, right?
And so with that many numbers, lots of people will work hard but the people who have a proclivity and Work hard and have some level of natural talents words, it will just exceed Excel better and faster.
14:05
And so, I think that everybody can be in the top 1% that I believe which means you 125 million vessel assets.
I believe everyone can do that in their life span 100% but most people don't have the character traits in the discipline to do that.
Now, is that lock?
Is that, you know, who knows?
14:21
But the question that my closest friend, dr.
Trevor Kashi.
Who's a scientist in to save your stuff all the time.
He's like Is it useful to ask the question because it's not under our control at all?
He's like so you might as well tell yourself that you do have a natural proclivity to being in business if you want to be successful in business.
14:44
Real quick guys.
If you can think about how you found this podcast, somebody probably tweeted it told you about it.
Should it on Instagram or something like that?
The only way this grows is through word of mouth and so I don't run ads, I don't do sponsorships, I don't sell anything.
I only ask is that you continue to pay it forward to whoever showed you or however you found out about this podcast that you do the exact same thing.
15:04
So if it was a review, if it was a post, if you do that, you mean the world to me and you throw some good karma out there for another entrepreneur.
My question is only, like, what do I do if that I'm just making up an example, but what do I do?
If I'm incredibly talented guitarist, who wants to start a business where I'm teaching people music?
15:23
And I've been trying for two years and it's just not working.
Hmm.
And I don't, I don't think I have that proclivity.
Can I acquire that, I guess you could.
I think you'd probably be smarter for that person to go, find someone who loves that game.
And then the only skill, you have to have is how to, how do I make have the perspective from which to make adjustment?
15:40
That this person actually is good.
And then do I have enough skill in negotiation, so I can make a favorable deal for myself.
And so, if you can do those two things, you can be Justin Bieber, who's not a business guy, but it's still extremely wealthy.
Eminem is not a business guy, still ensuring a healthy.
So I think your there's still ways to play it without necessarily having business.
15:57
Be the game which I find kind of interesting too because I'm not Kylie Jenner.
You know what I mean?
And trial he's younger than me and Wealthy than me which I'll tell you another one.
When I found out she was a billionaire and she was younger than me.
I literally like had a day where I was like I just felt like I felt Although ourselves oh no I liked it.
16:14
It was like I suck.
It's like why am I not end?
So I'm just telling you like these Securities Run Deep to get here.
Sure.
Well you know you had an Instagram post and I really appreciate this is one of the reasons I want to talk to you, your candidness.
Yeah.
Lovers an Instagram post where you said you were in text conversation with a friend and you said something to the effect of like the bigger the hole in your heart, the bigger the stuff required to fill it.
16:38
So I have millions of dollars read what you will into That I think I just I appreciate you saying it and and separately for, if you have, have you ever done anything like therapy or psychedelic medicine or anything like that and have you found it, have you found it helpful because I mean I appreciate you sharing all of your knowledge but and then when I hear those things as well, I mean dude I can I I can totally relate to that smaller number values and I guess it's some point.
17:08
I'm appreciative that the stubbornness in meek.
Quit and went, this is fucking stupid like 100,000 subscribers, a million subscribers 5 million.
There's like when I get that diamond play button at 10 million then people will see me differently and I hear that same and as his business partner and best friend in a mixed blessing.
17:29
Hi guys, it's friend.
I'm like that's great and as the business part, I'm like, remember when you had all those insecurities?
Yes, it's taking the taken, the wind out of my sails.
It's taking them to myself.
So, yeah.
Have you have you addressed it other than filling it with Success and achievement.
Have you have you have taken other ways of looking at that, that internal feeling.
17:46
Yes and how has that gone?
Like what what is what is Sue's door are out there?
I will see that.
I think time does The Sting of pain but you know, over a long enough time Horizon.
But for me I don't think pain, the pain changes when we look back on it until we understand it.
And I think that's, I think, for me defining, what the objective was for quote therapy, or self work, or whatever, simply as my I seek.
18:12
I understand and I think it becomes far less intimidating to go explore some of these things.
If you're like, I'm just I'm not, I'm not here to change anything like you're telling yourself, right?
You're like, I just want to understand it, right?
And so for me, the conclusion that I've made and candidly this is also just a story and that I might just be telling myself so hey, who knows.
18:30
But the story that I tell myself at least is that I had these massive insecurities about my father's approval, right that?
So that was the thing that was withheld for me my child Hood adulthood, I mean in for context my father called me, and he pretty much said, all the things that I had done up to, you know, every, every decision that I had made was not a good decision after I decided to Veer off the path of the job, right?
18:56
Everything after that was a bad decision and it was only when I had literally made more money than he'd ever made in his entire life that he said, You Know, You're Gonna Want to hear this and I stepped out.
It was like what I meant like dinner.
He was like, I'm sorry.
And I was like, for what he was like, you know, for For saying that you shouldn't have done this and I was like, okay, and and he was like, no, I think it was like, but for the record, he's like, if it had been 30 years ago when I was coming up, I would have been, right?
19:25
Yeah.
And I remember thinking to myself, One.
If I cared about your opinion, I wouldn't have done it.
And so I had to I'd break the sting of your approval when I was literally on my balcony, thinking about killing myself in my Consulting career, that was what was the painful enough to force me to make the change where I was like, well if the alternative is death then I can at least disappoint my father that was really what it has to come to like, it sounds ridiculous but that is what I had to and that's why you probably often hear me measure a lot of decisions against death because it helps me gain.
19:58
Perspective on what is important.
And so, for me, I was like, well, I'm guaranteed to be to be miserable forever.
And if I'm going to be miserable forever doing this, that I might as well die.
And if death is what this is then I might as well choose this and live with the disapproval.
And so I explained that and the piece that I think I delivered that I think stung, but I think the audience might appreciate was like as a, you know, that moment I was talking to my house.
20:18
You know, that moment when people get on stage and like, I just want to thank my mom and my dad for always being there and always being supportive of me.
I was like, I'm not going to say that as I because you weren't.
And so you probably hear I've always liked, I still have the anger.
That's there.
Yeah, but what I had to realize was what I had done up to that point and up until maybe a couple of years ago, was I wanted to beat my father so badly at his game that it would be that no one that he could not claim that I had not one.
20:51
And so every aspect of my life has been built to be impenetrable and so it's like I don't want to just be in shape.
I want to be so Jeff that no one says that I am not in shape.
I don't want my wife to be just a girl.
I want her to be incredibly hot.
Incredibly cool.
21:06
And fucking good at business and making money, right?
I want And I can't just make money or have a living or just being a top 1%.
Like I want, I want so much money in the real reason is because I just want everyone to leave me alone and not hurt, right?
Yeah.
Yeah, that's how I built my defenses up.
21:23
And so it was it was to be just an unheard-of all machine, but it was just because deep down, I was, right?
And so, yeah, the game that I did was to play a game that he had built for me.
And so now the question that I had to ask myself, is what game do I want to play?
21:39
And so, it's been, it's been Illuminating for me to try and redefine my own game.
And I think that for me, my, my decision acquisition.com is the first business that is spawned from my desires rather than from the games and the, the variables that were set out by, you could say, Society, dad, whatever that I had to win, right?
21:59
And so, the new games that I'm trying to play are to Die.
The person who gave Of the most.
And so those are the things that feel aligned with my values.
Not the values that I was trying to prove to other people.
Yeah, I mean I this is a your your conversation interview but I just did MDMA with my dad.
22:21
All right.
So that's like a you yeah.
Ended.
Its, it was not exactly the same.
I would say everything that I hear about you, I have like an order.
I'm it's the same for me, but an order of magnitude less, you know, but it was that competitive best thing going on and, and the Deep seeking of approval.
22:38
And, you know, he told me the same thing when I turn my business, which has And and and and understanding him it was because for him it didn't work in his in his era that wasn't how you did things.
So I totally relate and and separately will try to convince you to do MDMA.
22:55
But for now for now I actually must you want to stay on this.
I wanted to sort of talk about a little bit about the book that you've got and offers and stuff like that.
Is that did you want to stay on this pain?
No.
Go for it because I want to Circle back to business, but it feels really shallow convertible were talking about.
23:10
So I like you I'll bring up a topic.
That's a tie with how shallow you guys.
I'm happy to talk about money when you like I like I enjoyed making money and all the things about it so I'm happy to know this is this is my life man.
I love going in and out.
Like I love sitting up here and talking about like to this had this whole game is bullshit.
23:28
Like this is all silly and it doesn't matter and then fucking screaming when I'm losing it.
How do I get better at this game?
So that's, that's how I live and that's everything.
But in terms of the game, in terms of the offer, one of the like learning listening, You is if you're very pithy, you've got a lot of useful Frameworks that are helpful and one of them that as I watched a video was the, it's like an equation for what an offer is.
23:52
And I don't want to mess it up, but essentially on the top part of it, you know, better than I do.
I'll let you introduce it.
Yeah.
So I think the contribution of that book that maybe the marketing Community, our business Community as a whole like if it were summarized into one thing, you would probably be that equation which is the value equation.
And the reason that it actually came to be was because I was trying to, I was actually this came to me like three years ago.
24:13
Ross building our supplement company.
And when I was doing research on supplements, it turns out that supplements.
So there's twice as much revenue as supplements is.
There are in gems as a whole and I was like, how can that be right?
Because like, Jim's obviously help.
We more people get in shape.
I was like, but but if that works, but the market place values with the market place value.
24:32
So it was like that was kind of the data point that set me on this kind of little path to figure this out.
And so and and trying to compare, like why is this thing?
They both still have the same.
Why is this one worth more?
Why do people pay more for this than this?
And so it came with these four variables and then organize them to an equation that became a fraction which was the value equation.
24:52
So, if we're, if I think we have a video too, so people can see this, right?
So if you, if you draw a line in the middle the screen which is just the fractional line, there's the top of the equations, the numerator and over everybody's remember from grade school, right?
In the denominators of one another.
Okay, so the first part of the equation is dream outcome, which is what is the experience of transformation that a customer is going to go through that?
25:11
We are pro that rather we are promised Saying that they're going to go through, right?
And so this is more to speak that.
In general.
If you have, if I'm talking to men for example and I say I can help you make a million dollars versus I can help you be handsome.
Right, in general, most men will value making a million dollars more than being handsome and you can see that by the size of the men's Beauty Market Compares them making money market for men, right?
25:35
So, it's not that all things, but just in general, this category of items will be higher valued than this category of items.
And so that is the only purpose of this.
First one is what is the experience that we're actually going to be giving and how much value that confer to the ultimate price?
Will charge.
So, it is variable number one.
Now, if two things are the same outcome, let's say it's weight loss, right?
25:56
And I've got a nine dollar ebook and I've got a fifty thousand dollar liposuction surgery, they both have the same outcome.
Why is 150 thousand and one nine dollars because of the other three variables.
So, variable number two, now that we're talking about two two types of solutions to the same in the same vehicle, right?
26:13
Or so the same same destination, but different ways of getting there.
So number two is perceived likelihood of a achievement and to use the liposuction example, if I have two doctors, right?
And one of them has done, what has not done a surgery at they're fresh out of medical school in the other guys, done, 10,000 surgeries and they're both going to do a liposuction surgery, which of these guys would we be more likely to want to work with which of them would be?
26:38
Would we be more likely to want to pay more the tenth out?
We probably ask this guy to pay us to be his first patient, right?
And he wasn't even funnier is that of these two people?
It'll probably take this guy longer so it has nothing to do with time.
He's we're gonna get more work out of this guy's probably harder for this guy.
26:54
That is for this guy's, does it in his sleep but still our perceive likelihood of getting what we want when we buy and the important point is that it confers value to the prospect prior to the purchasing decision.
So the knowledge that this guy's done 10,000 versus the nauseous guys done, zero actually provides value.
27:13
In that can be translated, into increased pricing power to a prospect.
So when I, when you You start your business and your and you've done in 100.
Testimonials I used to joke.
I was like, oh, that because we raised our prices over time and I was like, well, that was my Hundred testimonial price.
I was like, this is my 4,000 testimonial price, because the likely that you achieve this, it would be unreasonable for you to believe that our solution will not work, right?
27:36
So those are the first also seems to be especially in the Internet.
It's almost I don't it appears exponential right when you I guess there's when you're number one in the category and and people just trust that it's you given the time as finite, especially if there's any time Liposuction doctor, he's not just charging three times.
27:52
Like he's Tashi, insane amount of money more in, his clientele are willing to pay for it and part of that is because of the, the delicate dance of desire, right?
The supply demand curve, right?
But we can get in that way.
Yeah, so number one for everybody is dream outcome with the experience was the thing that we're providing.
Number two is the perceived likelihood that the prospect believes that they believe that they will achieve it upon purchase, right.
28:13
Same thing.
If you get the nine dollar ebook, what do you think the likelihood is that?
You can lose fat in your stomach?
Probably pretty small.
You get liposuction.
Ian, what percentage likely do you think that you're going to actually lose fat on your stomach?
Pretty fucking high.
So you mentioned you mentioned testimonials is this is this the variable most influence by marketing then in terms, like if you have a sales page on the Internet, is this is that what the sales page does is it like, tries to confer certain marketing so many ways, the whole That Word of Mouth does not have for a business.
28:38
Because if you think about what just word of mouth is, if you have three friends, who read the book, write said the book was good.
I don't need to have a sales pitch for the book because you already have a perceived likelihood of achieving, a desirable result from reading.
The book.
Right, just itself.
So it fills the whole if you don't have Word of Mouth, but yes, I tell my friend to read it.
28:56
This whole just pull, just read it and you ready to get dirty silly out, that value part of the equation for them.
But yes, 100% to your point.
Yes.
For people who for a New Prospect who doesn't who you are at your marketing or messaging your sales, your stories, your positioning in the marketplace.
Overall is gonna be the thing that's going to confer the perceive like that of achievement.
29:13
So there's the top two.
Got it for us as business owners and entrepreneurs and marketers.
Our goal is to increase this the highest of our ability Right?
We want them to have a beautiful experience, a beautiful beach in Maui that they're envisioning themselves on and up very high likelihood of achievement.
If they buy this thing, they're going to get them out right now.
29:29
Come the other two parts of the equation which is the bottom half these are the detractors.
These are things that take away increased out increased risk, alright.
So the first is time to light so between one I purchased when I'm going to experience the result is.
So as a fun, anecdote for anybody, if you want to create value in the marketplace, look, whatever else is doing and provide the same thing in half the time.
29:49
Easiest way to provide value, right?
But for most people and I want to demonstrate this, right?
So if we had a weight loss example, I use weight loss, doesn't understand that if you were to click a button and by a thousand dollar thing for weight loss, and you're a guy and all of a sudden, you look down at your abs, are your stomach and there's just a six-pack there.
30:07
How unbelievably valuable would that thing?
Be wild?
Oh, yeah, right.
And if you are marketing agency, which I feel like a lot of the marketing world and lots of people have their smas or whatever it is right, if someone's signed up.
As soon as their credit card, ran their phone rings and they pick it up while they're on the phone with you, after just buying and it's like, hey, this is Marc.
30:26
I heard about your company, I just saw some your advertisements.
I'd like to, you know, I'm interested, they be like, holy crap.
And the thing is that the only thing that changed that might still happen, 60, 60 days from now.
But how much more valuable is the service or the product if it happens fast, right?
30:42
And so the goal is that time is a huge component of value fast beats free.
The reason Spotify was able to Go over, even though there is this huge rampant piracy in the market was that it was fast.
That's how they beat free.
And I've got a friend of mine who has I think I probably have 20 locations now, who created like the MVD rather than the DMV in New Mexico and so they got license to the state to provide DMV renewal Services as a private company and their whole shtick is you come in, you pay fifty dollars, you pay 50 bucks to not have to wait, that's it.
31:19
It that's the entire value prop and they kill them.
Yeah, that's TSA PreCheck.
That's all hundred percent.
It's so I'd I wish there was more of that.
It's one of the easiest value things to think of as an entrepreneur is like, how can I do this thing faster.
So, that's the third in the in the in the value equation and the fourth and final is effort and sacrifice and I didn't talk about this as much in the books.
31:38
I'll be able to give the listener.
Something that's unique here, is that effort sacrifice, I see them as two sides of the same coin.
Effort is things that a prospect has to begin doing that.
They were not doing That they do not enjoy as a result of the purchase.
So this might be, if I had a marketing agency, all of a sudden, I've got to start working leads, I have to make ads that I have to give this person.
31:59
I have to make creative, I have to have weekly meetings with the team and blah, blah blah, and all this other stuff that comes as a consequence of the purchase, right?
The flip side sacrifice are what are the things that I enjoy doing that?
I no longer am able to do as a result of the purchase and so a lot of times they're flipped out of the coin like if I'm Susie and I got to wake up early I got to go to the gym now because I'm trying to lose weight.
32:21
Well, I used to sleep in, so that's a sacrifice.
I'm no longer able to sleep in the effort is that I don't have to wake up.
So it's kind of two sides, the same thing but I like I like delineating that you because I think you think differently about things when you when you hear both sides of it.
And so the idea for us is business owners is how can I get the effort and sacrifice as close to zero as humanly possible?
32:41
Because in theory and as I've kind of evolved in the business world, I used to spend the beginning, part of my, entrepreneurial career always focused on the top side.
Always have a bigger promises figure claims.
Lots of testimonials, right?
That was it was all the marketing side of it, right?
But as I got older and we started making more money and I started observing the people who are making far more money than me.
33:01
And the companies are a much bigger.
It became realizing that the way that those guys were providing value was on the more competitively defensible side because anyone can make claims and anyone can have testimonials and Big Marketing and great copying words and stuff.
That's the easy part.
33:16
The hard part is actually having the operational.
Vantage of figuring out the way to provide the thing, faster and provide the thing without effort and sacrifice on behalf the Prospect.
And so, that's why the, in the book I took a ton of the section getting the bottom 20, which is like, in theory for us as entrepreneurs.
33:33
If we could have anything on the top side of the equation, that's positive, but the effort and sacrifice, and time delay was instant, right?
As soon as they purchased it, it was instant.
You would have an infinitely valuable product.
And if you think about like Amazon Netflix, each of these each of these Uber However, each of these companies, has this value proposition in all of the, of the effort and Amazon in there, in there, in there, re investment strategy has been on decreasing effort, and sacrificing and decreasing time to like making things faster.
34:01
Yeah, so I went as well as I'm going through this.
I was thinking of our own business and I love it when I find ways that, I don't know if it's cut, the gordian knot or like, find out.
Oh my gosh.
If I just, you know, frame it differently.
One of the things that I was coming up against at least in my head, if it's not a limiting, belief is the Physics of transformation.
34:21
And so, like, take weight loss for instance, you know, you're doing gym stuff and you can always promised 7-minute at 6-minute.
ABS, can you talk about designing a product that fulfills these like it would seem that finding an offer that did it a bigger thing, more reliably faster and more like that.
34:39
That's just hard to do so operationally and in sort of creating these products.
Like I know I know how I might love to talk about what I do, but how do I make that a thing?
What are the Is that one does in order to actually devised a product that you can realistically handle being talked about in this awesome totally.
34:56
So in the book, you know, the the sexually go over this and so hopefully it's not repented for you guys, but the audience haven't forgotten Something cover this so I think I think thinking about product Improvement is really hard because what does that mean?
Right, but just thinking about what are the problems every single problem in as nuanced details.
35:14
I possibly can about the customer experience both perceived and actual that the customers.
Going through from the from before they start to use the product all the way through the end.
And after the result are experiencing the result of the product every single micro step that occurs on that process.
35:29
How can I lubricate that?
How can I make it faster and easier for them so that when they get to that they just click cheat code and they move through right and so with services this is probably easier right but this is where great product and design comes into play is like, okay.
35:46
Well, I'm use if you have software right?
It's like how many clicks do I need to get?
Get here.
Is there a way that we can reorganize the ux so that we can do this in fewer clicks?
How can we display the information differently?
You know what I'm saying?
You're like, how can you make it?
So the effort in sacrificing trips are training their team in all of that stuff is decreased and minimized so that ultimately the experience is improved.
36:07
Hope you guys enjoy the first part of the two part interview with those guys.
Charlie and Ben are really awesome dudes.
And I think you guys will really dig.
What is coming into part two of this worry.
Dive even deeper.








Company0:00
Real quick.
Because you guys already know that, I don't run any ads on this and I don't sell anything.
And so, the only ask that I can ever have you guys that you help me spread the word so we can have more entrepreneurs, make more money, feed their families, make better products, and have better experiences for their employees and customers.
And the only way we do that is if you can rate and review and share this podcast, so the single thing that I have to do is you can just leave review will take you 10 seconds or one type of the thumb, mean, the absolute world to me.
0:25
And more importantly, it may change the world of someone else, if it breaks out, how I learned how to consistently.
Only generate leads independent of platforms and the key piece that I was missing in multiple different platforms, going to tell you five key stories that are my life that a massively impacted, how effective my marketing was as a result of the exchange, welcome to the game, where we talked about it, get more customers how to make more per customer and how to keep them longer in the many failures and lessons.
0:48
We have learned along the way.
I hope you enjoy and subscribe.
So a few high-level observations before I dive into this, the first thing is there's a setting in our community called, do the boring work and a lot of times we don't confront the work that we that must be done because it's not exciting or sexy and it feels somehow like it's beneath us, you know, prospecting and doing a hundred dollars a day can feel tedious, you know, posting and repurposing the same content across lots of different resources, can feel tedious, you know, reaching out to people, you know, and asking if they know someone who might be interested in your products or Services might feel tedious.
1:22
Or creating, you know, a hundred isn't add variations with different Hooks and headlines can seem tedious.
It's very easy to understand very hard to do mostly because people don't have the discipline and the work ethic to go through the board work which kind of leads to the second one here which is that there's a saying between my closest friend and I dr.
1:39
Kashi violence is the answer.
Sometimes when you have this outcome that you must achieve in your life because of the goals and insecurities that we have set upon ourselves that just being violent with the level of activity that we are doing.
Ultimately get us much closer than, you know, the nuances and the skill that sometimes we like to project and pretend matter more than just physically doing a Shear higher volume of work.
2:04
Number three is that if you do more than you are doing right now, you will get more than you currently have.
And that is a promise, and you can take that to the bank.
And number four is do what matters most first.
So right now, you probably have lots of things that, you know, fill up your day in the morning, all that kind of stuff.
But the things there are only four activities that will actually generate more business for you.
2:22
Period that is new.
All right.
Number one is reaching out to people, you know, there were two is posting to an audience that you know number three is reaching out to people who don't know 101.
And number four is is advertising, right?
There's the four, only four ways you can get new clients, right?
2:39
And so, if you're not doing one of those four things, and you're struggling to get customers, you're not doing lots of those four things as your primary activities, then that is probably one of the reasons that you don't have the amount of customers that you wish you have.
All right?
And so what I want to do is take this quick moment to introduce.
Reduce an equation that I've thought a lot about, but it's v x as X date.
2:57
So, volume tone skills have is time and this is kind of a flywheel that feeds itself and which, and I'll get to the actual like wording behind this, but essentially, the more volume you do, the better you are at and longer you do it.
The more throughput you will ultimately have the more outcome, the more clients, the more sales, the more leads you will ultimately have from doing.
3:18
All right?
So let's dive into this in a little bit more.
So in other words and this is based on Like pure foundational principles of logic, right?
The more we do the better, we get the better we did.
The more we do, because we like it because we're better at it right?
In the lumber we do something, the better we get the better, we get the longer, we do it, the longer we do it, the more of what we did compounds on itself and this is the same reason.
3:40
Why if you start doing cold out, bouncer.
Start building a pipeline starts, a compound on itself and you start doing business over a long enough period of time, they're just becomes.
This is larger and larger audience of people who know you for doing this.
Thing, right.
And I'll show you a couple examples and some of the stories examples we have today that will show you how compounding massively affected my life.
4:01
And so in this way each of these, three variables, volume skill and time feed each other but it all starts with doing.
And so these are the three we're going to focus just on volume today because I want to be mindful of your time.
And so I'll tell you a quick example of this.
So this is probably a decade ago.
4:18
I'm starting my gym, first business, I own a real business, Diane and Sometimes like I should run flyers.
I was like, okay, cool.
So I went out I did, you know, a bunch of flyers and, you know, didn't really work for me.
And so, you know, a few months later, I was talking to a friend of mine who had, you know, multiple successful locations you doing well and I was like, hey, you know, I did, he's like, you should do flyers.
4:41
I was like, nah, I did that.
It didn't work for me is like, well, you know, what was your, what was your test eyes?
And I was like test eyes.
What do you mean?
He was like well how many do you test before you?
You know?
Oh about girls like let me not put 300 out and he was like 300 like total.
4:57
And I was like well yeah, he's like I don't even test for less than five thousand Fliers and all of a sudden I was like, whoa.
He's like yeah, he's like I'll put out a hundred thousand Flyers a month he's like and I'll get a half a percent or percent back.
He's like who walk through the door?
5:13
He's like, yeah, but hundred thousand fliers of percent back.
I get 30 people a day.
Walk in my store and I was like holy cow my understanding.
Standing of the sheer volume for the activity that I thought wasn't working was just dramatically under what it really was supposed to be.
5:31
And in that moment, I had a belief broken about what volume really means.
This happens all the time and I'll tell you a couple other examples in a second, but like this happens all the time.
Even like Fitness stuff.
People are like, man, why can't he get jacks?
And I'm like, you know, why can't I grow my arms?
It's like, alright, well, how many sets of arms you do every week and they're like, why train arms twice a week.
5:50
I'm like, what are you doing?
I'm like, well, you know, like three sets ten times.
Like, is it like, for a week?
Like, so six total sets.
They're like, yeah, I'm like, well, try 12 sets, six days a week and I guarantee your arms will go out there.
Like, seriously like yeah, imagine that the more you do, the more you look like you can do.
6:07
So I'll give you a different one that I had.
This isn't it in a paid ads example, which is similar to Flyers just a different platform.
Hey guys, love that you're listening to the podcast.
If you ever want to have the video version of this, which usually has more effects, more More graphs, you know, drawn out stuff.
6:24
Sometimes it can help hit the brain centers in different ways.
You can check out my YouTube channel.
It's absolutely free.
So check that out if that's what you are into and if not keep enjoying the show, I had a an agency owner who is walking who's talking to us in within our software company and he was like, Hey, you know, my leafless Doling out.
6:43
I can't seem to scale above a certain mouth, it was like, okay, well, you know how many pieces of creative are you putting out, you know, per week.
And he was like he was he confidently answered, right?
So he was like, he's like he's like that we have on point.
He's like, we're putting out like five to ten pieces of content week and I was like per week, he's like, yeah.
7:01
And I was like div and I scrolled over I shared my screen of my creative.
Moment, it was like we're testing 30 pieces, every three days.
He's like what I was like.
Yeah, it's level of output, quantity of output.
7:17
The level of most people dramatically underestimate how much work it takes to make money, right?
The thing is, once you understand and for most people, and this is the point that I'm hoping somebody who's like housing on their first customer wants to start a new channel.
If you already have one working, is you usually need to do a lot more because yours s.
7:35
Equation, your skill level is low and you have no time that has compounded for you.
So you must compensate with extraordinary volume so that you can learn the skill.
And then begin the compounding process that will give you the throughput or outcome that you desire.
And so, a lot of times you got to do a lot more in the beginning to get the ball rolling, all right?
7:54
And when I was talking to Grant about his, his overarching content strategist, I came in, you know, how many pieces, what's the framework that you use?
And he was like brow.
And this is actually this was in a difficult.
Ahead of them this.
Not on the channel.
He's like, bro, someone trying to sell you a framework.
He's like, they're just trying to sell you something.
8:10
He's like it's about 10x and he said that it and he wasn't saying it in a pejorative way.
He meant it genuinely.
He's like, dude, he's like we just take Massive Action.
He's like we just try and be omnipresent.
He's like, look at your Instagram.
Look at my scripts, we pull him up and he's like, I'm hosting six times a day.
8:28
He's like, I'm posting 15 times a day on Twitter and she's like, you just pull up every one of them.
Compared them to mine.
He's like, he's like I'm just doing way more than you.
And I was like, man and he's been doing it for 10 years longer, right?
And so that was a huge Epiphany for me.
8:43
And then for me, I switch from one time a week. 21 times a day and here's what's crazy.
My growth organically 40 axed from a 7x increase in effort.
So there is a multiplicative effect here because sure, we did more but we got better at the doing and then the more we did, the more each of those other pieces fed one another, right?
9:04
And so again all of this Starts with the doing and taking a lot more than most people anticipate to get the result and get going.
And so this is a different Nuance on volume.
This is more level of effort, but I think it Bears mentioning because for this concept to kind of sink in, I want to hit it from a couple different angles.
9:23
So this is the number one video or at this time is one of the number one videos on the channel and I made this like a month ago and the thing is, is like, and I realized that quality most times This quantity, right?
And the thing is is but quality and quantity Trump's just quantity, right?
9:42
Or just quality.
And so this particular piece of content took me 20 hours to actually put the slide back together and then two days of travel to go film and then gone lo and behold ends up being you know the number one thing on there and to me I was like well that's not really surprising.
I spent a ton of time on this and so it was just and like I'm just saying if I get reminded of this, at all levels of the game, you know what I mean?
10:02
And so I'm making these videos because like, as I'm learning it, I'm sharing it so that hopefully it provides some value to you.
Like it just takes a lot more work than most people think like Layla.
This is 45 years ago when we were re filming an entire content portal.
So she had probably recorded God.
10:19
I don't know 70 or so videos with, you know, trainings and everything and she got down.
And she was like I don't think these are that.
Good and cheers.
And I was like, like she's like I just, I don't know.
I don't know if they're like getting the way.
I want them to be there.
Like just not as crisp and we Out there and I was like Dhoom Again, she looks at me and she was like yeah you're right because the thing is just like and I've said this before and I'll keep saying it, like your work looks on you more than you work on it.
10:47
The thing we're developing is our character because that's the Ultimate Prize that we get at the end of the race.
Right?
We can't keep this stuff than we have with us.
And so we're doing this work to become better people, right?
And so, if you do it again, it's no, it's nothing, bad about it, you're just like cool, I get more practice and doing the thing and my sis is going to get better.
11:05
In the throughput equation.
So even if you did the same in terms of volume of output, the skill on the equation, the S is going to be higher.
So you're still going to actually still get more throughput even if you do the same effort again, right?
And so, that's why the level of effort and giving a shit for lack of a better term.
11:21
And really working, like, violence is the answer doing the boring work and putting the time under the bar in to use a finis analogy is what is required and most people dramatically underestimate the volume.
All right.
And so I'm going to tell you this last one to wrap.
This prep this little piece up which is I wrote this book, right?
11:40
It took me basically like a year, right?
It it took me two weeks to write, it took me a year to edit it and right now I get DM's everyday like what is the second book coming out?
And so right now I'm on the fifth version of book to end to end.
I had a completely copy copyright at edited from a professional editor and that was version 1 and I've since Made for More version since then, but the thing is, is the difference between that level of effort is why.
12:05
Many times, I think things don't work out is that most people put, like, a 7 out of 10 effort or an 8 out of 10 effort.
And then, look at somebody, who put a 10/10 effort and, and think, well, I didn't put that much less effort in, but you don't realize the difference between 88 and attend.
Might be five times the work, but also the different scene in Aden.
12:22
It 10 might be 100 times the outcome and to the actual net outcome.
On the incremental, increase in work is still worth it.
That's what's crazy.
Is that if it takes five times, the effort to go from an 8 to a 10, Might get a hundred times, even though you needed five times more work.
12:39
And so this is one of these beliefs that I have ingrained in myself with, in how we do business.
But I'm sharing it with you because most things that most people make suck most products suck, most marketing sucks, most businesses suck, and most people suck at the things that they think they're good at, right?
12:56
And it's because they don't even know how to work, even know how to do it.
And I'll tell you this final story throughout this up when I was a legal intern in a past lifetime.
At a chemical company called Arc Emma in France, believe it or not, I work there in the legal department and this older more experienced you know senior lawyer of in the department kind of like tap I was like I'm going to go back to work and she like tap my shoulder and she was like you don't even know how to work and I was like what do you mean?
13:21
And she was like you're so young.
She's like you don't even know what work really is.
And it just hit me and it struck me like, to my quarks.
I was like, how could you tell me that?
I don't know how to work.
But here I am 10 years. 15 years later.
I think Stuff like, man, I had no idea what work even looks like, because I don't even know how to focus the way.
13:40
You know, I didn't know how to eliminate distractions.
I didn't know what it looked like to just put rep after rep, after rep after rep in to just get that thing, just right.
And the Beautiful Thing, especially when it comes to marketing stuff, is that, when you make those each of those posts, each of those outreaches, each of those calls, each of those ads that you run make, you better, they increase the S.
14:02
And so, in that way, the V, the S and the T, the I'm the skill in the time, work on each other and then yield you a higher throughput because they are multiplicative not additive and that's like the one thing that if I can drive this home is that most people just do so much less volume than they think.
14:18
Because and then they look at the vehicle that they're using.
And think, why is this not working?
When the reality was that you were not working because you did not know how much work really was required to get to where you wanted to go.
And so with that, in other words, most times you just need to do more than what you're currently doing in a lot more.
14:35
Or of it.
Okay.
So if you don't know me like I said, my name's Oxfam ozi own acquisition.com or business investors are portfolio.
Does about 85 million dollars a year and I have nothing to sell you those Nation keep rocking.








0:00
It was a nation, what's up?
This is second part of my interview.
With / coaching call with Ben and Charlie from Charisma on command.
In this section, we talk about three main things.
One is my business equation for what I think about in terms of how to build amazing and wonderful businesses that's been off cash flow like clockwork.
0:16
Secondly, how to look for and higher amazing talents that they can actually run that machine for you and then finally, the meaning of life according to Aristotle, which is one of my, one of my grandfather's are my good homies.
And so I hope you guys buckle.
Up and enjoy part 2.
Not that you're gonna be the best in the world.
0:33
At this one thing, it's that if you can be decent at seven things, you'll be number one at those seven things.
When combined, welcome to the game, where we talk about it, get more customers how to make more per customer and how to keep them longer in the many failures and lessons.
We have learned along the way.
I hope you enjoy and subscribe.
0:50
And so you give a concrete example of what, like not even necessarily a gym launched like a how a fitness trainer you know somebody who like understands like you're going to have to eat healthy foods, that's going to set up, you're going to have to exercise like how can this person talk about something as difficult to to transform as physical fitness, which is diet and exercise.
1:09
Yeah.
How can they talk about it and create a product that beats other physical fitness trainers.
So the first big step one is delineating every single problem that the person is going to encounter all the Just that they're going to have to have the efforts in the sacrificing that they'd start doing things.
They've stopped it right and so the things they have start doing it's like they have to like if we're going sequence here, right?
1:29
They're going to leave with some sort of plan of some sort now hopefully you have that building them a plan as part of the thing that you're selling the right.
But after that there then gonna have to go to the grocery store.
So we have to ask the questions how they're going to know, which door to go to.
Are they gonna have to go to multiple stores when they go to the store?
How are they going to find the things they're looking for?
1:45
What brands?
Are they going to need to buy?
How much of them, right?
All of those questions arise.
These are all the things people.
Get stuck on.
So, say okay.
Well then, how can I solve this problem of grocery shopping?
I haven't even gotten to one, click grocery delivery or some like, you know, you got the plan.
I'm just going to send the food to your house or I'm gonna send the food in a chef to your house where I'm going to send.
2:03
Yeah, so yeah, so I'm going to take the grocery store example.
So, in the book I have the delivery tube which is six different ways you can look different lenses.
You can look at the product for, right?
But just just for groceries because this is the first part we have even got into cooking.
We haven't gotten a meal prepping it out.
We haven't gone to actually showing the first workout just groceries.
2:19
All right.
So, if I were trying to help them with this one problem, I could say, okay, well I could have a do-it-yourself grocery calculator that I could build so that it would have just based on their weight and their goals their calories, and it would adjust for them.
Another ways I could already have a premade book based on the weeks that they could, they could go through.
2:36
And by that way, I could do a grocery store tour, right?
Where I take a big group of them out and we go buy groceries together.
I could record that tour and give it as a virtual product.
I could put people together as a buddy system and say, hey, hey, you're not going to go, we're going to go with an alumni and going to go together and you're going to do that for the first two months of working with me until you have the skill, right?
2:56
Or I could personally take them grocery shopping or to your point.
I could pre make the list load into instacart and then send it to their house.
I could also create a an alliance or an affiliation with some sort of meal prep company as an additional solution that would be done for you, right?
So like all of these are just different ways.
3:12
I mean, another one would be because I have I'm just going through the delivery of my head.
If I said, okay, you can go grocery shopping but I will be on call for phone or text.
Ford at any time if you get stuck during your shopping spree, I won't be with you but I will be there to support you and you can text me a picture of anything and I'll immediately respond to you.
3:29
One of the books, they just had a ton of influence on me is essentialism, I'm not afraid of it, but it's the discipline idea of less is more.
How does that idea?
Because it seems like it may compete with this, you know, the idea that being there all the time, having ten different ebooks, for this person, potentially to read and six different numbers that they can call in all of this stuff.
3:48
Do you see that as being competitive with this idea?
A of solving, every micro problem that this person might experience in their in their Journey.
I don't think it is.
I'm trying to think about the Nuance between the difference because when I delineate, all of these different things that we just had as a different ideas on how we would solve that problem, we would through trial, and error figure out with the highest likelihood success.
4:10
So, like, if I had to pick of all of these, the most likely would be high preload instacart with their stuff.
Got it?
That would be the most glitches, right?
Simple.
Yeah, simple knot at the grocery store.
Not answering the question.
We're just using this as an ideation process for everyone who's listening.
So you can find out whatever problem.
You're trying to solve, there is a unique way to solve the problem that the prospect more importantly will perceive as an easy solution and to your point.
4:33
Every single time we've made iterations in our services and we have education components for our licensing business, right?
Every new improved version of it gets shorter, not longer.
It's always come last and that's why the book was small because it took me four versions of the book to get it down to 160 pages.
4:53
So that my goal was that someone could read it in one sitting, that was the goal of the book ever made each of the books that will happen.
It did.
Yeah.
So 100 percent in terms of Simplicity but for you from the ideation process, the ideation process you can be all over the place but then that's why the fourth step is trim.
5:11
And stack is how am I going to trim and trim and trim down to the few things that I have the absolute most value or perceived value in the prospects mind and then once you go through a handful of customers, you'll also learn more and get feedback and say they're still having trouble with this.
I have to somehow reach week, this solution, and this one, they don't value so I can cut it out.
5:30
And this is requiring, it sounds like real time or at least serve a interaction with your customers.
So that you're seeing like one, what are these problems?
I mean, even think of grocery shopping as a problem, you know.
So I've got to be next to them or asking them these sorts of questions and then receiving or soliciting feedback about how did that go?
5:46
What did you like, those sorts of things go into the final version of the product?
Yeah, and especially for newer entrepreneurs, I tend to be attentive leaving, kind of like, the Tesla ideology a starting at the top of the pyramid and the working our way down.
So that you know, the Tesla first Tesla Roadster was Whatever, 500,000.
6:01
Whatever is a lot of money, right?
And then the next one was I think, was 250,000.
The next thing that came out with was the hundred thousand or car and then you know, years later they came out with that 30,000 or version and so I think that people would be best served starting with done for you, kind of operationally heavy solutions for people.
6:18
And that's because you simply don't know enough.
And so it's do the expensive coat Consulting work.
That is not scalable to get paid to learn more about how to solve problems for your prospects.
So that You will be able to then have a brand story, right?
6:33
For yourself about how you started at this price anchor and how you can provide this level because it's anchored to this price of value at a lower mid-tier price, which might be a done with you rather than done for you solution, with all of the learnings you have from.
And this mirrors, the experience that I had was just like I had six gems and then I did two years doing turnarounds.
6:54
Where I flew out and actually literally did every aspect of it before.
I was like okay our licensing solution will work for Jim's.
Whereas the vast majority of people are like well he's doing a licensing thing.
I'll do a licensing thing but they didn't do the path that got us there and that's why they don't replicate the success.
Yeah, makes sense.
7:09
Then I know that you'd want to ask about personal business question.
I do.
So this is where we use our podcast in order to get coaching.
That would otherwise quite expensive, but it has a 5 Subscriber YouTube channel and has burned out from right.
7:27
So, for all for all those people listening, the question is, we have made three hundred plus videos and to date it has been the engine of our business.
That's how we form a relationship with people, create credibility, and create desire for mastering Charisma, and then we give them a program.
7:45
That Masters Charisma.
I am curious because we have tried to hire for a number of roles we thought.
Well, maybe the YouTube channel Have to be the backbone of the company.
Maybe we can just get a really good marketer.
And so we did a multi-month search.
8:00
Pretty much got my ideal person if I could have before the search.
Like I was like, oh, I would love to poach this person.
We got that person, but it didn't end up working out.
And then I've secondly been, it's been hard to find someone who can write content at the level that we would be proud to publish it.
8:16
And so the, I getting out of the business From The Bottom, Rung, and being an owner and a strategist like you are has been something.
I've personally struggled with And I was curious, how do you find the right people?
Because I know your big thing is.
I don't hire talented people who I need to train.
8:32
I hire people with pre-existing skills.
How do you go about that?
Because it has been something that I have either misjudged in the sense that I went this person is going to crush it.
They have the pre existing skills or I've gone.
I don't know how to find someone with a pre-existing skill of knows a ton about Charisma and is good at writing scripts and so I'm just curious.
8:51
If you have any suggestions or advice on ways, I might We go about this and I will answer this as a off the cuff of me thinking for it out loud.
Rather than saying sure straight did you know, Alex is definitive answer if I were in this position.
9:06
What I'd be thinking through like, well, Justin Bieber is like, I just can't find someone to sing, like I can on stage so that I can Outsource my Justin Bieber brand, you know what I mean?
So like, sometimes I think there are some businesses that are more and more difficult to do that with.
Yeah, I feel I feel like a mix of a business and an artist.
9:24
Yeah.
And I think that's normal.
And so, I think the first thing that I would do is I'd see if I could chunk chunk down the actual activities.
Are you familiar?
Nothing of erotic on II?
Talk about some of this stuff cuz I like his stuff a lot but he talks about specific knowledge being not that you're gonna be the best in the world.
9:40
At this one thing, it's that if you can be decent at seven things, when you combine those seven things, that's what creates you'll be number one at those seven things when combined, right.
And so, I think a lot of Entrepreneurship and why you guys have been exceptional at your thing is that you were good.
Okay.
Camera.
You understand scriptwriting, you also understand YouTube, you also like good-looking young guy like you know me there's there's off and then when you combine all those things then you become boom.
10:03
Number one at this type of thing.
And so if I could chunk down because you're not going to be fine, be able to find out a you because there's only one of you, right?
But if can I find the number one at these seven or eight skills, they've put together and it might take a village to try and replace you and I'll stay within the business that I had on the licensing.
10:24
It took me two years to replace my like, it was a two-year long process to replace me.
And and I speak candidly about the fact that the now part of this might have been because there is this pandemic that went around at the same time as I step down.
So that might have influenced that, you know, the income numbers.
10:40
So that's not a slight at the teamwork.
I'm saying this because my team might also listen to us but I was willing to make the trade-off to get the time back, right?
I was willing to make half as much from that particular entity in order to get 100% of Of the time that I was, you know, not a hundred ninety percent of the time that I was allocating there.
10:58
So how do you do it?
I think you chunk down and then you'll still be left with something and so this might be the one fallacy that I can hopefully share is that we have this illusion as entrepreneurs.
That we're going to quote, replace ourselves and turn our business into passive income, right?
It is my opinion that nothing is passive and it's just, you have varying degrees of active.
11:18
And so even even if I were to somehow, you know, roll everything into Person who all of my companies rolled into Sodor place myself right?
Well, who does that person reports it right?
It's so like you're only just you're consolidating, you're aggregating but never really eliminating.
11:37
And I think that simply eliminating the false, the fallacy, the false belief that that we are failing at complete passiveness.
Somehow sometimes can solve the problem by realizing that it's not a problem to be solved, but just something that needs to be diminished and is not a binary of yes or no.
11:53
But to what degree It's a Continuum and I think if shift that way, then you can look back two years from now and say, am I more or less involved in the business than I was?
And if the answer is high in 50% or 75% less involved in the business and we're still making the same money, then I would say I'm doing a great job.
12:10
I'm going to keep using this direction rather than I'm not past it yet.
I suck sure.
Well, I'm much less active in been is much more active so it turns out there's not a lot of us.
So what, in terms of hiring, do you have tips?
12:28
And then, I believe that I've heard you again, I've heard kind of heard you speak about this but one of the ask for clarification, I think so many things in business.
Are you developed an instinct and you just kind of know after a lot of time and that's life as well.
But in terms of knowing, if you've got the right person for the job about how much time do you feel like is appropriate before you get that that instinct that and allow it to kick in and our do you have any tips and tricks are particular things to look for?
12:54
To know if this is someone who needs time and TLC and training or if this, is it likely to not work out that that is an area that I think we are very deficient.
Oh, I'll hold on.
Oh there's hold on so many funds there too long.
So many fun times on this one.
Okay, consolidate some stuff for the audience so in the 40 to 1 million is about promotion.
13:13
All right one to ten million is about product, 10 to 100 million is about people.
Right?
And so that's the that is directed at everyone goes through.
First first, false belief is that I have like an impeccable picker.
You just get better.
You never, you never get perfect, right?
13:29
Just as I'm just throwing it out there.
It's just that my error rate is lower than it used to be, but it's not that it's somehow, like I have eliminated are I?
We still make that hires.
But these are the thought processes and this is kind of this might be interesting for you guys, is that resume will have three times the predictive power of interviewing in terms of getting the success.
13:47
Yeah, successive people in the world.
Now mind you in a perfect world, you'd have ten good resumes and then you pick off of interviews, right?
That's kind of the the How you would solve for both of those, right?
Because then you look for culture, fit know, that kind of stuff, but in terms of skills, track record is going to be, is going to be the greatest predictor that they're going to be able to do the same thing again.
14:07
Right?
And so and as specific as possible.
So rather than like this person was in marketing, it's this person handled Marketing in a YouTube channel that was at 10 million or higher.
And so ideally, you want someone who's who's a little bit above where you are, but not so far that they've forgotten where you are now.
Hey, Moe is an Asian quick break, just to let you know that we've been starting to post on LinkedIn and want to connect with you.
14:30
Alright so send me a connection request.
A note letting me know that you listen to the show and I will accept it.
There's anyone you think that would be should be connected with tag them in one of my or laila's posts?
And I will give you all the love in the world.
All right, so let's get back to the show.
So, and you're poaching.
14:46
It sounds like, you know, you're like, finding that person and their, they've got a job and they're, you know, and you're going.
I want that guy or that gal.
Yes.
So in, this is again, higher level, right?
So, when you're playing beginner beginner business and I'm saying this with love to all business owners, that's not, I'm not saying there's a pejorative thing, but like when you're going to do a million, most the times you got to, you got to train people because you kind of can't afford, really, really good people.
15:09
You can't the business economics right there, right?
So you have to take undervalued labor and add value through your own Eels, and that's how you end up having still making a profit with low labor costs.
Right?
And then you know I want to 10 mil.
You can you can you can hire people with some level of skill and you can still use job ads and job placements and things like that and you still get decent people.
15:26
Once you start Crossing in the two hundred thousand, five hundred thousand, dollar-a-year threshold, those people are always employed there, never not employed.
Yeah they're never not employed.
So and every company that they've ever been employed will work really hard to keep them.
So those are people that are have to, you've got to trade them out of the position, they're in to come.
15:44
For you.
Now, in terms of the characteristics, I'm going to be borrowing this from Warren Buffett, but I think he's a pretty good source.
And so I will share with you what he has shared with me, personally, in our many talks together, right?
A few looks for intelligence, which I Define.
16:00
As I just missed that down to Super relevant experience within the and having solved.
The problem that I'm looking to solve, right?
I'm hiring for Solutions, I'm not hiring for positions, and I think if we can be Very clear about what problem we were trying to solve will be much better at defining.
16:17
The problem we get much more clear about the solution.
So number one is he says intelligence.
I just defined that a little bit more Nuance to to has this person solve the problem in a business just like mine.
The second is, is he calls it energy?
I call it work ethic, right?
And the way that you would judge that for me is what's the speed of response?
16:34
When were interacting with this person?
If I ask them for something, how quickly do they get it to me?
Just general communication style?
Because we like to move quickly, and I know that if they're not moving quickly during the interview process, Not going to expect it to move faster afterwards.
That is how I measure that.
And then the third is character, right?
16:50
Which is difficult.
But if he says Integrity, but just, I would say character in general and the underpinnings of that, which is the fourth piece is, do they have a long-term perspective?
Can they think in longer time Horizons?
And that's so important, especially, as you get leadership positions.
17:05
And because at each level of the business, you're in the beginning, you're replacing tasks, you're replacing doing right, and then you're replacing I'm managing, and then you're replacing leadership and then you're replacing efficient Innovation, and, and decision making.
17:23
So, each of these levels, right?
The things that were replacing become more intangible and harder to find, which is why most people can succeed and don't scale their businesses because it's harder to look for leadership by.
But that's like the, when we're approaching these, these interviews, we keep it front of mine, which is like, what am I looking for right now?
17:42
They got on the interview because they have to track.
Okay, the correspondence has been Speedy ish.
What I'm really looking for is the character that I think can lead this component in the company and do they have the teeth to really want to drive?
Which a lot of people don't got it right?
17:58
And you still do so you just have fewer mistakes.
Yeah, the the big thing that, I mean we, if we shifted would be to Target our Outreach, much more instead of like posting a job post or like a even, even a page I post on LinkedIn which did Net.
18:14
Good applicants is to go know the industries that were looking for a bit better.
And go that's the person you want to come, right?
My videos or do my thing and go track them down and be like you're the person we want you.
What we got to do to mean, I would say for our marketing for a market position we did offer several hundred grand and we actually did poach.
18:35
Yeah, both of our top two candidates were currently employed but we is going way off.
I don't know what stuff this with pockets but Are we are not willing to do some of the marketing strategies that have been successful at other places and so someone might come in and say, hey we want to run discounts that only certain people will know about.
18:55
And so it's not unfair because the other people won't know about it.
We go well, pretend ever knew about it.
Would people be upset that this to happen because you have they're not going to know and we just we just don't feel comfortable doing it.
Yeah.
And that was not something.
I had a good grasp on.
Was like how exactly this person?
So, okay, you took, I'm gonna make this up to, you know, two million to 10 million.
19:14
What were the exact strategies that you did?
I just saw you took two million to 10 million and a video that sells self-improvement courses just like us.
You're perfect, you know?
Yeah.
And so I think where I, where we are, particularly a pain in the butt for marking people is our definition of honesty or doing, right?
19:32
By clients is annoying to most marketing people that we hire.
They find it inconvenient and it's great.
Yeah, it's short for Montford, right long-term, hmm.
If you thought that long-term that just going to approach, Actually met you more money forever, maybe be more inclined to do it, but I don't think you think that I think that you think that would be a short-term strategy and long-term you'd lose brand equity and for both reasons.
19:54
I well, even if it would long-term, I don't know what I think.
I said, I solve my money problems.
So if I'm trading a tiny bit of my own personal morality or Integrity for more, it's just like, I don't you really don't need that things are too good for me to give a damn.
So that's that's kind of the the other thing and and to, you know, to the credit of all the people that have come for us.
20:12
I've watched a lot of your videos and And I go Alex could help guys with our business, but not with our fucking with not with our Drive.
I've been kicking back and enjoying and I watched your video that you talked about the gym that you worked at where the ball said be here at 9:00 a.m. and he locked the door and everybody who came in after 9 a.m. was fired.
20:31
And I'm the guy who shouldn't the boss, who shows up at 9:05, you know, I just don't set the standard at a level, but what I think is still wonderful and that I do like about it is that I think we have a lot of Happy.
People who work here and enjoy working here and it is, I don't know.
20:48
I like it.
I'm not, I'm not too, will be liable Godless?
Yeah, you're not alone.
You're not going to show up at night.
Yes, exactly.
We've aligned values and, and it probably isn't the value of 100 million dollar company, but we can grow slowly, maybe not.
I mean there's hedge funds that that operate that way they manage zillions of dollars.
21:05
Yeah, so I don't, ya think it's just I think if you're being Integris to what you believe, then I think that will always win out in the end and you can attract and look for people, I was going to add More note that I think might be viable for you in terms of that interviewing process.
But my wife talk to this a lot Layla.
If you see her Channel, her shell is super super like it's really good on building infrastructure because that's how the companies that we all.
21:24
She's.
Really the one who's building that but if what is her Channel, shaft angle for Mosey.
It's my name.
That's England front of it.
You guys got to find a way to do it.
It's so funny, man, because you you now pop up on my home pages, YouTube thing.
If you ever want to chat You Through, by the way, I don't know.
If you have somebody that's helping you, I'm happy to sit down and talk thumbnails titles, all that kind of stuff is horrible, you stamp so yeah.
21:44
You can definitely help because it's also interesting that she's not popping up on my homepage.
Given, how much similarity there, YouTube?
Would, imagine.
So there's there's some things that you guys can do to cross-pollinate as well.
I appreciate it, she says this process and I like it.
A lot is that she uses the interview process and one point you're saying directly reach out.
22:01
You can also just hire Headhunter.
So at this point, now we just have several headhunting firms that we know that a reputable.
We know the owners and we just, they know exactly what they're looking for.
And so, it makes it so much faster and easier for us because I just write a check in the problem solved.
And I have, and I have three.
Beautiful candidates.
We make a pick it's just it's just way faster that way and sometimes the people that like, so I just hired I'll tell you guys this is cool.
22:20
So on Monday, my new executive assistant starts, very said about this.
She was nice Sheldon adelson's for 10 years and he just recently passed.
There's this wasn't.
So she happened to have been on the job market at the exact moment that I needed an executive assistant and for those who don't know he was a these were thirty three billion dollars.
22:40
So I'm not quite there but hopefully I'll learn from some stuff from her butt.
But yeah, it's like those people exist, it's crazy and using the interview process itself as a learning process for you.
So, when you talk to, let's say 10 of these high level marketing people and you asked know, specifically, what would you do?
22:56
Because that is part of our interview process.
I want to know, specifically what you would do.
We like we had one guy was like, wow, I'm not going to share that with you.
So you have mirror like next, right?
So another guy, and then he wrote this massive thing about how we were horrible.
And it's so unprofessional to expect that.
And I was like, thank God, we didn't hire you and so so that Two other guys, were all I would do this.
23:15
I would do this, I would do this.
I would do this.
And the thing is by the tenth interview, we've got a list of like, 30, really, good ideas.
And we have other guys were like, what do you think about this?
Is like, oh, I have experience with this thing's.
So the interviews get better and better and better as we get more, really nuanced information and solutions from people who have already done it.
23:32
And so we actually get it's like a two-sided learning process and I think that even thinking about it that way, shifts the perspective of like God it's such a waste of time.
We interview all these people to this is a learning process for me, just as much as it is an interview for them.
Cool.
Interesting.
Is there a did you have other stuff that you wanted to do on the hiring piece?
23:49
I know that that was a big thorn in your side.
I wish there were a magic cure, you know, I think what I've been, I've been aiming for what you described, which is you're not going to get the person, but maybe you can get someone that takes half the work away.
And so that's what I've shifted.
What I'm aiming for is like, okay, I'm not going to be able to just send a title and the topic and have them write it record it send it over to our editor and I'm not involved, but maybe they can do a bunch of early research and a first draft.
24:13
Draft such that I do have to work.
So that's that is where I'm actually leaning.
I was just kind of hoping you'd have some magic Alex for mozi bullet that I didn't know about where I could clone myself but lobotomize him so he loves working and hates fun but it's money until I kids money till I can do that.
24:31
No.
Yeah he loves.
Yeah.
He hates Yates money.
He hates sunshine and surfing and my clone.
No.
I mean I think like your your advice is exactly what I'm going to try to pursue.
So it's comforting to know that.
That's at least in the right direction.
24:47
So, okay.
Well then I'll start to bring us back home and we can wind down with sort of a follow-up.
You talked about, you know, flying private is really cool.
All this stuff is really cool.
You're getting to do what you like I without using the term happy.
But I will use the term happy.
Maybe Joy is a better word.
25:05
What is bringing?
You Joy?
What is working?
Because he like you said, you solve your money problems.
And these are the problems that you're that.
You're solving now is, is, are these interviews and these kinds of King videos for acquisition in those challenges.
If you find that joyous I've you have you found a way to solve your.
I don't know.
Joy problem that all humans face now that you're really yeah probably more heavily focused on that.
25:24
So I've been looking into this lot this is probably as he probably 25 to 30 percent of my time is focused on kind of these types of questions.
And so what's really interesting is that I think Aristotelian so Aristotle like kind of made this this point and is actually gave me a lot of Solace and thinking about it.
25:44
But it was that you cannot see whether a man's life was, well lived, until after he is, he's dead.
And I thought that was for me.
It actually gave me a lot of comfort because it was like, so then it decreases the pressure that I have in terms of how to always try and create meaning because meaning is actually created posthumously.
26:01
So rather than think as I'm doing something, is this thing meaningful?
Instead I could finish my we can then look back and say I will ascribe this meaning to these activities.
And that that is actually been very helpful for me.
In terms of the meaning in life, I'm borrowing this from a friend of mine who quoted Albert Camus, who's a Moroccan I believe in rock and philosopher.
26:24
He said the meaning of life is the reason you don't kill yourself and it's not super it's super morbid but it's also kind of true right?
Like whatever the reason we get like what like if you think about why would I not see this way?
Well whatever the actual first or second answer that you have is your meaning.
And I thought that that was actually really, really Powerful.
26:40
So for me, that was also very, very useful.
And then the third, what did you come up with?
For that the game?
Oh, the game.
The gates just that the game is in and of itself is I love the game, pleasure bullet show up.
Again, in my wife Layla, I wouldn't she's part of the game, did she's got an awesome Channel selfishly, take the next 60 seconds for everybody who's who's deciding on like who their life Partners going to be.
27:11
And I call it that way rather than, like, spouse or wife or husband because I think it is really life partner.
I'm such Proponent of loving logically.
And I know that's that's, that's a oxymoron, you know, in as most people understand it, but I think that arranged marriages make a lot of sense like his parents look.
27:30
Like you could you probably know your friends and see some of the people there didn't like, what are they thinking, right?
Like this, what an idiot by all the time, all the time.
And the thing is that, sometimes, you're that friend.
And so, I think that like, the biggest, the second biggest risk, I've taken in my life besides, He's quitting the job that I did was when Layla.
27:50
And I got married, I was petrified because I was like, I can't believe I'm an adult enough to actually do this and make this decision.
This is insane.
How are they letting me?
Do they really know really?
And I was like, I can't believe that I can actually just choose to marry someone.
This sounds insane, right?
But the reason I was able to move forward with it and I wasn't able to before in the past is that logically my logic brain kept stepping in, whenever I had these relationships, that I was like, really passionate and love and all this stuff in this chemistry, right?
28:17
And Sister this doesn't make sense.
They don't like the stuff.
I like, you don't.
I mean I just think it's like but they don't like like it would always be like, okay don't talk about business.
Now let's talk about what I like to talk about and I was like I don't want to stop talking about when I was talking but I don't want to compromise.
And so I feel like, for me, what we, what with Layla's, I kind of have a life without compromise.
28:35
Like I was like, this is exactly how I want to live.
Do you want to do that?
And I remember when I was dating, people are like, that's so selfish and one-sided and you're never going to find anybody who likes that.
And I was like, well, I only we need to find one.
That's what I think people miss that in the past.
28:52
It's like, it's like, well, what's the likely that you find them?
Like, I only need one.
N equals one, is all I have to find.
So it's okay.
That it's an outlier.
I expect it to be an outlier.
It should be an outlier, but it doesn't mean I can't find.
It just means, it'll take me longer.
And so I would just save those for everyone like the single most important decision, I think that we make in terms of subjective well-being and that's supported with data is that you have a point seven, one correlation to your, to your own subjective well-being, based on the strength of your relationship with your significant other.
29:20
And so, for me, I've taken the there in the business with me approach.
I'm not saying you have to do that, but I'm saying, that is what worked for me because I could have the shared experience and we're aligning, where we're trying to go, and we both are exposed to the same, stimuli, so, we grow together in that direction and that has been very valuable to me.
Interesting.
29:36
No, I we've talked about compromises regards relationships in the past and it is a sticky question.
You know a lot of people tells you that compromise is the Bedrock of relationships and that has always for me gone.
It's not been the Bedrock of my friendships.
No it is nothing like it's been not at all really in my friendships.
29:54
Almost never in my friendships is there compromise.
It's just shared desire to do and not do the same in waves of things.
So why would that be completely different in a And ship.
And then, you know, there's a bunch of reasons that are offered that the tend not to make a ton of sense.
So that's that's something that I have not gotten to the bottom of, but it we've discussed in the past here and I've felt similarly that compromise.
30:18
Sounds like a dirty word today.
Sometimes.
Anything else that you wanted to get to before we hop off then?
No nothing comes to mind.
Yeah, I want you to let you do.
You know, I'll shout you out.
I think your channels.
Awesome have gotten a lot out of it myself.
It has really crystallized why we are At the level that we are at and why we were growing at the speed which is still good.
30:38
We're still growing but why were, you know, not parabolic at this point because I'm going out, you know, that's what would be required and it totally makes sense.
So, no matter where you're at.
I think one of the cool things is that you can't always tell with Alex's Channel immediately.
Whether it's a video for somebody who's just getting started or somebody who is making three five ten million dollars and there's tons of value at every single level.
30:59
So it's Alex from Rosie on YouTube.
Anything else you want people to check out There's the book study nine cents on Amazon.
About 100 million-dollar offers, I'll be making nine more books in the series.

Yep.

31:35
It's all awesome.

Company0:00
Hey guys, real quick.
So Leyland are definitely working on our social media presence.
If you guys haven't noticed and we're just breaking now into LinkedIn.
All right.
It's not as bad as I thought it's actually a pretty awesome so far and you guys have been really cool in there and people are sharing our stuff a lot.
So if we aren't connected on LinkedIn, it go ahead and let's connect and let's rock and roll.
0:17
If you're picking businesses the difference that he and I had is that his mentor's always want.
Super super big, they wanted to go change the world and whatnot but what I don't think we see or appropriate leave it risk or value is the graveyard full of people who went Big and struck out the wealthiest people in the world, see business as a game.
0:34
This podcast, the game is my attempt at documenting, the lessons.
I've learned on my way to building acquisition.com into a billion dollar portfolio.
My Hope Is that you use the lessons to grow your business and maybe someday soon partner with us to get $200 and Beyond.
I hope you share and enjoy.
There are two big risks that exist in business.
0:50
The first is the execution risk.
The second is the idea risk.
Now, you can maybe make an argument for a third being, you know, environmental risk regulatory risk, things like that.
But I would say big picture is does the idea of fundamentally work you know is having strangers Drive kids around in cars going to be a really good idea.
1:08
Uber right or creating lockers for cats is that going to be a good idea?
I don't know, right?
Or am I going to be able to execute the idea itself and if I know who I am.
My name is Alex from Rosie.
I would acquisition.com.
It's a portfolio of companies that have a hundred dollars a year and I've nothing to sell you.
I like talking about business stuff and hopefully making fewer people broke in the world, makes me die happy.
1:28
Okay.
So I was having a really good conversation with a friend of mine, who's a software entrepreneur.
He's had three or four software companies.
None of them have really hit.
He's about the same age as me and he and I sit and very different Financial positions at this point in our life.
And we were having a really in-depth conversation around this topic, which is appropriately.
1:47
Measuring risk.
And so one of the issues that I see with a lot of newer entrepreneurs is that they overestimate the payoff for a risk and underestimate the cost number one.
And second is they overestimate the likelihood of success they're going to have and the underestimates the risk in terms of the likelihood that they fail and I think this is really interesting because he and I were discussing the first quote that I have this kind of it's an intro of my book by Jeff basis.
2:13
I'll read it to you right now.
Outsized returns often come from betting against.
Ancient wisdom and conventional wisdom is usually, right.
Given ten percent chance of 100 times payoff, you should take that bet every time, but you're still going to be wrong, nine times out of ten.
We all know that if you swing for the fences you're going to strike out a lot.
But if you're also going to hit some home runs the difference between baseball and business.
2:31
However, is that baseball has a truncated outcome distribution when you swing no matter how well you connect with the ball, the most runs you can get is for in business every once in a while when you step up to the plate you can score 1000 runs this long tail distribution of returns.
It's why it's important to be bold.
2:47
Big Winners pay for so many experiments.
Jeff Bezos.
And so the thing is that there are two big costs when you're making these risks.
One is, you've got the money and things like that, but I think the biggest cost is time.
And so if you think about portfolio Theory, which is for example, like Venture Capital VCS though, let's say they take 50 companies on and they're betting, the fact that one of those 50 companies is going to, you know, 100x and pretty much carry the return to the entire portfolio and for the vast majority of the other ones, they'll either go out of business or basically not really do anything.
3:17
Spectacular.
And so for the VC, for the Venture Capital investor, it makes sense to take this approach because they're going to get very good returns using, you know, using this method.
Whereas, if you are one of the 49, you know, Founders who has pretty much all of the net worth invest in this thing and it takes five years of your life away to only fail, it can be harder to swallow.
3:39
And so, he and I have had very different careers and lives and it's because we value risk differently.
Now, he would say that, That he is not interested in making money and he just wants to do something, really big and really cool.
I tend to be more money focused or money, money driven, whatever you want to say.
3:55
Because I think that the accumulation of money will allow me to do really cool things later on in my life.
And when I say later, I mean, like, you know, give me 20, 30 years of doing this, and I think we can do that.
Now, the reason that I want to bring up this topic is because picking the business that you're going to go after I think is a very important question that you're going.
4:11
You're going to ask yourself and you have to understand that you're probably going to fail many times before you are successful and Of the hardest questions in entrepreneurship.
This is also one of things that come up in conversation is what do I push a 1 by pivot, right?
What do I keep pushing when I keep persevering on this idea, that's not quite working.
4:27
And when do I pivot?
And it's one of the hardest questions in entrepreneurship because you don't know whether it's you or the idea, and that's what's hard.
Because sometimes it's like, how many great business ideas have the founders have abandoned six inches from gold, where they just needed to push a little bit harder, and they were going to have the Breakthrough, and I hesitate to talk about the subjects.
4:46
I think most people just You know, how to push it all.
And so you know, I put that as a big caveat now when we're talking about business in general, I and this is my difference for my friend.
I prefer to only go after ideas that I think have virtually no risk of not being ideas that people want, which then leaves only me as the variable, the execution risk that it can be done.
5:07
Well, it can be well businessed, right?
And so I think in a lot of ways this is just Alex's to sense.
Most newer entrepreneurs I think would be better served going after.
Ring businesses that have established needs, right?
So people want to have, you know, businesses want more customers.
5:24
People want to make more money, people want higher paying jobs people want to have skills that are valuable people want you know to lose weight people.
Want love people want, you know entertainment like these are all things that are not going to change over time.
And so what that allows you to do is hone your skills at business because, you know, if it doesn't work it's only you.
5:43
It's only your fault.
If it doesn't work, right?
And it because the problem is that At having the perspective from which to make a judgment on whether you have product-market fit can be, I think a much harder decision of, when to push.
And when to Pivot, Most Nation real quick.
If you are a business owner that has a big old business and wants to get to a much bigger business, going to fifteen hundred dollars.
6:04
Plus, we would love to talk to you and if you like that or would like to hear more about it, go to acquisition.com, you planning on the page and talk to one of our team and see if we can help you get there.
You know, as a total said, no, because I think this is really interesting, I think there's three big questions that are really dichotomies that you have to manage as an entrepreneur, right?
6:26
One is when to push and when to Pivot the second is, how much do I spend versus?
How much do I, sorry?
How much my consume versus?
How much do I invest, right?
Because you're going to be living your whole life.
If you if you always forgo the immediate satisfaction, you may reach the end of your life and never have enjoyed anything, right?
So there's a little bit of a balance there that you have to strike, right?
6:44
And it probably shifts over time, but they're still means that there's I'm level of consumption even early on in your life and at the same time, you also don't know if you're gonna live tomorrow, right?
That's where it gets really interesting.
It's a personal question, right?
And the third is, is kind of the balance between, like, how much do I, you know, delegate to other people versus, how much do I do, right?
7:01
Because you got to do something, and you can tell get everything right, I can.
So there's there's balances here.
And so today, it's just about the pushing the pivot, and idea, risk versus execution risk.
And so, for the newer entrepreneurs, you probably suck a business and that's okay.
And that's because your new, which is totally reasonable, totally acceptable.
7:16
And of course, Stock because it's hard a lot of people do it, right?
If you want to be the top one percent, it's 1% of people, that means you have to beat 99.
Other people out of 100 in order to be the top one percent, which is only four hundred thousand year, right?
Not only emits, a lot of money, right?
And so, the thing is that Instagram makes everyone feel like if you're not making Modell's your poor, which is not true.
7:33
You can save for another thousand a year for not that long and and have a lot of money, you know what I mean?
And so, anyways, back to the point, if you're picking businesses, the difference that he and I had is that his mentor's always want.
Super, super big, they wanted to go change.
The world and whatnot, but what?
I don't think we see or appropriate leave it risk or value is the graveyard full of people who went big and struck out.
7:56
And I think is an interesting caveat to this Jeff Bezos gives this example, and I want to dive into it a little bit more detail, is that?
Let's let's zoom out for a second.
Let's, let's eliminate Jeff.
Besos, Elon Musk Warren Buffett from the names that you have in your head.
If we were to think, what would be required to be number one in the world at a thing, right?
8:14
You'd have to have the natural proclivity, right?
Because if you're committing, it's We the people who are going to have natural advantages based on genetic code up, bringing whatever are going to, they're going to, they're going to win more, right?
So, that'd be the first thing we'd want if we wanted to create this person who's going to be likely to win, number two, is they'd have to have a tremendous amount of skill, right?
8:31
So they'd have the natural proclivity.
The the nurture that created an environment, where they had work ethic to pursue the scale, right?
So they have to be very, very good and third, they have to be lucky, right?
Because if you think about a whole bunch of people, like, imagine everybody who's born, That you know, has his natural tendencies or proclivities towards these activities, right?
8:51
And then does a ton of it in terms of volume, so they get very good, what then separates them walk, right?
The people at the very, very, very top have all the all of the things aligned comma and luck.
And so it's interesting that he has this quote around risk because one of the things that's unique about basis and even Elan, right?
9:10
And this is probably a further discussion on business strategy overall is that they've had virtually Limitless access to Capital.
Right.
Like as in they can basically raise money endlessly to fund these risks, right?
And so the equation that he said, which is a magic go to Vegas casino.
9:28
And there's that, there's a table that has a 10% chance of winning, but you get 100 times pay out.
When you do, if you can play the game on an unlimited time, rise, and then you absolutely should just play it as many times as you only possible, but most of us do not have unlimited spins, right?
9:43
And that's where this gets more interesting.
And so, if If you were to imagine a dollar as a year of life, okay, do you have in your entrepreneurial career?
And let's say to build something.
Really epic would take 10 years and that's like minimum, you know, I mean like Facebook was 20 is 20 years old now, right?
10:00
Which is kind of insane to think about, I think it's 20 years.
Is it 20 years old?
I feel like it's wonders.
It's pretty old, 15 years old, it's pretty old, right.
Let's just say 15, right?
If you want to build something epic, which means and how long does it take to test the idea before moving on, right?
10:16
That's another Big question.
Like, how long does it take to really give it your all on a thing?
And so we were having the discussion and he said I think we should say $35 would be you know, you have 35 years of life and and you know how long do we do?
We chunk.
And we agreed on five years as a mid ground because it takes 15 to really you know, see something all the way through if we said 15 was the chunk that didn't seem realistic because it does take you 15 years to find out something doesn't work right?
10:42
And so it's that balance.
So we said five was that was the number you can come up with your own right and so on.
More realistic way to see this.
Right?
Would be, you know you've got a one out of ten shot at 100 times payout, but the minimum bet is 5 and you've got 35 bucks.
10:59
Interesting, the conversation changes.
Now, let's say that you're now 15 years unless you bet three times, you lost all three times, which would be reasonable.
That would be expected that you'd lose three times.
You could even lose all three of the first times, but after 15 years in and you have still no money.
Huh, how do you feel about yourself?
11:16
How do you feel about your skill?
What's your reputation?
All these things, kind of way in, you know what I mean?
This is why I think this is a really interesting discussion and so, I will give you my two cents because he and I disagree on these things because I have the perspective that all the people that I know the wealthiest in the world eliminate risk.
11:32
So, that's what they do.
They control risk, they virtually eliminated.
They figure out ways to play the game in new ways where they cannot lose.
Right.
I'll give an example if the Rock.
Came out with a, I'm trying think of something he hasn't come out with because it came out with apparel and whatever.
11:48
Let's see came out with.
Let's see, him all the book.
Right, let's say let's see the rock writes, a book.
Maybe already has written a book.
I don't know.
And he writes a book.
What are the like, what's the likelihood?
That is not a best seller.
Virtually zero, right?
12:04
It's virtually zero.
So he's basically limited the risk because you control some other variable, which is a massive audience, right?
And you can build that deliberate.
And so, when we think about these things, the richest people that I know, control risk and only play games where if they wait, they win and my friend has not taken that approach and he's like, hey, I just want to go big or go home.
12:21
And the thing is, is that he's gone home more than he's gone big.
And so, I will give you Alex has two cents and you can choose to do what you want with it.
I'll just explain my views on risk.
I tend to go with With the highest likelihood bet.
And I tend to, if I have two bets, let's say one where I have a 10x payoff for a one out of two shots, right?
12:44
Which would be a two-to-one risk-adjusted return.
All right, if you curse, you just multiply the payoff by the, the by the likelihood ours.
That's a 5x.
Sorry, I've messed that up, but you get the idea you multiply the payoff by the percentage likelihood.
And if I had an equivalent risk-adjusted, return, another one.
13:00
But I higher likelihood of achieving it.
So if I had a 5x that I r6x that, I thought I had a four out of five chance of getting versus a 10 x that I had, I do the math on it, but whatever, one out of two shot of getting I would pick the the four out of five shot that had a lower upside.
13:17
That's me.
And I think part of that is because the games that are set up, that way are usually going to be just execution risk businesses.
And I feel like I can I can pay that down in other ways, right?
I can pay down that wrist so I can virtually nothing's guaranteed but I can virtually guarantee the outcome and so my goal is to string as many of these virtually guaranteed upsides in my favor for a long enough period of time.
13:42
That I let compounding work because compounding on a long enough time Horizon creates the outsized return.
And so the idea is, how can I play?
How can I get as many W's in a row and as few L's as possible?
For a long enough time Horizon, so that I create the outsides return comma Ain't get deliver, pretty cool and and stress-free, you're not stress-free but like a pretty cool Life along the way right now.
14:08
If we played the game, the way that we talked about earlier where you have the 35 years that you can bet and your three bets in your 15 years in, and you don't have anything that can be pretty hard hard on your ego hard-earned reputation, maybe you learn bad habits.
Like, there's a lot of things because you won't know, especially if there's an idea risk that's at hand.
14:25
Like is it me?
Or was it the idea right?
And so for that reason, I'm in Favor of the significantly lower risk and he and I were talking, you know, talking back and forth.
He's like, you know what I've observed from you is that you just you go for the sure thing and that's 100% would I do that is I've always gone for the sure thing and then I just continue to try and trade up the upside of my sure things, right.
14:46
So the first sure thing you can have is a very high-paying, you know, income job.
And then the next sure thing would be like, if I were to quit a job, I would make sure that I had more income from my side hustle.
Probably, where I believed it would be very reasonable for me to get that, you know, within a very short For your time.
So then I would, you know, make maybe that switch and then I would look at, you know, all the opportunities that existed and think okay.
15:06
What have these things on a risk-adjusted basis and this is again where people make it you know errors just assume you have to take the negative assumptions and I would say like the better.
I get it this thinking this way.
The more I continue to make which is I'm going to assume everything goes wrong.
15:24
What what then do I make right?
And so if you can just say like assuming none of the good Things that you think are reasonable are going to happen happen, can you still win?
And I think when you think that way what happens is, you give yourself room to be pleasantly surprised and exceed expectations.
15:41
But what happens is when you set up the game that way where you're like, I'm assuming these are the five things that I think will happen and we'll go, right?
But I'm assuming none of them are going to go, right?
Do I still win?
And if you can still win then that is an opportunity to worth pursuing in my opinion.
15:56
And so that's some that has been the approach that I have taken.
Which is how can I virtually eliminate?
The execution risk.
Let me idea Risk by only going after things that people I already know want and then how can I stack the chips in my favor like the rock.
Where if I want to write a book I want to make sure it's a best-seller.
16:14
No matter why.
Right, how do I do that?
And then think about all the things that can go, wrong assume they go wrong.
And the think, what would I do in order to still succeed?
Even with all these things going wrong and then I think, when you take those actions, you may not hit the Thousand extra turn, but let's paint.
16:30
Ain't a different game that you could play.
So let's say, you could play this, there's the two games.
One was the one that Jeff Bezos outlined, right?
What you got?
You know, one out of ten shot at getting a hundred times.
Pay off the game that I prefer to play.
Is how can I get 3x pay off with a 95% chance of certainty and I still have the same 35, right minimum bet.
16:53
Well, I'll bet five and get my three and then I'll bet my 15 and I'll be at 45 and then I'll bet my 45 and I'll be up.
There we go, I'm already at 120.
Whatever.
Sort of got my hundred times pay off by thinking about it from risk-adjusted basis.
17:11
Now it's not going to be sexy, it's not.
But if you double or triple or 5x things enough times you get to the 100x very quickly and you can do it with limited downside knowing that you've controlled for the idea risk and have only focused on the execution risk, which is yourself.
17:28
And so, that's how I've thought about risk with opportunity that I thought I would share with you cuz it was really cool conversation.
And I hope that you guys.
Hope it gave you some light in terms of at least how I think of things and maybe some of those ideas could serve you.
17:44
So, most Nation.
Love you guys.
I don't deserve you.
But I, I love you for being as awesome as you are.
Leave questions in the comments for for future vids.
They're really helpful for me and I'll see you in the next one.
Bye.

0:00
Real quick.
Cause you guys already know that, I don't run any ads on this and I don't sell anything.
And so, the only ask that I can ever have you guys that you help me spread the word so we can have more entrepreneurs, make more money, feed their families, make better products, and have better experiences for their employees and customers.
And the only way we do that is if you can rate and review and share this podcast, so the single thing that I have to do is you can just leave review will take you 10 seconds or one type of the thumb, mean, the absolute world to me.
0:25
And more importantly, it may change the world of someone else.
I had to die to my father and I Know Myself and I Realize that I would rather die to him, pretty much ended up happening.
And so my fears were relatively Justified, welcome to the game where we talk about how to get more customers, how to make more per customer and how to keep them longer in the many failures and lessons.
0:41
We have learned along the way.
I hope you enjoy and subscribe.
Well, I usually ask my guests.
How did you get this job?
So I was a Management Consultant right out of college.
I did space, cyber intelligence for the military, which was sounds much cooler than it really was, but I had a top secret clearance.
0:59
It sounded really good.
Dinner parties in just about only that.
And, you know, one day I looked out for my balcony.
Exciter really nice place because I could afford at the time and I was like, is this it?
And I was you know in my young 20s you know, at that point I had done everything that I think I was supposed to do.
So I was, you know, I did well in school I you know, was president of all the clubs, you know, graduated in three years.
1:19
Got the good job and I realized it was I was living you know, life for me that my father wanted me to live.
And so that was kind of, you know, when I faltered back and forth or probably a period of six months.
Of really not wanting this to be my life, but not wanting to let my dad down.
And so at some point, the thing that kind of pushed me over the edge was I can either, you know, die to myself where I can do to my father and the end of the day, you know, I have to survive.
1:43
So I will if I make this decision and he no longer wants to be my dad, then I can accept that.
Wow, was that extreme?
Then.
Yes, see more about that.
Where are you an only child?
Yeah, so only child raised by single father Middle Eastern.
He was born in Iran and You know I everything in my life up until that point was really just to make him proud.
2:04
So I it was very much a seeking approval seeking validation kind of drive at that point in my life and so the idea of disappointing him or not getting his approval felt like death and at that point I was actually contemplating not living you have watched some of my YouTube stuff mortality has been the single biggest driver and the biggest decisions that I've made in my life and it has become a routine process for decision-making for me in general because I think it provides Clarity and it provides context to most of the decisions we have which the vast majority of them don't matter which is helpful in and of themselves and then you know beyond that it helps me make the decisions that I think four moves everyone else from The Playbook because if you if you study subjective well-being and how people perceive how they're doing in their own lives, it looks like a smiley face.
2:49
So seven-year-olds think they're killing life and then it drops dramatically between 20 and 30 and then there's still a little bit more of a dip right around 45.
That's like when people are their true, They hate life the most and then and then it kind of slowly goes up to like 55 60 and then it shoots right back up again, when people see that they're going to die and that life is short and that they can make the decisions without worrying about the ramifications of other people.
3:13
And some of the people they're worried about are also dead and so it was using that context for that biggest decision.
That's been duplicated many times in my life since then, because if I have a good decision making algorithm, I try and reuse it as many times as I can, let's unpack it for the audience a little bit.
So, you know, when we're seven, we don't have a care in the world.
3:30
The artist or the whatever we want to be is not been beaten out of us yet.
No one's told us that we are not what we think we are.
We're still popping wheelies and climbing trees and falling out and that's okay.
And then you get to your 20s and 30s and rubber hits the road a little bit and if you made money, I guess and if that's your sign of success than your, okay, but if not your kind of hosed then in your 40s I'm guessing you start to have more life experience.
4:00
He's maybe you start carrying less what people think and then then you fast forward all the way to maybe near death and then you really get to a point where you don't care what anyone says and you really boil it down to what's important.
And probably, I'm guessing that's love relationships Legacy.
4:19
And then you're just, like, peace out.
I think for most people.
Yes, for me, specifically, the Legacy piece less.
So, but I think for most people, yes.
And why is the Legacy piece less?
Important, um, more so.
And whenever I get into this topic, I think a lot of, like, some people get sensitive about it.
4:37
And so, I just like to put the disclaimer, like, this is not be judging your beliefs and me stating my beliefs is in no way.
Yeah, a judgment on anyone else, but if you just look at expanding the time Horizon over a much longer period of time.
If you look at it at in 10,000 years or 100,000 years or a million years, right?
The easy way to test, this is to go backwards, right?
4:53
Which is do, you know your great-great-great-great great-great-great grandfather?
Probably not.
And then if you look at it from a how much has somebody achieve Standpoint, I happen to be an interesting situation where my great great grandfather was in the ruling class in Iran, and he had 400 children.
So he would literally, you know, like old and had a lot of wealth.
5:11
He had a lot of wives to create 400 children, right?
And I actually still can't remember his name because I my dad told me one time and I can't remember it.
And I've never seen any of the quote Legacy that.
I'm sure he felt like he was leaving.
And so if that was that level of success and Legacy and only for five generations later, I don't even remember them as they ignore.
5:29
Do I have any piece of that Legacy?
Yeah, it seems a little bit irrelevant.
When the revolution happened in Iran who talked about Legacy lands, buildings houses, bank accounts coverage says those are ours.
No that's it.
Is your legacy.
God that's why.
5:45
I'm like and you were like I want to build a legacy of like u.s. might not even be the superpower in 500 years.
Your kids, your kids might be in Bangladesh, who knows?
India might be the the hotspot 500.
No nose.
Right?
And I think, it'll long enough time Horizon, we're all screwed.
And I think in some ways, I find that incredibly disheartening but an equal opposite is you can't find it both disheartening and also not freeing because all of the decisions that we're making that are not for ourselves are subject to change, that we feel pressure from whether that be Society, societal, I'll put quotes there cause that's a big word or family friends.
6:20
Expectations.
That we perceive others.
People's have us.
If you can, if you can, just relinquish all of those chains.
I think it's incredibly freeing and I choose To live that way advice is good because it helps us live in the moment because you know, even if you believe in something after that still in the future.
6:38
Yeah.
And there's a question mark because no one actually knows, you know, with knowledge what happens or if something happens, so you might as well live in the present.
Make the best of it.
Yeah, an interesting one that I thought through around that was a lot of us, not a lot of us.
All of us have 100% experience not being alive.
6:58
Right before we were born, we were not alive.
And so we know what that was like there was nothing that we can recollect and so I would imagine that.
That's the closest experience that we can have to not be alive yet again, which to me is not that frightening.
Yeah, and it is fraying, you're right because it's both humbling to know that you don't matter in the grand scheme of things.
7:17
But at the same time, you matter infinitely, if you just focus on the present and the mark that you're going to leave here and now I contemplated I had to die to my father.
I do myself and I realize that I would rather Either died of him which pretty much ended up happening.
7:32
And so my fears were relatively Justified, he was not in support of the things that I wanted to do.
I ended up quitting that job, sold everything, I had packed my car went to California because that's where I thought the land if it is opportunity was because that was the only thing I really enjoyed mentored under a guy for a few months to try and at least learn the ropes started.
My first facility slept on the floor for the first nine months, which was a very terrible experience for me and timestamp.
7:52
The age for me now I was 23.
That's a graduated early, you got that dream job and then you bailed.
Yeah.
You know, two years and that was really at the time.
And all of this kind of it was at the splitting point, where I done two years in the kind of career path, traditionally is like two to four years of management consulting, and then you go back to an ivy league for your GMAT.
8:13
And then from there, you go into, you know, you can, you can go do investment banking a new private Equity, you can do, you know, some of the bigger white-collar jobs, but it was, I didn't want more of what I had.
And so I thought that I would have a better shot taking two hundred thousand dollars in two years, which is what the, you know.
8:29
No economic equivalent of what the degree was and starting something on my own and I figured I would learn more in the first two years and with that money and maybe even have a business by the end of that period of time that made an equivalent amount of money.
Compared to what I would have had as a job offer.
Hey guys, real quick.
If you're new to the podcast, I have a book on Amazon called 100 million-dollar offers that over eight thousand five star reviews.
8:49
It has almost a perfect score.
You can get it for 99 cents on Kindle.
The reason I bring it up is that I put over 1,000 hours in the writing that book and it's my biggest gift to our community.
So it's my very Shameless way of trying to get you to like me more and ultimately make more dollars to that later on in your business career I guess a partner with you.
9:06
So that's my give go check it out Amazon and back to the show.
What signals did you get?
I mean, you just saying like I wasn't feeling it, but like, what was your motivation?
Because I see you as this Hustler.
This go get is all about gobbling up new opportunities.
9:22
It transcends beyond that now but like at first, it sounds like you were just all about to go get but how did you know?
I mean, the first I was driven by fear.
Okay, it was all fear fear of failure.
Feel of disappointment, fear of other people's judgment.
What does your dad end up saying?
9:38
Did he say good luck with you?
We thought it was stupid either.
I was wasting my life.
Yeah, and wasted a degree that he had spent money on and yeah, wasted a good job for opportunity that he had set up for me all these things right in his defense.
Did he immigrated here?
Yeah.
Okay.
So in his defense the numbers are right and I just want to tell the audience so that they're not but but it's like you know if you have justified in saying that yeah if you escape from a country where there's trauma and impending Danger Then your son, squanders an opportunity, you might get a little anxious about that.
10:15
I want to pursue.
I mean, my dad came here with a thousand dollars, you know.
And at a medical degree.
Yeah.
And then built every didn't even speak English, right?
I think what he did was harder than what I've done.
Like, I got to, I got to stand on his shoulders.
Okay, you know, in what way, I mean, I speak English like just the basics.
10:33
Like I speak English.
I went to a good school, just all the support infrastructure, known and unknown, that was around me.
You know to be successful.
Yeah, I think it's healthy to recognize your privilege.
Yeah.
But the same time you know, it came with lots of baggage to and so you had signals which were mainly fear-based.
10:50
Yeah and I mean the biggest thing that made the decision for me.
I would say I The Logical decision and then I had the emotional decision, the emotional decision was I don't want to do this, this is not the life I want to lead.
I'm not happy doing this every day.
I would prefer to not be alive.
If this is what my life will be continuously.
11:06
If I would prefer to not be alive, then that kind of opens up my decision calculus and what was it?
I'm trying to put my finger on.
What was it that made you happy?
Was it just the freedom to do what you want?
I didn't know.
It made me happy.
I knew it was not making me happy.
Okay.
Yeah.
So I think that's another important lesson to if I can just extract them.
11:21
You know, I'm sure a lot of people watching, they feel the same kind of family pressure, they want to be what other people expect them to be if you know, if that's who you are and that's totally normal but we should always remember the context in which that advice is given could be given through the lens of a Lifestyle a certain timeframe.
11:41
But like I think that's a thing, whether you're young or middle-aged, you're trying to figure out what you want to be.
When you grow up, you're trying to have it all figured out because we don't seems like we don't like uncertainty.
But I think your message if I'm hearing you is, sometimes you have to try it on for size to see if it fits or not and you get it on your like, well, I thought that dream job was going to be like perfect but turns out, you know, It's tight in the crotch.
12:10
It's like I need some different.
Hmm.
Nothing giving yourself permission to do that and it was a side to what you're saying about.
My dad, like education saved his life.
Like he was only able to leave the country because he was educated.
And so there's very deep roots, they're not going to appreciate that.
12:26
But for this context or for my life, it just wasn't appropriate, right?
And when we did come to terms later, the only time he's ever apologize to me my life and said, but to be fair in my time, I would have been, right?
Well, absolutely.
And he would have been this is not the same time.
Yeah, absolutely.
12:42
It wasn't that it was inappropriate.
It's just out of context and didn't necessarily translate to this new life.
I love the saying, you know, in our 20s were concerned about what everyone thinks about us.
In our 40s, we don't care what anyone thinks about us.
And in our 60s, we realize that owners thinking about studying with right and I just I just feel like that's I mean, who else have you thought about today besides yourself?
13:00
Probably not, I mean, you have your kids which is an extension yourself but, you know, I yeah not a lot.
And so most people are like that and you know, a lot of Like we have a lot more leeway than I think.
We give ourselves credit for and I think the more that I have now, you know, I'll say accomplished with quotes in material success, the more I am excited about the things that I can do.
13:20
And that was why the opening of the book was like there are no rules and it just took me a very long time to realize that I continue to unlearn rules that.
I thought existed, you know, as I continue to go on this journey.
Yeah, I love that idea of unlearning.
I think we all just try and go back to being like we were when we were children, just because when you're a child, you are purely present by years.
13:38
Present in the moment and I don't like the word happy very much I prefer using Joy, because you can be, you can mourn joyfully, because it's internal, rather than happiness which I feel is more like happenstance.
It's more from external.
And so, you know, what are the things that bring you Joy, where things that I find, you know, find joy in and I think for anyone who's listening, it's a much harder question to answer.
14:01
What are the things that bring me joy?
Then answering the question.
What are the things I hate?
And it's easier to correct those.
First, like, why I hate my job?
And I hate my relationship and I hate this city.
Okay, those are all very changeable and a lot of times you get there by by inversion.
14:18
Well if I wanted to destroy my life I wanted to have the worst life possible.
What would I do?
And then taking all those things that you would do to really destroy your life and make your life miserable and then reverse them.
It's a much easier way to solve the positive psychology equation, in my opinion.
Yeah, I love that and I'm remembering this, this Picasso quote, which is I think he said everyone is born an artist.
14:38
Yeah.
Right and then eventually we you know get convinced that we're not.
Yeah and we have to really just strip away and get you know get back to basics.

The nation.
I was interviewed by Greg Hickman on his podcast related, specifically to some questions that he had in his audience, had of agency owners around, how to use 100 million-dollar offers the framework within the book on their businesses as agency owners and then also on their clients businesses as small business owners because they're also getting leads for their small businesses.
0:21
And so this was a two-sided discussion birth, the B2B side and then also b2c side of how to use offers in a compelling way to increase prices, get more Clicks get more people to say yes and get them to do it to things that they can't say no to and how to chunk through a product.
A service in a way that makes it business more scalable and more profitable.
0:40
And so there's really, really in-depth tactical stuff in this interview and I think you guys hopefully will like it as much as I enjoyed making it for you.
And this is part one of our two-part podcast enjoy.
If I deliver 10,000 dollars of value and I trucks in thousand dollars, I will have a satisfied customer but there will not be any surplus.
0:57
They won't tell their friends about it.
They had Fair exchange right if I charge ten thousand dollars for a hundred thousand dollars in value.
They'll tell everybody to know, Welcome to the game where we talk about how to get more customers, how to make more per customer and how to keep them longer in the many failures and lessons.
We have learned along the way.
I hope you enjoy and subscribe.

Everybody Alex are Mosey In the Flesh joining us today.
So it was kind of interesting I posted in the group, you know, who would be interested and I was like, I wonder like how many of my people know who you are.
I was like, there's gonna be some definitely, and it is like the most engaged thread in our group.
1:31
Like, I'm in, I'm in, I'm in, I'm in.
So, the message is spreading my friend, but guys, if you haven't gotten Alex's new book, 100 million offers.
Check it out, it's on Amazon for I think still 99 cents on Audible.
And he has a free course at acquisition.com.
1:47
For / training I believe or a takes you through that content.
So definitely check it out.
We're gonna be talking about that and a lot more today.
So Alex, here's how I want to start this.
So this group, right?
This group is people that I would kind of consider micro agency owners, they're like they're more than Freelancers.
2:02
They've got a little bit of traction, probably lean and mean team done-for-you service has, some of them are trying to escape that all together.
At on Consulting move into training, some are still rocking the quote unquote.
Traditional agency model and you said in multiple of your interviews but have never gone deeper on it.
2:20
I just don't like the agency model.
So I'd love to understand how do you unpack that a little bit because I feel like I know where you're going to take it and I think I agree but I've never heard you take that deeper Beyond.
I just don't really like the agency model.
So, can you explain what you mean by that?
I think the ages most most people practice, it is not a sellable business.
2:39
You don't, I mean, I think that's, that's the, like, if I were to say, like, one Consolidated statement that is it.
It underneath of that, there's tons of sub buckets but that's the best, the overarching piece underneath of that.
I would say, I don't like like pure service-based businesses in general because if you were to plot things on a high value on one thing and then how teachable skill is on the other, most things that are really teachable or not valuable things that are very valuable to not be teachable.
3:02
And so the more you invest in someone, the more Flight Risk, you you suffer from in a service in a purely service-based business.
And this is why most franchises that are purely service-based.
Don't achieve nearly the scale that non-service Franchises do so if you look at like the biggest franchise out there, if you look as from a trend standpoint, they're almost all food-based, because Starbucks coffee is going to taste like a Starbucks coffee because the machine is going to like, the beans are going to taste the same as long as the temperature is, right?
3:27
And they had the same amount of water, right?
Your sandwiches more or less can be the same because the same ingredients, right?
But in the service business, for example, let's say, you went to a massage parlor.
It's very, very difficult to standardize.
A really good masseuse first really, bad masseuse, like, they can go through the same training, we miss something, entirely different outcome, right?
3:42
And so, what ends up happening is that, that person builds a book of Business within your business and then they walk from your business and that happens with virtually any service based business will hear.
Its chiropractor trying to get chiropractors gym owner, trying to personal trainers.
Like Salon with hair stylist.
It's all the same, there's service, right?
And so, I don't like that component of it, right?
4:01
Which is why I tend to lean more towards, you know, to the extent that we can try to productize as many pieces of the services we can, because then people are loyal to the product and the brand that's associated with it, rather than the individual who's providing it.
And then also, when you product size that you can, Also break it into individual chunks and then you can divide out the work between people so that it's not one person doing and on the thing, right?
4:21
And so then they're more loyal against the outcome or the product, rather than to the person.
So that's one.
Number two, is most people who practice agencies tend to be generalists, which is, you know, I talk about in the book.
Why?
I think that's terrible idea, but like if you're going to be a generalist, you're competing, it's like old will be, you know, I mean, you're competing against like the biggest people out there and you absolutely can win in General market.
4:41
So, despite what I said in the book in terms of like the riches are in the niches, It is absolutely possible.
It's just much harder, right?
Like right now I can talk as a business generalist but because of the tracker that I have, right?
And so what happens is, I think a lot of people try and get in as a business generals, but they have no experience, they have no credibility, and that's really the issue, right?
4:57
So like, if you want to compete at General business coaching, for example, not that I have a business coaching company but at least a business advice company that I give away for free, right?
Then you have to compete with me and it's going to be harder if you don't have contacts for experience across multiple industries that have more relevant experience.
And so that's that's the reason like the new You said because niching is special.
5:15
It's just because it's easier to get really good at one thing that is to be really good at a lot of things.
And I think that's like, that's the subtext for wide niching.
Makes more sense, right?
And then on top of that, you can for more easily standardize the product offerings.
So that you have less variability, which then increases or decreases, the operational.
5:32
Dragon increases your margins.
It also allows you to price differently so that you can compete in them store, Marketplace and own candidly, I'm more valuable outcome, right?
Because like if you know, Ogilvy isn't going to provide that.
Well first off, they wouldn't work with a Local real estate agent but if they were going to work with local real estate agent, they wouldn't be able to ride the same value of somebody who only does real estate agents.
5:50
And not only that only does real estate agents who only sell commercial homes in the 125 million dollar range because if you just did that then you know exactly what the sales process will look like, you know, exactly where the lead should get, you know, what they should get worked on, you know what, the price per deal is, you can price appropriately and all of this can be optimized, and in terms of product, hasn't you're going to deliver again?
6:08
Your team is going to know who the Avatar is, how you're going to help them in every aspect of that process, right?
Compared to We Market stuff, which is really, really hard.
It's all custom and it's hard to be competitive, right?
Because then you're going to get priced, just like everyone else in the marketplace, which is really difficult to differentiate.
6:24
And as marketers, we should know what that is.
So it would make sense that we start with ourselves.
You mentioned word productize up a bunch of times and it's a term that we use a lot and at least in our programs a lot of times what we're helping our clients do is take that that specialty and start packaging up so that they are not pure service-based, but you touched on something that I hadn't.
6:44
Really earliest worded it in a way where you talked about the chunking of the pieces, then to delegating that.
Can you can you expand on that and maybe even touch on your experience from the early stages of gym, launch or maybe any other business that you, you've seen do this.
7:00
So I think the first thing that needs to happen is you have to have a clear customer jerk.
And so most people don't even have a customer Journey.
They have a rough idea of what has to happen but they haven't actually like written it down.
So it's like first step is for us as a company to have a shared understanding like you may think in your own head that you have a shared understanding.
But you probably don't write because if I were to ask your front line employees, what does it look like?
7:18
They probably will mess something up and you will be horrified what they say.
The client journey is gonna be like, oh my God, that's over clay trineas.
And it's like, and you wonder why clients are getting a good experience, right?
And so it's like, first we have to agree upon this thing, everyone's there.
And it's like, okay, now we have to slice up these things into pieces that will best suit the team, you know, for those specific you know, rolls, right?
7:40
And so you're going to have a different person, just onboarding, then somebody who does climb, you know, Kyle Made in Japan versus somebody who does the creative?
Like all of those are different roles at all might be necessary in the process that you crave.
Now, what I just described is a generalist approach which would probably not be the right way to do it is like how can you peel off the pieces that are, the highest margin that were the best at?
7:59
Because at the end of the day, like everything comes down to like, where do we provide the most value?
And who do we provide that value to?
And like, we can answer those questions, then business gets a lot easier.
It's like, well, this is for every the gentlest you need to make the transition.
Like, the way that I would do this in approach, this is I look at my entire It base historical, and actual and say which of these clients are the best to deal with which of these accounts were the least trouble.
8:21
And which of these do we make the most money, right?
And so if you plot those, then you'll start to see that there's a clump, right?
And there's probably gonna be some where you made a lot of Revenue but not a lot of profit.
You have some guys who are a lot again, a lot of Revenue, but there are ton of work, but there's going to be a sweet spot where you have lots of profit.
Not a lot of work, High client satisfaction and it might be like, we're really good at this one aspect or these two aspects are really good that we're really good at and we serve this type of business and you can either be niche.
8:44
In terms of there's levels to niching, right?
You just say local businesses or one level below, that could be service-based, local businesses or it could be your own saying you're like you can you can help you can try to think slice and dice that group and so you really can Define it.
Well, we're like might be might be male founder tech companies, whatever.
8:59
Right?
Because I'm sure your audience is really, you know, varied in terms of they serve.
And so you might find out like tech companies have the budget and are really willing to spend the money and don't have a lot of feedback and creative and they're just like, yeah this is good, we needed a logo and that's that right?
And then you can just that's what you focus on.
Is the thing is, is like it also becomes for entrepreneurs.
9:17
The biggest asset that we have in our net worth is going to be our business.
And that means that the business in order for it to be valuable, it has to be sellable.
And so, a great book on this is John were lows but built to sell I think really good story.
If you've read that.
Yep, the kind of depicts that issue that much.
I think the actual examples of agencies that is probably.
9:33
Yes I guess they do blow goes.
Yeah, it's really suitable for your audience.
Yeah.
And so yeah, that just tends to be the kind of recurring issues.
They don't think like business owners are still so fully integrating the business.
And so It's like in terms of sequence.
It's like we have to get our offer right?
Then we have to get our customer Journey, right?
9:49
And we have to slice that up so that other people can do it.
So that now, we're fully removed from the delivery.
Then we're still probably selling depending on the size of the people.
You're dealing with are probably a lot of them are so heavily involved in the sales and acquisition.
And so then it's how do we create, you know, a pipeline of new business and that can be whatever we want, you know, you can go paid ads, you can learn media, you known me to be made alive, founding Affiliates.
10:09
You could do word-of-mouth referrals, if you have a strong strong back in there, any of those ways you could do, but you have, Have to pick one.
And so for every use under million dollars and you've heard my content before, but I'll just repeat it again.
It's one product, one Avatar, and one channel.
And that is how you get from zero minute that's it.
And what most people are doing, is lots of products, to lots of avatars on multiple channels and stuff and failing at all of the miserably and somehow wondering why right?
10:32
Is because like, you can barely do one thing.
How are you expecting to do to serve lots of different?
It just doesn't make any sense.
It's we can more and when you say the channel just to be specific of the ones you kind of rifled off, like One committing to manual outbound would be an example or like if you're going to do paid media.
10:48
Does that mean like paid media only on Facebook?
Or does that mean just paid media across all the channels?
P media is a is a single bucket, right?
And then inside of that there's obviously your pre-roll YouTube ads you could do Facebook.
You do is you're going to be, do whatever, right?
Google has, you can Craigslist ads.
11:04
There's a lot of educated run but what I have found in scaling, our company's on paid media, and then obviously, you know, as you know, with our newer stuff, we're more focused on the other.
Three.
It's easier to go from Facebook to adding YouTube, then it is to go from Facebook to col color.
11:20
So it's much easier to just add or remove a step in the friction of like, having a call funnel from a different Source because you usually just have to get the friction, right?
That's really the only variable with the different traffic sources.
Whereas, with mini lop out, it's like, you literally are starting from scratch.
And so, whatever one you feel like you are best suited for I would start there.
11:36
I will say though that from a cell ability, a company that is far more on the Affiliates man.
Not bound and word-of-mouth are going to be much more sellable entities than paid advertising earned media and owned.
Look wise, you guys already know that, I don't run any ads on this and I don't sell anything.
11:56
And so the only ask that I can ever have you guys that you help me, spread the words we cannot more entrepreneurs, make more money, feed their families, make better products and have better experiences for their employees and customers.
The only way we do that is if you can rate and review and share this podcast, so the single thing that I have to do You can just leave review but they can 10 seconds or one type of the thump.
12:15
It means the absolute world to me.
And more importantly, it may change the world for someone else.
You said that during dinner, you made a comment.
Now, I was fortunate enough to have dinner with you and Layla like a month ago now and you made the comment of, you know, like the next channel that someone like myself could really focus on even though it'll take longer to get dialed in as the manual outbound, because then you don't have to, and I think the words were, you don't have to be a dancing bear.
12:42
Is that kind of, why you think those three are more relevant?
First?
The cell ability, if you look at the biggest companies in the world, Was all of them, have the foundation of the latter, three, not the former three.
It's all about like, referrals being the biggest because it's the one that is quadratic in nature, right?
12:59
Which is, you know, candidly the reason most businesses don't make money or a lot of money is because they don't actually provide that much value.
There's not a lot of what we call customer Surplus.
So I'll give you an example of what customer Surplus is.
So if I deliver 10,000 dollars of value and I charge ten thousand dollars, I will have a satisfied customer but there will not be any surplus.
13:15
They won't tell their friends about it.
They had Fair exchange right if I charge ten thousand dollars for a hundred thousand dollars in value.
They'll tell everybody to know, right?
And so there's a seesaw of hi, Mike.
How much virality you want in the product you have.
Now, if you look at again, the biggest company in the world, they would prefer to have zero cost of acquisition, have shitloads of virality.
13:33
And then deal with monetization later, that is what most yeah, a lot of them are funded so they don't have to deal with this.
So, there is a sweet spot there, right?
Like and, you know, I sit in an interesting position as a lot of people trying to look at what I'm doing with that because there's not calm.
And they're like, What's the play?
The real plays.
I don't need the money.
So that's the magic, right?
13:51
So I have a huge customer per Surplus.
The reason the book sells thousand copies a day right now with no pay.
Yeah, it's just because there's a big Surplus, right?
And so maybe if I play I had a bunch of people who read the the early copies before I before I launched it.
They're like, dude, you should charge $100 $500.
The book or whatever.
And I'm like I probably could have, but I would so much rather trade $99 to have your good.
14:11
Well, that's far more valuable to me over the Long Haul, right?
And the reality is that if I charge 99 Cents, which is basically nothing because Jeffrey, B, takes take 65 of the 99.
Then the likelihood that I get probably 20 times.
14:26
The people are 100 times, the people who read the book is significantly higher, and that's where I'm going to, you know, I would prefer to have a hundred people who know about the stuff and get value.
Then have one person who gets $500 to rightfully.
So, you made a comment earlier about, like, if I charge 10,000 and you only make 10,000, like, you're probably not going to go tell anybody about it.
14:45
So, in the book, you talk about how to basically double your rates, raise your rates without having to actually change anything.
About the offer and I want you to talk a little bit about that but then kind of specifically around that like the evolution to get to that, right?
Because I know a lot of people in this group that are watching this, a they're, they're definitely not charging enough.
15:04
They know they're not charging enough but some of those other things you talked about have been preventing them from solving a specific outcome that would even allow them to get to a multiple you know returns like all these things.
Start stacking on top of each other but save someone specialized.
They're doing something specific.
15:21
They're still not charging enough.
Can you talk to the path to raising your rates?
So the problem is the price is the is the is the symptom, not the Cause, right?
So the cause is that people are not providing sufficient value.
And so, the whole book details, how to break down every problem that your customer is dealing with a specific customer and then how to systematically solve each of those problems.
15:42
So that you can provide more value.
Once you have provided significant more value, then you can raise your prices.
And then, as a result of raising your prices, the price itself also, First more value to the product itself, which is kind of an interesting, you know, dynamic in and of itself.
And so of, like what I said didn't seem contradictory to what I'm saying right now, it's like I raise my prices at Jim launched by a lot and I was way ahead of the market but I also added two hundred fifty thousand dollars of top light on average.
16:09
And so the reality is that the people that I was competing against for charging between five hundred and five thousand for adding between five hundred and five thousand dollars to the business, right?
I was heading, 250 thousand dollars and I charged 40 So, I was still way above them, but I was like double or triple or 10 times way above them.
16:25
In terms of the value that was provided and that you could verify on the fact that like the business exploded, right?
And that's, that's the, you know, the reason behind it, which is why we didn't have to spend a ton in advertising like the first year business.
We ask we spent a million dollars advertisement at 28 million, you get so much more return by having some level of customer service is sequentially.
16:42
They'll like you had gone and personally flown around the country and did this one-on-one launching these gems.
So you obviously had that Experience to kind of, I think probably know the value discrepancy.
And so what I'm hearing correctly, some of you listening might have done this enough times in already have seen the type of returns you can get thus probably instantaneously can raise your rates, but some of you might have to earn it by actually going above and beyond getting figuring out what that is and sequentially, raising rates as you start getting those returns, does that sound accurate?
17:17
Yes.
So let me talk to different two different ways of getting.
All right, the first is that You massively fix what you're doing and provide 20 times the value in charge five times the price that you currently are, right?
And so if you do that, then you'll get both elements.
You have a massive increase in value, and you'll be able to provide that because you're at five times higher prices.
17:34
So you'll have extra cash flow to be able to fulfill these things that you can do.
And often times the value that we provide takes a one-time investment that you can yield, you know, returns over and over again.
So for example a book is a one-time investment but then I continue to real Returns on that book over and over and over again.
17:50
So it's like a lot of times we need Do more work on the onset than people end up doing.
I think I have a perfect example for this.
That's actually that might be perfectly relevant for this.
So one of the one of the companies that use using our software was an agency, right?
And this agency owner, I would do one column of the agency owners just like, you know, help them with this and stuff.
18:10
And every single month, same guy would get on.
And the same guy would bitch.
And moan about his custody and he had this down, he was only working with real estate agents and he was like, you know, that they suck, they say, That the leads are bad, no one works to leave and it was the same conversation over and over and over and over again.
18:28
And I was like dude, stop your agency and go work, the leads that you're getting.
Go get your real estate license, go work, the leads, go sell some houses and then you'll be able to help them and he didn't do it.
And then finally got so fed up that he did it.
18:44
And then in a month he sold like seven and a half million and houses right.
And I was like, okay, have you And something about, he's like, oh yeah, the you know what?
I was telling them to do it, like there's a couple different like, nuances about how you had to do that different.
And so what happens is, everyone just regurgitates generic advice and they've never done it and because they've never done it, they don't have the nuances.
19:05
And then, the devils in the details, the money is in, is in the, is in the tiny differences.
Not the massive things, right?
And so because he actually did it, I was like, now you can have conviction when you talk to them in the phone.
You're like dude, I'm working these leaves myself.
Like I just sold your house is this week.
Like it works and How different the sales conversation is how different he feels about the pricing that he's going to charge.
19:25
And now the product truly is better and so believe it or not crazy.
He's now making way more money mind-blowing.
And so, if you think about this, for most people, is they start getting into business, where they actually provide no value.
They don't know how to provide that they took a course in how to run Facebook ads or, you know, they did some sort of design in the past and they're ok at, right?
19:46
And the reason I make more money is because they're okay, they're not that good.
And so we have to figure out a way to bride Farm.
You to a very specific apps are make their entire lives amazing.
Because all the work that we did ahead of time which oftentimes one type park, right?
It's just no one's willing to wait.
Six months or a year to have a business that's 10 times as big, but that means that you have to forego 6 months to 12 months, right?
20:06
I'm just learning the craft to a way deeper level and here's what's crazy is that when you do that, Imagine The Story marketers, put your marker had on the story that he can.
Now tell you could say, dude, I get it.
I was so tired of it.
I work the damn lie to myself.
I figured out every one of the systems and now I'm giving Give it to you now.
20:22
They're like oh shit, no one else has done that, right?
And when I started the gym business like I had six teams my own still didn't feel secure enough to actually say that I can help gym owners.
Then I started flying out because I wanted to make sure everyone's getting way more value than I was charging for it and I did 33 turnarounds almost none in like 18 months.
20:40
And so I went to we went to 33 different markets, where we sat at the front desk was sold the membership.
We did everything right for them, we found the money.
And so at that point when I then say, hey, I just launched Jim's personally over the last 18 months, I can tell you that this will work in your Market hop on a call.
20:57
It's a story that no one else can say so it's not an angle, it's not a hook.
It's just it's true then and here's the cool thing as soon as I wanted to transition to the done with you model, I 33 gyms that I was like, hey, remember that thing I did they're like yeah, I was like do you want to want me to show you how I did it and they're like, yeah I 33.
21:12
Hi taking clients immediate right there client 34, who gets on the phone.
I'm like, well here I'll just set you up with one of the gyms at sooner, right?
Now, they're like to just buy it.
I didn't need sales.
It's like dude spot you you alluded to value in that and I think in consuming a lot of your content and then going to research this, I haven't found many people that actually defined it yet.
21:35
You yet you have, you know, we all think it's like, oh, like go serve, you know how to content, Bubba, blah, but like, do you actually put together an equation for it?
Can you can you talk through that?
Yeah, and I think I do with the same issue do right?
Which is like You know, price is what you pay, those what you get and so everyone could talk about price all day, but no one talks about value.
21:56
They just say the word value over and over.
There you go, evaluate.
There's the equation, the way that it came to this was trying to think about two products that were the same and had different prices.
And so I was like, why is this price higher than this?
And so, I just tried to think about it.
And those are the four buckets that I came with.
22:12
I think you could probably break those into further smaller markets, but those are kind of the big chunks that exist.
And so for the audience, a fastest way, that you can provide value is, look whatever else in the market is doing.
Doing and do it at halftime simplest simplest wet, like the thing that people value the most their time, right?
And then effort in sacrifices and not to convenience, right?
22:29
Effort is what you what the prospect has to.
Now begin doing that, they don't want to do that, they weren't doing before they started working with.
You sacrifice is what they have to stop doing.
They want to do that.
They no longer get to do as a result of working with you.
So it's just two sides of the same coin.
So for example you might be saying like I mean I'm getting them all these leaves but now they're incurring the cost of now I have to pay someone to work leads.
22:46
We have to we have to follow up with all these people.
I've got all these appointments like those are costs, right?
And we look at every cost that's point.
They're going to incur as a result of doing business with us and solutions, create more problems.
That's always how it is, right?
And so if we can solve more these problems that we're creating, then we can create more value in the end, right?
23:02
But back to the time delay, the single thing that I focus on with virtually every business that you start working with on the acquisition not calm side that portfolio is how can we decrease the time delay term are right?
And so I'll give you an easy example.
You just gave the market, right?
If I, you know, you start working with a company and, you know, they swipe the card and they start working as a team, take 30 days.
23:21
Days.
And then effort and sacrifice.
You have to give me all this creative.
Yes.
Give me access to all this stuff yet.
You have to, you have to, you have to, you have to.
It's like man.
There's a lot of effort sacrifice here and especially if it's ongoing every week.
You owe me this every month, you owe me this, we have to go on numbers every week.
We're gonna have this Cadence blah, blah, blah.
Like it's all stuff that now I have to do that I was doing for right?
23:38
Yeah.
And so what we try and do is like imagine a different marketing agency that as soon as they swipe the card right there phone rang with a qualified lead right holy cow different client experience different Impressions different expectations that immediately get set and way more Goodwill.

Right off the bat.
You just bought yourself three months of forgiveness from that first phone call in 30 seconds.
Do you already know my perceive light could have achieved with through the roof?
My buyer's remorse went way down, you know and then the likely that I'm going to ascend to a higher level of service or by the next thing triples, right?
And so for us we always try and engineer wins as fast as humanly possible for us with a new client.
24:15
We like to have in the first seven days.
So for us, the main kpi, that we will drive, as a company is, what a client is going to make in the first fit for us.
It's 14.
But like we try and get in the first seven, but we collect.
And is this Jim launch?
Specifically.
No love them.
Oh, we try and figure out how we and if you're like, well, it might Industries, different think creatively.
24:35
Like, I don't, you know, I'm like, I can't meet with everybody individually.
The like, I promise you, we made this work with ever, even the bottle on buying Cycles, like the mortgages and the and the and the real estate guy.
Yeah.
Those are longer buying Cycles but there are still wins you can Stop emotionally, they can still deliver in the first seven to fourteen days speed is set is so valuable to people, especially business owners, if I sign a contract and nothing happens for 30 days.
24:56
I think the company I'm doing with ship immediately I automatically assumed, right?
But if I see activity, I see predictors, I see activation points that are happening, then, I know.
So if for us, I'll use the gym example, if we know that we're going to have to pull all these levers, right?
We're going to change the number of people that take a session in their price points, how we're going to sell chat, their Lobby all the different aspects.
25:17
We're going to change right, those are all heavy things, they're important but they can't talk.
Well, I'm going to just peel off the fastest, easiest win and deliver that in the first 14 days.
So that I gained the Goodwill to then say now you trust me enough to do these other things so it's our work and actually make you even more, it'll take a little time, but now they believe me and I bought myself to Goodwill Hope you guys enjoy.

Musa Nation.
A lot of times you guys.
Ask me about what is time to Value me.
What do quick wins mean?
How do we decide whether going to go for a high cost product or service or a low cost high volume product or service?
Are there ways that we can increase margin and provide more value?
All this and more plus how to add guarantees to your offer to make them so good.
0:18
People feel stupid saying No this is the part 2 of the Greg Hickman podcast.
We talked about agency owners how they can Market their business in.
Also probably more importantly how the small businesses those agencies are serving can productize their services in a way to get more customers saying yes at higher prices and doing so with even more margin than ever thought of enjoy.
0:37
Sell the farm, give away everything get people to say, yes, get people to give you money and then we'll have cash flow that we can start solving problems with.
Welcome to the game.
Where we talk about it, get more customers how to make more per customer and how to keep them longer and the many failures and lessons, we have learned along the way.
0:54
I hope you enjoy and subscribe.
That menu and I think in the book he talked about like you you're getting them like a 2,000 dollar sale in seven days or whatever is that just a strategy to show them that they can make 2K doing this but it isn't necessary.
Is it a piece of what they would be doing as they roll out those other things that you said felt heavier?
1:15
It can be it can be either a weight loss example.
Just to give a totally like a b2c example like we would get people basically a starvation diet for their first you know, few weeks.
Even though we knew it wasn't sustainable.
We because there's tons of research that supports that people actually have better long-term weight loss outcomes.
1:32
If they have a short term win.
So if someone loses 10 pounds, in the first two weeks, now, they believe me.
And I'm saying, hey, this isn't going to be something we can do forever.
I just want to show you that our stuff works.
We know what we're doing.
We have this in our back pocket.
This is to show you, we do know what we're doing, but we do think we need to transition to this which is going to be slower, but we're going to be able help you lose it for good.
1:50
Right.
And so now it's like but if I said hey it's going to be slower and have you lose it for good?
It's like the SEO argument.
How long am I going to wait come up to trust?
Do I have?
To have because like everybody, it's like, yeah, it's going to take six months for SEO to start working.
May be right?
But maybe you're just a scam artists from online.
That's going to say that and just collect six months of Billings and neck, literally do nothing in the way that you create these early wins.
2:10
Is again, you look at the customers that you have had the most success with, and then you say, what are the top 10 percent of my customers?
Go through?
What was different about what they went through.
In the beginning thing first is what these guys went to in the beginning and then that becomes at least preliminarily because you don't have any Baseline those becoming activation balls.
2:27
Which means that in the first three days these are the one or two or three things that we want to deliver to every customer.
And then all of the client experience and onboarding and customer success is geared around driving those activation ports because we know like this is posthumously correlated, right?
So we're looking after the fact that they will these things happened here, we don't know if all of them are important, but we know that if we do all of them will probably have some success and then piece by piece will discover more and we may be able to peel some back wheel like okay, we thought this was important, they don't care about as much as this, but these two things are the main thing, right?
2:56
Like In HubSpot, when they get a new customer, they know that they have to get someone to use five different functionalities in the CRM.
If they use five different functionalities or more than the likely, they stick is like forever, right?
But you got to get them to file, right?
And so, I know that in a different crn world for online trainers because we're involved in that space to they have to get their first five clients.
3:14
So they get five clients, they never cancer, but they need five and we have to deliver five as fast as possible.
So even if the strategy that you use to get the first five is different that you get to get the next 100 if this one happens faster than do this one first.
And then earn the trust to.
Then start this this journey.
3:30
If you wouldn't feel cool, show them.
You can run paid ads and get them leads.
So they know, you know you're talking about and then start the SEO Journey makes sense.
Yeah dude.
So you talk about a believe that forget what you called it and it is the cycle of price or the prayer forget which one it was, but it was tied to the delivery Cube and I've looked through the book multiple times to see if I can find where it is.
3:50
And I'm like, at this point, I don't know if it was one of your YouTube videos or I've because I listened to everything you do.
But you talk some we're about like when you are identifying how you're going to deliver the solution delivery vehicle of all those problems?
There's the ones.
Obviously you want to aim in totality high value low cost, which is where, you know, the ability to go to information and showing people the done with you is really strong but somewhere you said it's okay to have some high value high cost.
4:19
Things like probably not more than one or two.
Yes and so I'm a big believer in kind of utilizing the Tesla Model.
So we talked about that fairly often here as well.
Okay, yeah.
So a lot of people get started trying to like everyone tries to think about scale before they had value, which is right before they even know their avatars, right.
4:39
And I think that's just I think it's just silly there's no other word for it's just silly and instead you'll have way better marketing way better stories, know your avatar better solve more problems, just have way more.
You'll just your hands would be you know you roll your sleeves up.
You'll get way, more dirty.
You don't need to actually worry about this done for you think being your business?
4:56
Everyone has this foul Lucy and thinking that like the first thing they cells thing, there are still alive it just consider it getting paid to do R&D.
So what it is, you're getting a paid to do research and acquiring customers profitably for done for you, is probably the easiest thing in the entire world because it's so easy to sell, right?
5:11
It is harder to deliver.
Absolutely.
But if you learn how to deliver that, because you should then doing the next level down and doing done with you, were doing two levels down and doing complete, GOI becomes easier because now you have the story that works and make sense, like, hey, we have are done with your clients that are 20,000.
5:26
Month.
But if you wanted to use the same system that we use and just and will help you along the way, you can just pay 10 grand one time and learn the whole system, you know, or get certified through us or wafflebot, right?
And so it's way easier to acquire customers with high done for you because most people and I talk, I don't know if I told us that thing.
5:43
I told the story in a YouTube thing but I had a friend who got laid off use a chiropractor and he was like, hey man I need to make money.
I was like gonna make money or doing a chiropractor's I got to make money.
I was like cool so just use the gym or system.
So he just started selling weight loss and not even doing the To thing.
And in the first month or two months, he actually made no sense.
6:01
And I was like, well, what's going on?
And he was like, dude, I'm still trying to get my offer right because I don't want to over commit not be able to fill and I was like how many clients he was like zero knows like why are we having this discussion is like sell the farm.
Give away everything get people to say, yes.
6:18
Get people to give you money and then we'll have cash flow that we can start solving problems with.
Right?
And you have no idea what your clients, why?
Because you can fucking sold any So like go sell some stuff and then what happens is once you have all the solutions that you plan on delivering maybe your first couple people.
6:34
You deliver everything, right?
And even if you broke even on that, I'd rather break even with cash flow.
Because once I have flow right, create flow monetize flow then add friction.
So it's like, let's create the flow with a crazy offer, that's what the books about, right?
Monetize the flow because we can charge a lot for it, because we're going to, we're going to go to their house and you're like, I don't know if that's sustainable.
6:51
I flew around the country for a year and a half actually going to people's gyms and working the front desk and so people, Well, forget that they're like man.
I want to do what you want it but you're not really doing Alex did so you got to pick, right?
And so if you want to be in a niche and go work, the front desk, go fly out to a salon, go flat 25, slide 10 salons, right?
7:07
And learnable markets, learn the different nuances, learn how different salons work, right?
And then on your sales calls, when you do decide to make your pivot down to a more scalable model, right?
You can say, listen, 80% of clinics are doing this.
This is all horseshit.
The 20% that drives, all the profit is this, that's what I'm going to help you focus on.
7:23
So then you end up, stripping and stacking everything that doesn't Her out and just focusing productizing on the most valuable highest profit things that you discovered through the R&D that you got paid to do.
Yes, for some of the newer clients that might be watching this and of the replay, this is what we tell you to do in the book, you know?
7:43
You'd like you said you list out all of the things, all the problems that they have and then identify Solutions and you take him to the, to the delivery Cube.
What are different ways, which is an amazing exercise.
But something we both I believe have similar thoughts on is to sell something.
Being up front that has a an end date with a clear outcome and then as you call it Down Sally or upsell.
8:04
So can you talk about like, when someone has this laundry list of things that they can do?
How do you figure out where to draw that line on?
What should the front end be?
So you won't consumables to be recurring and you want the one-time things to be the one time value, right?
That's the simple simple statement.
8:20
So, I actually just drew this out yesterday because I was thinking about this.
So maybe this will be some off.
The, you might see some YouTube content on this.
I'm building.
If I'm building, recurring Revenue, you've got physical digital, and then you've got collateralized and consumable and so I'm just going to go.
8:37
I'm going to a super zoom out and then I'm gonna come back in.
All right?
So a simple consumable would be like toothpaste, right?
Known here is really on subscription for toothpaste but a toothpaste company gets old but you know, Bob I proctoring anaphora zillion dollars, right?
And it's because you're still recurring.
You just buying once every month or whatever, right?
8:54
But it is the weakest type of recurring and it's A physical consumable, right?
A level above, that would be a physical that's collateralized.
So razors you by the razor and then the consumables are the razor, you buy the printer in the consumables of the ink cartridge, you put your stuff in storage and then you have to keep paying for the storage.
9:11
There's collateral, right?
They have something of yours that they're paying for.
These are both in the Physical Realm, and the digital realm, same thing versus consumables, and and things that are collateralized.
So the ideal World in terms of business value is to have something that's purely digital, and Collateral.
9:27
Which is why crms are so valuable because they have all your payment info, all your contacts, all your everything, and for you to leave is really hard because they have collateral, they have your stuff right.
Dropbox has all your files, so hard to leave those.
Right?
And so to go to the consumables, that's where, what are the things that a business is going to consume on a regular basis?
9:44
They're going to consume Financial Services, they're going to have a bookkeeper.
They're going to consume marketing services so they're going to have an agency or media buyer.
Right.
And so like for us it's like you want to sell the system as a one-time thing.
Then all the things that the system consumes as the recurring thing.
10:00
So you've got the machine and then you've got inputs and outputs, right?
So, you build the machine for the one time, and then you sell the inputs because they need more inputs over and over again.
Once you've helped them build machine, and then you can price those according to what the machine that you have built for them creates.
And so this is the biggest question I go out.
10:15
I'm just going to tack it on to figure somebody's going to ask.
Anyways, my clients are broke, they can't afford what I want to charge.
Well, the average gym owner makes thirty six thousand dollars a year.
Little less than that actually.
And we charge 42, right?
And that's her back in Prague Running program 16.
So you're 16 and then 42.
That's a lot of money and that's why it's 42,000 just for the record.
10:32
So that's what they make more than what they make in a year.
That's more than what they make currently.
But not more than what they make.
Once they use the machine that we have the belt.
So we price based on the value that weird know that our machine is going to help them produce, right?
And so it's the same thing where like and this is why we were able to just Crush everybody who's in the agency world because they would try and go to gym owners and sell them leads or saw them services and they could never charged more than 1,000.
10:56
Bucks a month because there was so little margin because gym owners were making any money.
Unless they had, they get priced out over ten bucks, a lie.
And they say, I can't do this anymore, it's too much sleep are guys can spend 50 bucks to lead because they make so much more money per customer because we show them how to sell High ticket how to set up the sales room with the offer supposed to be.
11:12
We give them all the Fulfillment stuff.
We show them how to sell supplements transaction.
We give them all the help to do that so that they can look at the cost of acquisition or make a profit on the acquisition, some back-end.
And so the idea is you solve a system, right?
And then the recurring, the downside, the upsell is going to be consumables of that system.
In a coaching training Consulting model that done with you.
11:30
What does that look like from a consumable piece on the back end then.
So we work with agencies through Allen.
So what they would so on the agency front end was they would solve the system, right?
That's the defined and thing is that by the end of this, so like what's the clear deliverable?
So let's say it's salon owners, right?
11:46
So it's like, okay, salon owners.
I'm going to help you double the average ticket to the person who walks in the door and five times the LCB by using our four step, you know, appointment system that X Y Z's and put Products in and will will show you how to add recurring with hair colorings and cuts and whatever, right?
That's the system.
12:02
Once they have the model, then they automatically make way more money from everything else that they ever do.
Awesome.
That means that we can charge more cool.
So, let's solve that problem first, so that we can then price what we want.
And so then what we sold on the back end, was shows because that's what they consume, they consume shows, that's what the machine that we built them, eats it eats people walking in the door and so we have to sell them, the people that it has to eat and so on the gym side, what we did was slightly different but still Concept is that we would test.
12:28
We spent about fifty thousand a month, testing ads and a bunch markets.
We had like 10 or 20 markets that we do representative tests in.
And then when we had the winners, you just license the winners to everyone.
So for them, they knew how to run ads.
They had the machine, but I would immediately save them on all of the, the lost and spend that they would normally have testing and not getting results.
12:50
And so, if you knew that every single ad that you had was a winner, how valuable would that be very?
And for us, it's high margin because it's media, right?
So it's a hundred percent gross margins and so that was one of the things that we had on the back end.
In addition to that it's like, what are the other problems read that are going to come up from, you know, having this new machine?
13:09
Well, now, they have to hire more trainers.
Well, are hiring systems going to be on the back end.
You have to hire salespeople.
So the, the sales scripts and the, and the ads for hiring salespeople, in the back end, you're gonna have to train those people.
That's why we have something that we call boiler room.
So that all of the sales people from all the gyms meet every morning on a call that we host to train their sales teams.
13:27
Right?
Because that's something that's consumable.
They're going to have to keep doing over and over again.
So it's like what are the activities in the business that have to continue to occur as a result of the system that we sold them?
And then those are all the things that we will bundle and sell on the back end.
So when people are like, I don't know what I'm going to do in the back.
It's like it means you haven't solved any problems on the front of problems in the front, there's going to be problems on the back and you just get to solve those problems.
13:48
Hey guys real quick for those of you guys who are 100 million-dollar offers fans I love you.
I added in a lost chapter that has never been released.
I'm releasing it now transparently.
I'm doing that to build hype 400 dollar leads but you will have the unreleased chapter it talks about your first Avatar and how to segment customers to make more money.
14:07
You can get it by going to acquisition.com forward slash leads.
Its fo free in exchange for your email so that I can email you when we launched under Miller leads and so that you can not miss out on it.
Because last time I sold out for like eight straight weeks really fast, so that is my way of making sure that y'all get first dibs.
14:25
You obviously talk in the book about guarantees and I've seen a lot of new ads out in the marketplace with guarantees which I'm like up.
They read the book can you talk about?
Like I was having a conversation with one of my buddies about this like you can obviously use a guarantee as like a sales tool.
14:41
If you're selling via the phone, is that like the one of rollout is I'm going to use this as a tactic to get them over the line if there's an objection because sometimes there is an objection, we're even need to offer a guarantee but then there's also the putting it in your marketing.
Is that the appropriate rolled out, like test it on call as a tool and then if it's working bring it out to the marketplace.
15:02
Like it almost is your offer if the guarantee can be good enough, I think that there's lots of ways to skin the cat.
So I don't want to give like a broad, sweeping generalized, answer for that.
I think testing on the phone is a good idea and then making it the offer also works.
I think there's two pieces that I think everyone at least that I try to confer whatever tell people is that one for many people a guarantee is a is a structured risk.
15:24
It's a risk.
We're you know all the variables so maybe you need to test it on the phone for a handful of people see the results and then measure, but nine times out of 10, you're going to make more money.
Having to guarantee.
You will sell more people than you, otherwise would have even - the extra returns that you'll have a result.
Most people though are still so afraid of making a guarantee that they make the contingency.
15:43
So so extreme that the guarantees worthless but and the thing is, if the guarantees worthless is not as compelling, right?
So I try to guarantee things that I'm almost afraid of guaranteeing and if I'm Is that means they'll get greedy and if they get greedy means, I'll make money and so big picture.
15:59
Here's here's just a thought experiment that I like to demonstrate the power of it.
So most of us are in B2B Services were listening, is, I would imagine.
And so if your B2B, let's say that your offer was, I'll double your profit in 30 days, I'll double your business in 30 days.
Whatever, write something crazy, right?
Or I'll pay you twice the amount of money.
16:15
You paid me back.
How difficult would it be to sell that?
Not at all.
And so if anyone is struggling to get customers, think about that.
As an extreme example, right?
On the flip side, you have Everyone else's stuff, which is painting.
Maybe your results may be, don't doesn't matter.
I get paid anyway, that's the that's what most people offer, fewer to boil it down to soup and nuts, right?
16:32
And so the question is, is there a place between extreme a and extreme be where we could peel off one or two of these things?
From the side?
Still have a really strong guarantee, that's very compelling and ultimately some more and make more.
Now the underlying point of the entire book that's unspoken which I think you picked up in a lot of people picked up is that we were like, well, if I guarantee that, what happens if they don't get the outcome, it's like then fix the product.
16:55
This was the my knowledge that was wrapped as a marketing book, right?
But the book does not go about marketing at all.
It's a product, it's a book on product by and so the problem is people aren't providing value.
That's the problem.
And that's the basic problem for all the businesses that don't make money because you should be able to say, a really bold claim.
17:14
And if you can't say really bold claim, then solve why you can't say really bold claim rather than not making it.
So I think it's just a better question which is like how could we guarantee that they're going to.
How could we do that?
Because if you ask better questions will get better answers rather than how can we pick people into thinking?
17:31
It's a guarantee when it really isn't because you create wealth, you create wealth through value, right?
And that's that.
Like, you can only sell people once and this is the whole the Dan Kennedy most people get customers to make sales rather than make sales to get customers.
Right?
17:46
And it sounds like it, minor semantic difference but it's important because most marketers that exist in the in the information or Internet space which is a lot of people, right?
They try to get a customer to just make a sale.
That's the whole goal for them is the sale, right?
Rather than I'd rather create the relationship that I can then have have an ongoing exchange of value over and over and over again which makes you unbeatable.
18:09
It's so hard to compete against a business.
That that just consistently provides more value than they charge for.
But people are like, well then I need to lower my price.
You can increase the price divided government.
See by lowering your price, you absolutely can do that.
That's what Netflix does.
That's the Dropbox does.
That's why I mean like, think about it.
Nine dollars a month.
18:25
Think about how many things that we charge on the internet that are charged for more than nine dollars a month, that are way less viable.
The Netflix, all right, but for most of us we don't have tons and tons and tons of funding to be able to do that.
And so the other way of doing is increasing the value, right?
And then correspondingly increasing the price to a certain degree so you still have a discrepancy between what you charge and what they get, but it's still far more than what you currently are doing.
18:48
Which is why it's like, how do I create value, solve all the problems they have and you don't have to do done for you for all the problems.
That's why The delivery tube is like I give the example groceries because I think it's such a simple thing.
Everybody understands like if you start losing weight, Susie's got to start buying groceries different, right?
19:03
Well let's think of all the different ways we could solve that problem, right?
We could we could create a calculator that helps or calculate it.
We could pre-make PDFs that already have the list for every week.
We could we could pre-populated instacart that already has each week already pre-loaded.
She clicks it with one button.
We can have affiliation with a meal prep company.
19:20
The first time we could do a tour with her meet her at the grocery store and go with her at her local.
Store, how valuable would that be?
We could provide tech support during period of hours that when everyone goes grocery shopping where there to respond and show and say, hey, and they can text us if they're curious about, if this can of soup or this kind of soup is the right can write, like, we could have cost support.
19:38
We can have, you know, I mean, all of these things are different ways to solving the same one problem.
And so the idea is, we do need to solve every problem or every perceived problem to get the sale, right?
And then the business economics behind it is where we figure out which of these different ways of solving the problem.
Provides the most value and has Most margin for us as a business in his most scalable.
19:57
I know we have just a couple minutes left.
Guys, again, if you haven't picked up his book yet, Amazon and get on Kindle hard copy you makes literally almost no money on any of these things.
He's doing it because he's an awesome human being.
I've since my friend 35 cents if I recite 35 cents, guys, if I sense, but a couple just random off-the-cuff quick question.
20:18
So since starting acquisition.com, right?
Like you mentioned you'd say, you know, companies above 3 million, but really it's more like five million.
Ian and you have kind of an interesting Dynamic of companies.
Least from what you've told me about what types they are, what's been the most?
Like surprising thing that you seen from these owners as you've kind of inserted yourself into their businesses.
20:39
Businesses that we work.
Best with have a clearly defined integrator and Visionary.
So married couples work really well or people who have to two partners that are clearly defined.
They work really well because usually that we just need to fix the model and they blow up when it's the single founder.
We need to help them find that integrator our operator.
20:57
Sometimes they're in the business, but maybe they're not as strong as they should be.
So that that tends to take more time.
But for most businesses that are at that 35-ish million, we usually need to figure out a way to make the lifetime gross profit per customer higher.
That's usually, which is what's the next off?
Ring, you know, I mean that we're going to provide and how are we going to sell it?
21:12
How we're going to price that we can deliver on it in a way that's scalable went on that usually get someone from, you know, it depends on the size of the market but you know, from five million to, you know, 20 or 25.
That's usually the next kind of step for most of those guys.
So, you mentioned next offer and I'll sit to piggyback off what you said.
Earlier, one product, one Prospect one channel to get you to a million.
21:30
Pretty sure.
I saw Layla say on Instagram to tend I could get you to 10 million.
So with the front-end back-end, like the continuity piece.
Do you consider the continuity more of an extension of the Ten verses like it's the next offer.
Like, when should someone be adding continuity?
Because I know like we have a back-end program and we're obviously sub 3 million were above one.
21:48
But like, where does it make sense?
And is that actually, a different offer?
It depends on it.
So, I would say, I would categorize them.
So, six ways of increasing lifetime gross profit per customer right price.
So you increase the price, decrease the costs, get them to buy more times upsells process down cells, right?
22:03
Those are the six ways of doing it.
So if we're thinking about the back of these, are their upsell, or cross-sell or down.
So I would say, it depends on what the So if we're delivering more of the same thing, then I would consider that at down south because it's like, down to the upside.
It's like, it's consuming the thing that's going to feed the machine and if you do that, I would adequately you really don't have turn because they always need the thing that feed the machine, right?
22:23
The upsells, which is usually where we will try and build some sort of upsell, but most times people try and cross sell.
And that is the mistake.
That is mistake.
That is what most on Tremors jump to, which is I have a distribution based on Sodom something else.
And usually, that's not the time to do it because they end up having two companies and their see of companies and UK PC of two companies.
22:42
Because if you look at every Fortune 500, their CEO of one company, the only solution is Elon and he's not actually see of any of them, use the owner and founder.
And so there's really no Fortune 500 company.
That is like, yeah, I'm see you at Home Depot and Dairy Queen.
You and me just like, that's not, but we do that all.
The time is not supposed to be thing.
22:58
For some reason, if we started the company to solve our problems, when in reality, we just create double the problems that we had.
And we still never Advanced past the point of our incompetence, which is where I can tell you, this is one of the themes that I've seen repeated over.
It over and over again.
So I can drive this one which is you will make the amount of money based on what level of entrepreneur, anyone that's like level of entrepreneur times opportunity size that is with the amount of money that you will make, right?
23:23
And so most people entrepreneur wise, they'll have a 3 million dollar business and they'll start a second business and then I'll have to one and a half million dollar businesses with less profit.
This happens in the brick and mortar world all the time.
Yeah, well location truly profitable.
They start a second location.
Then they start Third location, right happens with some of These generalist service providers that they add a different service but arguably it's a completely different business.
23:44
Whatever business exactly.
And so until you can really transition to owner which everyone thinks they are but the reality is that they just Outsource sales but they're still see em.
Oh they're still CEO, they're still see 00, right?
They still have four hats on and they think that somehow there because they are owners also that they are owners exclusively on.
24:04
That is not the reality.
And so for the companies that we're working with, like, in the beginning, it's like, I'll Leti.
So we have Focus.
We drive the the one channel we maximize what we have there.
So we know that we can put somebody's in charge of that channel.
Then we can take time from the owner to who's really still Chief product officer.
24:21
Write also that hat and really create the next product offer and sometimes it takes time, you know?
I mean like I mean, it might take six months just to get those two things to happen, you know what I mean?
And that's weird.
When we try and work with entrepreneurs, we want to have an extended time arises, which is like a 12 week program is not going to help someone go from 5 million to 30 million.
24:39
We we take equity in the companies are working with because we're looking for people were like, sometimes you have to take a step back in order to take three steps forward and that's just true.
Like, if you're offering six things and you have to cut five of them because they're not profitable, your Revenue will drop, you'll also have to get rid of teammates that you don't need.
24:56
But now, the new business may be far more profit.
I'll give you one example that might just drive this home.
Also, the first company I took over, acquisition.com had a 1.6 million dollar which is small.
But I really like the guy 1.6 million dollar Brick, and mortar business, and they to five hundred thousand, dollar-a-year agency.
25:13
All right, that was helping this type of regular business.
And so what I told him to do was I hated the pin, the model so we killed the business.
I killed the 500,000 or your business making money, right?
You killed it and then we started the new model which is what we do now which is we own all the locations.
25:30
And so now we have 10 locations.
We open a new location every month and so that business went from what he was doing then is now 14 months later is doing two hundred thousand a week.
Right, but for the first 90 days, Revenue went down.
But it's like it, so that's why I'm there to be like, breathe, okay?
25:47
Like it's fine.
Like you see where we're going?
Like you see how things are getting simpler?
Like, you have to get simpler Pare down focus and then we can have the explosive growth because it's really easy to do.
One thing a hundred times, it's very hard to do.
One thing 100 things one time, which is what most people do in their businesses, especially on the custom guys, you'll never sell the business.
26:04
You'll never scale the business.
It's horrible the last question before you tell us again, where we can go for all the free stuff.
And and also, I think you should share why you're doing this because I think Really awesome.
So, again, this more of a selfish one, but like, training coaching space, what do you feel like we're all missing that we need to get right in order to kind of build something of substance most people haven't done it.
26:26
I mean, most like we're being super real.
Most people haven't done the thing that they're selling.
They had to do, I mean, how many business coaches are talking about scaling a business than a scalable business before he's right.
You know, I mean, like, that's that's the real runs because everyone, everyone so status driven and everyone wants to everyone's a successful before, they actually are wants to fake it till they make it.
26:42
But I'll tell Tell you, if you make it, you don't have to fake it.
And so, the whole thing with acquisition.com is only when I probably take about 45 million in dividends out of the businesses are last 45 years and the new chapter I feel like is the scorecard, is changing for me, from revenue and profit to just kind of like meaning and things that I drive Joy from.
27:00
And so, I thought was the most valuable thing that I can give the marketplace besides money.
Now, we donate, you know, we donate a couple million bucks.
I was 2 years to Charities that we find meaning in which are usually education-based, but like, I believe education is the thing that's going to set everyone free.
And so I think that most of us Anybody want to like formal College was kind of chips?
27:15
I think if you can have, if you could make the same money after a four-year, Twitter that imagine a four year 200,000 or coaching program, you made the exact same money afterwards, it's ridiculous.
And no one called him, which is hilarious to me.
But anyways, so my thought process is, can I give any other people are teaching business, never had a business like, all right, in the College of Civic, but the most valuable thing I can do the marketplaces, give all the experiences, the skills, the traits, and the beliefs, that have shaped where we are now to everyone.
27:41
And I know that with media, I can give that all wait for free at no cost.
And so the whole idea that was not calm is just give away more value for free than other people charged for.
I mean, that's that's the strategy and then hopefully get people from zero to, you know, 35 million on their own with no assistance.
27:58
And if you're the type of person that doesn't need assistance in, was able to use the stuff that we gave, then you'd be a perfect fit for the type of business that I want to, you know, invest in and then help grow to the next thing because I know that you won't need the handled it, right?
And so, you know, my works.
I know that you work and so as a result we can kind of work off of Shared shared trust.
28:14
And you know that the downside risk for me is that I just hope a lot of people prefer which a lot of man.
Well, we all appreciate it.
I know.
I appreciate it guys.
If you haven't gotten the book, I'll drop a links in the thread below, this but definitely download the book or all three growth.

Hey guys, love that.
You're listening to the podcast.
If you ever want to have the video version of this which usually has more effects, more visuals, more graphs, you know, drawn out stuff.
Sometimes it can help hit the brain centers in different ways.
You can check out my YouTube channel, it's absolutely free.
Go check that out, if that's what you are into.
0:16
And if not keep enjoying the show, Amazon has been the pioneer of prime of two day.
Shipping one day, shipping one, our shipping, right?
And they continue to try and drive this down, because they know that the faster than get people to things, they want the more that they will value.
And like it and repeat buying on the platform.
0:33
Welcome to the game, where we talk about how to sell more stuff to more people in more ways and build businesses worth owning.
I'm trying to build a billion-dollar thing with acquisition.com.
I always wish besos musk and buffeted documented their Journey.
So I'm doing it for the rest of us.
Please share and enjoy.
I am pissed, not really.
0:49
But I recently was on a podcast, a few months ago via my first million podcast with salmon, Sean, great guys.
And we were talking about my book and really other offers, which you can get Amazon Kindle for 99 cents if you don't have the dollars for a hardback and I heard on a later podcast that I wasn't on that.
1:06
Sean was saying, yeah, I really loved the book but it's just a bummer.
Doesn't apply to e-commerce and I disagree.
And that is why I'm making this to break down.
Why the value equation, in the things inside of the under law first book, which pretty much, this this visual right here, encapsulate sore or summarizes.
1:22
The vast majority of the pieces in the book and obviously there's a lot more examples and stories and as, you know, a lot of five-star reviews on Amazon.
So check it out for 99 cents.
If you Ain't.
But the main point is that these are variables that create purchasing decisions that get people to Value something in order to buy it because they valued in excess of the price tag.
1:41
And the idea here is, if we understand the things that drive value, then we can understand the things that underpin price which then lead to profits.
All right?
And so in the book I do give a lot of service-based examples both to B2B and b2c.
But I wanted to take this as using a little bit different and talk about how it applies to e-commerce.
1:57
All right, because the end of the day people buy stuff because they value All right.
And so the application may be somewhat different but the fundamentals, and the variables are the same.
Okay?
And so, quick recap on this dream outcome is people actually have to want the thing that you're delivering to them.
Number one, number two is that when they buy, they will buy based on the perceived likelihood that they're going to get that thing.
2:17
So it's like a lot of people may want to get rich but they will buy the one that they think that has the highest likelihood of actually them getting there or a lot of people might want to look skinny, but the work with the physician that has worked, with 10,000 patients rather than their first patient because they're perceived I could've actually getting skinny or getting the surgery.
They want is higher and the in a very real way, value it.
2:34
More time delay is how quickly something can happen right?
Is between when I buy and when I get if we can compress that time Horizon at that time line, the more valuable it is.
If I can get you a six-pack in 30 days for a six-pack and 30 months, which one you value more, of course, the 30 days one.
So we try and compress the time Horizon along, how we deliver our products and services and then finally effort and sacrifice the things that we have to start doing that.
2:56
We don't want to do.
We have to give up doing that?
We do want to do as a result of The purchase and so in a perfect world, we want to deliver someone the dream outcome, and when they buy it because they have extremely high like that are there certain that there are going to achieve that and they're going to achieve it overnight with.
He's right so fast, easy and exactly what they want, the way they want it to be delivered.
3:16
All right, so, that's what we have to think about here.
Now, in the book, I talk about scarcity, urgency guarantees bonuses and naming.
All right.
And so what I want to do is just apply these and the easiest way to look at this and prove out the point that this 100 applies e-commerce is to look at the e-commerce.
Giant.
Giants.
All right, specifically.
3:31
Let's just look at Amazon and over time, they've really nailed down, hitting each and every single one of these variables that drive value.
Now, if you are an e-commerce person and you're like, why can't sell on Amazon?
Well, one is you can.
The other is that you can start thinking about it, through Amazon lenses, and of course, it's taken him 30 years to build this thing, right?
3:49
But we can still think if this is the theoretical that we need to try and shoot for, this is the ideal scene, then we can start taking steps towards it to improve the value of our offerings.
Okay cool.
Now if let's say I wanted to buy a jacket, all right?
So this is a very different example than my normal ones and I have other examples and services with this one is just for physical products.
4:08
So let's say I wanted to buy a jacket.
My dream outcome might be that I look good in this jacket.
That could be an outcome it could be that I it's very warm.
Ideally maybe it's both of those things right now might even want a jacket that looks good.
And that isn't warm because I just want to wear because I think it looks good but I don't get hot right?
So it depends what your Malcolm is.
4:24
Rights are going to have different messaging for different avatars depending on the product itself and what problem it solves Right.
So let's just use, for example, that I just want a fashionable jacket, that looks cool, okay?
So that's that's point one around what our Dream outcome is great.
Now, I may be a buyer who's like, but I'm not that fashionable and I don't really know how to like pair stuff and make it.
4:44
Look cool.
All right.
So what are the ways that we can increase the perceived likely of achievement of me?
Achieving this cool look?
All right.
Well, first off is reviews.
If I have lots of five-star reviews on my page and I can read them, then I'm more likely to make.
4:59
Purchase because I see other people made the purchase and are happy about it.
Right makes sense.
That's why reviews Amazon pioneered this and then it became commonplace because it increase the perceived likely of achievement.
Right?
What else can we do?
And I actually saw this Levi's did this for selling a jean jacket, which is why I'm giving the examples, he was so masterful and how they did it, but they did is that I saw this video, it was maybe 90 seconds and it had the jean jacket, and it had three different ways you can wear and they showed here.
5:26
So you pair it with dark stuff here.
So you pair with light stuff.
Here's how you pair it with With the same looking Gene blah blah blah.
And I was like, wow, I did not know how jean jackets work but now I do and now I know how to wear it.
So my perceive likelihood of achieving the dream outcome of looking cool.
Has just gone up, simply by them making a video that demonstrated it right?
5:46
These variables apply to services and e-commerce just the same.
It's just the way that we show.
Someone how to experience the dream Malcolm they desire differ.
All right.
In a let's say it's a I'm teaching a skill.
Going to show somebody who has the skill, showing them demonstrating the skill and the results of having that skill, right?
6:06
That would be increasing the perceive I could.
But if it's a physical product then we have to think.
What's the outcome they want?
And then how do we increase the likelihood that they say they see that and easy ways to demonstrate it right at the literally demonstrate, this is probably what you're thinking and here's how it works, that's why unboxing videos and things like that work because it decreases the risk associated with making the purchase.
6:25
Because they're like, oh that's what's going to happen?
It decreases the other side of me, swiping.
My card.
What happens after that, right?
And as much as we can demystify, what happens after they say, oh I now can create expectations and then these this product will meet the expectations.
I will be happy great.
Now, the next one is time to light.
6:42
Amazon has been the pioneer of prime of two day.
Shipping one day, shipping one, our shipping, right?
And they continue to try and drive this down because they know that the faster than get people to things, they want the more that they will value and like it and repeat buying on the platform, right?
And so this should be a no-brainer, this absolutely applies to you.
6:59
Commerce.
All right, now the next one and that can also apply different levels, right?
There's the actual purchasing experience but then there's also the experience of using the products.
It depends on types of products that you have like a jacket might not have a huge time delay in terms of using it.
If you sold custom-tailored stuff then delivering it faster or finding a way to operationalize, that more quickly would be very real value, right?
7:20
Right.
So there's the purchasing process and then there's also the like the wearing process, all right?
And like unboxing and actually having them experience again, the dream Alka Hey, most addition quick break just to let you know that we've been starting to post on LinkedIn and want to connect with you.
7:36
All right, so send me a connection request.
A note letting me know that you listen to the show and I will accept it.
There's anyone you think that would be should be connected with tag them in one of my or Layla's posts?
And I will give you all the love in the world.
All right, so let's get back to the show.
Now, finally of these four variables, we have evidence sacrifice.
7:55
And so the purchasing decision here, Amazon has one, click purchases with everything are on file save so you can make a purchasing decision in a split second, right?
And so that's why the rise of products like bolt and Shop.
Pay are all things that have decreased the effort and sacrifice.
And a lot of e-commerce stores, have been able to use this to their advantage and make more sales, right?
8:15
And that's because in a real way, things have become more valuable.
So decrease the likelihood people are going to buy, all right?
But let's look at the other ratchets that I said, these are inside of the book, are enhancers a value.
They do even more to increase the value equation in your favor, so that you can sell more stuffs, okay?
8:32
So let's look at Amazon.
For example, what do they have under virtually?
Every single item?
How many they have left in stock is their way of showing scarcity, only two left.
Only six left, only 17 left and then they have it by size, right?
So that they can show scarcity at every single level.
8:49
Huh what does that do?
It drives conversions.
People want to buy?
All right.
Are you guys are you guys tracking with me?
Does this feel like it applies to you Commerce?
Let's keep going urgency.
What else does Amazon?
Do?
They have Lightning Deals, right?
When you do a limited drop, a limited edition, drop of a t-shirt, there's only 100 printed and we drop them on Friday.
9:10
And first come first serve.
What does that do?
It gives scarcity and because you were giving it there's a Time component.
It adds urgency now we to really add urgency would say we're only selling these.
For an hour but hopefully the point drives home.
All right, buddy, lightning deal.
For example, where they said, we're only giving this price for for 60 minutes.
9:27
That is absolutely urgency.
All right, seeing how many you have left is absolutely scarcity.
Are you guys tracking with this?
All right.
Cool.
Now guarantees.
So, what do we do here?
Well, Amazon, took this one step further, not only do they already have a money back guarantee, right?
9:43
Because it's satisfaction.
You don't have to do anything.
You just send it back and they made it easy to return stuff.
What they did now is try before you buy So they have seven-day layaway so you can buy the thing and they charge you seven days later.
You can literally try the thing on and not even have to get built on the card.
10:00
Right.
Why did they do that?
It's a version of a guarantee.
Why?
Because what we're doing is we're decreasing the risk of someone purchasing, right?
That's what we're doing here.
We're decreasing the likelihood that they have a poor experience which as an inverse increases, the likelihood that they do have positive experience if they choose to purchase.
10:16
So it's like if I'm trying it on before I buy it, then I'll be very Darn sure that.
If I like it, I'm my perceive like, bit of a chief of achieving the outcome after I'm wearing.
It is very, very high.
That's why they did it, right.
This is an implied guarantee.
It's a version of guarantee, so, they technically have to guarantees.
10:34
They have one, which is the money back guarantee, which is now, become almost table Stakes for physical products, but on top of that, they added in a try before you buy now bonuses.
All right?
Some of these ones will include bonuses.
Like the training that I said for Levi's, like little videos on how you can tips and tricks on how you can use this thing, right.
10:51
If you have a widget that's like at home health, kitchen stuff, having videos on how they can actually use the thing.
And better ways is huge.
If you have a supplement business, for example, telling people how to take the products and the best thing is to combine it with and what time of day and how they can make sure they don't forget it and blah, blah.
11:06
Those are all things that can be bonuses, that can be perceived benefits of doing the thing, right in all of this stuff goes back to these variables, okay?
In increasing value and increasing the like that, somebody wants to buy all right and then finally naming it.
In a way that I think it will be cool.
11:22
If I said my dream outcome was that I wanted a warm jacket then probably having warm or hot or fire or Flames or oven right in the name, might be something.
That would increase my likely that I'm thinking, this is going to be something that I will help make sure experience my dream Malcolm, right?
Okay.
Now on the flip side, if I want to just something that was fashioned, one light that it might be a light fashion jacket.
11:42
Right?
And so it's telling me the dream outcome, so we have to be explicit in what we were doing and I'll also bed, you write that you'll have different avatars will be Different things or maybe same Avatar, but they're solving different needs.
So the question is, what job is?
Are we trying to do?
What's the job to be done?
11:58
And then everything else is going to fall down from there now?
Amazon, specifically people named it based on the things that people search for right?
Which makes sense.
Because why would they do that?
Because it's exactly what I was looking for, by naming it properly.
And so, my hope here is that this at least gives you a little bit of a cursory overview of the things that you can do within an e-commerce or physical products business to apply the hundred dollar offer framework.
12:21
To make your stuff more buyable.
So that people increase in higher amounts at higher percentages.
And they do so willing to pay higher prices because you have checked all these boxes off and the competitors that you have might even have the same product as you, but they have an increase, the perceived negative achievement.
12:37
They haven't shown how demonstrated, how they can use the product.
They don't have guarantees, they don't have try before you buy.
It's, it takes two weeks to get there.
And the purchasing process of pain in the ass.
They have to make an entire profile, they have to do all the stuff, right?
And they find out that there is no scarcity.
So, as far as They're concerned they could buy this whenever so they can come back next week if they feel like it right?
12:54
And there's no urgency or time timeline where they do it, because maybe maybe this is seasonal for for you.
But for them, it's your round.
So again, they can take even more time to make the decision, right?
And then in terms of bonuses, yours comes with all these different trainings and things like that, they can and how to use the product and how to use it in different ways.
And even how to use it for different avatars, to solve different problems, because people are going to experience different problems that they're using.
13:14
Their hiring your product to solve.








0:00
Hey guys, real quick.
So Leyland are definitely working on our social media presence.
If you guys haven't noticed and we're just breaking now into LinkedIn.
All right.
It's not as bad as I thought it's actually a pretty awesome so far and you guys have been really cool in there and people are sharing our stuff a lot.
So if we aren't connected on LinkedIn, it go ahead and let's connect and let's rock and roll.
0:17
And so what you have to do is you have to peel in your past and say, when did I exhibit these?
Things is all of us have exhibited.
These character traits at some point in our life.
And then what you do is you say, I am this way because and then you tell yourself the story, Or he's of the things you did in the past that exhibited those traits, the wealthiest people in the world, see business as a game.
0:36
This podcast, the game is my attempt at documenting, the lessons.
I've learned on my way to building acquisition.com into a billion dollar portfolio.
My Hope Is that you use the lessons to grow your business and maybe someday soon partner with us to get $200 and Beyond.
I hope you share and enjoy.
The most powerful things that change our behavior and our character are the stories.
0:54
We tell ourselves, I think that when I started out in business, I heard all these things in the personal development space, like, you should read these affirmations every morning, blah, blah blah blah.
I never did that and it was because it felt stupid to me.
Now, that being said there might be some people who had life-changing results from doing that.
1:09
But what I did notice is that the stories I would tell myself about myself were the things that changed my beliefs.
They were the things that changed my character and One of times that talked about how entrepreneurship is about three things, it's about changing the beliefs that you have, it's about increasing the skill set that you have.
1:27
And then the character traits they go along with that to make sure the skills are successful.
So I'll give you a simple example for this.
So, a friend of mine, you started a fitness app, it was doing about twenty thousand dollars a month.
He was a top game CrossFit games competitor, but he was really a shame because he wasn't the winner.
He was like, you know, really really highly ranked one, but he wasn't the winner.
1:42
And so he felt he believed that his app wasn't good enough and so we never promoted it, so it grew to twenty thousand dollars.
Month in Revenue with him doing zero promotion, right?
And when he realized that it was okay for him to promote it and people got a lot of value from it in the app, was good enough, he went from twenty thousand dollars a month to like a hundred fifty thousand dollars a month, like that.
2:04
And the difference was his beliefs, his skills were the same, right?
It's character traits of the same.
He changed his beliefs, right?
So let me give you a different example.
So when I actually started out getting in my own business, I had a chain of gyms.
This is a very very, you know, there's a ten years ago, I'd change.
2:20
And I knew how to run sales teams, I knew how to generate leads, I need to do all these things.
But what ended up happening was, I had one missing piece, which is also a belief darn.
I was actually trying to give you a different one, but I had a mentor come in and say, you need to be, you need to get in the licensing business.
2:36
You know, license is modeled W, people rather than doing the actual model yourself.
And so, I did make that transition.
And then we went from, I think, you know, I think we did like two or three million dollars to doing seven in the next year, we did 28 million.
So the year that we made the transition halfway, Through is what jumped us from two or three to seven.
2:51
And it was just in the last, like, four months that we saw this crazy growth and then we did 20 million next year.
And so, it was because I had all these skills, and I also had the character traits.
I just needed again to change my beliefs.
I was trying to give you an example with the character traits, I'll let me think of one.
Ah, so if you have, for example, if I had had those skills, but I didn't have the character traits of being disciplined and being focused on one thing, I would have jumped between multiple, you know, entrepreneurial Endeavors and never been able to see success.
3:16
Because even though I had the beliefs about what was possible.
Like if I'd said okay.
To do gyms, and I'm going to do chiropractors, I'm going to do dentist, I'm going to do X, Y, and Z, right?
Until I, the character trait of focus, the character trait of discipline, then I would not have seen the success, right?
And so the next natural question is okay.
3:31
Well, if I have to have a line to believe skills and character traits at each level of the ladder because you can have, and this is what's crazy.
When you see the overnight successes, this is what happens.
I want to describe it to you.
So you understand how you can do it.
All right, so let's say that there's a ladder.
All right, and you've got this pull on one side, to get the pulling the other side and get the middle bar.
3:49
Okay, you need all three to move to the next level of the ladder, right?
And so for example, you might have the left side built up six, storeys above where you're at, and you might have the right side build up ten stories from where you're at right now.
But all of a sudden, if you change your character and that character trait development, gives you three more rungs, all of a sudden, you go three rungs because you already have the constraint has been removed and so you can be more advanced in your beliefs and your skills or it can be more advanced than your character trait than you are in your skills.
4:19
We can be more Advance your skills and your beliefs, right?
And so it's having all three of those that are checked off at each level of Entrepreneurship, that gets you to 11 million dollars a year, three million, all your ten million dollars, you're 100 miles or whatever it is right?
Is you have to have all of them.
And so the point is to get you to understand how to actually develop the soft things because the skills are straightforward.
4:38
Right?
The skills, are you just go by the course?
And you read the book and you consume the content like this and you practice you apply right?
That's what you have to do.
That's it.
That's it, right?
One of the skills that I see, lots of marketers these days not have is They don't know how to sell, they don't know how to develop sales team.
They don't know how to manage and grow sales team.
4:54
They don't to lead a sales team, that's a skill, they don't have.
And as soon as they do, they go from 3 million to 10 million like that very, very easily.
Right?
And so, it's understanding that that's the skill deficit and as soon as they do, boom, they blog.
I was fortunate, I had a ton of the skills of my skill toolbox, but I went from making nothing to tons because I had all of these rungs of this ladder already built out to a 30 million dollar level, except I just didn't have the beliefs, that was my issue, right?
5:18
And Today, I think still one of my biggest issues is belief.
I suffer from a lot of insecurities and so my wife was the one who was like, you can do this.
Like you don't have to have these gyms like you can license out the model like you can.
You can really succeed like this.
And I honestly, just thought she was a really smart person and very wise.
5:36
And so I trusted her belief in me before I really trusted it for myself.
And so hopefully, you can have somebody like that in your life but maybe that could be me.
I trust in you, I trust in your skills and your belief so so hopefully you can borrow some of that trust.
Cause I promise you the world does get better when you when you take those leaps of Faith.
5:52
But the point is is if you have these three things, right?
The stories that you tell yourself, right?
One of the things that Layla always says, she's my wife, she has her own channel, you can check it out.
Is she said what's the evidence right?
What's the evidence that you're so bad at this?
What's the evidence that you have?
Because you keep beating yourself up about this but what's your evidence right?
6:11
Most Nation real quick.
If you are a business owner that has a big old business and wants to get to a much bigger business, going to fifteen hundred dollars.
Plus, we would love to talk to you and if you like that or like to hear more about it, go to acquisition.com, you planning on the page and talk to one of our team and see if we can help you get there.
6:31
What I do when I identify a character trait that I lack or identify a skill that I don't have, we're belief that I don't have.
And this one I'll just specifically talked about the character traits.
Could think it's really important.
It's probably the one that people struggle with the most is what are the stories that you tell yourself about yourself, right?
6:48
A lot of times I had dinner recently with a five million dollar your entrepreneur and he was like I had a lot of trauma when I was a kid.
And that's why I am this way, he speaks like he is this way because and I was like I think that's a really convenient story to tell yourself about why you are Are anxious or why you exhibit anxious Tendencies.
7:04
I was like but what if you did that and you just didn't exhibit anxious Tendencies what that what if you just chose?
Not to what if he chose to not?
Give power to that situation to that parent when you were growing up?
They already made you suffer.
Why would you let them make?
7:20
You suffer more.
By telling yourself that you, they gave you this character trait, and it's, because it's uncomfortable for you to suffer through the change of changing your identity, right?
But only, when I both believe this is that your These fluid and need to be able to change your identity and your character traits based on what the business requires if you want to grow, right?
7:37
Like if you're not a patient person, then you need to be calm.
Patient macro micro speed macro patients, right?
If you want to develop a reputation, need to become a person of Integrity which means sometimes short-term, you have to sacrifice, right?
You have to not make the quick Buck if you want to be disciplined and have focused and it means that you have to be able to say no strategy means.
7:54
What do you say no to?
That still looks like it makes sense on paper.
That's strategy.
That's what it is.
It's what things do.
We choose not to To invest in right?
And the people who learn how to make the most money are the ones, you know, how to focus.
And that's a character trait.
And so what you have to do is you have to pee on your past and say, when did I exhibit these?
8:10
Things is all of us have exhibited.
These character traits at some point in our life.
And then what you do is you say, I am this way because and then you tell yourself the stories of the things you did in the past that exhibited those traits.
And by doing that you'll start reminding yourself.
8:26
So if I want to say like because I'll tell you, I used to have more Angry Tendencies.
I used to tend Trend towards being angry as response to things that I didn't like right.
But one of the things that I liked like that I try to tell myself is that I am wise, right?
And this is a character trait.
8:41
That's probably been the number.
One character, trait that I've tried to develop over the harmony years just because I believe determine is the single greatest characters that you can have.
Because if you make the right decisions, the whole world is your oyster, right?
If you can make the right, call, the whole world is your oyster.
And so, for me, wisdom is the number one character trait that I wish to develop.
8:58
And so, when I think to myself, I am wise, because Cuz I use the same formula that most people and most of us, myself included used to destroy ourselves with these insecurities with these, with these negative character traits that we believe we have.
9:14
And instead of saying an affirmation, you tell yourself the story of why you're saying is true.
You learn to argue against your own thoughts and that's how you start developing this muscle, this to these traits, that start to become a whisper and then a shout and then they become they emanate from you and you project.
9:31
Exempt, when you walk in the room subconsciously but it's a practice that goes from active to passive in your mind, right?
If you are a patient person, if you are a kind person, if you are an Integris person, right?
If you are hardworking person, right?
We all have these stories that we tell about ourselves.
9:47
And so, if you have a limitation right now on your character trait or traits, you don't feel like you are patient enough.
You feel like you are too easily distracted, you feel like you don't focus enough then you need to start telling yourself the story, I I am this way because not I am wealthy stupid.
10:05
In my opinion, I think our brains are too smart for that stuff.
You have to give it.
The reasons you have to make the argument.
And I think, instead of affirmations, if you make affirmations into arguments that you make with yourself every day, then those become things that will change who you are.
And if you change who you are and how you make decisions, you'll change your entire life and you'll be able to watch your business grow as a result of who you have become.
10:27
And so, this is one of the things that was most powerful for me in my entrepreneurial Journey.
I had had tons of insecurities, right?
I had tons of anxieties.
I had lots of anger, I had lots of perceived trauma, and I'll say it that way, because I don't even want to make it into trauma.
10:43
That's what I perceived as trauma because I was a child in the world with the regular, the emotion regulation of a child.
And so things, of course, affect you more, when your kid, everyone's traumatized, traumatized perceives trauma.
As a child, like, if I go to a stage and I say, hey, who here, had a traumatic childhood in some instance, or had a Matic event occur, everyone's going to raise their hand.
11:04
So stop thinking that because you have trauma.
And I don't say this, I'll say this with, I'll say it this way better for me, I chose to stop giving trauma power, and I think if you can do that, and you can tell yourself a different story about why you are who you are and make arguments.
11:20
Instead of affirmations, you'll be able to have stronger faster change in the direction that you desire and you'll have more control over your emotional state, and then in, so doing, you'll be able to level The business that you have.
Because most the times when I see business owners, the reason they're not successful is not because they don't have the beliefs or because they don't have the skills, it's just because of who they are, I'd call the other day and somebody hopped on and they were like, and honestly, the guy was an asshole.
11:45
He's like, man, employee suck, and I can never keep any good talent and bottle bot.
I just paused.
I was like, that's not surprising.
He was like, what that's like, have you met you like, I don't know what else to say, if you don't have you met you like, I don't need to change this guy's marketing right now.
12:00
Need to change this.
Guys, beliefs about his own business, he's just change who he is and the only with that guy to do that is for him to get over the reasons that he tells himself.
It's okay to be who he is.
And I think a lot of us do that.
We give ourselves the the excuse for being impatient.
We give ourselves the excuse for cheating, right?
12:17
We give ourselves the excuse for being unfaithful.
You give the excuse for being a loyal.
Well, my dad was where my mom was, or my brother was or whatever, right?
Or when I was growing up or went from my town.
I XYZ.
I'm this way because the cows is One of the most powerful words in the English language it's great for persuasion.
12:34
Make sure you use it to persuade yourself in the right direction.
So, anyways, that's just my two cents.
I might not know anything.

Most Nation.
What's going on?
Got a special podcast for you today.
This is part one of these 0 to 100 million dollars in sales by H 30 podcast.
I did with Albert preciado from driven, we had a great discussion and the three points that we had on this one, was The Dark Side of motivation.
0:15
The things that were afraid of and whether they use us or we use them and how to focus on one path for an extended period of time to achieve the goals that are unreasonable in everyone else's eyes but not your own.
And this is part one of our two-part podcast enjoy.
If I had known one how to pick the right opportunity into said, okay, if I did just this thing for the next 10 years would be unreasonable for me not to be a billionaire.
0:38
Then nothing else matters.
Welcome to the game where we talk about it, get more customers how to make more per customer and how to keep them longer in the many failures and lessons.
We have learned along the way.
I hope you enjoy and subscribe.
Hey guys, I'm here with Alex or MOSI and really excited, welcome to driven Channel.
0:54
I'm really pumped up about this interview because me, and my wife.
We talk a lot about you guys.
We're like ham usually wear like the young entrepreneurs that are doing good and making money and everybody's older, you know.
But if you guys were like, damn, you guys met Us feel old.
1:11
So that like, I know you're 31 your wife's 29 and you guys have a, an incredible story that reminds us a lot.
Also of our battles.
Like, when you start a business, you go broke.
You don't have money.
You're barely surviving and I know you sold businesses for a lot of money.
You made some good money and now you're CEO of Acquisitions.com.
1:30
So, Alex, first of all, thank you for being part of this and you feel like you have to get to, that darkest moment to become somebody.
Really?
Successful.
So like you're really successful.
I see you guys specially with the age.
1:45
There's have done a lot but like in the beginning I know that there's a lot of times where like you said, you don't want to live anymore.
Yeah.
We really stressed out and you get down to your last penny.
You think that's important for somebody to go through that and come back up to really make it or be in the position where they're going to continue to make it.
2:03
You think you guys do you think you could have done it differently without having to go through all that pain?
Yes or no.
So I don't think that suffering is a requisite for success, but I do think that it is very likely and I think that when I think what it does is it gives us evidence.
2:22
Like when you get into hard times it doesn't change who you are.
It gives you evidence of who you are.
It just it, should it displays, it demonstrates who you are.
So some people were like, you know, when the when the going gets tough, the get the tough, get, you know, that whatever, whatever the saying is.
But I think that a lot of times it just reveals Mules are character.
2:39
It doesn't necessarily create it because it might have already.
It might have already been there that whole time and then we just get the environment in which, to prove it to ourselves, but I think it goes from the man with the opinion, to the man with the experience, which LH Hardwick said, no man with an experience as ever at the mercy of a man, with an opinion.
2:58
And so, like, somebody could be, like, I meant 2008, wasn't that bad like somebody who's younger does?
It hasn't gone through it.
But like yeah man with an opinion man with an experience who went through it.
He's never had that guys.
Mercy and so like there's some some like Soul hardness that I think comes through that because you have evidence in your past of like I have been through worse that being said, I think that you can you can extrapolate any negative experience to give yourself a shield against any new - so it's like I give a different example.
3:24
Since let's say you haven't, you're new to business, which a lot of people.
Maybe listen to this our yeah, but you might have had a tough upbringing, which a lot of people listen, this probably have because a lot of people suffer, because we're kids, right?
If you think to yourself like man, like None of this is nearly as bad as my dad whooping, the shit out of me, all of a sudden.
3:43
It just gives you a very different context of what heart feels like, right?
Or Mom or whatever it is, right?
And so we're my brother, it doesn't matter who it is, but the point is like we've gone through hardship.
And I think that what hard feels like is the same, whether it's a business or dirt emotional heart, it feels the same.
3:59
And so I think you can take these past experiences that are hard before and extrapolate them onto your current situation.
You realize you've been through so much more than this then you can look back and I'd say like to use the Morpheus quote, from the Matrix.
Like, I stand Here, truthfully on afraid, not because of the path that lies before me.
4:15
But because of the path that lies behind me.
Yeah, and so, I think that those Hard Times give us evidence of who we are.
Yeah.
And I think it's the stories that we tell ourselves that create.
You know, the Futures were going to Alex.
What do you think?
If you wouldn't have met Layla?
Yeah, and maybe you meet Kyle.
4:32
Are somebody else.
What are you Kayla?
Where do you think you are at this moment?
Do you think you're a successful less successful?
Because let me tell you something, that the reason why I ask is because me and still are really different.
Yeah.
Like I'm like the Visionary, the recruiter, the sales guy, and she's operator.
4:51
So she operates everything like if we have any bat, like, if she didn't have me, I wouldn't have any people, but if I didn't have her, we would have people and would lose all the people because I don't know how to operate an organized.
I'm horrible at that.
Feel like my job is to bring in agents and their job is to keep the agents.
5:08
Yeah.
And then, that makes any sense.
Totally.
It's the same Dynamic.
Yeah, with identical dynamic between Layla and I, but how does that work?
And where do you, where do you think you would have been without Laila?
So, of course, since Layla is in the back of the audience, I would be homeless under that bridge.
5:23
That's what I would.
I would just be there just without anything but we actually have this conversation a lot.
Like if I were not in her life she would probably just find someone who's similar to me and to have find a complementary skill set and like if she were not in my life, I would like.
Business requires these functions to occur and whether it's mix between me and Layla or Layla's.
5:45
Got because, like, we talked about, like, what if Alex dies because we, you know, we think about like, you know, what happens after that same scenario.
Well, she might have to find two or three people to do the functions that I'm doing and so, I probably can't find one Layla, but I might be able to find, like, two or three people who can fill the holes that she leaves to make sure that the functions get done.
6:03
And so, it's like so y combinator, has put out a lot of research on the fact that like three Founders, is the ideal amount of people for a business and I think that that just happens to be like there are kind of buckets of activity that must occur in order for a business to be successful.
And it's just more difficult for a single founder to do that on their own.
6:20
Where all the hats, learn all the things or finds finding incentivize someone who's good enough to be like owner level of give a shit.
I don't know.
Like the cussing words on this but lies.
Yeah the owner level of give a shit in a company when it's early days.
And so I think that's why it gets so hard for people to get going because especially if you're a solo you own 100%.
6:38
Etc.
If it's just you like we both have the advantage of two owners just right off the bat.
And I remember when we were coming up and compete against other people, I always used to think, like, even if I'm Toda Toe with this guy, I was like, have also got her.
And he doesn't, it was like, it's two on one.
6:54
Like with every every business, you know, competitive space.
I thought was like, it's two on one, like, we always come to the with an advantage.
And so, I think that if you can get that, that's that founding team in place of talented people who Who have complementary skill sets and for anybody who's watching like the three kind of big ones in you alluded to, it was like you've got your acquisition side, which is Howard.
7:16
The promoter who's going to bring people into the door.
You've got the the operation side.
The fact the product side, right?
Which is what are we going to?
What are we going to fulfill the promises?
We made on the front end, right?
And then the third one, keeps the other two out of jail which is, you know, HR Finance legal, I see taxes.
7:33
You know, counting all that stuff.
And so those are kind of the three elements that we see within within the business you've got your product.
You've got your acquisition and then you've got all the stuff to keep yourself out of prison.
Well, what is the biggest lesson?
You think you learned?
And do you think, maybe if you would have known what, you know, now you could have been with more money earlier?
7:53
Yeah.
Is there one?
Big lesson that if you could go back, you'll change?
Yeah, it took me five years to learn.
Focus took me five years, maybe ten, depending on.
What do you mean about Focus?
Picking one opportunity and, and ruthlessly going after that one thing, I think a lot of people I mean me, yeah, I get sucked.
8:11
Like, I get excited, I mop, you know, I love opportunity, I love seeing the Unseen, seeing where things could come together and they see your mind going, like, I could tell, like, from Far, like, when you walked in the first of the first time right here and we met back in Bradley's event.
Yeah.
But but you, you just, I could tell that you have so many ideas going to get out.
8:29
I don't know if that's true but you seem like you're thinking like a hundred things at once.
And so like, you talked about Focus.
Yeah.
Does that also mean?
How you manage your time?
Because I know in the beginning part, you give everybody your time, and then after you start growing, then you stop giving people time.
8:46
And then the, some people just get a insulted and they get mad.
And how do you, how do you approach that?
So two separate one is one excited like the networking and people thing and the other side was like the business focus side.
So on the business focus side, it's really it's accepting.
The fact that there are always many, many 10/10 opportunities.
9:04
So the first thing I did was I was picking bad opportunities to go after, you don't know.
Mean like, you know, opening a dry-cleaning store or rather I'll walk up the opportunity letter.
This might be interesting for everyone.
So like opportunity.
Level number one is that you're working at a dry-cleaning store, right?
Like in you're just you're cleaning the clothing, right?
9:21
That's like lowest level opportunity trading time for dollars you have zero, leverage one level above that is you're managing at that store.
So now you in some way, have some leverage, but you're not still owning but you are your operating, right?
Level above that is you own the dry-cleaning store.
9:36
Okay.
That's cool.
But your Leverage is Got five mile radius of people that you can serve out of the entire world.
Hmm.
And the only level of Leverage you have there is labor.
That's all you have.
Is you have leverage over other people's time.
The level above that is you franchisor you you sell other people your business model for how to do it.
9:54
Now all of a sudden you've got capital and you've got leverage your other people's money and other people's time.
So all of a sudden that thing can go from being a maybe a 1 million dollar opportunity to 100 million dollar opportunity, right?
And then all of a sudden if you aggregate franchises right now, you're at a billion-dollar it's like Each of these things we inch.
10:09
And if let's say you created a software that made the whole thing faster, it's like now you're using code and that and then you associate like Kylie Jenner's brand with like Kylie clean, whatever.
And so then you're using media to get even more leverage on the opportunity.
And so learning about leverage was the thing that took me a long time to understand in terms of what boat I am in.
10:29
So I'll give you the quote from Warren Buffett but you said I'll give you the full quote.
So he had his closest friend from Columbia business school who went to school with them.
They were really Smart really hard-working liked each other a lot.
When they finish one, his best buddy went to do in to steal business manufacturing steel and then he started Berkshire Hathaway, you know 30 40 years later, this guy still business is a tough business but you didn't I mean he's like he made an okay living.
10:54
He's like, but he didn't do anything really exceptional and then Warren built Berkshire Hathaway and he said and that's when I learned that it wasn't about how hard you row but what boat you're in and so there's a lot of really, really hard working people out there who are really smart.
The thing that they're missing is Currents of opportunity is ignorance of Leverage and so if you can get into a better leverage opportunity, the same time or same effort or same intelligence, can yield, you a 10x 20x thousand extra turn, which is hard to conceptualize, but still true.
11:20
And so understanding The Leverage of the opportunity and then from a character her perspective, understanding that I have to pick a high leverage opportunity and I must stick with it for an unreasonable amount of time.
I have to just keep doing it and the the outsized returns the compounding of the opportunity comes from the depth of the experience which comes through repetition.
11:38
Ian and so, a lot of people get, you know, whether a mile wide and an inch deep rather than a mile deep and inch wide.
And most times that kind of death of experience is, what gives you the compounding outsized returns in the longer haul.
And so I think if I had known one how to pick the right opportunity and to said, okay, if I did just this thing for the next 10 years would be unreasonable for me, not to be a billionaire.
12:00
The nothing else matters.
So even if somebody's like, dude, I've got this new texting, it's going to be huge.
I could say, totally understand.
But if I do, just the thing, I'm doing right now, I'll get to a billion which is right now the current goal, right?
And so that's it.
Like and I could have 20 other things like, dude, we got to do this building together, like I bet you I could make money on that if I do nothing else.
12:20
Besides this one thing that I'm focused on, I will get to a billion.
And so everything that is not, there is a distraction from Hey guys, real quick.
If you're new to the podcast, I have a book on Amazon called 100 million-dollar offers that over eight thousand five star reviews.
12:35
It has almost a perfect score.
You can get it for 99 cents on Kindle.
The reason I bring it up is that I put over a thousand hours in the writing that book and it's my biggest gift to our community.
So it's my very Shameless way of trying to get you to like me more and ultimately make more dollars to that later on in your business career I guess a partner with you.
12:52
So that's my give go check it out Amazon and back to the show.
What do you think keeps people from not doing that?
Because like, there's so many opportunities that come up and especially now with how much your know.
Now a lot more than before, right?
13:08
You probably get a ton of opportunities for people to pitch you like, hey got this, I'm going to make it.
We can make millions with this.
Yeah.
But why do you think that's just say, Scott?
Yeah.
Why did Ken Scott just focus on mortgages or real estate?
Why does he have to do events?
13:24
Why does God have to go out there and do like this other side business?
Southern side business and then they just get diluted.
Yeah.
And then they don't when they could just go out there and make millions and realistic or mortgages.
What's what do you think?
Is?
What gets people to do?
Oh yeah, it's manifested.
Yeah, because I have my lead a lot of people and then they find him like Hey you know what?
13:44
It's cool doing.
The little swing and Van said Tik-Tok and but what is that like focus on what you're doing?
And we're all yeah yeah so I think it's human behavior.
And so the way that we described This is local versus global benefit and so simple examples, like if I want to have a six-pack, right?
14:05
Why does Sarah go grab a piece of cake rather than grabbing a piece of chicken breast because the local benefit the acute benefit of having a piece of cake is higher in the small, in the local region.
Yeah, but the global benefit for her body is lower.
And so humans in general will tend to optimize for local benefit rather than Global and the people who can simply optimize for Global benefit for their Stan wide benefit are the ones that get the biggest compounding returns over the Long Haul.
14:31
It's the same thing as in a business setting, why don't the sales guys?
Leave notes in the CRM so that when the customer service rep with all the onboarding rep can see the notes to, you know, have a way better experience have, you know, way better Ascension rates, way less turn, drop out, all these other great metrics that would improve their overall business because the local pain right of writing the notes in is harder than not doing it, but doing it gives the global benefit that is is worth it, right?
14:58
And an interesting one from an operational perspective because like, I'm sure, you've also had the flip side of people who over operationalize things they over-processed shit and then it gets too hard.
Is that the point of process is to give a global benefit and so you can measure is there a global benefit from this thing?
15:14
If we're having people do lots of stuff but it doesn't have a global benefit or the global fit benefit does not outweigh the costs.
Like for example, let's say that they're one of the benefits is if we could have people go walk through a 20 step sales page thing.
So they can finish all of that without the finance department hopping on it.
15:30
Sure that might be a benefit globally, but the global loss might be that we lose sales by like 70% because it's such a pain in the ass, right?
And so you have to look at, you know, Global cost versus global benefit on any kind of initiative.
And so to get back to the, why does, why does Johnny have a bunch of side?
15:48
Hustles is because the local perceived benefit of a shiny object sounds exciting.
Even though globally, we could make a very easy argument that if you took all that time.
Time all that attention, all that wasted energy and just put it into the thing.
That is his main vehicle, you get outsized returns because the thing that Johnny doesn't understand in this is alluding to the lesson that you mentioned earlier, is that like all the gains come at the end?
16:11
You know what I mean?
And so so many guys are like they're doing 80 percent effort in three things where if you just did that extra 20 for the one thing you would get more on that 20 than you would on everything else, makes a lot of sense.
And so it's a diminishing We'll return with an outsized absolute return.
16:30
And so I'll give a different example to drive this.
Sorry, I've just would like loading the examples if I'm a runner and I'm in the Olympics and I ran and I train and train and train the amount that an extra, you know, two hours a day of training, does for me the amount extra speed I get is might be this much right?
16:50
The last two hours compared to the first two hours?
I'm going to get this much extra but this must extra Is the difference between 1st and 4th and so what's the absolute difference of that marginal return?
It's everything.
Yeah.
And so I think that when we, when we're trying to compete in the space, we have to understand like you are going to have less return on your time in an opportunity but the absolute return of being that much better than everyone else.
17:15
Makes all the difference in the world.
If you're a really good sales trainer versus the best sales trainer, you'll make 10 times, more money being number one.
Yeah.
And that's the absolute versus marginal difference.
Now, let's when you guys were growing growing and you guys made a certain amount of money where you've never made that money before.
17:31
Yeah, you guys are both good looking really good shape.
You guys look like models.
When people did you ever have people and having MV towards you?
Like when you started growing, maybe you had your second, your right hand person or your left hand person and then they're like, wait a minute.
17:48
If they could do it, I can do it.
Maybe I'm gonna go out there and start something and be their competitor that you ever deal with people like that peeling, the pieces apart.
There's the end beside and People, you know, copying and do things like that?
Yes, I think.
Last time I counted we had over 20 people would work for me who tried to start similar companies.
18:05
So yes to that to that question in terms of Envy, I don't know.
I don't know what their primary motivation was.
It might have just been like wanting to do more for themselves like and that's and that's fine.
You know what I mean?
But at the same time like now we will compete and like and I will do everything I can to win.
18:22
Yeah.
And so you know or any of those companies bigger than the That we had.
No are all of them together, not bigger than a quarter of what we had.
Is there something that you guys do to keep to to maximize all the people that you have?
So that yeah that's that was a good lesson that from what you were asking earlier about like any lessons that I learned I think that early on it was just like every dollar has to be mine, you know what I mean?
18:46
I think that giving more slices of the pie to people, you get so much more like Jeff Bezos right now.
Owns 10% of Amazon, right?
Ilan owns 17% of Slow Warren.
Buffett owns 38% of Berkshire, Hathaway stock, whatever.
19:02
And so these these huge guys understood a concept, which is like the more money you can make other people, the more money you make, even though if the pies not her percent yours.
And it took me that was, that's a lesson that took me too long to understand, because if you give other people slices of the pie, then you can gain your time back disproportionately.
19:20
And so it's like it'd be better to have 51% of 100 businesses, you know what I mean?
Then 100% of, you know what I mean?
And because you can just give the opportunity way, but the problem is that everyone thinks that the boat therein is the only boat they'll ever be in for the rest of their lives.
Not to say, you shouldn't focus on that boat.
19:36
But I'm saying, like, we think so small and then you talking about Equity wise or also compensation wise both.
Yeah.
But I just mean in general, just like however, you slice up the pie and now, getting back to the whole Fitness part.
I heard somewhere that like I don't believe it, but maybe you could you could convince me.
Otherwise but but I heard you say that you work out twice a week and that you have a way of eating where you get Your food in the beginning and it is that is there a science that you mastered?
20:01
It's the end.
So it's that it's the end of the day mostly, but there's minimum effective dose, right?
And then there's mrv, which is maximal, recoverable volume.
All right, so there are the two extremes, from a training perspective.
So, the amount that it takes to maintain the amount of muscle mass you has, is typically significantly less than most people expect.
20:18
And the amount that it takes to grow and to get an adaptation and then the maximum amount that you can do and recover from, Is usually much further down the volume Spectrum Than People expect.
And most people are just in between those two things.
So they're above the amount to maintain, but not enough to adapt.
20:36
So like they're just doing more work than is necessary to just basically stay the same.
Yeah, right.
And I think that, that happens with a lot of systems, in terms of like, let's say you're working on sales.
It's like they, they read their shell script every morning.
So they're enough to have to maintain, they do the minimum amount to maintain, but maybe they do a little bit more, but it's not enough to drive a temptation to drive growth, right?
20:56
And so, I mean the fitness example works for life in general but if I want to grow then I will train like 90 minutes six days a week.
So every day and I'll train maybe even two hours a day and I will force the muscle to grow.
Like you will either break, or you will grow.
21:13
Because there's no way you can stay the same, given the amount of punishment I'm putting on this muscle, right?
And it's not about even the intensity.
It's like if I do legs every day for six days, straight, My legs will grow.
If your your arms are small and you train arms every single day, your arms will grow.
21:29
I promise you.
And so then what happens is, if I know that I have the work ethic to do this level of volume, then it comes to okay, what exercise, to get to taxpayer.
But like what exercise selection can I do that?
Does not give me joint pain, because if you do that, much volume joint pain.
Can start coming in issue.
So then it's about finding the exercises that you are really biomechanically advantaged for that.
21:47
Give you the least amount of stress or rotating between two to three of those throughout that Six-Day cycle.
So you might go like exercise ABC and then ABC for that six days and that way you get Little bit of variety on the joint while still maximize the amount of volume you do.
That's the training side.
The food side is under that you've alluded to the video that I had was just calories.
22:06
And protein is pretty much, all you have to do, which is why we dessert every night.
And yeah, yeah they do that because like it you could have rice and potatoes or just like a big ice cream sundae.
I'd rather big ice cream sundae but that's me.
Are you still on the clean drinking diet or you drink?
22:23
We do not drink much.
I would say like Leila has Has one drink.
And I will have some of it sometimes.
Yeah, but it's definitely not with the intention of getting drunk is because I know I saw a video where you posted.
You didn't drink for a while.
Yeah.
How did not drinking for a while?
22:41
How did I, and how does your health in general?
Like, staying in shape, working out, how does that contribute to your business's success?
Has I think at that time, when I stopped drinking it was really important.
I think that now it would matter less because the things that I was I would drink I'd like, I never had a drinking problem, you don't?
23:00
I mean, it was just like I would be straight, you know, I'd be stressed from work or whatever.
And I would just like, want to have a shot or two at the end of the day, or three shots, or four shots to just like take the edge off, right?
But the thing is, is like when I, when I force myself to stop drinking, I did it cold turkey because I was like, what's the point?
23:18
It's just like you're going to do it sooner or later muscle did sooner, right?
And so, I stopped drinking the day that we decided to Without Really any prompt and then what happened is for the next six months.
Months.
I was like, I would feel this like itch like at the whenever I was stressed like man, I could really use a drink and but I couldn't.
23:35
And so it forced me to confront the things that I wasn't confronting which is like decisions that were unmade.
Hard conversations, I needed to have relationships that need to be cut out, or brought in depending on, you know what, they were.
And so it, basically, I had all these unresolved Loops that I needed to close and then once I closed all those Loops, once I closed, all those Loops my desire to drink went down dramatically.
23:58
And then when I did decide to drink two and a half years later, you know, it wasn't like, you know, it's like, you know, guzzle down five bottles of liquor because I wasn't drinking for a place of stress.
I was just like, okay, things are good and so we're in the same place now where as I think, as long as you don't drink to to run away from anything.
24:17
Yeah.
Then I think it's much less likely that you'll do it in excess.
Yeah, but most people do it to escape and I did too.
Yeah.
Do you have any fears?
Probably.
Lots of them.
Thought about him lately, probably the main human ones, you know, fear of failure.
24:33
I suppose think a lot, a lot of that is dis as has become less, but it might just be because I have all this evidence that I haven't failed.
So I don't know.
But I think that if I were to like of all that were to be removed for me today or tomorrow, I think I'd be okay.
Do you ever feel like the fear of being broke again and let me explain a little bit more?
24:50
Yeah, because for example you guys live really like a simple way Living like you know, you had up, you bought a car because because because Brad yeah there's and and they say you got a Bentley, then you sold it, then you sold everything.
25:06
You you, you got your cash put aside and you got your money.
Put away.
Your means of living are not that high.
Yeah.
But then I think about because I read with that.
Yeah.
But then I think about like, what?
If I die tomorrow and I didn't, I don't drive what I want to drive.
25:22
I don't travel the way I want to travel.
How do you process that on?
How are you going to spend your money as great question?
Yeah, I think that to what you said, like Drive.
What I want to drive liver.
I Wanna Live.
I wanna fly.
We do that.
I just don't want to use someone else's Drive, what they want to drive.
25:39
And so I realized for me, when I had the Bentley that it didn't make any difference in my life, like I didn't, I did it because I thought it was cooler.
What other people would think like, you know, I mean, I literally did it as bad as I do.
Go by one of their, I find out what about and it didn't, it didn't do anything for me.
Yeah, and so like what are the things that we find valuable?
Like, we enjoy going out to dinner.
25:56
So we've gone out to dinner.
Her every night for ever, we haven't used our kitchen, and I like that.
You don't, I mean in, like, when we go out, we get whatever we will enter.
I mean, like it doesn't matter what like, we get whatever you want.
I get to on treat last night at 2:00 on trays three desserts.
Like I just like that and it's cool.
Like I enjoy that you know we fly private a lot because we enjoy that and we get returns from that we bought like I'll just say a big number worth of big homes recently after having sold everything.
26:23
And then you know as soon as we got there we were like I don't want to do with all this.
I don't know that the housekeeper, the AV guy, the the lawn care of the pool guy that The Decorator that like all of this stuff and I was like, I just don't give a shit.
And so we have like a 3,000 square foot, you know, apartment that we can lock and leave and go wherever we want.
26:42
And so, I think that the point of money is to buy us options.
And so I want to have the option to work because if I can't work, it's just as bad as having to work.
And if I want to go fly private, I want to have that option to do it.
I don't want to have to do it.
And so I think it's for us, we've you've optimized towards optionality rather than than quote freedom.
27:04
And that concludes part, one of the album preciado driven podcast, stay tuned for part two, which is a banger.
I hope you enjoy it as much as we enjoyed.
Making it for you.
And that concludes part, one of the album preciado driven podcast, stay tuned for part two, which is a banger.
I hope you enjoy it as much as we enjoyed.
Making it for you.

Hey guys, love that.
You're listening to the podcast.
If you ever want to have the video version of this which usually has more effects, more visuals, more graphs, you know, drawn out stuff.
Sometimes it can help hit the brain centers in different ways.
You can check out my YouTube channel, it's absolutely free.
Go check that out if that's what you are into and if not keep enjoying the show Alastair what is up.
0:20
Okay, so I want to make this video specifically for my man Alastair because he was kind enough to drop a comment about About kind of not, I don't see understanding, but like being like you're a crazy person.
Why would you turn down this much money?
0:36
And I'm sorry about the glare.
I tried to fix it and then I just got really frustrated.
So here we are.
So I was like, I just don't get it.
That makes no sense.
Like this seems too good to be true.
Why would you turn out fifty thousand dollars.
And so, I wanted to break it down because and as an aside for anyone who liked Post in a public group and things like that, like most times people have questions.
1:00
Like we want to think like they're attacking us but they're not like and if you just own the fact that like I didn't do a good enough job, explaining it, the video, then what's up there?
Then you'll just be a lot better and be able to communicate what you were after trying to say better and then more people can be helped through didn't articulate the question.
1:19
So anyways here is why It makes sense.
Okay, so there's a couple different angles that we think about this and believe me.
It's still hard like belief, like, it's hard to turn to 50, 50 grand out, like it really is.
And that's why my wife makes a lot of these sessions because I just get excited because my entrepreneurial add is like awesome so much fun.
1:40
Like we'll just go, you know, rock on and like having me day, but she Bears, my time more than I do.
So, here's how it works.
First thing is dealing income versus the offered in.
Okay, it's never one.
So you can see that to well and years, My Bill Gates example.
So I heard a joke the other day was like, you know, if Bill Gates stops to pick up a hundred dollar bill, he loses money and it's because Bill Gates makes so much per hour that the amount of time it would take him to stop pick up a hundred dollar bill would actually be negative on his amount of time and so obviously if you like you can choose to believe it or not I mean I'm happy to say I'm not going to like show the screenshots but like you can do the math on our paint group.
2:23
Right now, we do about 65,000 a day, okay?
So for me, this is actually less than what we normally get paid, just with our normal business, okay?
So this is the only income versus the offer this is real today, right?
Let's first aspect, but I'm going to go to more, so it makes more sense.
2:39
So, first is actually undervaluation of time, all right.
Now to be fair, though to get to that valuation time, you still want a needed, make that decision, even when we weren't making that much, and that's the second thing.
So, it's projected income versus the offer. /.
So if I think that my life is going to cap out at fifty thousand dollars, a big thumb, then maybe I'll take that offer.
3:01
I don't believe that.
And so I'm not going to take that off because I know that in order for me to get to my projected income level, then I can't accept less than that today, right?
And it's also related to the business that we're actually in, right?
3:16
So like for our current business like, Emo's, an Asian quick break, just to let you know that we've been starting to post on LinkedIn and want to connect with you.
Alright, so send me a connection request a note.
Let me know that you listen to the show and I will accept it.
3:32
There's anyone you think that would be should be connected with tag them in one of my or laila's posts?
And I will give you all the love in the world.
All right, so let's get back to the show.
This business, I believe, will grow to a certain amount if I take that same amount of time, which is, where is the real cost was the opportunity cost?
3:51
If I take that same time, we're goes my prep time, right?
The actual time of the day that I need the full day that in do it then probably a day to recover because it's like, dude, it's super intense when you go with someone all day long, and then after that, there's going to be aftermath, okay?
So somebody's gonna have lingering questions.
4:07
And the thing is, is that this isn't my main business.
If I were to a Consulting that, right?
And the thing is that, if it were my main business, then I'll have some more support team based.
And that have a framework.
I have template that I would be working off of because that would be my main income stream.
And so since it's not learning anything from it's going to be a less efficient use of my time.
4:22
And I have to do a lot of stuff custom, a lot of stuff individually and so it's actually gonna take more than with that initial days.
It might take 34 days of actual real time and so now you're that 50 Grand is really only like 10 12 Grand a day and so it's really have an accurate assessment.
What the real cost is okay so that's first is that the real cost that you much higher than the first day of time that it looks like on paper.
4:42
All right, the second thing is the opportunity cost, right?
Is that if I were to take that same amount of time and attention, right?
And then put it towards my main engine, right?
That already has efficiencies, that already has levers that we built into it, then what?
I be able to generate more income from that.
And the answer is obviously, yes.
4:59
Right.
Because if I am able to build something for our gym, owners by taking three days of detention, right and putting it just towards the machine that we already have.
I'll be able to make a lot more money than fifty thousand dollars.
Now right now the 50 Grand Given your current level to give an example.
5:17
That might be more relevant would be like Somebody offers you you know whatever two thousand dollars per day, right?
Of consulting or whatever the reality is if you had that same level of focus and here's where the here's where the hook.
5:32
And that's great for hold yourself accountable and like myself to is a am I taking those three days and actually spending it as dedicated as I should be on the business and most times we're not.
And so that's where like the rubber hits the road is like I'm not where I want to be and it's because I should be paying myself.
5:56
I should act with my time as though, I were constantly turning these things down and I can guarantee you that every time I have to turn one of these things down and wash it.
I need to be extremely productive because I just said, no to that, which means that I need to be able to make more than that.
Today, that kind of comes out of one of the day, Kennedy decisions is like, if you value your time, you need to value your time at what you want it to be valued, because if you're working at a 15 dollar an hour, A thing, right?
6:20
Like, so, right now, a lot, like one of the first things we do, which Among Us will get him stopped training sessions, and it's really hard for them because they're like, everyone's going to leave.
Like no one's going to look like once you see if I did, they all come for me.
They don't, they don't go for you, and there's probably someone who can do a job interview, which is Bulls enough, printers to constantly get yourself out of the next roll, right?
6:37
And so, if you want to make more than $15 an hour, then you need to stop valuing your time and doing things that you could replace or $15 an hour, right?
And so I want my time to be worth more than Two thousand cars a day.
And so, I'm not going to accept things that value added that market price.
6:54
So I hope this makes sense, both formerly.
Here's our real income is actually less than what we've made.
Here's the projected in form of what I want to make.
And this is not an alignment with that.
All right?
So then that also don't say gifts to add on that same point and then there's the real cost which no one actually wants to calculate versus the opportunity cost of that same time dedicated to an efficient business that I've already built, right?
7:15
Because the engine that we have will extract for more value from that.
Time with that boy.
Audience.
Then going one off and doing lots of custom stuff with some other guy and then distracting, right?
And so it's really just a question of distraction versus really focusing down on the thing that makes you money.
7:32
And so for those of you who were there, if you, like man, I want to be online business and be a business.
You already have a business, you just either you need to get out of that business to enter that other business, which is something that you have to confront.
Like, if you really like, if all these people keep a peace offering you 10 thousand dollars a day and you're not making that in your current business, you might be like, huh?
7:49
Maybe?
Should do that, but then you need to stop your current business, right?
It's just, it's a real decision, but if you are in the business that you want to be in and then you're like, well, this might be nice.
I guarantee you will cost you more in the long run.
If you make decisions like this, you'll end up making more over the Long Haul.
8:05
So lots of love dudes and dudettes alasdair.
I hope this answered your question a little better about why we would turn this down and hopefully why it makes sense for you to turn out other little side gigs that are relevant to you, all right?
Also, the guys and have an amazing amazing birthday.

And there were two statements that he made through that four hours that have stuck with me since then and one from the former conversation that I had with him that really kind of changed my my life and my Outlook.
And from the first conversation we talked about was how he said you need to look at things and consume content for people.
2:26
We're outside of the Matrix.
And I was like, what do you mean by that?
He was like everyone's inside of the Matrix.
Everyone is trying to make money, right?
Everyone's trying to make money.
They're operating from a place of scarcity, they're operating from a place of Desire of wanting something more than what they currently have.
2:43
And whenever they're doing that they're like they're operating from a different energy level.
And I don't think you use that exact word, but that's, that's kind of how I perceived it and that was like, my big takeaway from the first one.
And I think that between my first conversation, my second was about six or nine months.
Months.
And I'm feeling this kind of shift that's happening within us, you know?
3:00
Layla and I as we as we start this Channel and you know, we write the book you guys, if you haven't heard of it and really offers, it's got a lot of good reviews.
It's 99 Cents.
I made it 99 Cents because I want everybody want to be able to afford it and that's as cheap as Jeffy be will let me do it.
3:17
And so yeah, I'm still true to the to the cause of having nothing to sell you.
All right.
Anyway, so I had this conversation with John and the first question I asked When I shifted the conversation too, kind of personal stuff.
I said, now that, you know, you've made what you have, you made your exit as like, you know, how do you create and Destroy meaning and he was like, huh?
3:37
That's interesting question.
And I was like like in work.
Like how do you create a new streaming in the things that you work on any pausing?
He looked at me and I felt like I was staring into my soul and he was like why do you think work needs to be meaningful?
I was like, okay, and this is why I love talking to people who who are who are outside of the Matrix, right?
3:55
There's so much pressure.
Spective and later in the conversation, I was like, well, then outside of work, you know, like how do you give me?
And he was like, why do you think life needs to be meaningful?
And he's like, just hold for a second.
So if you say that life has to be meaningful, then what happens is, you create this desire, right?
4:11
That life must be a certain way, which means we're not accepting life as it currently is.
And as soon as we say, that life has to be a certain way, it must be meaningful.
Then we create this deficit, this deficiency between where we are and where we want to be.
And so in, so, doing we create the deficiency that we're trying to avoid by saying, it must Certain way.
4:27
Rah God.
My first book was a gym book, and I think the opening passage, says, we questioned all of our beliefs except for those is from Orson Scott Card.
We questioned all of our beliefs except for those that we truly believe and those who never think to question at all, and I always take that to heart because the belief that we truly hold dear, the ones that we don't eat.
4:46
They operate in the background of our minds, their assumptions that we make on how the world is and how it's supposed to be how it must be, how it should be.
Right?
What we have to do, right?
I'm like, I must create meaning.
I should work should be meaningful but by creating that I end up creating an equation of deficiency which then ends up making or forcing myself to not experience that, right?
5:12
And so I'll tell you a quick story.
So when I was in college, I dated a girl who is really really obsessed with happiness and she may be completely over this chapter of my life.
I'm sure she is.
But at the time she was really into happiness and positive psychologist even Positive psychology.
So everything was always like, does this make me happy?
5:29
Does this make me happy?
Does this make me happy?
Right?
So it's like, we're studying for things like this is make me happy.
And so, for me, I ended up actually getting really sick of that concept because I felt like I was always analyzing you mean, like, no.
Like, this doesn't make me happy, right?
And I got so frustrated with it.
I got, so in my head about, like, happiness, happiness, happiness, that, I remember that I gave myself the Mantra, fuck happiness, and so, as soon as I said, this is how I'm going to live.
5:55
I was like, fuck happiness.
I'm just going to get you done and I'm going to move forward.
I feel like I ended up actually experiencing more joy in the work that I was doing, and I didn't realize this, but as, as we kind of reached, another quote, Mountaintop, or whatever, want to call it, as we've kind of succeeded in business and whatnot.
6:11
I created another happiness placeholder, right?
Which I now called meaning or fulfillment.
And by doing that, I created, yet another equation of deficiency in my own life, which is always analyzing my work and saying is this meaningful, do I Fulfillment from this, and all of that kind of jazz.
6:28
But for me, what ends up happening is like, if I go donate all this money and I feel nothing, I feel like I'm by failed, right?
And then the question is, like, when you donate are you, should you feel better?
I don't know.
I assumed that I was supposed to feel better, right?
6:44
Feel good.
But I didn't and this has been kind of the the thing that I am doing right now, at least this what I'm thinking through.
So, I'm sharing this with the channel and it has been I use the word.
It's been meaningful for me to give myself the excuse or give myself permission rather to not find meaning in things and that has been unbelievably free, which is just giving myself permission to work on things that I may or may not find meaningful, but to Simply do the thing.
7:18
And I think that for me, giving my self permission to not find, meaning has allowed me to accept reality as it currently is.
By accepting it as it currently is.
I do not have a deficiency that I must resolve between where I am and where I think it should be and by doing that I have enjoyed the process more.
7:36
So I'll put it that way.
I have less less anxiety around those things.
Not see that anxiety is bad.
It is a human condition or part of the human condition but it is been something that I've experienced by first saying, fuck happiness earlier in my life and then creating meaning as the new happiness thing that I should be striving for.
7:52
And again, I think now it's removing meaning or destroying the The idea that something should be meaningful or should not be meaningful and that has been very, very valuable for me and so simply focusing on the work at hand and doing it.
Well, according to my values, which is whether this is Meaningful or not.
8:12
The way that I choose to live is according to these values and is the way that I am completing this work, is the way that I'm showing up on this meeting is the way that I am conducting.
Myself is the way that I'm making this decision in alignment with those values.
Use and in thinking like that, I feel like I'm able to do it in the present.
8:31
Rather than in the future, I'm able to walk with the values that I choose rather than try and pursue meaning in, and of itself, which created a deficit between where I was and where I wanted to go, which created a negative experience again, not that - Spencer bad, but I have a preference of not having them if I can avoid them.
8:56
Real quick guys.
If you can think about how you found this podcast, somebody probably tweeted it told you about it.
Should it on Instagram or something like that?
The only way this grows is through word of mouth and so I don't run ads, I don't do sponsorships, I don't sell anything.
I only ask is that you continue to pay it forward to whoever showed you or however you found out about this podcast that you do the exact same thing.
9:15
So if it was a review if it was a post, if you do that would mean the world to me and you throw some good karma out there for another entrepreneur.
And so I show you this.
I know this little bit more heavy than more more of my natural stuff talk about money, but I guess I make this because I know a lot of entrepreneurs are like me, hopefully, maybe not, not really like me, but hopefully, they're just like themselves.
9:35
But if you were like me in that you strive for these things, I can tell you that, I got no more meaning from giving lots of money away at all.
And just thinking about taking the actions that I am taking with the intention of being in alignment with the values that I find.
9:54
Meaningful has been the thing that has been truly freeing for me mentally.
And I make this channel because it feels in alignment with my values.
I wrote the book and the books because they are in alignment with my values and, you know, building acquisition.com and taking interest in the companies that we do in our portfolio.
10:15
Been in alignment with the values rather than saying is this company, meaningful is my work with this company, meaningful.
Because here's the one that really gets me tricked up and this is also something that John brought up which is like, admitting that.
And again, this may be contrary to a lot of people's religious beliefs.
10:32
I don't mean to offend anyone that is not my intention here but my belief.
My viewpoint of the world is that when we die nothing happens.
And when you and Legacy is a myth and so when the Idea of taking money and then having my kids right?
10:49
Then have something.
I think that ruins people.
I think wealth, without the skill of acquiring, the wealth is like my favorite Magic card of all time.
Magic, the Gathering.
There's card.
Burning wish the flavor text on the card.
Is she wished for a weapon but for not the skill to wield it and I always thought that was so profound because I feel like money is power, right?
11:09
It's just raw energy that you can either, you know, you create hospitals, you can build bombs with it whatever you want.
You can do it with money but if you The skill of learning how to master and wheeled money which is in, which is really just learning how to get it to flow to you.
If you don't have that skill that those traits, right?
11:25
If you get it, it's like having all this raw power and I think it ruins people.
And so I already knew Layla and I already decided and we signed our will when we did that.
I realized that we don't have kids and everything that I've amassed and was probably going to become a pretty big Fortune when we die.
I'm just donating anyways, because I believe that even if I did have kids It's one, I wouldn't give it to him and if I did choose to give it to him, here's how I think how crazy this is from a legacy 10-point 100 Generations from now you're diluting your gene pool, you know, 100 x like factored, right?
11:57
And so, it's like, you know, cutting by half, cutting by half, putting by half cutting my half times 100, right?
And that's assuming that humans are still around. 100 Generations from now.
But if they were, I'm still not even any way related to these people.
And I kind of ruined them anyways because I'm giving them well, that they don't control and don't understand how it was generated, right?
12:14
And they definitely remember.
I was not that that's that I need that but like just being real and the other alternative is that in a hundred Generations there won't be any humans right?
And in that case, then the Legacy doesn't matter either.
And so that was what was kind of like my ultimate wrap around with this of meaning is that nothing inherently has meaning which also gives us the power to create and Destroy meeting as we see fit but more importantly to rise above meeting and say.
12:38
Why am I saying that things should or should not be meaningful and answering an examining that question has been very valuable for me as it is.
An entrepreneur because in some ways it's freed up a lot of my attention because of this continued Obsession I had or that I have Tendencies towards towards only doing things that are meaningful.
12:54
When in fact I feel like my an easier thing that has been useful for me has been, am I doing things that are in alignment with my values?
And those values to me are meaningful in and of themselves and that is all, they don't have to be that way.
They shouldn't be that way.
But for me, doing actions in that way, rather than putting it in casting, in the future has been a useful mental Eyes and so I don't know where you're at in your journey but my name is Alex from Asia in a portfolio of companies that do about 85 million dollars a year.
13:22
I've absolutely nothing to sell you.
My goal with acquisition.com is to help entrepreneurs build their businesses and you know, get Financial Freedom.
The way that we structure everything is I give away everything.
So the courses the books, this book you can get for 99 cents.
I have this the first of a big series of volumes that are making of the real stuff that actually helped us build these companies.
13:43
And then with the hopes that we can help invest in some, The, the bigger ones that succeed using those materials.
So anyways, lots of love keeping amazing back.

Musa Nation.
What's going on?
We got a special podcast for you today.
This is part 2 of the 0 to 100 million dollars in sales by age 30 podcast.
I did with Albert preciado from driven where we talk about how to win and win big.
How we sealed our social media to almost 2 million person audience in under two years and third in the understanding of control and freedom and how it relates to the entrepreneurial journey in growth in business.
0:25
Enjoy Tony, Robbins talks about this which like we have this like unstated question that we we asked all the time.
I think he says his just like kind of make this better and when I was at the Tony Robbins event I was like I wonder what my question is that like the one in a question?
You repeat over and over again and I think mine is like, how can I use this?
0:42
Welcome to the game, where we talk about how to get more customers, how to make more per customer and how to keep them longer in the many failures and lessons.
We have learned along the way.
I hope you enjoy and subscribe.
I've always scream to the world.
I have this.
I'm gonna have this before I have it.
Yeah, and then it becomes a reality, Maybe not.
0:59
Maybe I don't.
Each the number, maybe I don't reach 50 million but I reached 36 million and but I've always been like that and that keeps me pushed it it motivates me and you talked about private private flying.
I never imagined I would fly private like I never imagined it and then I scream to the world, like, we're gonna fly private, I scream to the world, we're gonna buy a jet, haven't bought it yet, but we but we will.
1:21
Yeah.
But but when I flew private, the first time would still yeah and it felt it's just a different Seeing feeling I know where you spend your money on things you love in your life or how was your first experience, flying private.
1:41
I've said this before, I like it just transforms.
What is normally a painful experience into one that can be enjoyable.
Like going from economy to First Class?
I don't think makes the flight enjoyable.
I think it just makes it less painful.
I think flying private does make it an enjoyable experience.
That being said to what you were saying earlier about like casting it on the world and trying to make it to reality.
2:00
Me just throwing it out there.
Yeah, I think you would be just as successful if you did because I think it's who you are, like, you are going to win because winners win and that fact that is innate.
And so someone put duct tape on your mouth and took away your social media.
It's still fucking kill it.
And so, you know, like on the flip side, like they've seen people who set really big goals and then they go after them and that's what drives them.
2:20
And then, you can also set goals that you never miss and you always keep over delivering on that.
That incremental goal.
I think either way the winners win because of the activities that they do the drive, the l've.
I'm less spiritual about my about winning.
Are there certain traits that you see?
Like when you see somebody, can you tell like in five minutes if they have what it takes to win?
2:40
Big, or does it take time for you to analyze a person feeling?
A lot of people have said?
Yeah, I think talking to people, you get it, you get a Vibe for how, you know, like how sharp, they are some level of character.
I mean, there's the whole like thinking fast and slow like you can make, you know.
2:55
Yeah, 30.
I'm because I used to know from selling and you've done a lot of sales to like someone The door.
I usually had a pretty good idea of where I was going to close them.
Not before they even like, started talking.
You know, I mean, like you just start seeing patterns over and I like this person, I know how much that, you know what, angle my going to come from to like lot like, you know, unlock this.
But I don't, you know, I don't want to sound arrogant, like I can just I can read everyone but I think it's when you get these unique pairings of people like, what?
3:20
Because I'm trying to think of like, what is, what is it Factor?
What is like X Factor?
Like what is it?
What makes someone special?
What is why do?
Some people raise get raised up, right?
And I think, It's when we have patterns, we don't recognize.
And so, for example, like, if you look at this outfit, right?
3:37
Yeah, a lot of times in my videos I'm wearing a wife beater.
And I look like I'm in a basement, just being real, right?
Is another.
Yeah, and I think people have an expectation of what I'm going to sound like, whatever my level of intelligence is whatever level of success, they are expecting and then it's, it's not met.
3:57
And so I think that when people can and I think Those patterns, where people what happens is?
People are like wait a second.
What happened here?
And then all of a sudden the brain goes into learning mode because Norman's like pattern recognition, pattern recognition, and then you don't actually have to consciously think because it's just all unconscious.
Like you're just I know what that person is.
4:13
I know what they're about because people usually grab their identities off the shelf.
They say oh, I'm going to be a country boy and then they just adopt the country boy outfit.
Or I'm going to be the, you know, Instagram influencer Avatar, right?
And then they put that put that outfit on and they believe those things they do.
4:29
Do those things and and then they become just like everybody else.
And so I think a big part of kind of like the quote authenticity is like, everybody has had a unique experience, but they don't express that.
And so they just conform.
And so I think if you can, if you have true alignment of what you really deeply believe, and what you say, and what you do, and how you act, then that is the authenticity, but I think most people are afraid of doing it because they're afraid of being rejected.
4:53
And so it's so much safer to pull an identity off-the-shelf dress like a goth dress like Honk dress like a corporate dude dress, like the real estate guys rather than just have something that's a little bit different.
And that's what I think is people pause and I think that's what makes that's what gives people a, you know, if Factor X Factor.
5:14
Yeah, speaking of that, The Branding cause you're a genius marketer and, and, you know, and you know, except what you're doing.
I could tell, you know exactly what you're doing.
There's always a strategy because I think the same way.
There's always a reason why you're doing In something.
5:30
So like, for example, like let's say if you look like me, like if you buzz your hair and you start worry dressing like me and then I switch it up and I started.
Yeah, I dress the same way and and, you know, I get bit bigger.
And yeah, do you think people are going to be like, wait a minute.
5:46
That's not Albert.
Wait a minute, that's not Alex.
Do you think it's important to have a look that separates you and it gives you that unique identity?
I think how you dress is a part of your identity, whether you like it or not, even even someone who like I mean candidly probably dresses.
6:01
Like me, it's like I might be trying to communicate something which is like I'm dressing for comfort and function.
Function matters more to me than form.
Like that would be a value that I'm communicating with how I dress.
It's also true.
Now, if, if if that weren't true, then it would be silly for me to dress in a way that would communicate that like Leila probably dresses the exact opposite of me.
6:21
She usually dresses, it like her, her outfits, probably cost more.
Rent every month and every day, but like because for her, that communicate something else which for her is like, I am excellent.
Everything I have is always dialed in like from every every aspect of what I'm doing, like was curated, was thought of.
6:42
And I'm here to present my best self for the day for the opportunity, for everybody in the room.
And I want to respect and honor them by how I how I show up, not that I don't feel that way.
I just do it differently.
You don't have meaning I think people like you because of the way you look like a sister, you have that look and feel the same way she always has to be ready.
7:00
Her Yale's, her eyelashes.
She needs to put and, and she's the one because I dress we don't dress that much different.
Yeah, I'm pretty casual but I used to dress more casual and she's the one that forced me to like, hey, you can't look that, you can look at that casual when you run a mortgage company or just a real estate.
7:17
So she got me to looking a bit more professional, but this is me like they have trainings on Tuesdays Wednesdays.
Yeah.
I'm This I dig that I don't when they, you know, sometimes people expect you because you're the owner, or whatever title you have, they expect you to be in the suit and the tie.
Yeah.
And I don't like it, I'm comfortable like this too.
7:35
Yeah.
Is that one of the main reasons?
Why you do it?
Come to us?
Not the main, the main reason is because it's this, what I did salil.
I am comfy, I'm comfy.
Like, I, this is what I wear.
I go to the gym with this.
I go out to dinner with this.
I go to, this is just how I dress and like, all right, we're I'll go deep on this with you for a second.
7:51
So, I just bought 40 pairs of white tank tops to figure out what was the best white tank top.
I bought probably 25 pairs of barefoot shoes to figure out, which was the most comfortable when I worked out, which was the easiest that could put on or off, which is the one that didn't bother my foot.
8:07
When I went because we walk like two hours a day.
And so putting all those things together so I could pick the right one.
So that, I just don't have to think about it ever again.
So like, in terms of, that's for me because that's just like, I tend to operate that way, like when I would, I used to eat the same sandwich every day and lightly used to joke about it because Like I had a bagel with this protein cream cheese and lox that was low-fat locks because the whole meal was like 100 grams of protein and she saw me everyday experiment with a different way of eating it, which is like.
8:35
Okay.
I'm going to put the locks, the cream cheese and the thing and I'm going to toast it and I'll do glop glop and then take a bite.
The other way is like I put the cream cheese on and, and the salmon on and do that.
Otherwise I chopped it all chopped, all the salmon up to.
So, is mush.
So I didn't have to, like, have pieces that I pull off because, you know, like, half the sandwich is missing.
8:52
You like got a piece And so it's like just continuing thing.
Like, is there a better way?
I can do this.
And I think that like, we all have these kind of any questions Tony Robbins talks about this, which like we have this like unstated question that we ask all the time.
I think he says his just like can I make this better and when I was at the Tony Robbins event I was like I wonder what my my question is that like the one in a question?
9:12
You repeat over and over again and I think mine is like how can I use this?
And his was like how can I make this better for me?
Like it's always like Vibe you know if I meet and it's probably sounds really utilitarian if I meet someone like how can I use this witch?
Sounds bad.
But like, I think this would it like, if I have a bad situation like how can I use this?
9:27
I think it also saves you a lot of time, right?
When you just you know you're going to wear the same thing.
Exactly.
Meet the same thing a hundred percent.
So that's how can I use an outfit?
Well, this outfit is optimized for working out.
I can change my temperature really easily because if it's too cold in here, I can roll in button and if it gets hot, I can roll it up.
9:43
If it gets way too hot.
I can take it off and I'm just in a beater, right?
I can do the workouts with this and I can, if I put it up and go out, I can go walk into any restaurant.
If I take these off because these are not sandals, because I've gone, Into the nicest restaurants.
If I put my sport mode on no one stops me, right four-wheel drive.
9:59
Anyways all that to say I think this represents probably a lot of the values that I have in terms of like, I've thought of all of these things, for me of what is convenient.
What is functional?
What is comfortable?
And then this is the end result of that on the quick.
Quick questions on the 100 grams of protein.
Can your body processes that at one setting or is, or because I heard that you could only process, like, 30, 40 grams at once.
10:19
So, 100 grams protein is good to get it out of the way, it's not that.
So there's a Nuance to that.
There's a new ones to it.
You can't do 100 grams protein, it's 30 to 40 per hour, but you would eat 100 and you process the first 30 to 40 in the first hour, the process, the next 30 to 40 the next hour and the like it's in your gut the whole time.
10:39
Yeah.
So you can I mean like thinking that that would limit your protein intake because you have to space it out throughout the day would be like saying a caveman isn't going to get us protein.
If he's if he kills an animal on the Deets, 200 grams of protein in one sitting cause he's fucking starving that he only eats.
The 30 grams, the other 170, or thrown out like, you know, I mean so it's just, you're gonna get the first 30 to 40 now and then in an hour you get another 30 40, just like and so you have nutrients that are going through a system.
11:04
Yeah, now, Alex going to your where you work from, like the cloth, is it a closet?
It's a closet and you and you always have a nose strips.
What are those nose strips?
They make you smarter.
What are those?
What's special about this?
Like, I've had two operations on my nose.
I can't breathe out of my nose, and so that just like it just, it just, you know, keeps it.
11:23
Keeps it open for me, which is why I wear them and because if I don't I do this all day long which I hate doing.
So just keeps it open.
That was an issue of thing.
And then the I like the being in the windowless closet because if I have a like I love yous to look at but if I look at views while I'm working, I will stare out into space for you know, that make hours and then I'm like oh where am I?
11:48
And then 25 minutes went by.
So if I have this like a like I'm just very scattered I think by nature and so I try and control as many environmental conditions that can Hey guys, love that.
You're listening to the podcast.
If you ever want to have the video version of this which usually has more effects, more visuals, more graphs, you know, drawn out stuff.
12:09
Sometimes it can help hit the brain centers in different ways.
You can check out my YouTube channel.
It's absolutely free to check that out if that's what you are into.
And if not keep enjoying the show, But when they met you, you had a long talk.
It was like, I think you did for like two hours.
Yeah.
Because I didn't know you write.
12:26
So, so I see you speaking and I'm there and I'm like 10 15 minutes in and and, and then it's like 30 minutes in and then I'm like, damn, he's still on.
Yeah.
I'm liking and, and you're like a lot about value, you're just you're you're talking about the boring stuff, not in a bad way, but that's just stuff that people need to listen to people.
12:45
People, you know, people get a, they want entertainment and all that.
Yeah, but a step.
Out.
Got a drink, came back in, and it's like an hour 15, you're still there and then it goes on and on.
And then I see I met you after when you came out and we're at the bar.
But um about my question is on social media, you got into social media not too long ago, right?
13:06
You weren't that known before and I think was it eight months ago or a little more 18 months is when I had my first YouTube video.
So in 18 months you just blew up and got a bunch of followers of God, verified.
Was that your Party that you wanted to do?
13:21
Or did you have a game plan on that?
Or how'd you do that?
Yeah.
So there were there were a couple of things.
So Dean gracioso who's Tony Robbins right-hand man who's become a I was with him.
I know him.
Yeah.
Is, he's become a close friend.
I asked him, his Fame worth it because I was like, I was very big on the, like, just be rich in Anonymous.
13:41
Like, I like to getting rich and Anonymous and he, he said, you know, Alex, I get people who send me, weird messages and threats, and threatened my family, he said, but if that's the price Have to pay to make the impact.
I want to have.
I'd pay it.
I paid every day of the week and we said that it really hit me because I was like, man, I guess I'm you know I'm trying to stay in this hole and not be known because I was I was kind of showing all that.
14:02
He's like what if you want to make the impact, you want to help the people that you say, you want to help like you have to become known.
And so that was kind of like one of the big things that that started me on the path.
That's probably the last push that got me into like alright I'll start making content of What Not.
And then from a business perspective, you know we're looking for internet businesses that are doing you know, 3 million to 30 million a year.
14:20
To you know, take a meaningful stake in so we can help scale them and so that's what acquisition.com is.
And so the best way to do that type of structure is to have inbound deal flow so that people see stuff and then decide to walk towards you whereas the rest of my companies have always build off of paid ads, Affiliates you know, cold calling in.
14:38
I found things like that.
And so, but I knew with this process, you know, going getting a propriety or deal flow structure set up with trust at the onset where we've already provided value we've She helped someone 3x or 10x their business before they start working with us.
14:54
It just speeds up the process, so much more and we operate from shared, trust from the beginning and it just makes for what I would hope.
You know what?
I hoped.
And now I can say is true a much more enjoyable experience for both people and it makes the diligence much shorter.
And so just makes for an overall more efficient growth process.
15:11
And also, because we come in as a minority partner with these companies, like I have no legal strong-arm.
I can't say, I'm going to kick out the CEO.
It's his, it's his company.
And so it all has to be from a position of like influence and trust and so like recently just pulled the stats on the portfolio, but like the average company that we've worked with increases the revenue by 80%, and triples their profit within the first eight months.
15:33
It's pretty cool.
But you can only do that if someone trusts you to like, make major changes in the business and like I still have to have some calls with them.
Like, it's okay.
Yeah, we're going to increase this price, or we're going to change this continuity.
We're going to eliminate this product line.
And if it was a traditional kind of like private, Or family office relationship.
15:52
They would probably be much more resistant to those things.
And so all of this branding stuff has the function of, you know, generating inbound companies for us.
But then also, if we Zoom way, way, way out, I like the idea of just helping a lot of people for free without really selling anything.
You spend a lot of money on ads right now.
16:09
It's been zero dollars under 1000 and you give a lot of value in.
You have that phrase where you say, I have nothing to sell you.
Yeah.
Was that is that a strategy or is that that happened on accident and happened?
An accident.
Well, I was really frustrated because we were like this guy's going to sell us something else.
16:24
Like I have nothing to sell you as like go to the website.
What can you, what can you buy?
There's nothing to buy.
We're an investment company.
Like that's what we do.
So we buy into companies, you know, we're definitely private Equity company and so that's what we do.
So if you were like, where's when's the 10,000 dollar course coming out is like, it's not like here's what you would get for the 10,000 or course and I'll just give it to you and you can just consume it and crush it.
16:41
And the idea is the strategy when the business is get as many people as I possibly can into the world, help as many of them, as I possibly can with the best stuff out there.
And then the people who are hyper executors will self-select, because they can execute without hand-holding, and then they will seek us out and say, hey, I've used all your stuff, we three extra sales, we 10x our profits, whatever it is and like now we're going to go from, you know, 5 million, 250 million I'm going from 10 million to you know, 100 million, whatever it is.
17:08
So wrapping up Alex to close out.
I know that you sold your, you sold a few companies writing made a You made a lot of millions, can you share a little bit of the details?
Maybe that's much as you can.
And then, how did that change your life and Layla's life?
17:26
So we sold the, we saw two of the companies for forty.
Six point two million, it was an all-cash deal.
There was no seller financing, no earn-out no Consulting back which was, which is great, which is Jim lunch and Prestige Labs.
We still retained 33 percent of the company.
So we still, like, we still believe in the company.
17:41
We just wanted to exit from the majority position so that we could do acquisition.com, which is the goal we sold Allen last year as well, which we were not at Liberty to say, The price was I can say it was a 12 million-dollar Top Line software company with we had done in 12 months prior.
So we sold all three of those companies last year.
17:58
And the thing is is that like we've always run really high cash flow businesses into your point about living really pretty modestly compared to our income Leyland.
I already taken about 45 million in dividends out of the businesses just in the five years leading up to that.
And so, you know, the 46 million dollar price tag on the sale was not like life-changing.
18:17
Yeah.
And I can say this is that when the wire Came in.
I did not feel the money that came in but I did feel the Stop and cash flow.
And so you're just accustomed to a certain amount of cash that comes in.
And for me that's like almost my like my thermostat for like how I'm doing and all of a sudden that my big cash flow hose got dropped down to zero but then I got this big lump but I didn't feel the lump and so I feel poor.
18:42
Now building acquisition.com then I did with Jim launching procedures, kind of interesting.
Yeah, I'm just saying like it was something that I didn't expect because most people Most people they think about well I'm gonna sell em.
They get this much cash.
Yeah.
But then they don't realize the cash flow.
Yeah.
18:57
Youyou went through that SOL.
SOL.
SOL.
That really is important.
Yeah.
Because then you have to take that money and then go recreate the cash flow you once had and then you have to put an entirely different hat on because we've been like you and I to both have been in the business game rather than the investment best in game.
I'm not a an experienced, investor.
19:15
I have a by sheer amount of money that I can invest.
I have probably a high percentage investor By net worth, but investing is not how I made my money.
Like I made money in business here, I mean that I translated it into cash and so still to this day like we're like acquisition.com, is the thing that's going to get us to a billion.
19:33
The money that we took out is just put in really safe stuff that we don't want to lose.
Like we don't need to take big risks there because like this is how this is, how I'm going to make everything to get past the billion.
And I say that often mostly because it's like a fun goal and I'm dedicated to doing it, but it Be there.
19:51
Can you share of acquisition yeah.com the the company?
Whoa.
What do you exactly do?
Yeah and and and how does your day look like now?
What's your typical?
You could answer that either last before or after.
But how is your, what's your typical Monday through Sunday?
20:06
And Layla's typical Monday through Sunday?
For like, for example, us, we're always together.
Like we work out together work together.
Have a life together.
So I think it's kind of similar but I don't know, maybe you guys separate and and and do different like different things.
How is Is your days and what is acquisition.com.
20:23
So, so we take Internet businesses from usually three-ish, you know, three to ten million is the rains that most of them come in at and we take them to, you know, 30 to 100 and that's kind of the incubator spot and it's almost all been internet businesses that we've taken on and its really.
20:39
We have a, it's called value acceleration method.
So vam is there's kind of a shorthand for it.
But we were verse out how we're going to get to 50 million in terms of what is the Enterprise data look like, right.
What is the what's the leadership need to look like what would team needs to?
They're what strategy, and what monetization vehicle does.
This need to be in to get the multiple that, it's that.
20:55
It's going to yield, right?
And so we work backwards from that, kind of, we put it as a 36-month goal back to the present and then we start chipping away at it, 12 weeks at a time.
And so, in the beginning, a lot of people come to acquisition.com, they expect that we're going to go go do a ton of acquisition, but the most of the times, we have to fix the back end.
21:12
We have to get customer success metrics in place.
We have to get them on a CRM that tracks.
Everything from click, the closed end to end, so we can have metrics to make decisions.
From there.
Usually we can, you know, to 35 x, the customer lifetime value.
And that's where we get the really huge outsized returns because all that drops to bottom line.
21:29
And so, then we get this massive boom in profit that we can, then once we've improved the customer experience increased the the reputation in the space, then we have all this excess, you know, net free, cash flow, that's pump, getting pumped out of the business that we can.
Then go spend on recruiting high level Talent, go buying into networks or acquisition channels that we couldn't otherwise afford.
21:50
Word.
And so it's really we go back to front, so we fix the back end, fix the product, fix the experience, get the customer.
Sweet, right?
Make sure customer segmentation is being tracked, appropriately.
So we can, we can figure out where we have the most leverage on profitability.
We pull that as hard as we can once we pulled all the levers, we can on the back end.
22:07
Then we go and say okay well we're getting all of this is from cold calls.
But do we have a cold email team, do we have do we have an ads team?
Do we have a tick tock to even organic team?
Do we have a partnership and Affiliates team?
So like all of a sudden then we can start expanding Landing the amount of channels and we acquire much and when you do this, is to just you and Layla, or do you have like a CFO even team?
22:26
Yeah, we have everybody analyzes the business together.
Yeah, exactly.
So we have also like our CFO, for example.
She's, she's done 16, South Side exits.
So she was on the team that did the sale biggest when she sold was 15 billion.
And then the last, she saw the last two companies with us and then before that was 750 million before that was a billion.
22:45
And so she's very accustomed to walking through these transactions, not cheap right though.
Touchy, she's a partner.
And so what we do and we have, you know, our portfolio, operating partner, who's really specialize in customer success.
And doing kind of what I just outlined Layla's really good at getting the operational team, the culture, the leadership in place and so and, you know, I'm pretty good at pricing and product and getting the messaging, right?
23:06
Why not?
And so we think of it as I can on demand c-suite as like company comes in and let's say we know that a company at 10 million needs to look like this, right?
And the company currently looks like this and so we match what our reality is to fix this This so that it matches.
So we basically copy and paste our expertise into the team so that it can get to that level.
23:26
And then maybe a 10 million we might have to swap out to, and get to different people in or move to people above them unless they have the ability to grow.
And so, like, you know, at three million, you might need a staff accountant at at 10 million, might need a controller and at, you know, 30 million, you need to CFO.
And so, it's not just knowing, like, okay, this is what we need to do to get there.
23:45
But we, this is what we need to do right now in this business today, to get to the next step.
So I think a lot of times, it's the people would take something from two steps forward and it's not the right sequence even though it's the right move.
Okay, so I want to respect your time out, Alex.
One last question and I realized like you talk about controller then CFO CEO.
24:05
Oh how important they are.
Yeah.
When you start a business, you kind of want to have all the control and you want to say the last word and everything.
But then then then when you start doing good.
Yeah.
Then you want to let go of the control because you want to get smarter people than you to run it for.
Are you so that you don't have any control I know you went through that whole process.
24:24
So so is that how it is?
How you see it?
Yeah, I think entrepreneurship in general is a continuous and unrelenting relinquishing of control, and so, like, most people want freedom, right?
So, it's like, we have these, these polar opposite.
These contrasting values that we are after we're entrepreneurs.
24:41
So, we want absolute freedom, and then we also want absolute control and you can't have both.
And so if you want true Freedom, you have to give up control.
If you want to control, you have to give up your freedom.
And so if everything is depending on you, then everything is dependent on you.
And so for me, I value Freedom more than I value control.
24:57
And I think that the leveling up that happens in entrepreneurship, at least in my journey has been what my expectations of talent look like.
Like, I remember when I got my first 50,000 or your employee and I was like, whoa, this is awesome because I was used to like ten dollars an hour.
You know it sounds like this is unbelievable.
25:12
This is this is where it's at.
And then I remember I got my first 70,000 or your plate.
I was like this is where it's at.
I got my first six-figure employee and I was like, okay.
Now we're talking and they got my first 250,000, all your employee and I was like, that's what's up?
And then I got my first million dollar employee and I was like, okay.
And so I think that what happens is just like it's the continually leveling up what, what, talent exists and I had a mentor.
25:33
Say this to me said, you have to remember that the best talent isn't even on your team yet.
Yeah, they're in the future.
You haven't even hired him yet.
And so, I think that's been, I'll be the biggest thing because if we're, if it's a continuous process of relinquishing control, then it means it's a continuous process of leveling up the people that you can give the control to Alex something that the audience doesn't know about you?
25:52
Something that I shared in anywhere in French, is my first language.
Yeah, awesome.
Thank you, appreciate it.
Hey, you guys, hopefully was valuable for your time as well.

What's up was a nation?

Hope you enjoy and subscribe.
Hey guys.
Welcome to this episode of the passionate few podcast today.
It's your host Omar here.
1:02
And today, we're sitting down with the CEO of Jim launch, and a handful of other companies.
None other than Alex her MOSI.
And as some people might know in the Internet space, he's gone from literally zero in March of 2017, I think to now just clearing 110 million in revenue between his company's.
1:18
So today we're going to pick as mind.
Here's whole story and get some advice for how you guys can grow your mindset in business.
Thanks so much for being on the show today, Alex, appreciate it.
Thank you for having me.
Awesome man.
So I know we were talking a little bit before the zoom call about kind of the nuances of now you're kind of teaching entrepreneurship and kind of giving advice With No Agenda per se, but take me back like what's the, where did the inspiration for the entrepreneur?
1:43
That is Alex, before you know, 110 million in Revenue, you know, you and your wife, Leila really killing it in the fitness space but like, take me back to Alex before.
All this started, what were you doing for and word entrepreneurship?
Start for you early on, I had a I would say I'm a typical story.
2:00
I was not the bachelor who felt like school didn't understand him and who, you know, struggled, pay attention, and was slinging hot dogs on the side.
Like that.
Was that my story?
I did really well in school went to Vanderbilt graduate in three years, medical Odie did very well on the SATs.
2:15
I got above hearts are birds, med school, and wedgie Mets.
And I was planning on going to Medical consultant or Investment Banking around because that was kind of the more I knew that people made the most money.
But I read the 4-Hour workweek.
When I was a Management Consultant and I was during the process Was I just in my two years, I was 23 and I realized that there was no job that was going to pay me as much money as I wanted to make and would let me live.
2:36
I knew that there were jobs like being a beggar.
For example, you can make 10 million a year as an investment banker.
Once you move up the ranks, but you pretty much give 25 years your life good thing and I that was like, I don't know, I just didn't, I didn't feel like it made sense to me to give up all of my youth for money later.
2:53
You know what I mean?
We all see those cartoons of the person, chasing the money at the very end.
They have all this money, they're old.
They're Going to class.
And so I just didn't want that.
And so I was applying for business school and one of the questions was, how will, you know, XYZ MBA help you with your short and long-term goals?
3:09
And and I think pretty sure this is why they asked the question to make sure that people are clear and why they're even applying.
And I spent like, two days looking at the question, and I just realized it was saying, help me with my short One controls.
It's a nice look to the opportunity cost suspending.
You know, two hundred thousand dollars in two years of not making income versus, you know, starting a business.
3:26
And so that was what got me too.
Position, I looked at a bunch of different business ideas.
I was super close to opening up a frozen yogurt store as I have a name for it yet.
Evie's treats even.
Yeah I just thought it was like squeak and Kiddush.
It had like a candy and a positive energy Thug.
3:42
Vibe overall was going to model it after a candy store, except it had frozen yogurt.
But from a decoration style think like lights and all the huge tubes of toppings like I could tell you all about the ogre business if you ever want so many ways ended up realizing that it was like two hundred thousand dollars to start one of those and I didn't have that.
4:00
So I had 60,000 was that I'd saved up at 23 and how did you save up that cash just from jobs along the way from the Consulting gig that I that I apologize.
I had.
How much were you making?
Give or take doing the Consulting?
Don't mind sharing at that time.
I, it's good.
4:16
So I had set up, I think I was making 50 or 60, I gotta see a rose, either 50 or 60 Grand a year out of college.
And the second year, I was in that job, they allowed me to work on like Mission.
So I brought in a deal, I would get a higher rate and so they ended up switching me to that.
4:35
And so we ended up having one deal that happened in the last six months of me being there.
And I got to like 30,000 our paychecks.
And after out the second one that deal ended.
And so I was going to have another period where I basically didn't get a paycheck until the next deal came through.
And so it was at that point that I was like, alright, I'm going to do it.
4:53
And so that's when I that's when I sold my condo and Packed my car.
And I started driving across the country to California, which is where I was my first trip.
And when you open your first Jim, this is before you meet Layla or anything like that, right?
So, uh, so 24, you open your first gym and what's your plan at this stage?
5:12
Like are you already thinking about scale in this or it's just like yeah you want to create your own income like a lot of entrepreneurs.
Now at 24 25, they're trying to get the 2 comma Club be on stage clickfunnels you know like and they make that the target instead of the stuff in front of them.
Take me to your mind.
5:28
I was at that time.
What was going through your head?
With that first one, I was different plating on a big.
Like, I would say it was brief that I wanted to be a a.
So I'll answer your question with context.
I was so depressed in this consulting job that I just didn't want to be alive anymore and so I I didn't and so when I realized that a lot of things that I created was because of what I thought I was supposed to do and that I was in some places they call that a rock top moment rather than a rock bottom moment.
5:57
You get to the top of I mean, you realize there's nothing there, right?
And so I was like, this is miserable if the rest of my life is more of this than I don't high and so that was when I you know, quit everything sold, everything and said.
Well at least about you know, do Fitness.
It's something that I'm really passionate about and they say, if you do some you're passionate about then you know you're working.
6:14
You don't have to work another day in your life or whatever the saying is.
And so I kind of bought into that which is alive but definitely of work since then.
But it got me on that path.
In the thing is is that as soon as I started the gym, it was the hardest period of my life was the first nine months of running.
Much an Really top two hardest years of my life.
6:30
And during that process, once I got out of, like, sleeping on the gym floor, which is how I started to actually like, making it into a business.
At that point, I was hope.
And I just, I was all, I could think about was, how do I, you know, how do I, how do I scale?
I do get more gems.
How do I have more locations?
6:46
And, and from the, from the point where you started to start getting momentum was about nine months, you said I was very fortunate.
I hired a coach before I opened a gym.
Yeah, so I learned from the Consulting world of the best way to to learn a skill is to hire an expert because that's exactly what you're doing.
The Consulting for the Management's artwork from shot came from because that sound back here it was something you're saying.
7:07
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
So actually so I actually knew Sam rest in peace Sam and yeah I know he was instrumental in so many people's fitness journey.
So what did you learn from him, man?
That's awesome.
Yeah, so to my knowledge I was I am I think Sam's only Apprentice so he created his Have Fun Classic.
7:26
Same fashion, I emailed 40 gym owners.
That seemed like they were doing something.
He was the only one who replied to me.
I was in Baltimore.
He said, come on over Sherman.
See what we can do.
I drove over knocked on his door and he's like holy shit.
You're here like, that's weird.
Yeah I'm here.
And he's like where you staying?
7:41
I was like, I don't know.
I just showed up at your door and he was like you.
I was like, no I literally just got out of my car like from Baltimore like hi.
And so he said well you know I'm busy right now he's like but you can come over to my place for dinner tonight you can step over and I was like how things like that was kind of the guy Sam was and I think Sam was really passionate.
7:58
She guy who's definitely very opinionated and created a lot of enemies and a lot of friends, but you always knew where you stood with Sam.
So he took me in and then I woke up with him every day.
You know, I was at the gym at four with him to kind of learn the ropes.
He let me sign up his Mastermind so he was like, it's 10 grand for my master wants.
8:14
I said, okay, here's 10 grand.
I was like, I don't have a gym.
He said, it's fine and then you turn around and give me a job.
So I was like, you started pay me back the money from the my son died just before, and then 90 days in, I found a location.
I said I'm going to open this one so great house.
Was it for you to invest the cash at that time, because that amount of money you're in your mid-20s.
8:33
And, you know, I had 60.
So I knew I had 10 left our 9:50 last and that I 50, like, I was just running off of like, how much money do I have, right?
And then I open the gym, I think, 437 something like that.
And I spent money in the three months in between.
So I know I had five thousand dollars left in my bank account when the gym opened and was Fitness already a part of your routine and I just want to zoom in because I think a lot of people obviously, See your fit is how we see all your caps videos on your inside.
9:02
Yeah I was I was I was I think I was 15.
I was already very fit like I was already like extremely fit and how do you maintain the consistency thing?
You just love it and it's so the consistencies automatic at this stage the results try view or is it does it help you with business in a certain context like you get awfully things?
9:22
Really interesting answer for?
Yeah it's interesting because I think we should talk to a lot of entrepreneurs about Fitness they're actually kind of green.
They're new to I've been training for 17 years.
So is there like despite the fact that I'm younger like I'm actually like old in the iron game in and I mean, how old are you?
And now we 131 like I've been training for a long time.
9:41
Like I mean, I had State records, most 20.
So like I've been competing for a long time at that point already, you know what I mean?
Yeah.
And so in the beginning, I started working out because I wanted to be strong enough to protect myself and then a transition from that to wanting to get girls, which it didn't help with but that's what I thought it would happen.
10:03
And then from there to print edition to status, right once I was in college, it was more about just like looking good in general and then from there it transitioned to being about progress because then I got into the strength game and really started like power lifting and competing and all that.
And then, once I opened my business from that point going forward, and that was 2013 whenever my gym, my first gym fitness no longer was a priority for me.
10:28
My body was the vehicle for growth prior to the business and the business became the vehicle for growth as soon as that started, I would say from then.
Until now it's been more or less the same, which is I work out because it is a part of my identity.
I enjoy what I feel like after I work out, I take the same amount of inertia, to overcome to get to the workout, you know, facility.
10:51
Like I have and I'm working on this now, hopefully, I mean, I have a key joints, like when my knees hurt, my hips hurt in tournament, because I've been doing a lot of volume, A long time.
So like I get in there and I just try and caught, I just call him punch it.
It's just like a clock in and clock out.
I do, my, I do my volume and I go about my life because I am in the fitness space and I need to look a certain way.
11:09
And so that's kind of what I've kind of tricking myself.
And so I have to look a certain way.
Yeah, I actually have to but I tricked.
This Sam Actually, Sam actually told me that to that, that it's like, used as like, a pressure motivation and that's why so often you see that, you know, very seldomly.
11:24
She people in other careers actually maintain a physique over the course of Years, it happens but it's anomaly.
Usually people who maintain their body are in the fitness space because they're walking Billboards or creates that pressure of like shit.
I'm an example of what I teach at some level, at least in your head.
11:40
Yeah, yeah, it's difficult because you also a lot of things that make you look super fit action, not good for your health, like me walking out of my body weight in general, is not good for my longevity, which is one of the things I struggle with because I want to make progress, right?
I Wanna Get Better, but me getting better.
I actually think, I mean, if I get bigger, now, I just got worse and If I get stronger, my joints hurt more, and I gained more muscle, I live less time because my heart will give up.
12:03
So that's like the real that no one talks about.
So those are the things that I look at.
So, for now it's like I'm just I train to train so that I can maintain my room at.
I may lose 30 pounds, you know, when I'm 40 just to get even leaner, but anyways, not to not to digress into if it's tangent.
No, no.
It makes sense because a lot of people I'm sure think about that.
12:20
You know, a lot of times, you know, they say one area, affects the other.
Have you found that when you don't work out for x amount of time, starts throwing you off in business a little bit or throw starts wrong.
Minor Rhythm at all.
Not at this Asia?
No, not at all.
I don't work out.
I'm just if anything, I have more energy, I mean, I used to, I mean I used to sell Fitness and so it took like, oh, the reason you're tired is just not working out.
12:41
I think that there's there's some truth to that because it's usually people just so unaware of their body and what they're eating, and they're so out of touch, but I like, I know what I eat.
I know how many grams of everything that go into my body, because I've been doing it for such a long time.
So then, if I take a week off, I'm fine.
You know what I mean?
12:56
You know, I work out.
You occasionally pick out then you're human you're not just like the super disciplined robot.
That's up at like 2 a.m. or 3 a.m. 4 a.m. every day.
Well it sounds for you.
So there's so I anything that I can do forever it'll do.
And so I don't, I don't follow diets.
13:14
I don't like none of those things.
Make any sense to me personally, Because unless you're competing, right, which just about knowing is then the only thing that you have to do is something that you can do for sustainable period of time.
And so for me like, remember, Book on it.
Because Russell, I've had so many conversations about Spurs.
13:32
I did this, I did this weekend.
Where was eight entrepreneurs?
And all of us are doing about half a billion a year in revenue between the eight of us.
And everybody went up and share tactics and whatnot.
And then during lunch, everyone see me, eating cookies and Twizzlers, and they're like, what is wrong with you?
And on the second day, they saw me do it again and they're like, what the hell like seriously and they're all like, you know, I do keto because they're all entrepreneurs, you know, I only to fats and I do intermittent fasting and I, you know, like they're always just doing all this crazy shit out there, right?
13:56
Sorry, if I was asked mr.
Gus.
Good.
It was like, you guys just have it all wrong.
Like I eat two pounds of meat a day which tuner g protein, and that gives me about 1,000 calories and then I 1,500 calories of whatever else I want, and that's every day, that's it.
So if I won't eat 15, her College ice cream, I do that.
14:13
Phony 15, you guys Pizza, I do that.
If I want to eat bagels and cream cheese than I do that, it doesn't matter, it truly does not matter, and it's just not sexy from a fitness selling perspective, because it's like, we won't have a unique mechanism, right?
Throughout is like, You eat a gram per pound of body weight in protein and then the rest of your calories to whatever your goal is if you want to be in a deficit, just decrease it but I've never ever stopped eating ice cream for years.
14:35
I eat ice cream.
Probably once or twice a day.
I want to ask one more question before we get back to the business stuff.
And I noticed you're a systems guy.
Like your, if you have a lot of these rules and systems, do you spend a lot of time, kind of like, you know, obviously, it sounds simple.
Right?
You know, something I can't do forever.
14:51
I don't do like a very simple rule, but I'm sure it took a lot of trial and error and bullshit to get to that simple.
Jen, do you spend a lot of time consciously reviewing and reiterating systems, like in your mindset and your business?
Is that, is that a constant priority for you?
100%, it's probably the thing that I do the most just refining little thing is developing Frameworks is developing Frameworks for thinking because like at the end of the day, we only have so much decision-making power.
15:16
And if we can use Frameworks then we can conserve that power.
Make more high quality decisions and a lot of times, the decisions that we're making are similar in nature.
The variables may be different, but the nature Nature of the decisions, the same right?
Are we going to spend more?
We may spend less are going to add more acquisition or going to add this extra service line and you know whatever it is.
15:34
And so if you've made if you're making a decision for the first time it's very arduous you're like trying to spring it all in and trying to weigh the way the outcomes.
But if you have a framework for making the decision, that it significantly easier and faster and have a higher likelihood of making the right call, which, you know, at a certain point.
All of us are simply rewarded for the quality of our decisions over a long time Horizon.
15:55
Most of these are real quick.
If you are a business owner that has a big old business and wants to get to a much bigger business, going to 50 $100.
Plus, we would love to talk to you and if you like that or like to hear more about it, go to acquisition.com, you planning on the page and talk to one of our team and see if we can help you get there.
16:16
So how do you incorporate join that?
The results come back and the joy I think it's it's a really good question.
I think that if I look at my life now compared to what it was two years ago I'm I've significantly more drawn my life and if you put you know ten years ago it's wildly different internet mean.
16:34
I went from not wanting to be alive and being okay with not waking up tomorrow to genuinely being I would be very bummed if I died I don't know if I've ever even say that but I would be bummed if I die.
I just a lot of, like, there's a lot of stuff, I like my life.
And so I think that the easiest way from a, like a programmatic standpoint to, to reverse engineer.
16:53
Joy is just simply saying, like, what do I enjoy doing on a daily basis and then like, how can I create as many of those days as possible?
That's right.
And that's, that's at least how I think about it.
And so my days look, more or less the same because this is what I like doing.
I wake up at the time, I like waking up.
17:09
I trained at my beautiful home gym that I have with, that's completely commercial, you know, if you've seen some of the exhibits, very cool.
You know, I hang out with my wife, we we, we do the same things because that's my that's kind of my ideal day.
So we do as many of those days again, every once in a while, we had Variety in, you know, so it doesn't stay open.
17:27
That's how I like living powerful, man.
So, take me back to when you start the first gym before all this happens.
You start the first one and then it takes nine months, you get the ball rolling.
And then where you at in Revenue where you finally go.
Hi.
I'm starting to get it.
What was happening?
Where you went?
Ah, now I got, I went from being a novice, I went from being beginner to like, Okay, I get this I started out very successfully.
17:50
I mean five thousand dollars, my first month in business.
I mean 10,000 the second month?
15, 20, 25, 30, 35 35 was month seven or eight.
I had the gym Outsource time of night, so I had a manager and trainers full-time, so that I wasn't running the gym month, 15.
18:06
And what was your overhead monthly at that time?
Give or take.
It wasn't too bad.
I know that.
I'd squirreled away. 50 Grand in the first thing is, first six months, something like that.
Like, I I'd saved 50 thousand dollars, so I'd already made the money back from starting the gym in that time period.
18:22
And then, by months of scene, opened up the second location and then 121, we open Third location and then we had four and five and then six, oh, six locations in three years.
And did you have Partners in them or you were a solo?
Yeah, I had.
18:38
So I started it on my own and then being the unwise young entrepreneur that I was.
I basically gave away two thirds of my This for no money even though it was making me twenty thousand dollars a month, I sold two thirds of a business that was making twenty thousand dollars a month in a free cash flow to me for thirty four thousand dollars and then I bought Sam's 10% back because he made a deal with me that he would get temperature in the business and I didn't like that, somebody else had 10%.
19:01
So I gave away two thirds at a like 37 thousand dollar valuation and I bought back 10% at a two hundred thousand dollar valuation that Sam and I do that.
And so I ended up netting seventeen thousand dollars for the, for the sale of 23.
My business that was making me twenty thousand dollars a month.
19:18
So these are examples of fucking stupid decisions that you make.
And so if anyone's listening is like men, this guy sounds like, you know, more on anyone can do so, you know, but what ended up happening as a result of that is I know had one third of a job and so I was like well shit I need three gyms just to get back to what I was before and so that kind of I think that might have actually tricked me into the desire to grow very quickly because I needed to make, I try was trying to retroactively make a poor decisions.
19:45
Seemed like a good decision, right?
Yeah.
And so that was why I went into this try and rapid growth mode.
So, I had the two partners for the first two locations in the Third location, and then me and one of the Partners bought out the one, the third partner, and then, I ended up, buying out the first partner.
20:04
It took three years to do this process, and then Sultan chips and another stage, when you, when you sell the gems in those 20, I think I just turned 26 ad, okay?
60 days.
Care of them.
So that is what I thought of all it was right at the end, all of this stuff all my time lines overlap, right?
20:23
So I had my gyms and then at this point I had it was me and my in the one partner and I was like, hey man, I'm going to open this gym and I opened my fifth one of my own people MI6 on my own because I didn't want to do the part of thing anymore.
Because we also had different different opinions about how he wanted to run it.
Nothing wrong.
It's just you want to go high-volume low-cost.
20:40
I wanted to go super premium, lower lower amount of people, it's just different.
We still have a good.
Relationship to this day.
Anyways, during that process I also started I started getting reached out to you're like, hey, can you help me?
Do what you're doing side?
Open up.
All the chips at full capacity, which was kind of my, my thing at that point.
20:56
And so I started flying out to gyms and doing Jim watches by, which is what we call them.
So I'd fly out 21 days.
So 100, you know, 100 to 200 people, which was a logical matter.
How much we charging initially for that I charge nothing but I averaged a hundred thousand dollars in sales for myself every 21 days, so it was working out.
21:14
Well, So I'm starting to understand in Syria, you charge nothing but we're doing a hundred thousand a month.
Yeah, / jib.
So, I would fly out and I said, I get to collect all the upfront sales.
Also, in the marketing, I'll do the sales.
I get all the up for cash.
You get all the customers, AAS.
21:30
You negotiated that deal?
Yeah.
So you kept 100%, you kept 100% of the people.
You sign ups first month?
Yeah, six weeks.
But yeah, that's fucking smart.
Dude, was free acquisition for them, right?
Exactly.
Have a fixed and they have fixed costs.
And they'll I really like the fact that it motivates you because you get paid for what you deliver on.
21:49
So, it's aligned.
Yeah, yeah.
There was no, there's that was like, I'm risking everything here.
I'm paying for a hotel, for 30 days, and paying for rental car, for 30 days of paying food for 30 days.
Okay, enhancements for 30 days are commissions for 30 days.
I got all that you have nothing out of pocket.
Soon as a result of that risk that I'm taking on, I get The Upfront for six weeks and you get the next two fucking years from The Climb.
22:08
Yeah.
What made you what made you think of that?
Or was that just your intuitive first idea or did you kind of go back and forth?
Weighing that?
Ian out.
Because that's that's a little scary, right?
It's very first time to pitch that.
It's like people don't sell that all the time, right.
It's not like a normal thing risk to do.
22:24
Yeah.
So I was like pay 500 bucks.
Reserve the date, I'll fly out.
I was like, why $500?
I was like Zoom to put 3 Grand and in fights and stuff to your facility I was like this is literally just a token of commitment.
Yeah they're like alright fair enough.
Okay, cool.
22:40
So then and then right away, you start getting one after another client client.
One after another.
Yes, I did 33 launches or two years and you make your first million bucks during the stage.
So, this is, this is where the online community is a little bit, you know?
Yeah.
22:56
I mean, the gyms that I had were already dead.
Silly books here?
Yeah.
Well, like, I wasn't making too much noise here.
Let's just profit.
I barely had anything and then I sold the gyms.
I basically fire Soldier gyms because I To start doing the Jim wants thing because that's what Russell who became my sign up for Inner Circle as a gym owner, which made no sense by the way.
23:17
Yeah, I was I was all the other sales call like I was like, oh, there's tons of your Motors here.
Like it'll be, you think you'll love it, get get super connected and it was one of the best decisions I ever made.
But none of that stuff and has nothing to do.
23:33
Like you might not have known, there was nothing to suggest to us about it.
Just the group was I was the only brick-and-mortar element But because of that, they were like, what are you doing in a brick-and-mortar gym?
Like online is where it's at.
And so, when he heard what I was doing with my gyms, he's like, dude, you've six gyms and you're 20, you know, six, he's like, you need to be teaching people what you're doing and I was like, I don't teach anyone.
23:54
I was like, this thing is, like, I spend so long developing this whole process.
I don't want to give anyone my secrets and so that's what transition me to do in the launches, because I still didn't want to give away the secrets but also scarcity mindset stuff.
And then finally, through Series of Unfortunate Events.
Basically, we were doing, like six or eight times a month.
24:11
So we started scaling, right?
I ain't ya Jim's a month, you know, and they didn't cover.
How are you handling?
That demand, you were just hiring like crazy.
Like just like getting the deals and figuring out how to service later because that that must have been.
I mean for somebody special like yourself that like systems and like things in orderly fashion, he was the best.
24:29
Yeah.
The cash was flying in so you could use that cash to clean up the mess.
Now wasn't really flying cash.
Only flew in after you.
Duma launches.
So it's like someone say yes, I want to do this thing.
Let's say it's what day is today.
So it's April, right?
So they would say yes I'm like why can't slate you from makes?
24:45
They already got Jim slated for me, so I can put you in June.
I've got two slots left for doing so and so I had to balance, how many gyms I had versus how many sales guys.
The thing is, as soon as I move to the next month, I had to get eight more gems to that eight, guys.
And I couldn't get 10 because I because I still had eight guys, because I didn't then you're like, do I scale up two more things I have to do 10 the next month, right?
25:02
So it's so that part was scary, but the Issue with the problem with the original model was I was the one holding the bag for the liability, right?
So I'm able to sales, I process the payments but I had no control over delivery and candidly.
The people who are coming to me who wanted to get more clients.
Were I mean this we're being candid.
25:20
Here were not the best gym owners because really good people at delivery have full Jim's as the people who are really struggling with the ones who came and so they didn't do the best job of delivery at the time.
And so I had to Jim's in a matter of a week.
25:35
How all the clients that I had sold to refund after I left, it wasn't me.
It was one of my sales guys but like you know you get the idea.
So I got a hundred thousand dollars refunds then like I didn't that was like everything I'd saved up that point at a hundred thousand dollars in refunds and basically the percentage of refunds that were there exceeded my margin in the business.
25:54
And so, when up happening was, I had to sell more the next month, discover the month before is refunds, and I had to do that, and I had to do that two months in a row, and the nut kept getting bigger with every month.
At I would scale up and so it was just this, it was horrible.
26:09
Just the pressure was just who's horrendous, you think that pressure that pressure was necessary, at least, at that stage to catapult you to like have to figure it out because like, there's literally, no other option.
Yep.
I'm a big believer.
That if what's interesting is that when I started the gym, who would have been at the scale, you're at now at this quick without that or that was a catalyst, would you say it was a catalyst?
26:30
Because of the way the model was thought out.
And so this is a big proponent of this.
Is that so for anyone who's listening If people have had financial troubles, their lives at some point, right?
But just about everyone was thing, has gotten out of this furniture Charles, right?
Eventually.
Yeah.
And especially if you're an entrepreneur, there's been many times.
26:45
You're like, how the fuck would make payroll?
I've got this tax bill that comes up and then somehow magically you pulled out of your ass and you make it happen, right?
Right.
And the thing is that it's my belief that everyone knows how to make money.
They just aren't comfortable making for themselves.
They're okay, making it for the government there.
27:02
Okay making it for their employees their okay making it for the landlord, they're coming for their overhead.
When it comes to themselves, they treat themselves poorly and so the thing that broke for me at that point was that I said I have to just make money, I don't care about running a business.
27:20
I don't care about the branding, I don't care about the Enterprise.
I was like I just need to make money so I can get out of this horrible painful situation amount.
That's what launched Jim launch, you know.
Into which became the coaching program, right?
And it was because I figured what's the most viable thing I have.
27:35
And I was like, I'll tell people how I've been making a hundred thousand dollars, just going to a gym and and doing my process, I was so scared of giving it away that the only reason I ended up doing it was because I was actually to get out of the industry.
So my wife started her online business.
How'd you meet her by the way?
Because I love that story.
27:51
Yeah.
She, you know, you know, my stuff.
So I said, I'll try.
So my wife and I met on Bumble and she was a trainer The topsails and for 24-Hour Fitness in Southern, California, and so on.
Our first date, I pitched her own working for me.
Even as I even if this doesn't work out, you should totally work, you can.
28:09
So we can make a ton of money and so, I've tripled what she was getting paid.
She was like, okay, there's way more to the story but just okay.
And so she joined me on these launches.
And so she and I launched these gyms together in the beginning before I started scaling them up, but she was with me, you know days, you know, Ground Zero day one growing.
28:26
This thing she was with me through the transition shoes with me through the borderline.
Bankruptcy.
She's been with me through the whole thing and show.
She's a rock, but holy shit, dude, that's amazing.
Do you think the fact that you guys bonded on the connection and fitness also lady huge Foundation to it being a strong foundation for the relationship?
28:44
I don't think Fitness was the new thing.
I think I think there was a much deeper connection from like a kindred spirits like Souls.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
We need a lot more similar than Fitness because I mean candidly I dated people would fit as like it was it was it wasn't finished his Service level like, you know, she and I both were half Iran in Iranian father, white white mother, both of us had issues with, you know, Edge had some difficulties childhood.
29:11
Both of us left our homes.
At the same age, drove across the country to California, to start our lives again.
Well, those thankful to this fitness.
Journey transformation.
Wise clothes was got into fitness and set like there were way more similarities.
Yeah, then just the fitness piece.
And so the biggest one is that we were both growth-oriented.
29:27
We just wanted to grow.
And so that's why we've been able to Continue to do what we do but she started her Fitness business.
It's are doing a thousand dollars today and I was like, oh shit, let's just do this.
Let's keep out the middleman with the gyms we can just sell Fitness.
I'll take the eight sales guys.
Do it guys song A Thousand.
A some digital products will work so they courses.
29:45
They're like finished courses, 4,000 bucks or something.
Yeah, 16-week transformation program.
Okay, doped up and she would coach them through.
It was like a, it's like a done with you program, kind of think, like this is the curriculum.
This is what you're going through.
All talk to you, every week to make sure that you're following it.
You just things etcetera.
And it sort of working.
30:01
And so I hate gyms are supposed to launch the next month and I called him up and said, hey you know, we're not going to do this week, you know, pivoted directions.
And you know, they were like hey man, we need this and only at this point because I didn't think I was gonna get into fitness because I was so scarcity mindset.
30:16
That was like, fine, I'll sell my secrets and so I sold my system, you know, for six thousand dollars.
I was the first guy and I put the number so high that I thought no one would ever say yes.
That was the gym.
Like, that was my actual thought, was I just picked a number that I didn't think anyone.
Goodbye.
And the guy said yes and I was like, holy shit.
30:34
And then now that I knew I had to make this thing as I saw one of them I got on the call next guy and I said same conversation.
I was like eight thousand dollars.
He was like okay it was like holy shit and the next call is saying things like 10,000 times.
He's like okay and I was like holy mother of God inside in Sixty thousand dollars in sales on that one day.
30:52
Yeah.
And and I realize like, I mean I can't I can't express how like I all I felt was like Whatever this was, let's do as much of this, humanly possible and I want to get out of this horrible place them because I still owed.
Yeah, my knife of the next month was going to be like a hundred great, like, in those before overhead.
31:12
I think 100 Grand that I had to cover from refunds.
I knew were going to come then overhead, then, you know, I mean, then, maybe they're dry.
Get it?
I get it.
Yeah, so I just went back to all 33.
Gemston said, hey, remember, that thing I did at your gym or we filled it up, want to see how I did it?
And there were like, sure.
And so, I basically sold almost every one of those.
31:29
Guys, and ended up making I think 350,000 next month.

I was at Brooks house and she had like, seven twenty two, twenty three year olds at our house, all right?
0:54
And so they were working like kind of interns for the summer like making social media for her.
And so they asked me One morning, one of the guys was up early and he had a hit a job at like some Financial things that he was doing, like private wealth management, calls, trying to like build his book of business and he was like, so, you know, I've got my 401k and I've got, you know, whatever stuff and it was cute.
1:13
And the thing is, is like, I'm guessing he's making sixty to eighty thousand dollars a year.
That's my, that's my guess, and he was like, Hey, you know, right now I've got a thousand extra dollars at where do you think I should invest it?
And it was so interesting to me because like the perspective from which he was asking, he was looking in for an investment vehicle, that was going to yield him return.
1:33
And I want to be very clear about this.
If you invest in the S&P 500, you invest in, you know, real estate things like that for, you know, you start really early and you do it for a long period of time.
You absolutely will make money, and it is a very safe way to live life, but it's my belief that the moment you start investing in kind of the asset side of stuff, which is like the S&P or stocks in general.
2:00
You're not day trading or do any of that stuff because that's, that's but you're actually doing it because you want to have a long-term investment.
The moment you do that is actually the moment in my belief that you're actually see seeing to want to make more income.
Okay?
Hear me out.
So I'll tell you different example that I'll relate it back to to my man.
2:18
So, if you're 18 years old and you graduate high school tomorrow and you are now eligible on the marketplace, because you have no skills, aside your high school, diploma, you did.
No jobs, you fucked off the whole time and you don't watch YouTube to learn stuff which is not you.
2:34
But just imagine in two days, you could go and become certified as a phlebotomist and go from making 750, or whatever.
The minimum wage is to a phlebotomist make at $25 an hour.
And if you had to save up, $500 working, minimum wage over two months in order to afford the $500 certification, and two days.
2:56
You would triple your earning capacity after two days.
Spending $500.
Now if you can triple your income from having a weekend for the rest of your life, do you think it's worth the investment probably?
And so the problem is that people think about the biggest investment as the stuff that they take their money and they put it into and I'm going to be over.
3:19
I'm going to beat right right now but I'm going to be really real.
I'm trying to give examples here to really bring this home.
Your ability to earn money to provide value to the marketplace and solve problems for other people.
Is how you will be able to make money.
So there's the value of the problem that you solve and what you charge for it.
3:35
The bigger that number is the more you can charge because that, that gap between their old problem, and the solution that value is the percentage that you can take and put in your pocket as something that you have now created in this.
And it could be a service, you could be products, it could be whatever.
The in the day, your earning capacity is going to be the thing that generates you wealth, okay?
3:56
Now, Do you want to be smart with your money and save it?
Absolutely, because that gives you way more that you can play with.
But when you're 20, even when you're 30 and in my belief, whatever age you are, I believe that you should take all of the excess money and this is me being really aggressive.
4:12
And I'm I'm comfortable but defending my position on this live as cheap as you can take, 100% of that excess money and invest it in education that increases your earning capacity.
Because what happens is when you take that money like that, Botany course right.
4:28
And you take 500 bucks and a weekend.
You triple for minimum wage. $25 an hour.
Okay $25 an hour times two thousand, two thousand dollars a year if you're now to 50,000 all your income.
Okay cool.
Now we're fifty thousand dollars a year if I can live on 20 because I'm 20 years old and I can live with buddies and we can eat ramen soup and whatever and I got 30 left over after taxes, 25, whatever I got 25,000 dollars left over. 25 Grand can buy you, a lot of Education.
4:56
All right.
So hear me out.
I would rather you or I would rather me or somebody who's 20 or somebody who's 30, take two thousand dollars a month, because that's what 25 Grand is.
Two thousand dollars a month and invested in courses and coaching and mentorships and workshops and seminars.
5:16
And you just say every month, I'm putting that to K.
Now you could put UK into one opportunities.
You're like dude I think Real Estate School.
Cool.
We're not doing real estate as my passive income.
We're doing real estate is I'm going to get into the real estate.
Game.
And I'm going to make it my active income.
And by the way, everybody who builds their wealth in real estate, is in real estate, and they are actively spending their time.
5:33
Real estate don't believe what they're saying.
Because they're like, dude, I did this deal and I made x amount of money.
It's like, yeah, but how many, what was the process of finding deals?
How many deals did you look?
At how many conversations did you have?
How many buildings did you walk?
How many different General Contractors?
Did you talk to to negotiate each of your fixed?
Oh, wait.
5:49
Oh yeah.
We had to Market to get, tenants.
How did you like it?
There is another.
Another stuff has to happen, right?
Point.
Is that just because people build wealth in that thing, doesn't mean that the People were building the most wealth aren't active in the game now.
Back to the point, let's say that you take that two thousand dollars a month and you do that for four years, okay?
6:06
And you spend two thousand dollars every month and you do it on spending on education that you think will make you money.
And I'm not saying do the four-year degree.
I think that is play if you want to, I don't necessarily agree with it anymore in the marketplace that currently exists.
If you want to be an entrepreneur.
And so if you took two thousand dollars a month for four years, and you measured yourself the same way.
6:23
Colleges ask you to measure yourself, which is that you spend $2000?
A month for four years which is what they ask you to do for a college degree and four years later.
I fucking guarantee you that you will be making more than people who have four year degrees.
Do honestly, you'll probably, you'll probably start making money by the end of the first year.
6:41
Right?
If you do, I'm telling you the amount of like copy writing courses and books, and programs, and mentorships, and even one-on-one coaching, like I think one-on-one coaching, is it a phenomenal way to learn a new skill if you're like, hey, I need to know how to buy media.
6:57
I need to know how to run an ad on Facebook or on YouTube.
Go pay, someone who runs ads or teaches people how to run ads.
The difference is, when you make that payment, you're seeing it as one class in your entrepreneurial degree, rather than this one, twelve thousand dollar investment has to make me Rich.
7:17
If you can make, that shift is like, this is my course, like, when you get your degree in college, you're not like, oh, I'm going to take one class in Spanish.
And then I'm going to be able to graduate and do whatever job I want.
No one thinks that way.
But for some reason, the think about that when it comes to entrepreneurial stuff, which is ridiculous.
7:36
And I'll tell you why they think that, it's because the people were selling, it feel like they have to promise that in order to get someone to buy and I get it, I understand both sides of it.
But if I'm talking to the students, I'm talking the entrepreneurs who are trying to increase their wealth.
The first step is save as much money as you can.
The second step is that you take the access between what you earn and what you need to live on and you.
7:55
It increasing your earning capacity and you do that over an extended time Horizon.
And if you do that what will happen is all of a sudden let's say after a year spending twenty five thousand dollars on like tutoring and coaching around specific things.
Now you're making eighty thousand dollars a year.
Well now we've got four thousand dollars a month that we can spend on coaching and mentorships and learnings and courses in one night.
8:17
And guess what happens, the more money you spend on it.
The faster it's going to happen for you because it makes complete sense to borrow money from your future self.
To acquire skills today, like, for example, that I gave earlier for the, for the person who's working at McDonald's and then goes to do the full body thing, it makes sense that she borrows $500 from her parents that day.
8:38
And doesn't wait two months to to save the 500 bucks because here's what happens.
She's she takes the lawn for 500, she buys the new the new skill set in two days and then she has two months - two days to go earn $500 with her new three times higher in Income capacity and she can pay the 500 off in a week.
9:00
And then now she netted seven weeks of Life at higher income and that trade is fundamentally, what you need to do as an entrepreneur?
And so one is you have to make that decision that you're not going to spend all your money on stupid stuff.
The second is that you are going to spend your money, not on the SP, but on the Essen me, Now that clip that shit is that you're going to spend it on you, right?
9:31
Because that thing is going to compound a hell of a lot faster than 10% a year, right?
Like you can stack skills.
It's so much faster in the thing is is that you can double triple 10x your earning capacity.
The people were the richest people in the world.
Don't make 2x 4X.
They make a thousand times more and it's hard to comprehend when you're like, what is a thousand times more Jeff Bezos made 40 million dollars an hour last Here it's a lot and it's and it's because you plant a different game.
9:55
He's playing with leverage.
And so we have to take the excess cash.
We have that we're treating our time for by time with it by buying the skill so that we can compress the time arises in the getting to where we want to go, right?
And so, instead of going for the SP, go for the SN me.
10:11
If you do that, I promise you'll beat the stock market every time.
You'll quickly, as you guys already know that, I don't run any ads on this and I don't sell anything.
And so, the only ask that I can ever have you guys that you help me, spread the words we cannot more entrepreneurs, make more money, feed their families, make better products and have better experiences for their employees and customers.
10:30
The only way we do that is if you can rate and review and share this podcast, so the single thing that I have to do is just leave review but they can 10 seconds or one type of the thumb to means the absolute world to me and more importantly, it may change the world for someone else.
So, if you're trying to figure out who is the trustworthy source of information, like, who should I go to who I can listen to, and learn from high things going to be credible.
10:53
One is easiest thing to do is look at the people who've been there, the longest to have the most reviews and honestly, you're the biggest and that may sound crazy because like a lot of times really big companies have older stuff, but they had fundamentals that are there.
And so I would say, the safest bet is to go for the thing that's been there, the longest because they have still universally shown that they provide value.
11:12
Right now will be the most Cutting Edge of the most amazing thing.
Maybe not but from a risk-adjusted basis, the likelihood that it sucks is low right now.
Some new hot kid might be coming out and have 10 people and want to help you out or something like that.
You might be really, really good but there's also really high chance that he's not really good, right?
11:28
And so it's a on a risk-adjusted basis.
I'd rather say like there's a 70% job that this is a good thing.
And so I'd rather take a seven, you know, then have the risk of getting a zero or a ten.
Right?
And so one is I go to the establish.
Go to the Coca-Cola.
Go to the Coca-Cola classic.
11:43
Keep watching videos like this.
People have nothing to sell you things like that.
The next one is that you have to shift your expectations around it and this is the biggest piece here is that you're not paying someone to think that they're going to be your savior.
They're not going to save you from your life.
They're not going to do everything for you and you have something to learn from everyone.
12:01
The worst courses that I have taken, I have learned what not to do.
I've learned how to do things better by seeing a negative example.
And so it's just like people who have parents who fight all the time and you're like, I fucking don't want that.
You can still learn from.
That it's still lessons.
And so a lot of people, you know, want to put their little, you know, sissy hat on and and be like, you know, like my dad wasn't the value that I thought I was just like, just don't get in that headspace.
12:26
Now, if you're the business owner, by all means, fix your shit.
But if you were the person who's going through it, you can always think, like, my belief for myself.
When I go through courses, mentorship masterminds, whatever it is.
I was seeing myself, like, I'm going to be the number one student here always, and the way that I'll do that is by out executed, I'll just do whatever they say.
12:45
And then I'll see what happens and I'll do whatever they say, I'll see what happens.
And so one of the one of the key points here is that you want to replicate before you iterate.
All right?
And so when someone teaches you, hey I've got this thing for buying YouTube ads.
I got this way to build.
Landing pages.
I got this way to do sales calls, whatever it is, write something that they're teaching.
13:02
Try and copy what they're doing.
First duplicate, replicate what they're doing before you iterate.
Before you say, I'm going to put my Alex sauce on, I'm above my Caleb sauce on it.
Before you do that, just make sure that you can duplicate what they're doing because then you earn the right to make the iterations.
If you can't get zero to one yet, you should be trying to get sexy because you don't even know how to make it work.
13:21
So, just copy it.
Even if it's not perfectly, your style copy it, first duplicate, replicate before you make the iterations.
And if you can make that switch at mentally and think I will learn from everyone.
I will be everyone's best student and I will copy what they're doing before I make it my own, then you will be on the right path to being a good student of the person that we just picked for where you're going to get your source of information.
13:44
The next piece is also like don't expect like I said anyone to be your savior, not know, one person's going to teach you everything right?
I'll do my best on this channel teaching stuff, I know.
But if you come in with the expectation that this person is going to teach me everything, I know.
I don't think that's wise.
I think he said like this if you see it as a bridge that has many So on it, you have to lay all the bricks and here's the bad part, is that, let's say you've got 30 bricks on this bridge to make your first dollar.
14:07
The first of all, I has to walk across the bridge when you're 28 breaks in, you might not have made the brick the first, the first dollar yet, but you're 90% of the way there.
And so, you have to start measuring progress in terms of skills before you can measure it in terms of dollars.
And so that's where a lot of people get disheartened is that they will start building new Bridges and get to three bricks and then they'll start building a new bridge, 23 breaks, and they have lots of half built Bridges.
14:31
And they never make it all the way across and see if you can shift your perspective in terms of like I'm going to acquire these skills which is going to build the bridge to get me from where I am to, where I want to go.
Then when you when you learn a new skill like copywriting, you can say, okay.
Well now I know how to do this part and if you can think about your education in terms of a sequence or a pipeline, which is what I would encourage you to do, you have to think from the top down which is like, if you want to make money you got to sell stuff, right?
14:54
Which means you got to find people to sell to before that.
You got to have something to sell so it's like, alright, the first thing to do have an offer.
So we have the book.
Everybody offers figure out the thing you want to sell after, you got the thing, you're going to sell, then you figure out how to get people to find out about it.
You advertise it, make it known to the public, lots of ways to do that.
15:11
And if you don't know how, and that's what you have to solve for, once you make a note in public, you're gonna have people raise your hand say, hey, I'm kinda interested.
And at that point, you're going to have to figure out a way to sell them.
And so then that's where you'd start going through sales courses and things like that.
And then after you saw them like, oh crap, I don't know how to fulfill and then you go through things that go towards product and customer service customer success etcetera.
15:29
And so when you do this, think about it like a Pipeline.
The first thing you have to do is know what you're going to sell.
The second you have to do is get people to know about it.
And so, if you don't know how to get people to know about it, then that's where you focus.
And so, if you're on that bridge, you look at the brick and the speed with, which people are able to Traverse or cross.
That bridge is how well, they identify, which break is missing and where they put their attention.
15:49
Because this, what happens, a lot of times someone likes copywriting, they start writing copy and then they buy more copywriting stuff.
There's nothing wrong with that.
If you want to like be a copywriter, that's cool.
But if you want to be a business owner, You kind of need to be a jack of all trades, master of none, right?
16:05
And so you want to be good enough to get yourself across the bridge and to recognize what's good and what's bad.
You don't necessarily need to be a 10 out of 10.
On all of them.
Be need to be good enough to get it to work.
So whether you are a business owner or you're an employee, you are the owner of you and you have customers.
16:22
If you're an employer, customer is your boss in the business.
And to be fair, if you're a business owner, you have to customers, you have the customers who pay you and the customers you pay.
So you have the customers you got to treat and it's the same thing.
You have to have acquisition channels for recruiting Talent, just like you have acquisition channels for recruiting customers, right?
16:39
In the process is the same application generation lead generation application.
Nurtured leave nurture sales versus interviews, onboarding for both Ascension and retention for both rights.
The same thing, it's just parallel things, so you have to customers.
And so to the same degree, if you were an employee, your customer is going to be your boss in the company overall.
16:58
And so the only difference Will be that your sphere of problems that you're solving will be more narrow, but what will allow you to do is you can go deeper and so you can get, let's say you're, let's say your videographer or you like video stuff.
Well, you got to learn how to I would say like you want to learn all the ancillary stuff around it, because what do you think happens when you move up in an organization, you actually get broader.
17:19
So think about this when you're an employee, what happens is a business is going to limit the amount of stuff you have to focus on so that you can focus on that one piece and companies are Comprised of individual contributors who then get managed by people who are a little bit broader and more General managed by.
17:36
People are a little bit broader, more General and typically those people have multiple very deep understandings of those things.
And so let's say you're that videographer.
So now you're shooting video.
Well the next thing is that you probably want to understand editing.
Okay, cool.
Well that's an adjacent skill and it's a skill stacks and you become far more valuable if you can do both things than one individually.
17:57
So think about this.
Skills, stack exponentially and so imagine this human being, you got a video skill.
Now you got an editing skill now, you understand social media.
Now you understand messaging and copywriting and branding.
18:15
Whoo.
Wait, now we understand management and operations and Leadership, see how that person starts to expand.
You can imagine how their pay and their compensation is going to dramatically increase because now you are a CMO Right.
And on top of that, we got to say, like, do you understand how to buy media, do you understand how to optimize and convert traffic and so it started with a videographer ends up becoming a marketer.
18:40
And then from there, that person says huh.
I wonder if I can start learning about this product stuff.
I wonder if I can start learning about customer success.
Oh, you know what?
There's a lot of parallels between that in marketing, right?
And you start broadening your Horizon and going deep in these other silos in all of a sudden you're an entrepreneur.
18:56
And so like the end of the day is like you start narrow you go.
And then you start stacking the skills on top of each other and then that's where you'll get the disproportion return because each of the skills, multiply the others sum is greater than the whole.
And just like you on the reason.
He's got so many big companies.
He's because he's an expert at so many different things that he can draw cross.
19:13
Departmentally into his head, to create new ideas and new Innovations.
And you can also flip this advice.
If you're the person who's selling education and things like that, is that you want to go to the person who's providing the most value for free.
All right?
And so it's the easiest Way for you to decrease your risk of purchase.
19:31
So think about this if someone you follow someone's it's your grandfather YouTube, you follow their whatever right and you see the stuff they put on your like, dude, this is really good.
Like this is a lot of new information that I didn't know and it's like very tactical and I understand like I see what they're doing and how this works, how I can apply it.
19:47
Then a you already know that you like the person be you already know that you're getting value from the person from the content they have.
And so the likelihood that the thing that they have that Spade is going to be worse than that is low, you know?
They're probably a bit more attention to that, but even if they didn't just making the financial investment, I guarantee you'll make you consume all the free content and probably still benefit you.
20:06
And so, the easiest thing to do is follow lots of people in a particular space follow their content.
See the one that you jive with the most, you like their teaching style.
And you think the stuff that they have is valuable.
And the cool thing is, and this is also flipping the table.
If you're the guy who's like, oh, there's all these competitors, people have different values, they have different Vibes, they have different, psychographics, they appeal to, and so you might appeal, Even if you're in real estate right?
20:30
You might appeal to a different demo or your style of Rosetta you might like wholesaling versus doing like multi-tenant apartment buildings or you might like, you know, the Airbnb side a bit versus the, you know, whatever rental Arbitrage, it doesn't matter.
The point is, is that like there's different flavors and all of these spaces and find the flavor that you like the most, the easiest thing to do is consume the content.
20:49
But I would, if I, if it were me, I would say, give yourself seven days, like, you don't need to file this stuff for forever to like, belabor the decision because, you know, what's really?
We even cooler than buying one person's, buy them all, and then you'll know what everyone knows.
And then guess what happens?
21:05
You become just as good or better.








Company0:00
Most nation very proud to bring you part 2 of the passion.
If you podcast I do with Omar elat are in this podcast, talk about three main things.
One is the importance of picking the right Niche for your opportunity.
You're pursuing second.
The decision-making framework that I use when I'm confronted with hard choices and business which happen every single day and that you can use for your business and 3 the value of volume repetition in skill development and how we have to break the narrative that Society gives us about instant and immediate gratification just because you do the work doesn't mean you deserve the result.
0:30
I hope you guys enjoy it as much as I enjoyed.
Making it for you.
So Jeff, Bezos says, if you have a 10% chance of 100 times payout, just take that bet every time a hundred times payoff for 110 back to make it a more realistic example.
What if you had a hundred dollars in the minimum bet was 25.
0:48
So you only have two roles but the risk adjusted return is there, but you only have two roles.
Welcome to the game.
Where we talk about it, get more customers how to make more per customer and how to keep them longer in the many failures and lessons.
We have learned along the way.
I hope you enjoy and subscribe.
What were the delivery Those are, how are you packaging it?
1:05
And the reason I ask is because a lot of entrepreneurs out there, they may have this expertise or be building up to it, and they have a hard time figuring out how to package it.
Right?
You can't sell it, you know, package.
So did you kind of audition different models?
I'm sure over time you have, but initially that first round, how did you package?
1:22
It was an eight week program, was it a ghost public structures?
12 weeks of the beginning?
And then after I sold a hundred, I made a 16-week program and it's been 16 weeks since then 16 weeks has worked out.
Well, that was the program.
I mean, I think the big difference between, you know, most of the things that exist and what we did and what made you more special was the average client made thirty thousand dollars in the first three days.
1:44
I will Pete that slowly for everyone was this thing.
Might have a rich client.
So if I sell a hundred people, the average person makes thirty thousand dollars in their first 30 days.
So when people are like, I want to replicate what Tim what did like well then replicate the results that we created and then maybe we'll be able to replicate the success but everyone thinks that like everyone thinks it's the funnel.
2:05
It's a three step 10, everything.
Like it's not that, you know, me like you can look at it online right now.
Like you're not going to copy the business because the funnel, right?
It's because of the delivery is because the product and because I was so sick and I hated the guru space and all that stuff.
I was committed to not being a gym Guru.
2:20
Ha right?
I was so committed to it.
That I ended up becoming probably the biggest one, the biggest one ever I know for everything.
Questions on that real quick.
I heard dannhenry talked about the fact that he had a conversation with you one time.
2:38
And you know in the online space, people talk about robots, right?
Return on ad, spend for ads and people are impressed when they get like a 3 x row as five extract.
And he was saying that you had like a 25 or 27 x rho as and you were obliterating it and he was like, whoa, dude what are you doing, right?
2:54
Because all these, you know, internet marketers.
So intricate about all these things and you're like, oh my cheapest product is like, 25k or like whatever, whatever the thing was.
How important do you think that is?
Because a lot of people could work their ass off at a model, which is the model has a, has a sort of limit to it.
3:11
How important do you think the position of a model is?
And how much time should entrepreneurs really put into that part of it.
So that part of it is the thing that I invested.
I'm not the best part, girl.
I will be very candid about that.
I didn't do email follow up until three years ago, we'd already doing 50 million or 60 million in Revenue.
3:29
Before I open my eyes, I saw my first name, everyone steps.
Over dollars to pick up pennies Most people are just not like everyone here is, everyone is listening has the same time, right?
But we only have limited amounts of focus and limited amounts of JuJu that we can we can put towards things and so it's just like what handful of few things.
3:48
Will make the absolute biggest difference.
And price is obviously the biggest factor in that but the, the subset of price is the value that you can provide by.
Like, if you sell something that's expensive, that's not worth it.
You run out of space very quickly because people do talk and you do get a better.
4:03
Reputation correctly.
We're in a niche.
Like this is the one thing that everyone I feel like that is lost on the on the community of the internet World, which is like every other person is done close to the volume that we have is mass Market business opportunity.
Right?
Every one of them, we're the only ones in a niche and we are 50 times.
4:21
You know what I mean?
Bigger than anyone, who's in one tiny little sliver of a niche, right?
And it's because I actually ran gyms and I actually made money running gyms and the That we have make money using our systems.
And so the average gym that works with us adds two hundred plus thousand a year to their top line revenue.
4:39
They triple their profit, they cut their turn by 30%, they increase their prices by $38 a month, which, you know, equates to the tripling and profit that they get, and they do that by providing more value to their customers.
Right?
I mean, sure we have better Sales Systems and better Marketing Systems, but we also have really good retention systems that they get people better results in a better experience at the facility, which is why they stay longer and they pay more.
5:02
So it all starts with at the bottom and then it works its way backwards.
So yes, the lifetime return on ad spend and I have is 36 to more, that's lifetime, holy shit.
And that leads to my second question to.
And that is how important do you think the niche is when it comes to the opportunity.
Because a lot of people are, you know, working hard but that Niche has a limit to scale and I know you kind of mentioned it.
5:22
You know, people say that the, the, you know, biggest niches are the things like, you know, real estate fit in it.
The traditional things that were here. 50 years ago, will be here in 50 years and a lot of the kind of digital Marketing space, as you know, can get super saturated with a lot of people saying the same things and people misleading one another in your opinion, how important do you think it is for people to really appropriate their goals to the niche there in and not get lost in a delusion of chasing?
5:46
Something that just may not be realistic than a niche of people around them are doing it and, you know, kind of you get what I'm saying?
There's a lot of people stuck in that conundrum.
I know I was there too.
So what advice do you have for people when it comes to evaluating the niche, their inverses, the financial opportunity through the Kuil I was having a covered for good conversation.
6:05
Electric oven Hutto about this and we both agree that it comes down to there's two types of businesses that I would say.
And I'm expressly saying this to be like marketing Community because I think it's a subset of your audience, right?
Is you have traffic businesses and you have service businesses.
All right, traffic businesses are marketing.
6:22
Arbitrage, your simply for buying eyeballs for less than it cost you to sell a thing, a widget of course, whatever?
Right.
And you go after a big ocean And you try and just you just have an ocean and you just try and make two to one.
Three, two, one, and that's, and that's the game and you never run out of customers, but you also usually don't make it on a problem, right?
6:43
I mean, if I know the numbers of the guys that, you know, that you that everyone knows because they want to make and, you know, they're spending 500,000 more than ads.
They make many with interim mean, like my total advertising from this last month has probably 50,000 and we we pulled 1880 a week is what I just added up for your before our call.
7:03
So we do 880,000 a week and we have not a lot of advertising budget.
Actually might be more than I think.
She, I think if I think for now though it's less than 100,000 won.
All right, you know, advertising we spend which is wildly less than everyone else, and it's because we are service business, which is the second category of business which is our goal, is to penetrate a market and take as much market share as we can and keep those clients, right?
7:28
And then ultimately make it much more difficult for any competitors.
Are you guys, right?
So I can build some Enduring value.
As Enterprise Value, traffic businesses do not have Enterprise Value, they are Arbitrage plays for cash flow, all they're right.
They're not, they do not have intrinsic value because the moment the traffic stops.
7:45
So does the money right in a service business or a business that has Enterprise Value.
The business should be able to grow independent of your ads, to turn off for a day.
You know what I mean?
Yeah, and so that's that's kind of the the other, you know, kind of component.
So does the niche matter?
Yes, the reality is most people just not that good.
8:03
Good.
And so they think it's the niche, but it's really themselves.
And so whether you're in Fitness or like doesn't matter any of the dishes, we just talked about.
There is a billion-dollar it, there's a billion-dollar player in every Niche here in chiropractors.
8:18
There's a billion dollar company that sells the chiropractor's.
There's a billion dollar company that sells Fitness, tons of Botox myself in this.
As a matter of fact, there are tons of billion-dollar real estate things.
So if you're like real estate's, a bad niche, you're just not good at and everything seems bad when you are ignorant because you just don't know, you don't know how to fly.
8:40
And so most people are trying to forego the four years were you Rocky cutscene and put in all this volume and you learn Mastery of a skill like Russell, which I think about her off at parties is probably familiar with he pitched for years and sucked.
You mean he was building funnels for a decade before clickfunnels and so everyone sees the clickfunnels thing and sees the explosive growth but they Is that people will sharpen their sword doing something repetitive.
9:06
That is not a new opportunity, and then that opportunity will come knocking.
And they will take that skill set and apply it when it is there, when it is there, go and the only way that they're able to have that explosive growth is because they are ready and most people are just not ready.
They think it's the opportunity but you have to have the prep and the prep comes from doing the work.
9:24
Yeah.
And you talk about that.
I know you said you did almost like 4,000 sales calls some of your businesses, you mentioned and you guys do and just under a million A week 80 or so that those are usually in the fitness space.
And it's because it's not an industry that you're, you know, you've got the fitness space, the other half.
9:41
So I have the right now, I have four companies for acquiring two more and that's kind of where I'm at now is I'm looking for five million dollar-plus businesses that I can take 220, you know what I mean?
And just do that.
But we have, we have a business in the photography Niche, we have a software business, we have the supplement business, which is You know, adjacent to Jim launched a stage Labs.
10:06
So, you know, the prestige Labs was kind of it's not vertical integration but it's it's a it was just a huge Revenue stream that I do in parallel to existing customers.
Yeah.
Makes sense.
Now, when it comes to you like dealing with some of the business challenges, you have day to day, I'm sure, you know, new levels, new Devils.
10:25
What what's your, what's your mental reference, or what's your game plan?
When you're stuck with decisions that you don't have Frameworks or systems for which I'm sure happens all the freaking time, right?
As you scale.
What's your kind of Mo?
Do you just kind of come up with strategies?
You try them and then you see if it works.
Adjust accordingly.
10:41
Do you kind of zoom out?
You have coaches?
A kind of help you what's your what's out your moseys?
Go to when he's stuck in business, trying to get to the next level, it's a really good question.
It's just why I take.
And there's probably people much smarter than me, but the decisions that are make our that are huge decisions.
10:57
Are fewer and fewer hearing, because the bigger the ship gets the rarer you're pivoting.
The The show, right?
If you have a dingy through your switching directions, every way, right, right?
You're on the Titanic.
I'm not saying where the Titanic, but, you know, or whatever.
Some huge boat rides gonna get some negative connotations.
11:14
But if you're on some big Carnival Cruise Ship, they're not pivoting very much.
You know, I mean, so if you make a call, it's going to take time to move the boat and you better be right.
And most times it needs to happen, much more slowly than you think it does or most times not at all.
So, most people are concentrating, their existing heavy existential crises based on perceived pressures that they I've invented for themselves, right?
11:34
Yeah.
And so right now, you know the level that I'm trying to get to is a hundred million dollars a year and so that's the you know, it's kind of the next the next rung and I believe I know what I need to do to get there and so now it's simply doing it and it may take time and it will take time.
But I think I'm aware of what needs to happen and the way that I went about finding that information was talking to people who have done it multiple times and asking them, what do you see that?
11:59
I don't see.
And that's the.
And this is something that I have always done is I will massively overpay for people's time, one-on-one, okay?
For Grant Cardone like 30,000 for the hour.
So every single major scale that I've ever required, every major decision that I've needed to make.
12:16
I just say, what would it take for you to get on the phone with me?
Just tell me the number and I'll see if I can figure it out.
And just, if I mean, in every time, I mean, not with the grant one but like, earlier on a lot of those times were they were steep prices for me, but I paid them because I knew that my level of income was not going to be My life.
12:33
So if it was so the same example, right?
I paid 10 and I was happy to do it because I just knew that if I could get 20 years of experience in in six months, why would I not do that?
And, you know, when I paid I think Facebook marketing guy paid him $750, an hour for one-on-one coaching and and I was like to just teach me Facebook ads.
12:54
He was like, okay, so he taught me Facebook ads.
And so that's how I learned Facebook ads and then cheaper, like, if you get two hours with him for 1,500 bucks, that's way cheaper.
Than hiring an agency for twenty, five hundred a month that will throw you to the thing or more and you get lost and those the bottom line.
Shit.
Yeah.
13:10
And I'll tell you that conversation using the Internet space.
She's like, I don't sell my time and I was like, it's America.
Everyone sells their time and I was like, just tell me what house.
If you don't sell your time for a price that you're not saying yes Joseph.
So what would you say?
And so he said, 750 hours, I was like done cool, not cool, but I didn't.
13:26
I mean that was stupid.
That was super, super me.
You know what I mean?
So, I was like, I was showing up on every call, like present.
Yeah.
Two cups of coffee, ready to absorb whatever he had.
Yeah, thing is, is I didn't ask him how to learn how to run Facebook ads, I asked him, how would you run Facebook?
As for my business, I will run them, then you tell me what decisions you'd be making.
13:45
What do I turn off and why?
So I can understand the thought process.
So once I understood that then I got, you know I mean it's I think it's going to eight calls so cost me six grand or whatever it was to learn Facebook ads.
I didn't buy course I just paid the guy, right?
It was more than a course but it also took me less time.
14:02
Hmm.
It took me less time if I'd gone through a course people make 60 our course 60 hours.
You know what I mean?
Because people know how to focus and make it courses.
But like this guy was able to solve my specific problem was like I just need glocal Legion for Jim.
What do I need to do?
And he showed that was it.
14:19
Real quick guys.
If you can think about how you found this podcast, somebody probably tweeted it told you about it.
Should it on Instagram or something like that?
The only way this grows is through word of mouth and so I don't run ads, I don't do sponsorships, I don't sell anything.
I only ask is that you continue to pay it forward to whoever showed you or however you found out about this podcast that you do the exact same thing.
14:38
So if it was a review if it was a post, if you do that would mean the world to me and you throw some good karma out there for another entrepreneur.
The one thing I love about your stuff even when I see your ads, you know, because you have some of the most creative ads I've seen online, half of it is like, you don't give a shit to play in the confines of everybody else but you obviously give a shit for them to do well, and, and you do that, like, I can tell there's a lot of like, I think you had an ad.
15:05
The other day was like there's two things, I love this and like Jorts.
Yeah you know whatever, whatever it was.
Obviously I'm sure you have a team helping you with that stuff.
But what's your general mindset or is, are you at a stage?
Now kind of where you have the capital to kind of experiment a little bit, you know?
And so you're kind of a little bit more risky.
15:21
What's your what's your approach with that just help entrepreneurs out?
There might be curious.
Yeah, so this is the single greatest piece of advice.
I can give you if you want to learn how to work it better take a percentage of your advertising spend or percentage of your income.
If you're still working a job and say, this is what I'm willing to spend and I'm willing to C, 0 return, because I'm spending this on education, because there is no advertising School, the advertising school is you spending money.
15:44
And so if you figure all right, Spend five hundred dollars a month for a year.
It's a six thousand dollar school, but I'm actually going to learn, then you have to spend it because if you don't spend it right, then you're not learning.
And if you do spend it, then you're going to learn how to do it because you're not going to try and waste your money.
16:00
But you're going to give yourself mental permission to do so and that percentage can change over time.
But roughly, you know, for me if temper I mean I've gotten over this.
Now I spend money whenever you know what I mean, but as I was raising up the idea that I could spend 10% on stuff that I like mentally did not hold myself accountable to Allowed me to try new things.
16:18
And honestly most the time, the crazy ideas don't work, but every once in a while, something really cool does work.
And then it's like, whoa, that was awesome.
And he learned some skills and then you just, you just repeat that over time.
Do you think Alex that when it comes to, you know, like I know a lot of the skill and discipline you talked about the fact that a lot of people might see you as 31, you might be young so they might be, you know, 28 or 30 or whatever.
16:41
And so they're in your one or two and I'll shit.
How's he doing it right?
Not knowing that there's Huge discrepancy of time, and effort under the bar, or time under the bar as you say, like, in the gym but like, can you just, you know, give them maybe a quick, like one or two minutes of insight on that on the importance of really putting in the work?
16:58
I know it's a message all the time, but maybe it's new to the audience here.
Just Hornet is to like not expect your first sales call to be the same results of somebody else's thousand sales call.
You know, that kind of thing.
Everyone sabotage themselves simply based on expectations, I mean that's it like what it comes down to his people?
17:16
Or people sabotage themselves because they think they should, they think that they should be more successful than they are independent of a reality, a realistic assessment of what they have done.
And so they take to sales calls and say I didn't close anyone.
Either I suck at sales or this isn't for me.
17:33
If someone else were to tell you they took to they like they spent two hours quote and they haven't even read a book on sales.
Him do anything, right, studying sales and said they were good.
Why would you expect them to be or if I used a different example, if someone spent two hours, studying Spanish, man, speaks Finish, would you be surprised by that?
17:49
Would you feel like it was reasonable for them to expect that they would be proficient in Spanish or so right and so for some reason we apply these unrealistic expectations simply because we see someone who's at the same age as us.
And so it came of the analogy that I really like, which is the story of the dice.
18:05
So let's say you and a friend are both given a die, right?
Many sided die.
And so let's say one of you has a 20-sided, die, and the other one of you has a 200 sided die on your die only once.
One side is green.
The other sides are read both of you.
The catch is no knows how many sides each person has the rules of the game are simple.
18:26
If you roll and you hit red, you can pick up and you can roll.
Again.
If you hit green, you make a sale and every time you roll a green, the the dye that you has shrinks the side, which means that your probability increases with the next roll.
So you start playing the game and you realize that there's been people who've been playing this game since time began.
18:46
When people have been playing this game for 30 years, people playing this game for 10 years but you don't know how long anyone's been playing.
All you see is the size of their doc, but you don't know if they started at 5,000, you don't know what they started at three.
The size of the die is related to your natural Talent, your natural proclivities.
19:04
The things that you're born with, right?
The experiences that you had the got you that point.
But what action do you take a roll?
There's nothing else to do you roll?
There's no other actual action and the only thing that Has to happen.
Is whether or not you stop rolling.
That's it.
19:20
The success is simply predicated on your ability to hit red pickup, the die, and roll again.
But you looking at everyone else to size of die.
You don't know how long they played and you also don't know their natural Talent so they could have been smaller because they've been playing a long time or could have been smaller because they have natural talent.
But the thing is is you and your friend went in As The Story Goes to conclude it, your friend rolls a couple of times and he quits and he sees you had green and then it gets more and more frustrated.
19:46
Every time you hit green, even though his role is completely independent from yours, and he doesn't know that he actually has a 20-sided, die.
And you had the 200 side should do, so roll the dice.
Yeah, there's only one action, you roll the dice.
So here's here's an interesting one for, it's a risk-adjusted return.
20:02
It's a concept, I like a lot.
So just ways of says, if you have a 10% chance of a hundred times pay, Out to take that bet every time you go to a casino 100 times payout for one intend bet.
I wouldn't you bet ten times and you're going to head on you know you're going to participate hit 100 at one point and be worth what if to make it a more realistic example.
20:23
What if you had a hundred dollars in the minimum bet was 25.
Now, do you take the BET?
What if the Mets 50?
So you only have two roles but the risk adjusted return is there but you only have to do roles.
What do you do?
That is the reality for most people right now.
They know that if they play long enough they will eventually win our hopefully, they believe that, right?
20:44
But they only have a certain amount of place in them and so that's why it's my belief that you just take a percentage, not an absolute amount, take a percentage of your income and say, this is what I'm willing to spend.
This is what I'm willing to roll on learning the skills.
Because right now, there is no University for acquisition this.
21:01
What I'm hoping to build, you'll see it's one of my projects in a little side but there's no, there's no school for this.
And so the school that everyone has to go through.
Something that no one's willing to do which is you have to risk and if you don't like risking an entrepreneurship is probably not for you, you have to be comfortable within certain do it over sustained enough period of time to get, you know, to bet to hit on those Vents.
21:20
And I think that that might be the a good point to, to wrap to bring everything around while.
So, the single greatest thing that I can hopefully, convey to the audience that has been given me, the greatest peace of mind.
The joy that you referenced earlier is looking at people who are billionaires, not really nurse, and listen to how they talk and how they think.
21:37
And And there's plenty of universal things, they have in common, but one of the ones that I noticed that was most significant for me, was the extension of the time Horizon, which is if I extend my goal, let's say it's, let's say it's make a million dollars, you, and let's say, I give myself a decade to hit that, I would probably come up with a very different plan that if I wanted to be a millionaire 90 days.
22:00
And of course, millionaire versus millionaire million dollars in Revenue completely different but like let's just leave that aside for a second, right?
But the plan that I would set for it.
Cade would probably be very reasonable.
And the likelihood that I would achieve, it would be very hot and even more over.
22:16
I would probably achieve it before the decade was over.
Probably much sooner simply because of the shift in my perspective and because I wouldn't put this undue pressure on myself and not jump from opportunity to opportunity because this isn't happening quote fast enough.
And what ends up happening is when people are starting out there looking for Arbitrage opportunities, they're looking for something that's quick money.
22:36
But the thing is, there are so many ways to make reliable money.
And if you can go in those things in it, Goes from get rich quick to get rich for sure, and if it were up to me at, I'd always rather played a lot.
And so that that's been the biggest gift that I've had.
And if you can extend your time Horizon, the question isn't whether someone gets rich, but if they stay Rich, right?
22:55
It's not, whether they make one a book, whether they keep money, they keep making money.
So, if someone says that, you know, skyrocketed to a million-dollar Runner, who, what are you doing next year, year after that in Europe that are you growing?
Because I would much rather have something that I know gross 20% in here Indefinitely then something that grows by 3x and then tanks by 50% and it goes up by, you know what I mean?
23:13
Like a wildness that tends to accompany internet marketing compared to True business, the last question I have Alex.
Do you think that most people and that was super profound us going to definitely be a highlight clip on the ground will send you.
Do you think that the ultimate in the online space, at least you can get the ultimate thing to sell is something that helps people and it's earned Text make money because other products can help you get fit or help you do.
23:40
So there's a sort of limited scale in that.
But you would you say, at least in a general sense that helping people make money is, there's the most as long as you have the experience, credibility and results.
That that is the most longevity and sustainable type of training type of business internet marketing space or not necessarily at all.
23:58
I mean, I think, even though the question had some limiting statements in it, You see, always has more skill of me to be so helping people get fit.
There's 300 million Americans, and half of them are overweight or even if not overweight have them want to be better more fit than they are.
24:14
So you know, if I'm selling to gym owners, I got 40,000 Apprentice away loss, I got 150 million, right?
So your ticket may be lower but your volume is so much higher.
Yeah I mean we say that and it's like well there's only a certain limit.
It's like, is there a limit on Weight Watchers?
Is there a limit on Jenny Craig?
Is there a limit on Beachbody?
24:30
Is their weaker limit on P90x, which is subsidiaries.
He is there a limit on verbal lives or women advice Alice.
It's a little bit like I keep going, you know, I mean like all of these Fitness related companies so no, I don't think just on the premise that question.
No, I don't think that I do think that it's easy to fool people and make money much easier because if we're being real, the vast majority of people don't have the experience that they're claiming they do because they are quote expert except they never have done it or they did it one time.
24:58
I mean literally I saw a guy who did ten thousand dollars a month in an agency and then start selling how to sell, how did you tell those on?
In an agency, literally, the next month after only being in an agency for 90 days and I was like 10, 10 grand a month.
Like, that's not like, what are we like, what you don't?
25:15
I mean like, what are we?
What are we doing?
You know what I mean?
And so make money is always have higher ticket.
The reason where people will make money in the inexperience internet, marketers face it because it takes less operational drag to create more Revenue with a higher ticket, because if you sell 100 clients at 10K, it's a million dollars.
25:32
It's much more difficult to make a million dollars and finish.
That being said, if you are operationally sound, you have good products and you have good marketing, then you can also sell 10,000 people on your Fitness thing, right?
But it just takes more operations go and most people need a parking space are not operators and so they are always trying to go towards the Arbitrage traffic play, which is how can I buy our balls for less than the thing that I'm selling?
25:55
Because they have no back in, they have no delivery, they have no operations.
They don't have the infrastructure that came from culture, they can't recruit people who can't manage, they can they can't build teams that kept a process.
They Do any of those things, right?
And so they just do the thing that they have in to somebody as a hammer.
The only skill they have is marketing, then they just try and find the quickest easiest money, right?
26:11
But I don't think that B2B is the most longevity the way that most people practice it because they just sell a unique mechanism.
They sell a silly quick arm play, Arbitrage pie, right?
So they figured out that messenger or whatever, they figured out that group so the way it is but the thing is, is groups will disappear just like Facebook news feed ads for localized has taken, you know, a big tanking, right?
26:31
And there's there's always going to be a thing.
NG that's not a business.
It's based on an Arbitrage opportunity, which means it'll disappear in here, right?
Whereas, if you have a, a process like a Consulting process, that can improve any business, then that stands the test of time, if you can answer the question, will this be here in 20 years, right?
26:48
Well, the thing that I'm selling See's Candy, Warren Buffett going to be here in 20 years like that stuff that can last, you know, Fitness, for example, even people need to eat less and move more.
If you have a very good service delivery behind that you can Very, very well and you can continue to do so for a very long time, because that's not going to change, human bodies have changed, right?
27:08
And so it's just more difficult because it requires skills that most people in the audience that we are listening to right now do not have.
And most of them do not invest in those skills, which is used candidly, what separates the guys who are doing the, most of the guys are doing with it, put in the work, and they roll the dice.
27:26
Thanks so much for being on the show today, Alex and where can people find you?

I got a DM the other day about somebody who's like yeah I mean it's easy for you to build this brand because you know you already have this big audience and I was like, dude just start and he was discouraged by the fact that he had no following.
1:09
You had no audience etcetera.
Now, obviously the first rules apply which is like, do cool shit, talk about the cool shit you did, which is 99% of people who are watching this, do more crochet and then you'll have cool shit to talk about rather than regurgitating.
Other people stuff.
But for everyone who sees the overnight success, right?
Everyone's like, oh man, the most Contents all over the place.
1:26
And I'm just saying is I see the concepts and if you're new to the channel, then I've heard this and maybe you don't feel that way because you're new to the channel.
So welcome, but what I want you to do, is go to my podcast.
And look at the time stamp on my first episode this. 2017, we're halfway through 2022.
1:42
Right now, five and a half.
Six years ago was when I started first, making my first long for more piece of content.
And here's what's crazy about this.
It just now hit the top ten, six years later and in that six year period. .
I did not miss.
Every week, one, two, three podcasts for six years and so people are making podcasts and thinking in 90 days, they're somehow going to blow up.
2:08
When the reality is that, you're finding your voice for the first year.
You're figuring out what way you communicate, your learning, how to teach your learning, how to entertain your learning, how to present, your learning, how to speak and learning about and you're also learning about the stuff that you're learning.
Meantime, right?
Like in that period of time, I might not have had as much stuff that was as cool in the beginning, that apply to as many people because the first The episodes is just me talking about how to run a gym better, right?
2:31
But right around 150, I start to talk about Marketing in general because that's what I was into at the time and then I start talking about sales and I start talking about business in general and Ma and things as as they've evolved over time and so the subject matter as well as my skill and delivering it both improved over that period of time and now the podcast is top ten on entrepreneurship and very high ranked in business.
2:51
And so and with next two names that I looked up to my whole career.
I'm like holy cow, Mike Weir.
Wait, Just went about this guy that I've been looking up to my whole life.
And so the thing is it's like it doesn't take 90 days, it takes years and if you can think it decades instead of days, you'll be so much further.
3:08
When the decade comes, then the people thought days the entire ten years.
Like think about that if you thinking days the time is going to pass, no matter what.
But if you can think in decades, when you make your goals, when that decade does pass, it'll show that you were thinking that way.
Now I want to tell you a quick story.
3:25
So there was a guy who started at the first gym with me.
Same day, alright, and we've been friends since then, and I started my gym and then he started his gym and he started change him.
So we went and parallel, all right?
And he ended up selling those gyms and he wanted to go online and he was like, dude, I need to build like a brand.
3:43
He's like, what should I do?
I was like, dude, you just need to start posting you know, short form stuff start like just, you know, making stuff that's valuable and he posted every day for six months and then one video took off and then in the next video took off and the next video took off and then of all of a sudden now he's making a hundred thousand dollars a month from the content that he was making.
4:07
And it and this mind, this is a compressed timeline.
He did it in six months.
Some people can't, you know, like it sometimes takes longer mind you, he'd already been doing business for nine years, alright?
Like, remember nine years and then all of a sudden it took off and you.
And he messaged me is like, dude, I'm so like I'm super grateful that that you told me to do that.
4:24
And I told him he was, he was getting frustrated and I was like, dude, commit to the action as He makes the action, the goal right?
Not the outcome of go make the action, the goal, if the action is, did I make the post?
Did I make the reach out to every day?
Then you're a success.
You check both boxes and so he did the post and he did the reach out and what ended up happening is that earlier on he would have videos that would start taking off Houston Who start doing reach out to start making sales and then you'd make some money and then you would slow down and then all of a sudden you get in scarcity mode once.
4:53
He was like, oh shoot, there's no money coming in, there's no money coming in and then you start making content start doing Reach out again and you make money again and he's like dude how do I break the cycle?
And what we did was we shifted, what he was focusing on because you're focusing on the sales use making is focusing on the money you as making rather than focusing on the process.
And so I said like the person you are the character you aspire to have is we built on the activities that you commit to and so I was like you are not successful in my eyes because whenever you see some outcome you stop the activities which means you don't have the trait of consistency.
5:25
That's like the reason you want where you want to be is because you can't do things.
Italy.
And so most people can't do one thing over and over again.
You need to be able to do the doing without seeing the result of you're doing.
And you have to keep doing it.
And if you can keep doing things independent, and this is both ways.
5:42
If it goes really well, you keep doing the thing that got you there.
And if it's not going well comma yet, you keep doing the thing so that you get good enough that one day, it will.
And that's the shift that most people don't make.
And I think that's why most people just stay for is that they do a little bit of the right stuff.
5:58
Tough and either it works.
And they stop or it doesn't work yet.
And either way, they stop doing when the reality is that if you can commit to the actions, in the behaviors, in the traits that you will grow through doing then at the end of this process, a decade later, you will be the type of person who can do something for a long period of time and wait and I promise you that if you have that trait money will never be a constraint in your life.
6:19
Hey guys, love that.
You're listening to the podcast.
If you ever want to have the video version of this which usually has more effects, more visuals, more graphs, you don't draw.
Nowt stuff, sometimes it can help hit the brain centers in different ways.
You can check out my YouTube channel.
It's absolutely free.
So check that out if that's what you are into and if not keep enjoying the show, So I'll read you the text that I sent so he had just told me that this long thing about how you're struggling about stuff and I'll just read you the text I sent back to him I said do me a favor instead of writing your goals just write down.
6:54
What would a billionaire who lost it all do?
Or what would a billionaire do or whatever version of yourself, you want to be the doing?
And the outcomes will happen as a result of the main internal identity shift, which you can reinforce many times a day by asking yourself that question to teach Crossroad.
7:10
He said that's exactly what I thought of doing yesterday after you texted me.
But then I got to thinking well how do I know it?
A millionaire or billionaire would do or even the version that I want to be?
I'm just guessing what that person would do.
So you responded back with said, I disagree, I said, you know what to do.
I said you just aren't doing it.
7:26
I said have a six-pack.
You know what to do?
I said, we need to be reminded more than we need to be taught.
He said, you're right, I'm going to do it man.
I said said, I mean the exercise, the activity, all of it I said I stand by my original response.
He said I'm going to get my mojo back.
I said it never left my friend.
7:42
You just had to realize it.
Whenever you need it to make more money.
You always have literally So you've always known how you're just choosing to be someone who isn't Satisfied by an external outcome.
But by becoming a better version of yourself, additional thought for you, and this is from Atomic habits every winter and every loser have the same goals.
8:03
So, when you measure Yourself by having this external thing, and people like set goals, everyone wants to be rich.
Everyone wants to have a six-pack your goals, don't make you unique.
It's the activities that you do.
That make you unique.
So what separates them.
The activities they commit to.
8:19
If you commit to the activities that becomes the goal, the goal of the winter is to commit to the activities.
The goal of the loser is to commit to the goal.
To commit to the outcome.
Everybody wants the same things, but people don't do the things that make the things.
And so when you make a lot of money, one month, I said, you've achieved nothing because the goal was the activities, not the money you made.
8:40
He said that last one, deserves a fire reaction.
Thanks, man, I said you're focusing on the wrong part.
I said, the real real is that who do?
I wish to become the type of person that does these things?
And so I think if you can make that shift and that was literally the text said that I had to him and six months later.
Now he's saying her thousand dollars monthly news at 0 at this Because you just like really struggling and and he's got multiple kids, he's got a wife, doesn't work, has been relying on him and he's feeling all the pressure.
9:04
Every one of your peers, if you're younger wants to be rich 52% of 18 year, olds High School seniors.
Think they're going to be millionaires by 25.
The world is going to be shook, many of you will fail and that's because most of you have the same goal of 50%.
You think you're gonna be, mine are right.
9:20
It's just the math but only a small percentage will because if you want to be a millionaire, you're not going to focus on making a million dollars.
You're going to focus on The stuff that makes mine dollars.
And so if you do the activities that generate fifty thousand dollars and you're like oh cool, I hit my goal this month.
Then all of a sudden you don't do the activities because that outcome was what you focused on rather than the thing that created the outcome and so when you can divorce the activities from the outcome then you can focus on the doing which whether your income does this over that period of time.
9:50
Your self-esteem Remains the Same because you're committing to what you can control.
If you can make that shift it will change your life.
So back to the beginning, I started making podcast.
Six years ago, I committed to that process when I signed on with a YouTube vendor a few years ago on the first call.
10:10
I said I'd like to have this channel, be something in 5 to 10 years.
I was like, look at it then and see if it was worth continuing to do.
I was like, but I'm in for a decade and he stopped me afterwards.
He was like, I've literally never had a client say that to me.
Ever.
10:26
He's like, they're all, like, how can I get leads in the first 90 days from YouTube and like, blah, blah is like if we're making progress, I'm good.
I'll commit to that and so I was like, what do you need from me?
That I can commit to you.
That I know that I can do for 10 years and it's like if you can make two videos a week, I was like I can do that for ten years and so I'm only sharing this because to him he said it like change the way you saw things to me.
10:47
I've been I've been in this game a little bit and I've just been focusing that way on business rather than on content creation.
But I think that if you can think that way, You will get what you want and then people will ask you a decade from now, man.
How did you have this overnight success and blah?
Blah, blah.
And aren't you like don't the followers and the fans, like how does it get to your head?
11:06
You're like, because it was never really able.
And so I feel just as good at your one is they do it, you're eight because the activities that I committed to remain the same.
And so, I think if you can think that way you can shift your perspective, it will it'll decrease your emotional ups and downs.
And I think we all need ways to decrease our emotional ups and downs in the game of business because like We need to have s lives their lives and forth lives.
11:27
And the way to do that is to not put your life, your your game playing life in something that you can't control.
But putting all your game playing life in the things you can.
Right now we just crossed our 400th episode 400 episodes.
Like if I did one a week for a year that would be eight years of doing that.
11:47
If I had 400 episodes, I met like you're 6 and so if you make 400 long-form pieces of content, I guarantee that you're following would be bigger than it is today.
And if you're like, well, how long is that going to take as long as it takes?
Because the goal was never the outcome.
12:02
The goal was to do anything. that you're following would be bigger than it is today.
And if you're like, well, how long is that going to take as long as it takes?
Because the goal was never the outcome.
The goal was to do anything.

Real quick guys.
If you can think about how you found this podcast, somebody probably tweeted it told you about it.
Should it on Instagram or something like that?
The only way this grows is through word of mouth and so I don't run ads, I don't do sponsorships, I don't sell anything.
I only ask is that you continue to pay it forward to whoever showed you or however you found out about this Pockets that you do the exact same thing.
0:19
So if it was a review if it was a post if you do that would mean the world to me and you throw some good karma out there for another entrepreneur.
The biggest mistake that I see entrepreneurs who were at, you know, two million, three million, five million, Is that they are trying to solve their business growth Problem by just coming out with thing after thing, after thing, after thing for that audience, rather than thinking, maybe I should expand my audience.
0:41
The wealthiest people in the world see business as a game.
This podcast, the game is my attempt at documenting, the lessons.
I've learned on my way to building acquisition.com into a billion dollar portfolio.
My Hope Is that you use the lessons to grow your business and maybe someday soon partner with us to get $200 and Beyond.
I hope you share and enjoy.
Mark Bell just flew out.
0:58
Awesome guy to do a podcast here.
With me in Vegas, we worked out shot.
The shit was a great time and there was this really important point where he said you know I wish more people would just peel weight off the bar he's that I always respect a guy, who's lifting with strong guys that says, you know, guys I'm going to peel some weight off so that I can do this weight the right way and I thought it was such a beautiful parallel in business.
1:19
And one of the most common mistakes in business that I see entrepreneurs at all levels.
Make so acquisition.com, probably talks to 25.
New companies, a week that are coming at, you know, approaching us about us potentially, you know, investing in their companies.
And one of my biggest pet peeves, comma, entrepreneurial mistakes that I see across the board, especially in that like, sub 5 million range is something that will destroy your business, for the Long Haul.
1:49
And the reason is not because the strategy is wrong, but because it's too advanced.
And I will explain what I mean in a second.
So the easiest analogy for what I'm going to try to explain is something that you that hopefully people can resonate with at the gym.
So if you're working out with someone and one person stronger than the other person, and the strong guy goes first, and has three plates on the bar, doesn't really matter the weaker guy might go up, and if he has an ego, give it a shot.
2:16
Even though it's above his pay grade, it's above his strength level.
And even if you could pull it off and be poor, and it probably be risky because he is a strong enough, right?
And business is a lot.
Like that in ways because oftentimes are foreigners will have the right strategy, lifting the weight, and lifting heavier, weight is not wrong, and it's the right way to get strong, but it's just too advanced for where you're at right now and it takes humility, like the guy who says, you know what, I'm going to peel a plate off because it's like I can do that way better so that I can someday level up and get strong enough to do that more advanced thing in wheat and lifting its linear because you just add plates to the bar.
2:55
But in business, it's about Complexity.
And so the adding the weight of the bar is complexity in the business, whereas Simplicity often times is what scales.
So you might imagine, imagine somebody comes up to you and says, hey I want to start a digital bank because I think that all of this stuff should be Central and we can have payments and blah blah blah.
3:16
That's a hard business to build.
Elon Musk can build it because he's a thousand-pound squatter.
It's not to say that.
If you tried to build it, you're wrong for the It's that you just might not be there yet.
And so back to what I was saying with the entrepreneurs that we talk to on a regular basis.
3:35
The biggest mistake that I see is that they put on shoes that are too big for them.
And the way that they do that is that they have something that starts working and then they let this insipid phrase melt into their mind and take over their actions, which is I'm leaving money on the table.
3:51
And so they have this thing, it's working and then they think of themselves.
Well, well, I don't want to further that.
This out because like they should get that for me and then they try and glob that.
Oh yeah.
And then I need to do this too and I need to club that so that they so I can get more money in every customer.
Is that a great strategy?
4:09
Yes.
Is the execution of that strategy very Advanced from an operational perspective.
Yes and so here's the thing, I had a buddy from high school approached me and he was like, hey, this is what I'm doing with my contracting business.
He's a general contractor and he was used for whose Roofing.
4:27
Primarily it was like okay sweet.
So you're just going to show your roofing business.
He's like yeah.
But I also do some like flips in real estate because we like, you know, fix some stuff there.
I was like okay so you do roofs and you do real estate flipping he's like yeah, but I mean we also do some general contracting work, just kind of like fix stuff inside of houses was like, okay.
4:46
So you do Roofing, you do General Contracting work and you flip houses he was like, yeah, I was like, okay why?
Is it?
Well you know we have these resource.
I'm trying to like make the most of all that and I you know, some of these clients we fixed the roof and like hey can you fix them in my house?
5:03
I'm like I could do it so then I do it because I don't leave money on the table.
And the question is, what problem are we solving?
If the goal is to grow the business?
Do we think that we could have a hundred million dollar roofing business?
The answer is yes.
5:18
Do you think we could have a hundred million dollar?
General contracting business answers?
Yes, do you think we have a hundred million dollar?
Flipping houses business.
The answer is yes.
Can you have all three very unlikely unless you're an Elan unless you're a freak but most people aren't and that's okay, it's normal.
5:39
Hey guys, real quick for those of you guys who are 100 million-dollar offers fans I love you.
I added in a lost chapter that has never been released.
I'm releasing it now transparently.
I'm doing that to build hype for under million-dollar leads, but you will have the unreleased chapter, it talks about your first Avatar and how to segment customers, make more money.
5:57
You can get it by going to acquisition.com forward slash leads.
Its fo free in exchange for your email so that I can email you when we launched under Miller, All Leads and so that you can not miss out on it.
Because last time I sold out for like 8, Eight weeks really fast.
So that is my way of making sure that y'all get first dibs.
6:15
The biggest mistake that I see entrepreneurs who are at, you know, two million, three million, five million ish, is that they are trying to solve their business growth Problem by just trying to glob as many different things as they possibly can.
You know, the people I'm talking about, they have an audience.
And so then, they just start coming out with thing after thing.
6:31
After thing.
After thing for that audience, rather than thinking, maybe I should expand my audience and keep selling the thing that I'm really good at the thing that I'm best at the thing, that's the best leverage for my opportunity, my skill sets, and so, It's hard for people to say, or even peel back.
6:46
So this is you, and you've got five different products, you sell to different avatars, you saw very clearly different Services.
You might want to say, okay, which one of these in my best at and which one of these do I think I could serve the most people with and find the one that Christy Criss crosses, those two things and say I'm going to forget about the rest of the stuff and go all in on this one thing because the problem that we're trying to solve is that we're trying to make more money and so us doing all these other things, it distracts from the core business opportunity and That's where we need to peel weight.
7:15
Off the bar, we need to peel things down and focus on the weight that we can do and get more repetitions in it that this weight so that we then can earn the right later to maybe at one thing in at scale maybe when we have someone who can run that and drive that rather than you right and so it's probably the number one red flag that I look out for.
7:38
It also tends to stem from a little bit of greet and people like they're looking at other people.
People's paychecks.
I'm sending this guy so much business.
I'm sending that guy so much business.
Good great get an affiliate commission called, add a move on, right?
And they try and bring these things in-house.
7:55
And a lot of times they're not cordial.
It's just, it's just it's globbing.
And then you have this amalgamation that's frankenstein-looking business that no one wants to touch.
Because the first thing that we do with a business like that is we would simplify we peel weight off the bar and we said, we need to do more reps and more volume with the weight that we've got and that parallel.
8:14
Apply so beautifully in entrepreneurship that I felt the need to make this because so many of the entrepreneurs, we talked to her making this mistake, and I say this because I before I started making money, headed chiropractor agency.
I had a dental agency, I had a Jim Turner on business and I also had five locations, six locations, whatever those six locations.
8:36
So I had this many businesses at the same time, I wasn't making no money and so I do.
I think that I could Own all these businesses.
Now sure, I'm strong enough to own those businesses now, but then I wasn't.
And so, what did I have to do?
I'd appeal weight off the bar until I was left with one and then I did more reps with that.
8:56
One, with the one plate on the bar, I did as many reps as I could.
And then I was able to level up my entrepreneurial skill set on a clear opportunity of all of the opportunities that I was best at.
And you have to just say, no.
And this is just like the woman in the red dress, seeing no to increase in attractiveness as you get better.
9:14
I was starting out.
I might consider a thousand dollar month thing, but when you're making a hundred grand a month, you probably aren't as interested in a thousand dollars a month, and you just ignore it, but you have a harder time.
Ignoring another hundred thousand dollar month thing, right?
But you have to say no to that to get to a million a month because what happens is, you get to 100 and then you do another thing and then your attention split.
9:34
And then you can't get past here.
And so, you have to peel the weight off the bar, and then you do more reps.
And the thing is, is that even at that next level and you're a million a month.
You look at this other thing.
Thing, like there's this other opportunity to million a month but usually feel the weight off the bar and you do more reps.
9:50
And so the only reason you shouldn't be doing more reps and adding to the bar adding to the stuff that you sell is that you literally have no more people to sell to and until you have that problem, you should focus on the one thing.
And the secret is that most people really never get into that problem because they're not even close to the size of the market.
10:06
So mostly Nation your entrepreneur, focus on the one thing peel weight off, the bar do more reps at the way that's appropriate for you.
And then Wash your gains, both financial and physical stack.








0:00
Those a nation did a podcast with Founders stories.
We talk about three main things in part 1 of the podcast.
First is our entrepreneurs hardwired as entrepreneurs or are?
They born that way?
And I think I'm some interesting thoughts around this that will serve you s.
Do you have to have a software company in order to become a billionaire?
0:15
I'll give you my thoughts on this often overused path and the many dangers of thinking that is the only way to become ultra wealthy.
And the many, many, many people who have not been and Third how to craft an offer.
That's so good people, feel stupid, setting, go.
And if you're used to it, It's a nice verbal overview, and if you haven't read the book, then it'll give you a decent crash course.
0:34
If you like it you can grab the book on Amazon for nine months, my belief is like the three piece of scaling that I adhere to is zero to a million as promotion. 1 to 10 million is product, 10 to 100, is people Welcome to the game where we talk about it, get more customers how to make more per customer and how to keep them longer in the many failures and lessons.
0:53
We have learned along the way.
I hope you enjoy and subscribe.
Alex, thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today.
The first question, we ask everyone that comes on.
Is how did you get your job?
AKA how'd you find yourself doing the work you do and say, oh, by a master plan?
1:10
I started out when I was three.
Okay iterated and filled my way here.
So I went to school for business too.
He did management consulting after school for two years, did defense Contracting, so space siren, intelligence, top-secret all that stuff.
Sounded really cool.
1:26
Sounds much cooler than it was for me.
I was mostly just taking notes during dictated meetings and turning them into and highlighted color coded notes.
But didn't like that had co-workers told me that I should start Fitness stuff because it was all I was talking about use the Consulting method to try new, which is look up, experts and connect with them because it's faster to learn.
1:43
That way, emailed 40, guys, one guy got back to me.
I offer to work for or him for free left.
Everything I had sold my condo drove across the country. 36 hours later.
I was there more for free for three months, started.
My first facility learned about Facebook ads at about that time, use that as a primary way of getting customers after month. 15 in the first location, open up a new location.
2:05
Every six months at full capacity went to a different marketing Summit.
So, I'll guy signed up for his, his like mentorship.
He said, I should be showing people how I was doing, what I was doing rather than 0.
For Jim's.
I took his advice because he was richer than me so that I did turn arounds for.
2:23
So I flew around the country and did 33 turn around, so I flew out fill people's gyms and had a neat guy sales team doing that turnaround H&M's a month.
I was an intense period.
And then from there, I realized that the logistics were getting really difficult to scale.
We're doing public 33 100,000 a month at that point.
2:41
And so we switch to a licensing model and then that is when everything kind of took off, there's a ton of heartbreak and these and failed Partnerships intermixed in there but that is the two-minute story of how I got to the first big successful company which is Jim lunch.
2:56
Then we started supplement company, 12 months later than we started a software company, 12 months after that and then we started the parent company.
Acquisition.com.
We acquired interest in three other companies about to be 4.
So we'll have 7 in the portfolio and those companies.
Now do by 85 million a year.
3:11
Do you think entrepreneurs are hard-wired or do you think they Can be made and if so why I think it's a really good question.
I think it's a nature nurture thing so I think that there are some people who are hardcore could never live another way and there are some people who will never be entrepreneurs, but I think there's a whole lot of gray in between that depends on stimuli and Circumstance.
3:32
I think for me, I don't think I was hardwired entrepreneur.
I wasn't selling lemonade.
I think if there was like 10 being, you know, the Gary Vee who says he could never be anything but an entrepreneur and then a one is, you know, an academic chair at a department of mechanical engineering.
I think I was actually Closer to like three.
3:49
Like I think I'm actually left middle in terms of not being necessarily an entrepreneur personality type.
The only reason that I think I even got into this because I so dislike the career that I was on that candle.
They just wanted the emotional Pain to End and so I just thought like I didn't even want to be alive anymore and so I just threw away all my goals around money and just said I'm going to do something that I love.
4:12
Even if I don't make anything, I'll start a gym, I like Fitness but then I got the bug.
Realized I liked business more than I liked Fitness and then that kind of started the next kind of passion that started growing within me.
Like, the day that I open, my gym was the day that Fitness became second.
Most important thing in my life, business became the most important thing in my life.
4:31
I see, sir, you wrote this book called hundred million dollar offers seems like a lot of.
Like, it seems like it's doing really, really well like what compelled you to write this and what inspired you to write this book.
Sherwood number is really transparent lie on the channel, you know, my wife and I have taken a tremendous amount of Dividends from the business.
4:48
And we've sold, you know, one, I'd sold my gym for that.
Wasn't anything huge.
And I, we signed our will to give away everything we have, when we die.
Anyways, so in thinking, through that decision was like, well, giving away everything that I have, when I die, is, is neat, I guess, because then it decreases some of the pressure around like why I make more now, right?
5:09
But then I was like, I think, the most valuable thing that I can give isn't money, which we do give, but it's the skills, right?
It's the giving fish.
Teaching renovation.
So, that was kind of the spirit behind the YouTube channel, the spirit behind the books, and the courses.
And things that I'm just giving away now, mostly because it feels good.
5:29
And because I get to participate in some cool companies, you know, some, you know, I get to meet new people from this.
And I think that Leo and I were really, really sheltered in terms of how we've done our business career.
But this point, I mean, you know, we were known within a very small Niche, but for the most part, we've just kind of stuck to doing that.
5:45
Those actually an active decision about A year into gym which ones we transition to licensing.
We're doing about two and a half million a month and we said we can't mess this up and we've got too many families, too many employees who rely on us.
And so we basically said we're not going to have friends.
I'm not going to drink.
6:01
I'm not going to go out, just going to work and right or wrong.
You know what I mean?
That, that was just where I was mentally at the time.
I was like I just need to do this and do a really good job and we did.
But now that we've kind of come I would say come out of that season of life now, it's like, hey we can look around and share some of the lessons that we've learned along the way.
6:17
Yeah, that's cool.
I respect that.
So I have to ask you just delve a little deeper on that piece that you said you you guys are you and your partner, they'll have already written your will and you'll give everything away like why we're not big Believers in Legacy?
You know, I believe at least you know, America is built on equal opportunity.
6:35
I don't think that inherited wealth.
Does anyone any good?
I think it's, I think it ruins people.
I think you have to learn how to, like I believe.
Money is a, is a tool and my favorite Magic card, which there's a game called Magic.
Gathering, I played was kid but it was she wished for a weapon but not the skill to wield it.
6:52
And so I think that people get this very powerful tool and they don't have the skill to wheel.
That I think the only way to have not have money on, you is to know how to generate it.
And then you can respect it for what it is.
No, what its limitations are and know what you can do.
It use it for and I think that most people who are gifted it.
7:09
So if I don't have kids, but if I did have kids, I still wouldn't give them the money because they have to have to do it on their own.
Otherwise, it'll, I think it'll ruin them, and Comes to aspirations.
One of my close friends.
He's a, he's a gym guy.
So I think he, yeah, he even built following you for a long time.
7:27
He mentioned to me that your aspirations are to become a billionaire, right?
So like you want to do you still want to acquire you know a sizable amount of wealth, right?
Yes.
The easiest way for me explain is like I want to have a very big goal.
That sounds exciting but I have absolutely no emotional investment.
7:45
If I never hit it I wouldn't be upset.
I do think I'm going to I get it but I but I wouldn't be upset either way.
Can you talk to us about the how like conceptually kind of like top level?
Like how do you plan to get there?
We're just going to be investing in businesses that are similar to the ones that we scaled and participate in the growth.
8:02
It's very simple model and just you know, penciling out the numbers like I know that I can acquire probably a decent sized chunk of four to eight businesses a year.
And I think that I can reasonably 325 x those in three years because we're just Here, Niche businesses, that we know that we can Crush.
8:20
So the thesis, I'll zoom out for a second.
So the thesis point out was there's not calm, is that formal education?
At least, you know, in America for me, I feel like from Early Education field.
Most of us, right?
You know, we put a lot of money in, there's some in the u.s. you can't bankrupt out of the debt, like you cannot get out of the debt that you owe for your schooling.
8:37
And the entire ideally the original premise of higher education was that you'd now be a more viable member to society.
Be able to be more gainfully employed and provide value, right?
The problem is that the promises under liver right?
And And people go in and get the same level of income after they get a degree as as what they could get before.
8:53
And if you just look at the parallel track of somebody who took the same amount of money and spent it on what I would, consider alternative education Over a four-year period.
I would say almost invariably the person who spends an alternative education would be far better off for years later than somebody who party for four years of college.
And so I think that with technology I borrow this from Nepal robocon.
9:11
I just like the portal lot technology, democratizes consumption, and consolidates production, which means if you're the best in the world, you get to For everyone.
And so I think that education is going to become or already has been and will increase in his fragmentation.
So you'll have more Niche verticals and instead of having generalist which is what formal education is based on liberal arts where you get like I'm gonna English and math.
9:31
It has take literature and female studies and whatever, right?
Instead it's how to use Aaron, be to make money, how to drive Uber make money how to, you know, do Amazon FBA.
What's hilarious?
To me is that like, there's more Amazon sellers than there are almost, then you can pick, you can pick a profession that's out there in the It states and there are more individual Amazon sellers than there are almost of any, you know, Sub sub group of individual thing.
9:53
But why is it Amazon or e-commerce a major in undergraduate?
It's a real, you know, it's a real way of making money and so I think that with this huge fragmentation education hasn't hasn't gotten close to catching up but the demand for high-value skills has never been higher.
10:09
And so you have this huge amount of demand for people who want to have skills that they can feed themselves and provide value and then you have almost no Supply.
And so with that's given birth.
To is what I would consider it now the alternative education scene which is blowing up right the entire all the guru's and e-learning and all that stuff and some of its bad, some of its good but at the end of the day the demand is going to drive.
10:30
And so my bet that in my thesis mind acquisition.com is, I want to find the people who are the best at their specific thing.
The best salon girl, the best auto mechanic, the best gym owner, the best, all of these things, and then wrap the model that I already know how to deliver.
You know, provide exceptional service, provide great value, you how to teach effectively so that people can understand the concepts and then ultimately make a lot of profit and then participate in that process.
10:54
So, that's, that's the thesis behind it.
Hey, Mose addition, quick break, just to let you know that we've been starting to post on LinkedIn and want to connect with you.
Alright, so send me a connection request.
A note.
Let me know that you listen to the show and I will accept it.
There's anyone you think that would be should be connected with tag them in one of my or laila's posts?
11:12
And I will give you all the love in the world.
All right, so let's get back to the show.
We share similar views on education and that whole system, what we go to deep because could talk about it forever.
You talked about the, you know, the billionaire goal, once you hit that, like, what's next, and how.
11:31
And when do you want to do that by?
I think, if I said it was unreasonable, but I think that, I mean, I'll tell you what I have in my head, I don't think I've said it publicly but I think 10 years is what I is.
What I think I can.
I mean, it'd be cool to do it sooner than that and that's boring, you know, a global meltdown and reset or whatever.
11:48
Like a racing of currencies and crypto ruling the world, but, you know, short of that happening in as long as you know, whatever the recession is.
Coming comes in is just a normal level recession and not like a global depression meltdown.
I think that in 10 years we could get there and this is based on a normal, like just based on the assets that we already have how I plan on allocating assets and what kinds of returns.
12:08
I think we'll be able to reasonably expect.
That's where that's that's based out of, because all I have to really do is get to 100 million in Thibodaux in 10 years.
And then the company, you know, Hopefully, I'll have will be worth a billion.
That's what I have to do.
So I feel like I can do that though.
I'm curious as well, kind of like, what would be next once you hit that?
12:26
So what would be?
Next is just continuing to Alex's boring recipe.
For success is just keep doing what's working.
I would just continue to do that but I think that will be different, but acquisition dot combo in the designing, it is I'm trying to design it so that everybody every single party that touches it benefits.
12:46
So the vast majority of That looked like, because there's a, it's like an ecosystem.
What?
I'm trying to build.
So everybody who consumes all the content for free, right?
Gets hopefully value foreign access to the time that they're investing because that is the real cost is the time that you're investing in consuming the content, right?
And so, if you get value for an excess of that, then you will be left better off and that's going to be 99.9% of people because I'm not selling anything for the point.
13:08
One percent or point zero.
One percent of companies that we may end up, you know, partnering with, or doing some sort of investment deal with those companies will benefit because we'll be able to directly invest in them and will help them help themselves.
The team that I have within acquisition.com.
I'm recruiting the absolute best in the world.
13:24
So, we're talking about people who have uncapped earning potential, so they can make five hundred thousand a million, two million dollars a year, five million dollars a year within that structure.
So, the people who work for me, we'll be able to make, you know, tremendous amounts of incoming in create their own.
It own independent wealth, and then obviously acquisition not calm, as a portfolio itself, has to make money.
13:43
And then maybe in the future, I'll be able to help all of those companies.
You know, all those people, they could reinvest their own money and then also participate as both an investor and a, and a doer.
And so that's what I'm trying to create is just a huge ecosystem that just creates value for all parties that are involved.
13:59
Yeah, love it.
So I want to dive into your framework more but I have to ask one question selfishly, it's not something down here.
Like dude if you want to become a billionaire would have the fastest way from my perspective and this comes from.
I mean, if you do a lot of billionaires spoken to a lot of like extreme Rodney Rowe successful, people probably hundreds at this point.
14:22
There is no doubt about it.
That the fastest, way from my perspective to acquire and generate serious amounts of personal wealth is starting a software company and getting it to 100 million ARR.
Why don't you do that?
Like, you're a super smart guy.
14:37
Why wouldn't you just focus on that?
It's a really good question.
It's would.
I mean my wife and I talked about all the time because I say the same I mean we go back and forth on this thing.
I'll walk you through the decision-making process or at least the reasoning behind it.
So I think that software if you look at the people who are billionaires, right many of them created through software now.
14:57
And so what I feel like is not represented as the many people who try to create it with software and failed and so if we're looking at the ones who become billionaires, it's like VC.
If I bet on 51 of them or two of them, are going to hit it, right?
But if you're the entrepreneur in the one, your success likelihood is far lower.
15:16
Whereas I feel like if I invest the way that I In on investing, I will have a vehicle that compounds Capital at a very high rate of return and I can diversify my risk and virtually guarantee that I get there.
And so that's the, it's a risk analysis, which is I could probably hit bigger, but the risk of that, I don't hit it is high.
15:37
It's reasonable.
At least we're as the risk that I don't hit it on the other side, I feel like it is is dramatically lower and I still have software companies that are coming to me that I can still participate.
It in that process.
So that's that's the that's the overarching reasoning behind it.
15:52
Now that being said, maybe in three years we'll get on here, I'll be like, you know what, man I was full of shit.
I saw the software opportunity that crashed it.
So maybe that's but where I currently stand and I think part of that is because my heroes are like Charlie Munger and Warren Buffett.
Like, those guys are my absolute heroes in terms of how they live their lives and how they make decisions and how they think through things.
16:12
And so, that's I think that's been a big influence on, why I'm choosing to go in this direction.
Yeah, that makes sense.
So you got like the portfolio model look to be honest it's probably more fun that way too.
Let's be honest, those are big part of.
It will just leave when I spent 18 months, figuring out what we want to do.
16:27
What do we really want to do?
Is the next thing, the next season for us.
And I had all these like non-negotiables, right?
I was like, I don't know if I want to run another one and and I mean, I can do it.
I would just, I don't know if I want to do another, you know, grind first three years again, baby.
But I don't know what something that I won't get bored of.
16:44
Because, for me, I get bored in about 24 months.
That's my, that's my When do I know that?
And so if I could participate in lots of different companies, I think that that I will be able to keep my attention on one thing.
And I think that's probably the biggest, probably the biggest one because like every company we started as going from 0 to 2 million a month in less than a year like every company.
17:05
So we know how to scale them.
I just, you know I'm saying stuff, do you talk about crafting and off of it's so good?
That people feel stupid saying, no.
So why is the offer the most important part?
Comes to selling anything or build building a business.
17:21
In general.
It's trouble with saying it's the most important because, you know, both know it's it's like an engine, right?
Like a business is like an engine.
You need Wheels as much as you need cylinders as much as in your gas, all of them are important, right?
But I see that offer is like the spark.
17:37
Well, we're actually giving them exchange for their money and I think most entrepreneurs who are starting out, do it out of sequence.
And so they try and fix Step 2 or step 3 and they're like, hey, why is my copy batter?
Why are my a ads not performing when they're not starting with the very first part of the process, which is that initial transaction, right?
17:53
And so, a lot of my learnings around the offer, came out of necessity, because I prefer to be dealing with tremendous demand, and fixing operational problems, rather than trying to generate demand.
And so, my belief is like, the three piece of scaling that I adhere to is zero to a million as promotion, 1 to 10 million is product 10 to 100 as people, right?
18:18
Hey, you can say well if you had the right people.
Yeah, but that's not typically how it actually happens, right?
So you have to know enough promotion because if you have nothing, then you need to get people to find out, right?
So you have to start generating some traction.
Once you get the traction, and this is where I think people mess up, is they get their first dollar from promoting and then I need to spend more dollars promoting when it's like the whole point here is to get the product Market, fit and make sure that the product is exceptional and we're getting virality from a people are sharing it.
18:43
We're getting amazing reviews, all of that stuff is happening.
Because then when we go back to, Really scaling.
We're going to get so much more return on every dollar of advertising and media that we're buying, that it all makes the whole machine work.
Whereas most people, then try and duck more promotion on top of it, but the product isn't fixed.
18:59
And so, the reason that the offer was so important was because just getting that first traction, that first Spark started, it's so much easier to just give someone everything they possibly could dream of and then work backwards from there.
I'm curious, kind of you say, Tulsa that the past, few companies that you've worked with you've taken from 0 to 2, In a month in a year.
19:19
Is that correct?
Yeah.
So Prestige launched 1.7 million a month by month, I think.
Like for Jim launch hit two million a month within 12 months of us hitting a switching to licensing and then Alan was at one point seven as well, so just under two.
19:36
Yeah, wow, okay, so multiple different Industries, which was the steepest learning curve, so for y IC B, like there's three pieces.
Right about acquisition, you've got product, and you've got Ops right shared services, whatever you want to call it, right?
19:53
So with the first two companies, so if with Jim launch, the gym licensing company acquisition, I could cover product, I could cover because I knew everything about because what I was showing was how to acquire customers within a smaller Niche, right?
And run the business model and all the other things.
So I have, I understood both the acquisition and and the delivery to a to an immense amount of detail, right?
20:13
I was I was I was a master at it.
I'd Masters level both of these things and then my wife is a prodigious operator like she can build a team around anything which is why we've been able to scale so many things so quickly.
So, with the first company, all three pieces were in place, it blew up the second company.
20:31
I contracted the best doctor that I'm aware of to create all the formulas for all products that we sold.
And so, I had the acquisition, I had the product and then, we had the operational piece again, with my wife with software.
I knew how to acquire the customers.
20:47
We knew how to build the team, but I'm not a code guy and the mistake that I made when I was building Allen was that I did not have a technical co-founder, which is what I should have had.
And so I had an outsourced development team and I was a big mistake.
I shouldn't have done that and I just didn't.
And the thing is, it's so difficult.
21:04
You know, I was, I was blind negotiating.
This how I'd say it's like, you do I say, hey can we change this button, right?
And then you'd say, you know, it takes a month and I'd be like Feel like you can do better than that.
I had no idea.
It could have taken two years.
I have no clue.
So I'm blind.
Negotiating trying to just keep a front but I have no clue what I'm talking about and I hate operating from some sort of that kind of information disadvantage.
21:27
And so that was the, that was why it was so difficult.
Now, I blew the doors off of the Acquisitions.
I can go market and sell all day long but with software to your point getting you know, hundred million are our to get the 10x multiple that you're going to get on it.
It's about having that - turn And that's going to be all product-driven, right?
21:45
That's going to be making sure that ux is amazing.
Engineering teams on point.
You know, like people are promoting like crazy, all that kind of stuff.
And so I feel like it's interesting because in the internet marketing world because I see this all over the place.
So many of these guys are switching to trying to do software but they're selling the software.
The same way they sold their digital products, which means they have a shit software and they're selling it, and then everyone's leaving and they're like, I'm going to be able to sell this for a ton of money.
22:06
It's like, no, you're not.
You're only gonna be able to sell for a ton of money.
If, if you didn't mark it, it still grows those nature.
Hope you enjoyed that.

Hey guys, real quick.
So Leyland are definitely working on our social media presence.
If you guys haven't noticed and we're just breaking now into LinkedIn.
All right.
It's not as bad as I thought it's actually pretty awesome so far and you guys have been really cool in there and people are sharing our stuff a lot.
So if we aren't connected on LinkedIn, it go ahead and let's connect and let's rock and roll.
0:17
The biggest shift that I see in people who are wealthy is that they talk in decades, not days and I can tell you based on the time period that someone talks in when they talk about their plans, how wealthy they are.
Welcome to the game where we talk about how to sell more stuff to more people in more ways and build businesses worth owning.
0:35
I'm trying to build a billion-dollar thing with acquisition.com.
I always wished besos musk and buffeted documented their Journey.
So I'm doing it for the rest of us.
Please share and enjoy.
One of the strongest persuasive powers in existence is reciprocity, if people get something, they feel almost like it's like sick to their stomach, they have to give something back, right?
0:52
It's just most people are like not everyone.
There are some crazy out there but most humans because all of our civilization has been based on this concept of reciprocity.
You can force reciprocity your direction.
I just jamming so much Goodwill and so much value down someone's throat that they just feel like they have to vomit back on you in terms of value because they're so full on value.
1:11
They're like getting drunk.
The value that you're providing for them.
And so, when you do that, it results in a sale.
And I'll tell you one of the lessons that I learned later, this is just least been true for me.
Is that the end of your value, ladder of the essentials that you can refer customer is predicated in the last thing that you provided that was in excess of value from what you charged.
1:30
So if you think about the first thing you do is your content is free.
It's worth more than what you're doing because you're giving away everything.
And so then they purchase the first day.
If that first thing, let's say is a thousand dollars but it makes them ten thousand dollars they're like.
Well fuck, yeah, what else you got?
You know, I got 10,000 Nothing.
And they're like a minute and then they made a hundred grand.
1:47
No.
Like dude, what else you got?
No, I got $100 more thing and this is the part where people fuck up?
Is that a hundred thousand other thing?
They get a hundred thousand dollars value and then what they have done is that they have now completely, squeezed, the price devalue discrepancy and what they have is not a raven customer, but a satisfied customer and then that is where the customer relationship ends.
2:08
And so, the idea of being able to consistently and always have more demand than you can, Is predicated or is based on the ability to always provide not just a little bit more but significantly more than you are charging for.
And so there's two ways of doing that one.
2:24
Is you can decrease your price to the point where it's basically nothing.
And so if you give anything over nothing it seems poor which is why this kind of the premise around for Content but the thing is is that free content doesn't cost, it's just not monetary, it's time and attention.
How many people do you know?
Make contact and they get no fucking engagement.
2:39
On might be you, you might be that person?
Why do you think that is?
Does the price of free is still not worth it Gosha, right?
And so the idea is like if you are in that situation you make this free content, you say content doesn't work and so you keep putting a shittier and shittier contact as you keep saying that it's to work.
2:56
I think if you can flip the script and say, Hey what if I made all of the stuff that I have, that's free more.
Valuable the what my competitors are currently charging port.
What if I make my free stuff, better than their paid stuff and if you really truly try and do that, not just like, say that but live, that look at think about all the deliverables that happened to give it our all the checklist and the and the cheat sheets and the visuals and the videos and the in-depth training that you would provide if you were to try to divorce.
3:24
And what if you just gave that away?
What happens if someone makes a hundred grand a month using your free stuff, they fucking want to give you money to buy more from you reciprocity.
And so as Long as the next thing that you have can provide even more value because probably if you were able to help them make a hundred thousand dollars off of your free stuff, you probably have enough expertise to help them make a million, right?
3:47
And so that's the idea here is like packing provide so much value in excess.
They want to continue to buy from us over and over again by that's the that's the stick.
I will talk about how I did something not how to do something.
I'll talk about what my clients did, not what you should and I will base that from our perspective of I will try and get away as much as humanly possible so much that it makes me sick to my stomach.
4:09
And I'm very afraid of the amount of value that I'm giving.
Because I know that based on reciprocity by get more value out there, I will get more in return because you can give at scale with content.
So think about this if it cost you the same amount to provide value in a video to one person is the best fried value to a million people who watch a video just think about it.
4:28
Conceptually Because, you know, more efforts do that.
But the beautiful thing with technology is that there's still only one of you to receive from everything that you did on a multiplied with leverage at scale.
Like, I don't know if you can see this visual but you do one level of effort, one input and Technology, amplifies it to everyone but then it all has to come back into one which is you.
4:54
And so you can, this is how you can amass significant wealth.
Like this is how it works.
So, Caleb, For the other days.
I do, people say leverage all the time he's like, what is leverage even mean?
This is what marriage means.
Leverage means the ratio between inputs to outputs in assistant.
5:11
And so, if the input that we have is time or money, if we have something that has lots of Leverage means, we get a huge multiplier effect.
If I put 1 u 2 to N, I get 10 units out.
I get 100 units out.
That is a high leverage, activity or system.
And so the aggregation of wealth for people who have money is a function, Of understanding time because wealth is based on the fundamental unit of money.
5:39
Money is a foundational unit of time.
Why?
Because you can trade them back and forth.
Everybody here can trade your time for money?
It's an even exchange system and so here's what's interesting, everyone can trade time for money, but you can trade some time for more money, right?
And so, what we're doing when we gain Leverage is we're looking at and this is the people who are the wealthiest is they have control over their time, so that when they do, give it to get the most out of it, Right?
6:03
And so the game of business to aggregate wealth is to play with higher and higher and higher amounts of Leverage over.
The one thing that they all have the same amount which is time.
And so mastering that is the key to becoming wealthy.
So you you master your time in order to master your money and so there's two components in mastering time, you have Mastery of time which comes down to the micro which the day-to-day the speed of activity.
6:26
And I can tell you right now, if you talk to somebody, you say, hey, we should do this thing, right?
And then boom, they've got this organized a party.
I've done two or three messages and then like it's getting done tomorrow.
I guarantee you that that person is going to be more wealthy because they have a micro Mastery of their time.
So think about this from from an organizational perspective.
6:43
Imagine that the default time period that you use to get something done.
Is let's say a week.
Let's see.
That's just the unspoken default.
That's the cultural divide by K.
We need to start this project.
Hey, can you get this this thing to miss a call?
I'll get you by in the week and the week.
That's T5.
It's okay with that, right?
7:00
Let's say because you want to become a master of wealth and you understand the time is huge is one of the is one of the biggest components of wealth.
You did say no guys.
The new default is end of day for all activities unless stated otherwise that becomes the new norm.
And so let's say that this project that we had originally has seven it back and forth, interactions.
7:17
They get something view takes a week, you get them something back.
Takes a week to a week.
Take, we take weeks.
The whole thing takes several weeks right now.
Imagine it was end of day.
The same output happens in one, seventh of the time because we both get it done today.
7:33
Next day, two things happened.
Next day, two things.
Happen.
Next day, two, things happen, and then boom, the Project's done, it took two months, take somebody else for days.
And when you multiply that effect over a year, over a decade that is when you see the outsized returns in wealth and money because of Mastery on the micro of time.
7:51
The second component of time is the macro perspective time which is are all of the activities acting in alignment with my overall goal.
And do I believe that they can Compound on one another are they directionally aligned over a decade over three decades so that I can have a compounding effect leverage in action over a longer period of time.
8:11
So that my input is far less or my output far outweighs the input that I did.
Because I let time work as an asset rather than a liability.
Most people's plans.
When you add time get worse, which you want to do is play games.
8:26
Where if you waiting with And so those are the games that we want to set up and those are the games that the people were truly wealthy understand.
And so I can tell you having doubled people who make significantly more money than me, their Mastery of the micro of understanding how speed moves things forward.
8:42
Because on a macro scale of getting things done de de de de de de de rather than weak weak.
Weak, weak weak, weak, weak, means that, at the end of the year, they have 40 times, the output and people are like, that's not fair.
Who said life is supposed to be right?
And so this micro kind of exchange that happens.
9:00
There gets enhanced and magnified in the people get upset about it.
But the thing is you can either decry the system and hate on it.
We can accept it for what it is and just choose to play the game and win where you want, if that's what you want.
And so as micro and then to the macro perspective, like I was saying earlier, is that the biggest shift that I see in people who are wealthy is that they talk in decades, not days and I can tell you based on tan time period that someone talks in when they talk about their plans, how wealthy they are or to be fair, how wealthy they will be.
9:32
And so if you have truly realistic plans, that you're like, this is what's gonna take me about 10 years.
If you hear someone say that I can tell you that they're going to be successful.
And if you can shift your perspective that were you actually start planning in like okay, it would be unreasonable that if I did this for 10 straight years that I wouldn't be significantly wealthier than I am today.
9:51
So that's what I'm going to do and then having the singularity of mind to not get distracted.
Most Nation real quick.
If you are a business owner that has a big old business and wants to get to a much bigger business, going to 50 $100.
10:06
Plus, we would love to talk to you and if you like that would like to hear more about it, go to acquisition.com, you planning on the page and talk to one of our team and see if we can help you get there.
There's three things that they found that made people were Ultra successful and Ultra successful too.
10:24
I wish I had the definition for what they Define as Ultra successful but we'll just leave it at that.
He said they have a superiority complex and they think that they are in some way better than other people and deserve more than others.
Number one, number two, You have massive insecurity and fear failure.
10:42
They never think that they will measure up or be good enough, interesting parents.
And the number three is if impulse control, and so think about this from a bigger picture perspective, they have the superiority complex of they believe that they can accomplish these amazing things.
10:58
Like, how, like some people if you tell them your goals will say, how dare you think that one?
How dare you believe that you can accomplish anything like that?
And so it takes a little bit of delusion in order to think I'm going to make an iPhone, whatever the fuck that is So I'm gonna put a computer and everyone's hand and in the world.
I'm going to do that, right?
11:13
What people think, it's hubris and the only thing that separates genius and insanity is what happens.
It's outcome, right?
And so they have this is Vision where they want to go and they believe they can do big stuff.
Number two, they have this fuel that they push away from from always feeling the never be good enough.
11:31
Right?
That's what drives them towards this outcome.
And then number three and this is the big one.
This is the one that everyone messes up.
Is they have the impulse control to stay focused on it and not let shiny objects.
Distract them even though there's another opportunity comes up two years in there, like, know if I keep doing what I'm doing.
11:50
And I follow the plan that I said, I will beat would be unreasonable that.
I do not achieve the goal that I have could this help maybe.
But even if I don't do that, I will still get there.
And I would rather take the get rich for sure and get rich quick way every day. and most people, this is my finding at least If you were to sit down with someone and say, Here's a contract sign here, and you're going to live on thirty thousand dollars a year for the next five years.
12:15
But at the end of that, five years, you'll be able to make a million dollars a year.
Most people would sign that contract but they don't live like they would sign the contract.
And the reason that that contract works is because it delays, the gratification it separates the, I'm going to have the cookie today from.
12:32
I want to have a six-pack for life, right?
It's the, I will suffer for this long.
Period of time.
I will make 100 dials.
I will make the hundred pieces of content a week.
I will spend a hundred dollars a day on advertising and sacrifice my lifestyle in order to learn, not to get rich, but you learn the skills that will make me Rich.
12:50
He eventually and I know that if I accumulate these skills, because I'm dedicated to that, and I'm willing to sacrifice more than other people to achieve my dreams.
And I'm going to, I'm going to put a pin on this real quick because I think this is Grill.
How many of you to save Humanity but sacrificed your life?
13:07
How many of you guys would sack like, give your life or maybe even your country, right?
Lot of people do that a lot of our military to appreciate that.
You serve, like, how many people would do that or save your family.
Why is it that that is more important than your dreams?
Why were you willing to sacrifice so much?
13:24
And I feel like the better question is, why are people not willing to sacrifice anything?
It's like if you're willing to sacrifice your life, give the ultimate price for a country or for whatever.
Why would you not give at least that much for realize the potential that you believe you have?
13:42
And so that's for me, why?
The sacrifice is never felt like sacrifices, they felt like trade-offs and for me they were trade-offs here prices, I was willing to pay and so it's like, If there's a pair of shoes that I wanted as $500, I bought them, it was like, don't you feel guilty about spending $500?
13:58
Let's say no, that was the price and I was going to pee.
So I wanted to shoes here and so there's a price tag that we can ascribe for dreams or the potential that we believe that we have, which is what we want to pay down as regret.
The future for not having it.
If you read the price tag and says, you know, football with the boys dodgeball during the week, you know, drinking a couple of nights of a little bit grogger if that's the price tag.
14:23
Is it a price?
I'm going to pack and I think if you are in get significantly closer which trying to do.
And so that was the general gist of the of the chat that I had that chat.
Anyways, motivation, I love you guys, you for some reason are new on here, we have a book that's 99 Cents that I'll be referencing is five thousand, five star reviews on Amazon science sense.
14:44
If you want to check it out, a lot of people get value from it.
Here we have a podcast that encapsulates, a lot of this stuff.
Higher level, I don't sound anything like the whole reason acquisition.com is this is because I'm trying To help businesses that are doing 3 million or more.
And so, if you are a business is doing three million or more and you're on the internet, love to work with, you hop on acquisition.com, fill out the fill the form.

If you're below 3 million and you're not in that industry or your promote, your below 3 million in your in that industry, that's why we make the book we make YouTube, we make Twitter content, we make its your content.
15:18
And we just, I'm just trying to give everybody the tools.
They need to that.
I wish I had had earlier I'm not saying the right, I'm just saying it work.








0:00
Real quick.
Because you guys already know that, I don't run any ads on this and I don't sell anything.
And so, the only ask that I can ever have you guys that you help me spread the word so we can have more entrepreneurs, make more money, feed their families, make better products, and have better experiences for their employees and customers.
And the only way we do that is if you can rate and review and share this podcast, so the single thing that I have to do is you can just leave review will take you 10 seconds or one type of the thumb, mean, the absolute world to me.
0:25
And more importantly, it may change the world of someone else for me, I've relieved a lot of Pressure my life so that I could make better decisions by zooming way out and thinking ten thousand years from now will this matter?
And then if I can make the decision of like good or bad based on my new contacts that I created then I can live a life a lot easier.
0:44
The wealthiest people in the world see business as a game.
This podcast, the game is my attempt at documenting, the lessons.
I've learned on my way to building acquisition.com into a billion dollar portfolio.
My Hope Is that you use the lessons to grow your business and maybe someday soon partner with us to get $200 and Beyond.
I hope you share and enjoy.
When you're building a business or building your career, there are stressors that come into play, right?
1:04
And how we manage the circumstances or the conditions that come to us is dictates how our life turns out.
I like, everybody has bad stuff happen and I say that as a pause because you probably believed and nodded your head, like yeah, everybody has bad stuff happened, but that's not true.
Everyone has stuff happen and then we choose to make it bad or good.
1:23
And so, I'll tell you a quick back story and then I'll tell you how I deal with it.
So imagine For a second, two children that are playing and then one child tells the other child, your nose is really big or you're fat, huh?
1:39
And what's interesting is that the child who hears it is unaffected, and the child who says it is unaffected there, like you're fat.
He's like huh, two people.
Communicate parent comes in and overhears it.
And she's like, ah, oh my God takes the child that, that was called fat Comforts them, gives them the expectation that they should be.
1:59
Set.
And then tells the other one that that was bad.
And in a moment, there was something that is now traumatic that otherwise wouldn't have been because the adult tells both of those children, that that was bad.
And so, when we were kids, we walk in the world with no meaning.
All we do is we observe, and then we say, what does that mean?
2:16
What does that mean?
And then whatever the adults around us, tell us, and say this means that we take as fact, and it's not true.
It's their interpretation of the world and we inherit those, and then we spend the rest of our life trying to undo these an exam.
These beliefs that we have been told by people that we probably don't agree with and so it's hard to track back.
2:36
Every single thing you've ever been told means, but you can just on an exception basis, when something bothers, you pull it out and look at it and say, what happened?
And why is this bad, what?
If it were good and what would it look like if it were good?
2:52
And so the two tools that I use for this are time and volume.
And so the Umm, example is thinking, okay, I'm in traffic, if this happened every day, would I be upset?
If it happened every day, I'd probably expect it, which means that I would not be upset about it because it's just how things always are.
3:13
And so, if every time every person got into a card, always took 30 minutes to get somewhere.
Then that's just how driving a car is.
And so then our expectation meets reality or if you want to make it positive, you say well what?
If every time I got in a car normally would take an hour and today took 30 I'd be pretty.
3:29
I did about it and so all we did is just change the volume on the circumstance to recalibrate the meaning that we're choosing to ascribe to it, good or bad, right?
And so, I like to think of circumstances a lot like weather, which is like, you've got sunny days and you've got rainy days.
3:48
And the problem in my opinion is that people any day that it rains, they say is bad and I need a that Sonny, they say is good.
When in reality it just is.
It's just the weather and you need both and if it was only sunny, D-Day, you wouldn't be happy about the sun because it's just how it always is.
And so contrast is what creates the quote, good and bad when reality.
4:08
There's just a middle line and half of its above and half of its below.
And so, if we know that, then what we can do, is artificially move the line in our minds by saying, whatever this circumstance is, what would it look like, if it were worse and what would it look like, if it were worse all the time?
4:23
And then now, how would I look at my current circumstance?
And would it be better?
Now, as a result if it were always worse than it is today?
And if so, then maybe today's a good thing, right?
The second frame that I like to use is time, right?
Which is if I go not just 100 years out but 10,000 years out.
4:41
How much is this going to matter, right.
And so a good example of that is like if you're looking at the reason something affects you is because you have deemed it meaningful you've said it matters, right?
And it's my world view that nothing matters with a capital M like nothing matters in the universe.
4:59
There's one little Pebble into a big thing as saying, inside of lots of things to say, inside of lots of things to say and 14 billion years, whatever.
Right.
It doesn't matter.
And the easiest story that I saw about this camera with the writers name, but there's this statue of a head.
That's in the Sands of Egypt.
5:15
All right, and it's bigger than this whole room and it's just the head.
It's worn out and then inscripted along the forehead, was it was that it was a tombstone, it says here lies, crazy name, whatever here last crazy name.
Who owned everything that the eye could see.
The Immortal so-and-so.
5:32
And the only thing that was left was a worn-out statue.
Had that no one knew who he was and it was 5,000 years old.
And so, if that guy who ruled the known world to him wealth, probably mattered.
Right?
But does it matter?
5:48
No probably not.
And so, for me, I've relieved a lot of the pressure my life so that I could make better decisions by zooming, way out and thinking, ten thousand years from now, will this matter?
And if the answer is no, does it matter to me?
And then if I can make the decision of like good or bad based on my new context that I created then I can live a life, a lot easier.
6:09
And so for me, the help me decrease anxiety, it helped me decrease.
You know, sadness around certain circumstances and I'll give you the last example of this.
So I had a cat named Bill Chill Bill, rest in peace, homie.
Love the cat.
Really like the cat and he died.
6:24
Six some freak heart thing or something.
If you died in like two years and he was a a cute little cat, really nice dude.
Anyways, when he died, I was bummed.
I was like this sucks, then I thought to myself.
What if cats only normally lived six months, how stoked would I be that?
6:39
He lived four times, the normal length of a normal cat was like I probably really stuck.
I be like dude he lived a long life.
I can't believe we had him this long and all of a sudden my perspective around the death completely changed now.
It's like I was so grateful that I got to have him as long as I did.
Hey, guys, real quick.
6:56
If you're new to the podcast, I've a book on Amazon called 100 million-dollar offers that over eight thousand five star reviews.
It has almost a perfect score.
You can get it for 99 cents on Kindle.
The reason I bring it up is that I put over 1,000 hours in the writing that book and it's my biggest gift to our community.
So it's my very Shameless way of trying to get you to like me more and ultimately make more dollars to that later on in your business career I push the partner with you so that's my give go check it out Amazon and back to the show.
7:24
When you play with time and you play with volume, how regular is this, could it be worse?
What if worse is normal in?
This is what today was.
Well, then that's example of the cat or the traffic, like, then.
All of a sudden, you can make your current context much easier to deal with or even positive.
7:41
Even though you thought of it as negative because you ascribe to different meaning to it.
And then if we think about this on a very long time Horizon, we think that none of its really going to matter because in five hundred million years, the Sun is going to expand enough engulf the Earth and so on matter.
Like, literally everything that you do here is going to get in golf by the Sun and it'll only quote matter if we expand to the other, you know, universes.
8:01
Now imagine that you invented something that changes Humanity.
Like the guy who found fire, good dude, we appreciate him.
But you know what?
None of us knows name.
Did it matter for us?
Sure.
Does it matter that, that was his name and he was the guy, probably not.
When you look at your towns that you live in and you see, like, Henderson and Jacksonville right.
8:21
These guys were big deals.
Name cities after themselves.
And we barely know them and you probably have areas in your city that you would you would aspire to have a street named after you, right, where an entire County named after you Clark County, right?
But known as The Clarke, I don't know.
8:36
Clark is right?
I live here and so I think a lot of times we inflate the micro importance of things, when in reality, they aren't important at all and we just choose to make them meaningful.
First off, we have to be aware of the levers of meaning, that exist and then once you're aware of them, you can start moving them in your favor.
8:52
And then looking at your current condition Through different lenses and say what would this mean if it were amazing?
What would the conditions have to be in order for this to be an awesome thing?
And then all of a sudden, you just exit the game of happy sad and get to be your own game maker.
9:09
At least that's what I tried to do.
When I get upset, look at it, pull it apart thing.
Like is this real?
Is this true?
And then go from there?
I get asked about mindset a lot on podcast there like you have a unique view of the world Alex.
And to me it's weird because it's just how I see the world and so I don't to me it doesn't feel unique, it feels like how it is to me in general.
9:30
And so I have trouble sometimes articulating it because to me I expect that everyone else is thinking that way when sometimes, I was surprised that they weren't.
And so the first time this came out was on the ice coffee, our podcast, where they talked about just different views, I had on things, which apparently were contrarian, which I didn't know, and so it generated a lot of controversy.
9:47
Press and media around it.
And so my team said, hey do you think you could make a video just specifically around meaning since you talked about it so much with us.
And so this, although short is my best attempt to give you three different scenarios that I use to create an destroy meaning in my own life that helped me decrease my stress, increase the decrease, the emotional effect I have two circumstances so that I can make better decisions in my life.
10:08
And so I think the reason that people struggle with this a lot is because they try to control the uncontrollable they ascribe there.
Feelings to things that they are reactive to, which means if this, so they create these equations for themselves.
If this happens, I'll be angry.
10:24
If this happens, I'll be upset.
If this happens.
I'll be, I'll be stressed and so their life is just a series of piano keys that are being played on their emotions and they have no control.
Whereas, if you can flip the script and make it so that you were the one who writes, what that equation is then you can change with the keys mean.
10:44
So even though it's high on the keyboard over here, it turns out Over here when you hear it because you're the one who's setting, what that key means, rather than taking whatever the external circumstances.
So if people treat have to treat you a certain way for you to be happy, then it means that your happiness is in their hands.
11:04
If you have to have a job raise, or amount of income every month that you have to make in order to be fulfilled, then you set up circumstances for yourself to not be fulfilled, right?
And so, we Want to make at least, in my opinion, the feelings that we have, we want to derive them off of circumstances that we can control.
11:24
And then what happens is, then you create the shell around yourself, not realistically, but because internally is where your emotions are being generated.
Now, is anyone doing this perfectly?
No, but simply being aware of the fact that these piano keys are being played, but we are the ones who get to assign what the sound is internally gives you a lot more control over your own perception of.
11:47
Life in the conditions that are presented to you.








0:00
Hey guys, real quick.
So Leyland are definitely working on our social media presence.
If you guys haven't noticed and we're just breaking now into LinkedIn.
All right.
It's not as bad as I thought it's actually pretty awesome so far and you guys have been really cool in there and people are sharing our stuff a lot.
So if we aren't connected on LinkedIn, it go ahead and let's connect and let's rock and roll.
0:17
What's going on everybody?
Man, I am.
I've been, I've been a little uh a little bit of a tear with these videos.
So I Aaj eyes.
But I've just had a couple things just come up recently and I've been feeling them.
0:36
So we had a little incident internally that I feel like I just couldn't not talk about, and I was just feeling The Vibes, I'm gonna go with it.
So I'm going to try and attack something that a lot of people talk about.
0:52
But I'll tell you how, I think about it.
So oops.
Sorry about the wind the number one strategy for long-term business and personal.
Success right.
His honesty is being truthful and there's a couple different dynamics that happen with truth, right?
1:10
Is that when you are dishonest, it affects you first because you've heard me talk about attention in the power of having focus on a single thing.
Right attention is power.
1:26
The like the definition of power is the speed which with thoughts can become reality.
So if you think about God as being up, Nippon it as he thinks things become right.
It's seamless as he thinks them, they become.
Right.
And so for a human being, the only way that we can speed that process up is having as much attention as we possibly can have.
1:47
So let me paint you a picture.
So if you've ever had something that you wanted to talk to someone about whether it's your spouse, whether it's an employee a customer, right?
It eats at you like all day long.
You're like, man, I'm thinking about you keep playing these things in your Edge like, how am I gonna see this?
2:03
Like or worst case you don't want to say anything, right?
You don't say anything at all and you lie, right?
And starts eating at you.
What that is, is it's a tension, right?
It's that you actually have to use up some of your attention, this limited resource, the most valuable resource that you have in your life.
2:20
You have to put some of that attention on this lie that you have to keep.
And so the person that it hurts his you, right?
And so you need like, for example, let's say that you, I'm going to say, Worst case scenario, let's see.
You cheated on your wife, or if you're a woman you cheat on your husband, right?
2:37
It will destroy you as a person.
If you keep it in right truth is not the thing that hurts.
It's, the sin right?
Truth is the first step towards repentance and becoming free of it, right?
But you get that attention back, okay?
And so when you feel that feeling when you tell someone something that you've wanted to tell them and then all of a sudden you like what that feeling is is you getting your attention back.
3:01
Okay.
And so if you want to have a Surefire way of not succeeding in life lie, cheat steal.
You will mess yourself up.
Guaranteed, I promise.
Okay.
And so if you're doing like the only way to win is to be radically honest.
3:19
And I guarantee you and this is what happened for me.
I had a situation in my life once where this is way long ago, way way, way way, way, way long ago like in high school, okay.
And at the time, I Man, I probably shouldn't say this.
I was, I was in a relationship.
3:35
I never dated anyone before Layla Layla was the love of my life since day one, but before that I had, I had feelings for two girls and I didn't know what to do, okay, I didn't know what to do.
And so I didn't know how to manage a Web of Lies.
3:53
I was like, I have no idea how to even even even attack this.
And so I just said, hey, I've got feelings for both of you.
I don't know what to do and they'd be like, what are you doing?
I'm like, I'm gonna go see someone.
So right now, I'm like, yeah.
And then the other one would be like, I'm going to go see someone so, and they'd be like really, I'm like, yeah.
4:11
And then what happened is, they ended up meeting without my knowledge and having dinner together.
What do you think they talked about, right?
And both of them came back after it's being like Got a lot of respect for you.
Like, you always, you told me everything that was always happening.
4:28
Like, you didn't keep anything.
We compared both of our notes, and like you said it everything.
And in that moment, I was like like the truth and I was like, I was sold on the truth.
I was like, oh my gosh, I just want, I navigated a Minefield by just saying what was on my mind and so if you're if you're in an employee situation, you're like I don't know what to say.
4:53
Say what you Would tell me, like, I have gym owners come to me all the time.
Like, I don't know.
It's like I got this employee.
I feel like they're not invested anymore, but like I'm kind of worried about them stealing my clients because I rely on them all the stuff.
I'm like, just tell them that feel like I'm really worried because I feel like you're not invested anymore, not and I see you talking to someone.
5:09
So after class all the time and I feel like you've got, you've gotten closer to them.
Like, is there something I should be worried about?
Because it's like right now, it's eaten on me and I don't want to keep it to myself, right?
The truth always wins, right?
And if you, and that's why I'm trying to This picture on the flip side is that if you don't live that way, if you don't work your marriage that way, if you don't work your business, that way, if you don't manage your employees you don't manage your clients that way with truth first, you'll lose and not because because a eventually it always gets found out.
5:38
So if you ever think they're going to hide something from the world like was it's like shoot, there's this beautiful poem about it's like truth.
Truth, always comes up as sure as the sun or something like that but it's it's like you can always count On the truth being unveiled.
5:55
Always it never doesn't stay hidden and so like you're just playing this temporary gain that eats up all your attention and then you get back like totally screwed on the back end when you do get found out and on the flip side, if you're honest, people are like man.
He totally had an opportunity to lie there and he didn't and then your status points, go up and people believe you more.
6:14
And they go all in and then go more and more.
They trust you more and they trust you more than you gain more influence, you and more status.
This is virtuous cycle or vicious cycle and the thing is is you like once You lose it.
You lose it forever.
Most Nation real quick.
6:30
If you are a business owner that has a big old business and wants to get to a much bigger business, going to 50 $100.
Plus, we would love to talk to you and if you like that or like to hear more about it, go to acquisition.com, you can fly anywhere on the page and talk to one of our team and see if we can help you get there.
6:49
And man, I just, I just really grinds my gears.
And there was this, there's this, if anyone seen Ozark, don't know if you've ever seen the show, always Arc but episode 2 or something like that.
The drug lord is looking at Jason Bateman and they got like three of his Partners, they just killed one of them and like, oh my God, they're totally scared.
7:09
And he tells the story about how his father, like The Godfather caught like little Juanita stealing from their grocery store, right?
And the mother and the kids Loved her to death.
She'd been there for 10 years and that all she took was five bucks, and she put in her pocket, she walked out the door, and they were like Juanita.
7:25
Why did you do this?
And they caught her?
And the mother was like, no, let him go, let him go, like I'm sorry, Let Her Go, Let Her Go.
Like, it's not a big deal like like, like, like will forgive her, if like, if she needs the money, we can give it to her and he looks at Jason and Jason Bateman.
He's like what do you think?
7:41
Do you think we did with Juanita right?
And after that he liked kills, two more people then it goes to Jason Bateman.
He's like you fired her.
He's like because it wasn't the first time she stole from you.
It was just the first time you called her Right?
7:57
And I just remember that scene.
And I was like, man, that's truth, right?
Because what it is, it's a character trait.
It's a character trait, when things get rough.
Some people fold, right?
You want to be the type of person that you're like, like that.
Five years later, you pay back your debts because it talks about who you are, right?
8:16
And if you're somebody, who's a Believer, God gives the care about your assets.
He cares about your character because the whole this whole game that we're on is to see, like, was it?
Like humans are like Tea bags, when, when the water boils, what comes in, what's inside comes out, right?
8:33
So when things get tough, It's not that you change, it reveals who you are, right?
It reveals who you are and if you live with truth and you always speak that you can never get screwed.
And you know what?
Honestly it's a lot easier to live life because thing about truth is a lot like Shame.
8:51
Shame is is when you have this deep dark secret that you don't want to tell anyone, you don't want, I want to know but the moment you say it it loses its power.
Shame only has power in the darkness right?
In not being told in Iceland.
So what it does is it pulls you away isolates you right?
9:07
That's a pride does.
It's because you don't want people to see you in a certain way.
You isolate yourself.
That's what Pride does, right?
And so when you speak truth and you say, the things that are on your heart, right?
No one can fault you because you said them, you're like, listen, I'm struggling with this.
I know I'm not good at this, but if you claim it and it's yours, no one can fault you for that.
9:26
That and then you start and start people start believing you feel like hey I know where I stand with Alex, right?
And I've had complex business dealings in the past I've had mixed incentives, right?
I've had to do with Affiliates where they're like, man, we give you some huge deals on gym owners and I was like, you guys aren't the best pick for Jim's man.
9:44
And they're like, but dude, and I like the guys and I'm like, I really like him, I could not the best pick right now, I'm sorry, but they always knew where I stood rather than like and like that's how I want to be known at least as a business person.
Like you always know where Alex stands with you.
Tell you where we're at.
Like, I don't think your products the best right now.
If you get it to be better, we'll be there, right?
10:01
I'll always be there.
You can always count on me that if you were if gym owners, best interest is with your product.
I'll be first in line, right?
I'll be first in line, you can always trust on me for that, right?
And so let everyone know where you stand with them, right, and just speak it.
10:17
Like just tell them what it is and honestly, your relationships will improve.
You'll be closer to people because people already know, like, if you've got this thing with one of your employees like this, They've been bugging you and like you kind of you're not, you're not cold there, you're not cold yet but you're like one step before their you're standoffish, right?
10:35
They feel it.
You feel it?
So just acknowledge it like hey, the other day you said something.
I felt a little weird.
Maybe, maybe it's just me.
It's, did you feel that?
Maybe they say no be like, okay, was just me.
Did you mean that when you say like, this is how I took it and then they'll be like, no I didn't.
I didn't mean it like that and like oh great there's just me then right happens all the time but that way doesn't eat you alive.
10:56
I've because lies take your attention, they make you weaker, they make you less potent, they make you less powerful.
And then ultimately the dreams and the reality that you want to create, you're less able to do it because you have this Web of Lies behind you that you're constantly trying to maintain this image.
You're trying to keep for everybody, right?
11:15
Man, I love you guys.
This one was just on my mind and like, dude, this is how you, this is, how you like truth is, what keeps marriages truth is, what keeps businesses truth is.
What's keep clients, truth is at the center of it and truth always wins.
Always comes out.
11:31
Everyone always finds out and it's just a question of what kind of character you want to have?
You want to be someone who's known for truth?
Going to be someone who know, like, who people always know where they stand with you or doing some, like who is Shady right?
Like ha you stand offish like I don't know.
We ever know how I where I stand with Alex.
I don't know where where he's at, right?
11:49
So anyways, if you ever have the hardest situation it's just ask yourself what kind of person I want to be, right?
And just think about it like that.
I want to be able to tell the story of like I had all these issues and I lost it.
All right, I've told you guys, I was on the brink of bankruptcy in November 2016.
I I went into a Business Partnership that didn't work out.
12:07
I put all my working capital, all the savings that I had into this new Venture money got funneled out census In person filed bankruptcy, it happens.
You know what I mean?
But like I can't pretend like I'm some perfect business owner.
I mess up all the time.
Constantly did I mess up all the time?
12:26
So like don't put me on some pedestal because I don't deserve it.
But hopefully this hopefully this speaks to somebody who's who's here in this right now.
Maybe you got something on your heart.
You need to tell somebody, maybe it's an employee, maybe it's a client, just do it.
Because if you don't, you'll become less powerful, you become less potent.
12:43
You Be able to do the things you want to do.
All right?
Lots of love guys.
Have an amazing night.
Sorry, for the influx of lives recently, but I've just had some things.
I had to have to get off my chest.
Let's Love, talk to you soon.
Be able to do the things you want to do.
All right?
Lots of love guys.
Have an amazing night.
Sorry, for the influx of lives recently, but I've just had some things.
I had to have to get off my chest.
Let's Love, talk to you soon.

What's the nation?
Welcome to part 2 of the founders podcast that we are continuing from last episode.
First thing we're talking about is big money in tiny markets.
It's something the very passionate about and there is lots of money there and I'll talk about how to unlock it within your own business.
Second thing is how you speak and how you think and how you approach The Narrows and situations is going to predicate how successful you are in any Endeavor, you do especially entrepreneurship and how to break that down as a business owner.
0:23
And we bring it home with the biggest mistakes that I see entrepreneurs making in the space right now, that you may be making, And candidly.
You probably are making, if you're not growing at the rate you want to.
This is not me.
Projecting it onto you.
I'm just trying to help you fast track and shortcut to a place that you want to be faster.
So hope you guys enjoyed this as much as I enjoyed.
0:40
Making it for you, I had all the gyms I did the turnarounds and then I had zero dollars, five years later because of mistakes that I made.
But the things that I was gaining was not the money, it was skills.
There's the character traits in the beliefs Welcome to the game where we talk about it, get more customers how to make more per customer and how to keep them longer in the many failures and lessons.
1:00
We have learned along the way.
I hope you enjoy and subscribe.
Can you tell me also about kind of the tiny Market, Big Money process.
Like how you finding Niche markets that are overflowing with cash?
1:16
I would say, they're not as truly overflowing with cash, but I think if we can apply a standardized framework to how we approach their business is, Sounds silly but like you can plug into the universe as money and then you can have as much money as you want.
So for example, let's say I was working with, you know, hairstylists typically not what most people would consider a very affluent you know, demographic.
1:38
Now there's plenty of them and it's definitely a niche, but they're not considered I would say, you know, super wealthy, but if I know how to Market and sell and deliver high-value services and I show them how to do that and they can immediately.
Generate, let's say 5,000 10,000 dollars.
1:54
Using a system that I've put together for them so they can run their business model.
I don't need them to have money, I need my system to work and then have the system.
Make them enough money to pay me and that's the key Point.
Like, with any of these things, it's like I've never operated on how much money someone has.
2:12
I operate on how much money I can make them, and then I siphon off of that.
And so I'm going to dive a little bit tactical on this, but I think it would be valuable to the audience.
So there's a, there's a process that we have followed and every company that I've ever built and this Us will be in the third book is called money models, but it's called client finest acquisition at least that's what I call it.
2:30
And so client acquisition is when you have essentially a negative acquisition cost and the equation for that is for me that I must make in 30 day, cash, right?
Which is something that I call but just the amount of cash that I can take from a customer in net, free cash flow in the first 30 days and the first 30 is is important, which I'll get back to why it's important to second.
2:50
But the amount of money that I can generate from a new customer in the first 30 days and net, free cash flow.
You must exceed two times, the cost of acquisition in the cost of fulfillment.
If I can do that, then it means that I no longer in capital constraints for growth and so I can use the cash.
3:06
So let's say, I quietly take cost me a hundred bucks to acquire customer, right?
And let's say it cost me a hundred bucks to film, all right, so $200 is, is my cost.
I have to make two times that in net, free cash.
So I would have to price.
3:22
I would have to be selling whatever the widget is.
I'd have to Generate six hundred dollars in cash in the first 30 days from that Prospect.
If I can do that, I cover their cost of fulfillment and their cost of acquisition and the cost of acquiring and fulfilling the next customer off of that initial and I still have money left over to then profit.
3:44
Hire more people, Etc.
And so, that is what we try to design an acquisition system that we build independent of Market.
Whether it's for photographers, whether it's for certifications, whether It's for Jim licensing.
Whether it's for e-commerce, we do it in every single vertical or in and we continue to push the model until we achieve that.
4:03
And then at that point, we no longer have a marketing budget.
We can spend as much money as we damn.
Well, please in the acquisition and then operations becomes the bottleneck of scale.
And so that is why each of the companies has scaled at such a rapid rate is because I don't need anyone's money to do it.
And why we phoned every one of the company's outright without taking on outside Capital?
4:22
You've talked around hundred exiting your prices.
And yet like actually acquire more clients.
How did you pull that off by making them an offer?
So good.
They felt super saying.
No the so I give the classic Dan Kennedy example.
4:40
Try like a lot which is let's say that we had a time management course, right?
Jared time management course yourself for 19 bucks.
You're not gonna be able to suffer really much more than that if I drill down down a little bit and made it a sales time.
Management course, I might be able to sell it for $99.
Finance down, even further and said outbound sales, our sales reps, I might be able to sell it for 500 dollars.
5:00
If I miss down even further, I might say, you know, Automotive outbound sales reps.
I might be able to sell that, same course for $2000.
And so, the difference between the $19 thing and the two thousand other thing is 100x difference in price and we were able to achieve that because the Avatar that we're selling it to you, we can clearly demonstrate how much one additional sale could mean for them in their paycheck over the year or maybe one more sale per month and then Radically show the discrepancy what what they're paying and what they're getting, right?
5:29
And so I feel like unless you are well, funded and well, capitalized and trying to go after like a market penetration strategy, which the vast majority of entrepreneurs were bootstrapped Etc, do not have that situation.
Then they have to go in my opinion in the other direction and say, how can I very specifically find an avatar that I will have a competitive Advantage because I will understand their needs wants desires problems Etc.
5:52
And I can in a very real way, provide more value than No one else can because I am so nuanced and who I serve and then with that Niche, down, messaging positioning problem, solving and cetera.
I then generate outsized profits, which then allows me to spin the acquisition machine so I can get more customers.
6:09
I can spend more money to get higher quality Talent, provide a better experience etcetera.
Look if there's one thing that you wanted people to walk away from kind of everything you're doing on the education piece, the the knowledge, sharing the books, what would that be give more And I think Gary Vee says this.
6:27
Well, he says, you don't listen to what I'm saying, but watch what I'm doing right?
And I think that most people could learn more by watching, the entrepreneurs will moves.
They're making rather than necessarily what they're saying.
And part of that is because I think you know you don't always you're not always consciously aware of the moves you're making, right?
You just you only remember to say XY and Z but there's more Nuance to the thing is is I think that Goodwill compounds faster than revenue does.
6:49
And so I believe that if you truly give tremendous value and Tremendous being the operative word here.
I think most people are like, do my content so good.
It's like, yeah, but no one watches and if it were so good you'd have more people watching it.
Right?
If you give a tremendous amount of value better than what everyone else is paid stuff is and that's and that has to be real, right?
7:09
Like that has to be real, people say that, but it's not true and that's the hard part is that the self awareness piece of like my stuff so good, but it probably is just why you're not making the money 10 times because you think you are.
But if you actually can deliver truly more than anyone else can And you can price it at zero, the amount of Goodwill that you get becomes viral.
7:29
And then at that point, you will have more demand than, you know, what to do with.
And then at that point, you'll have this desire to liquidate the demand the Goodwill and monetize it.
But that's what you should resist doing and instead double down on giving more and only only skimming off a handful that you can service at a high level.
7:49
And by doing that you never have to keep generating demand, you will always have more demand than you want and that demand will continue In you to multiply and I talked about this in the book, in the delicate, dance of Desire by which is like, if we can just Circus the absolute best customers, the best avatars who perfectly fit the problems, that we know how to solve better than anyone else.
8:06
Everyone else gets value from you in the marketplace and the people, that you specifically select be, your customers will get outsized returns.
They'll Rave about you, more people will demand what you want and again, you sell less than your ability to sell and I think that's the dance that most people mess up and so if I had to consolidate it into It's your words, it's get more and if you give more than you take the marketplace will always reward you.
8:30
But most people their messaging is just you know, give take to take, give take whereas rather than like the true like give give give and my opinion is give gift.
Gift, gift gift gift.
Keep going.
And eventually you just start getting.
You don't even have to ask you to start getting.
8:47
That's just something that I have lived through.
And I think that if that became real, for more people, more people would become zillionaires. but it requires the the big p word, which is patience and most people have Look, wise, you guys already know that.
I don't run any ads on this and I don't sell anything.
9:05
And so, the only ask that I can ever have you guys that you help me, spread the words, we can help more entrepreneurs, make more money, feed their families, make better products and have better experiences for their employees and customers.
The only way we do that is if you can rate and review and share this podcast, so the single thing that I have to do is you can just leave review, but taking 10 seconds or one type of the thump, it means the absolute world to me.
9:25
And more importantly, it may change the world for someone else.
I'm curious as well.
I want to talk about mindset.
Not sexy, often, often kind of overlooked.
But you know, you, you've had serious success for someone your age.
9:45
I'm curious kind of like what what gives you the ability to go out and kind of sell and do what you do?
And not even just selling.
But like even the way that you speak like you really command a lot of confidence, how do you acquire that we always do?
This way or yes?
10:01
Or no.
I think we have natural proclivities.
And we have natural tendencies that we're better at than other things, just from our upbringing, whatever.
But I've thought a lot about this and I think that there's there's three pieces to it their skills beliefs and character traits.
And hopefully it's not repetitive for you.
10:18
Probably heard me say this but like I see the ladder of success is having three sides.
You both poles.
And you've got the middle, the middle handles that you need to climb up.
I think that a lot of times entrepreneurs are lopsided they'll have.
Let's say there's there's Skills might be up to the 10th, 10th story of the building.
Their, their traits might be to the sixth sixth floor, the left pole, but the handles their beliefs might be to the third and then there are curious and why they can't get past the third pole.
10:44
And then they keep growing their traits from the 6th and 7th or their their skills from the 10th to the 11th.
But they can't get past the third thing.
It's because they don't adequately understand what their limitations.
And so I think that's the like having that level of discernment and awareness of figuring out what my true bottleneck is if people solve problems that aren't problems their circumstances, right?
11:06
And so they put all this energy and effort to save you.
I need to get another copywriting course, the copper atoms at the weak Link in the chain, as they keep for defying a piece of the bridge.
But there's a part that has a brick missing in a kink of the dollar across the bridge, but the side on the right, has 17 pillars holding it up to hold up all this traffic.
11:21
That's not coming because they're missing something very simple.
And I think that's It's the I think that's the piece but in terms of the commanding the confidence, I don't think that there's actually hacked this and so I feel pretty passionate about this.
So we've used the terms, I had somebody didn't all live audience, asked me to send something came out of my mouth and people kept repeating it which is you have to outwork your self-doubt.
11:43
And so when we talk about sales processes, or if I talk about monetization structures, I talk about, you know, creating offers right?
Really decide only give so much confidence and conviction in this.
It's because I've done it to me.
Fucking times, right?
And so, when people were asking me, like, and I'm going to, I'm going to really drive this because I think it's important.
12:02
So, when we started the gym business, right?
And this is just because so many people are learning from people in the e-learning space, and I think it's good to have a lens through which to make decisions, right?
Of how, how much am I going to wait?
This person's opinion, right?
So, I had one Jim, and it was successful.
12:18
And then I had a second gym.
And after I'm a second Jim, I didn't start selling how to make a gym successful.
I had a third gym, and then I add a fourth gym.
And then I to 15 and then I just six gym, right?
And then at that point, I didn't sell of course on how to make him successful, then I spent a year and a half flying out because I had an offer that no one can say no to, which was don't pay me anything.
12:36
I'll generate. 100 percent of the sales are risk.
My own money.
Fly out there and do it myself and I did 33 turnarounds.
So 33, different markets, sat at the front desk for three and a half weeks and sold memberships all day long.
I 4000 sales face-to-face, my bail before we started Jim launch.
12:58
And so I think what happens is what I was talking about.
That Goodwill thing.
It's like, people are so, so impatient to jump to the next level of the pyramid that they don't build the foundation.
And I it's my belief that the peak of the pyramid is predicated on the On the thickness and width of the foundation that you build and that's the rocky cutscene that.
13:19
Most people are not willing to go through like you were like how you cheated, like there's five years of my life that disappeared.
In fact, I lost all the money which I talk about in the book.
I had all the gyms I did the turnarounds and then I had zero dollars, five years later because of mistakes that I made.
13:34
But the things that I was gaining was not the money, it was skills, who's the character traits and the beliefs and those are the assets that I was able to take with me.
And then the next thing NG, because, all I had, because I had the traits, and I had the skills.
I had already run a huge sales team.
I was already used to doing 20 30, 50 sales a day face-to-face.
13:53
Like I knew how to do a high volume sales associate.
I knew how to Market, I knew how to write copy, and you had to buy media, like I knew how to off this stuff and you had to deliver on the thing.
But the thing that I was lacking was the belief in terms of the opportunity vehicle that I need to wrap those skills in.
And once I had an outside person who came in and said, hey, I think you should use this vehicle instead of this vehicle.
14:13
That's Everything took off from but people see that overnight success but it was because the foundation of both sides of that of that ladder that were built.
And I was just missing three or four of these pegs and all of a sudden I was able to spring up from three million dollars a year to 30 million dollars a year in 12 months.
14:29
But it's because all these things were in place.
Sorry, I knew that was I just wanted to hit back on the other one about confidence is, like, most people are looking for a hack.
When the reality is that you're just not as good, you're just not that good.
And the way to be confident is to do it more times.
To do it so many times that it's obvious to you that it is boring to you.
14:48
Once it gets boring is when people you'll sound like you are confident.
But to you it'll be matter of fact because that is just how it is because you've observed it in reality not in theory so many times.
The problem is most of the guys were saying the stuff or only saying it because they heard someone else say and the regurgitating theory but they never experienced it.
15:06
And that's the kind of grim people can hear.
Last question is just kind of like biggest mistakes, common mistakes.
You see people make, especially early stage, entrepreneurs startup Founders, what's like the biggest mistake?
You see entrepreneurs making in 2021, it's Rush the biggest mistake.
15:25
I mean, I always look so bad Anita knows, 19 year-old Amber and who kept trying to make a mixed-use, trying to be a Millionaire, right?
Every month, he's trying to win millionaire with the new thing.
It was like, if you could sign a contract with me and I said, I could guarantee that you'll be a millionaire in 10 years.
We are not going to make anything between now and then we sign it.
He said yeah, it sounded and I was like cool.
15:42
This is your note.
This is this is your employment agreement.
Now you're working for me in ears are cold call.
And so we started Coco.
And he started his way now, he's like, you know, he's one of the top causes on our team.
He's worked his way up, three rungs of the ladder and our sales teams, and now, he's 19 years old, making 100 Grand a year, right?
16:00
Because he's taking everything to heart, he's got Hustle, but this is just the beginning of his journey.
There's lots of other skills along that I'm going to start putting in and putting into place.
So that when he is done that, instead of having a four-year degree where he's going to learn how to chug beer, right?
Four years from now he's going to have 500,000 saved up and he's going to have all the skills.
16:19
So that he can start his his next thing the right way with experience inside of a business, knowing what it's supposed to be.
And so the biggest mistake that they make is that they're such a rush that they try a new thing every 90 days.
And my fear is that they're going to be so many guys have been trying to make it big in 90-day Sprint's on the next new thing that 10 years from now, they think they're 90 days away.
16:40
When if they just stuck with the same thing for 10 years, it would be unreasonable for them.
Not to be exceptional because no one has stick-to-itiveness.
And if you stick with it, even if you suck, you'll be better than most people after a year.
And after 10 years will be almost Untouchable because no, 16 of any man, that was an epic story sir.
16:59
So you got an apprentice he actually saw in the contract.
Yes he started working with us.
Wow that's cool.
He's trying to wholesale real estate and I walked in on him because you've got some coarse or whatever on the Annette and he was like, I was out, always has like, how many deals you got home and you know yet it's always zeros, have many deals, have anything else yet?
17:15
And then I will walked in on him while he was trying to close the deal once and he hung up and I was like, dude it's like I know you haven't cousin deals.
He's like what it was like you suck at sales and he was like and then he like pause for things.
17:31
Like how do I get good at sales and I was like, you sell and I was like so you know, you can try to do it on your own.
I was I can just feed you volume all day and you can get, you know, 100 reps a day every single day and you're going to you can massively condense that, that learning was like, well, do that looks like and you can get paid as a penguin.
17:52
It was like, well, I guess I'll do that.
So yeah, there you go.
Awesome.
We'll look guys, we're going to move to Rapid Fire questions.
About three questions for you.
Age-old question, does money make you happy?
Yes or no explain your answer?
Yes in the it provides you.
18:10
You the time to have the thoughts, so I think it opens the door to give you the potential to answer life's harder questions.
But if you were stuck in, scarcity and survival, you can never get to that.
Or it's very difficult.
I'll say to get to that level.
Not saying it's impossible, it's just difficult.
Where do you see yourself ten years from now?
18:28
What's the big picture beyond the money?
It's the, it's the scale of the learning.
So for me, part of the reason that I want to build acquisition.com to expand a little bit on it is because I don't, I don't know anybody who's like, a specialist in this space and taking companies from like 3 or 5 to 50 to 100.
18:46
And I was like, man, we've done it three times on our own and we've got a fourth one, under our belt, in a portfolio company and I'm like, I'll bet you if I did it.
A hundred times, I would be able to write the sickest book about it and then that, that piece of knowledge would be public domain and more companies.
19:02
Could do it.
So I would just see that as like, me laying one brick, you know, on the path for, you know, the next season of entrepreneurs?
Yeah, that's almost a last one.
If you could have Dina with any entrepreneur Dead or Alive, who would it be and why the hard call for me?
19:19
I really like Charlie and warm, but I feel like, I know what they'd say Elon is just so brilliant.
I'm not sure if I would catch everything, he was saying, Jeff is really brilliant, but I feel like I could, I feel like I could communicate with them.
Him and I'll tell you what, I would ask him.
19:35
I would say if you look at my skills, my character traits and my viewpoints of the world and you were in my shoes.
What opportunities would you pursue?
Because he is a better Vantage Point than me so you can see what I can't see.
Mmm.
Yeah, love it, man.
Look, this was an awesome interview will wrap their but thank you so much for your time.
19:53
It's great to connect.
Keep doing what you're doing, really enjoying your content and yeah we'll wrap their.
Thanks so much man, thank you so much.
For having me was honored to be here.








Company0:00
Real quick.
Because you guys already know that, I don't run any ads on this and I don't sell anything.
And so, the only ask that I can ever have you guys that you help me spread the word so we can have more entrepreneurs, make more money, feed their families, make better products, and have better experiences for their employees and customers.
And the only way we do that is if you can rate and review and share this podcast, so the single thing that I have to do is you can just leave review will take you 10 seconds or one type of the thumb, mean, the absolute world to me.
0:25
And more importantly, it may change the world of someone else.
We want to be able to uh, Ideally cash flow the acquisition, which means that in the first 30 days, the customer.
We want to be able to make back to cash that it cost us to acquire them.
The wealthiest people in the world.
See business is a game.
0:40
This podcast, the game is my attempt at documenting, the lessons.
I've learned on my way to building acquisition.com into a billion dollar portfolio.
My Hope Is that you use the lessons to grow your business and maybe someday soon partner with us to get $200 and Beyond.
I hope you share and enjoy.
There are six ways to get customers.
The first four way is the core four ways?
0:57
You let anyone know about anything.
So you let people, you know, 101 about the stuff you sell you, let people know publicly about the stuff you sell, you let people, you don't know, privately about the stuff you sell and you let people know publicly about the stuff that you saw from those four ways, you can leverage the other two ways which is referrals and Affiliates, you have to do those four things to get customers.
1:16
We have to do this for things to get, Affiliates, and then those Affiliates in turn, do those four things?
Now, when you let a stranger 101, Know about the stuff that you sell, that's called cold outbound.
All right?
And so what I want to talk about this video is cold out bound and a really interesting story that just happened.
Alright?
And so I've been of the belief that those four methods work for any business anyway, no matter what now, cold a pound is a little bit, more costly of a way of acquiring customers.
1:40
So, most times, it tends to be B2B businesses that sell higher ticket.
They can afford to pay people to do outbound etcetera to get customers, right?
And I had this belief broken for me because as a consumer or director consumer, This physical products may be smaller, ticket, higher volume business, most times anyone would use cold outbound, would be to get Affiliates and then there's Affiliates get customer.
2:00
So you can afford to get Affiliates because affiliate is worth more than a single customers.
So make sense, hopefully it does.
Now, I was thinking about I was like, but marketing always works.
So I just have to think about an example where it would be real and so Layla, I were walking on the beach and we saw these two girls who are, I was like along the boardwalk, and these two girls were pushing a cooler full of energy drinks, you know that you can remember red.
2:23
Did this back in the day and I thought about it for a second.
I was like, okay, they're handing out cans of energy and there has to be some Financial Roi on this.
So let's do the math.
So I go up to the girls because they're like, hey, do you want to thing?
I was like, actually not really, but let's talk and so I asked them, how many cans do you guys give out a day just like 1,000.
2:44
It's okay, you give out 1,000 cans.
How many hours does that take you?
Do you like six hours and the amount of they make per hour is about 20 bucks an hour.
And so, Figure, six hours is 120 each 240 with taxes, maybe 260 270 whatever, right?
Okay.
So there's two hundred and seventy dollars in labor.
3:01
Now how much does a can of energy drink or can of whatever soda cost?
Well believe it or not cans of soda on their own cost very little.
It's actually mostly water and there's just a cost of cancer you're talking probably like 25 cents to make a soda.
All right.
3:16
Probably less than that like Coca-Cola cost less than for them that but let's just use 25 cents for the example, all right?
The biggest cost for a consumer product especially The lower ticket, one is the shipping, so the cost for them to get the soda, to the gas station, is the vast majority of the cost, the cost of the product is very little, all right?
3:32
So when they give 1000, they can ship a pallet all at once to one location or pallets.
All at once to one location, they stack them in a warehouse and then teams of two girl teams that look cute.
That can get attention, get these coolers full, put 1,000 cans in and have to give them out.
3:47
So let's do the math.
So if they give out 1,000 cans in a day, which is what they said thousand times 25 cents is 250 Asian product and let's just round and say it cost $250 in labor.
So it's $500 a day is what their cost per day of this one single two-person team is.
All right, now let's try and figure out the return on this for them.
4:06
So if they can and we can also figure out the cost per can hand it out.
So if we're giving out 1,000 cans and a cost 500 bucks, then cost 50 cents to deliver a can to a potential customer.
All right, that's our cost is now.
Let's think about the lifetime value of somebody who actually gets the drink and enjoys it right.
4:23
Right.
So this is where having a very good product is so important because if you can give a can away for free of the thing that you sell and know that X percent of people will buy again, then you have an incredibly viral product Hey guys, love that.
You're listening to the podcast.
4:39
If you ever want to have the video version of this which usually has more effects, more visuals, more graphs, you know, drawn out stuff.
Sometimes it can help hit the brain centers in different ways.
You can check out my YouTube channel.
It's absolutely free.
So check that out if that's what you are into and if not keep enjoying the show, There's a good friend of mine.
4:58
That owns a bar business actually acquainted for the front.
But, anyways, he owns a bar business that get 63 percent of people who get their first order to buy again, which is crazy high for a consumable.
All right, now, I'm going to use a much smaller version of this because it's free and there was no purchasing and let's just say, four out of a hundred, so four percent.
5:19
Alright, one out of 25, people who buy, who get a can for free are willing to then consistently by cans.
Now a case of this Stuff is about 30 bucks for 12 cans, okay?
So if you wanted to buy a month's worth, it would be 30 times, two and a half, so 75 bucks.
5:35
So $75 a month if you drink one and a drink in the morning every morning which is what a consistent user would take.
Right now remember our cost per can is 25 cents.
Now the shipping of a really expensive, really spends because it's heavy 12 cans, might be somewhere.
5:51
Like five bucks fish direct to the consumer, okay?
So if we get $90 For those 30 cans, right?
And it costs us $15 and shipping plus 30 times 25 cents, which is eight bucks ish.
So eight bucks.
6:07
Plus the 15 got 23 bucks on 90.
All right, so we've got the rest of that which is the margin.
All right, so we've got sixty seven dollars per month and let's say the average person stays for five months which is $335.
All right, so let's say that's the LTV of a customer lifetime.
6:25
Now we handed out 1,000 Cans and we said only 4% become lifetime customers.
So that means that we have 40 people who would then become $335 of LTV 40 times. $335 is twelve thousand dollars roughly, right?
6:42
They spent 500 for that, that makes sense.
Let's say was one in even less than that, right?
Like let's say the ltvs 100 bucks and they only get one out of a thousand to us, right?
One percent.
So 10, out of 1000 people to become that type of Summer.
6:57
Well then they get 10 customers to give us $100 in LTV which means to get a thousand dollars on five hundred, right?
So the question is at what point, does it make sense to do this, right?
And I use this more of an illustration to show you that there are, is a zillion ways to let people know about the stuff you sell.
7:15
All right, there is never a lack of attention or traffic that's out there.
You just have to be able to afford it marketing always works.
It's just a matter of how efficient is it, if every person in the world, literally just I saw the name of your company and nothing else you would make money period, a certain percentage of the people would come and buy period.
7:34
The problem is, it's hard to reach every single person the world.
So marketing is not whether it works or not, but how well did it work?
And so it's good to have benchmarks for these things.
And I, this is one example that's in the leads book.
That's coming out soon.
And if you were watching this and maybe 30 out, and Boeing, check it out.
7:49
Anyways, so since it's a matter of efficiency, we need to have benchmarks.
And so for me, I like to have a minimum of a 3 2 1.
LTV to CAC ratio.
So that means the lifetime value of the customer in gross profit, not Revenue.
Because if you cost me ninety dollars to 50 100 or thing, I can only use ten to Market it.
8:06
Right thing about that.
So it's just on the profit margin that you have.
That's what you have to use your calculation for.
So you need a 3 2, 1, LT Vedic, ratio, Cactus cost of acquiring a customer.
So if a cost me $100 to get a customer and I make, I have to make at least $300 in LTV for it to be worth it, because I have to cover the cost of acquisition.
8:24
And then with the remaining two hundred dollars, Run my entire business and still have some left over for profit.
And so they've done a lot of research on this and so, three, two.
One is kind of the minimum LTV to calc ratio that is required for profitable growth.
All right?
And so it's good to have that Benchmark now.
8:40
Me personally, I tend to shoot really high.
I like to have 10 or more because I like having lots of profit.
I want to make lots of money while I grow, right?
And I genuinely believe it's a belief thing where, like, if you believe it's possible, it is.
And so people, I think they have their stint, like people thought of their standards, because 321 has been accepted.
8:55
A lot of people, just go to three, two, one.
Think you can have ten to one and then keep going, right?
And you just follow that level of your standard in the book.
I talk about how my lifetime we're trying to advertising, is 36 one right now.
It's continued to improve.
And now, the numbers would make sense because the deals that we make.
But fundamentally, if you believe it's possible, it is you just have to think about it, more cleverly.
9:13
All right?
And so I want to use this example to show you that cold outbound specifically works for any type of business.
You can use it for a direct-to-consumer business.
It can be knocking on doors, you can be handed out cans, it can be, it can be cold, calling cold, email called message, it can be direct mailing people do.
No matter, whatever it is, it's cold outbound.
9:29
You're letting people know one-on-one about the stuff that you sell, and if you do the math, you can make it work and just to clarify on this math, real quick, it would cost $75 if we're able to buy two and a half cases which we can.
So we have to buy three cases to get our, you know, our months worth of 12 cans because 12 plus 12 is 24.
9:46
Plus another half case gets us to 30 for the month, right?
And so 90 is what I did this math on and it's more important to think about just what the math is just to get to the LTV because that's the only number.
We really care about So, just back of nappin, and the reason I gave the second example after that with 100 bucks, is that it doesn't matter.
It's just do.
10:02
You understand the thinking process, which is this is how much it costs for me to get a new customer.
And this is how much I make per customer over the lifetime of them being with me, right?
That's the big thing that we need to look at.
And as an added caveat, we want to be able to ideally cash flow, the acquisition, which means that in the first 30 days, the customer we want to be able to make back the cash that it cost us to acquire them.
10:26
So if it cost me a hundred, Dollars to get a new customer, my business, I want you to create an access of a hundred dollars of net free cash flow back to me to cover the expense.
Because if you can do that then you can take a credit card.
You can borrow the money for 30 days, you can get a customer and pay back the card.
So the customer was free and now you have no money that's owed and a customer.
10:44
You can sell for the rest of your life.
That's how you can profitably.
Grow even if your Capital constraint and so if you literally just figure out that part of the equation, Acquisitions no longer the bottleneck in your business and it will be something else further down the pipe.
And that's what we try to do.
Every business that we have the portfolios, how do we make it so that cash is not the restrictor of growth solve for number one.
11:04
Number two.
Now that we've eliminated caches the growth we can grow as much in as fast as we want which then means something else to become our barrier and then we attack that so let's say I was going to say I'm going to spend a thousand dollars a month on Facebook ads.
I spend $1000.
I don't have a thousand dollars back from those thousand dollars.
I sell ten people for $100 that wouldn't work because I have a cost to fulfill so I would have less money even if the LTV was ten thousand dollars, but if it if I made A $1000 back and my cost of folks.
11:29
It was 500.
I only make five hundred dollars back as my nephew cash, which means I'm down 500 at the end of the month, right?
So I need to make I need to fix my pricing fix my offer such that on that first 30 days of transactions with a customer.
I have at least the cost to acquire them in net free cash to me.
11:46
So the metric I use there is called 30-day cash, which is how much net free cash does a customer sped off in the first 30 days so that I can pay off a credit card to acquire the customer and then at that point you don't need to even use your Businesses money to acquire customers.
You just have a revolving credit line with it with the credit card company and the more you spend the more you pay back the more of the bump your limit.
12:04
All right, keeping awesome imagination lots of love and I'll catch you guys back.








Company0:00
Was a nation.
We've got a two-parter for you today.
This is part 1 of a podcast that I was invited on with Tanner Chester where we talked about one, how the role of having General business Acumen.
Can contribute to General business success, to how pain can be used to feel success and Third how to simplify your offers in such a way that they're both compelling, easy valuable and get people to buy them.
0:21
I think humans experience pain and then it just takes certain types of people, take the pain and let it beat the strength into them.
And other people take the pain and let it beat this drink out of them.
And they blame the person who caused that pain is.
The reason they are not successful rather than saying, I will not give this person power anymore over my life.
0:39
And so as a result of the pain that they beat into me, I will become stronger.
Welcome to the game, where we talked about it, get more customers how to make more per customer and how to keep them longer and the many failures and lessons, we have learned along the way.
I hope you enjoy and subscribe.
All right, so guys, I'm coming with you with the man, the myth, the mustache, Alex, your MOSI.
1:00
And, you know, it's actually start talking a lot recently had some good conversations with them and I just been great to get a perspective, a different perspective.
I think when I announce his strength to my own opinion is he just well, you, you think, you think a lot deeper than I thought, maybe you would and maybe because we're both like, in the gym space, so people are like, oh, they probably don't think that deep or whatever.
1:21
But I actually learned a lot of Valuable Insight from you, but guys, what we want to talk about today is his book 100 million-dollar offers, and yeah, right there, he's got the hard copy, you got hard taught, you got them.
All right, you got a hard copy.
I've got every version of bag.
1:40
How many years of knowledge would you say is packed into this thousands?
Um, I mean, it's just, it's just our knowledge scaling, our business, our businesses, rather, you know, for the last decade.
And how many, how many mistakes you think you made along the way a lot.
2:00
I can I can directly attribute probably like seven million dollars in profit of mistakes that I did not.
I did not make just from just from just like one chapter of that book.
Do you think that you most of the mistakes you made you think is from your own experience?
Do you think is from like hiring other people and then doing what they say?
2:18
But it doesn't work out the way you thought it would.
We're but maybe it's mixed.
It's a good question.
I would say sure.
It's other people stuff but like, I have also listened to other people.
So it's not like, I can like write other people off, it's just, you know, especially when you're starting out, you have mentors and coaches, and things like that.
2:33
And part of it is taking other people's experience, you know, at face value and going for it and a lot of the things earlier on did work out for me.
I think as we as as we got much bigger, you know, a lot and I know that you found out later, you know, how much we were doing for much longer in a time that most people knew, the people who were giving advice hadn't, even made the amount of money that way.
2:53
And so it was just very difficult for me to find people who I could whose perspective I could trust.
And that was, that was a very difficult thing for probably like a two or three year period, which is, you know, why we started acquisition.com.
And whatnot said to, hopefully provide that for people who are going from 10 million to 30 million, 250 million etcetera.
3:09
Yeah, it was that.
I mean, was it hard to find those people?
I'm genuinely curious.
Like I've had that same feeling and I'm not at your level.
So, that's how I felt was.
When I was looking for, people is trying to find those individuals who are truly at that level.
Was it hard for you to find them?
Yes.
But I think you can get there as much as like there's periods of time where you have to grind and like, put your shutters on.
3:29
I think there's like I think you execute until like all of the things that you have wanted to execute are executed and then I think you have to look back up again and look around until like, okay, I need more information and new frames and new lenses to see what I can't see right now because like, I always think like, if I were to talk to you on musk, like I wouldn't want to ask him questions.
3:48
I would just say like, what do you see that?
I don't see from my perspective, given my resources skills and character.
It's that that you would recommend, I should do given, what you see?
Because I wouldn't want to my questions are stupid.
You know what I mean?
It's, I mean, candidly, it's like, there was a, there's a, an acquaintance of mine who ended up sitting down with a guy who is a billionaire at the time and he was really fresh in his career and he was in the fitness space, and he ended up spending like the whole lunch asking about where to Source equipment from, and he always looks back at how stupid it was that these are the questions that he was asking this man, but it's because he just didn't know any better.
4:23
That, right?
And I think that that's what I try to avoid.
When I'm talking to people who have, you know, experience a different level as I try and I try and get them to ask the questions that I should be asking.
Yeah, so that's a great why I'm on the same mind frame where when I'm trying to ask someone heading me is like is this a good question because you sit there and sit there any debate.
4:41
I might this sounds like a good question like no that's um question it's like stupid.
I how do you get better at that?
You feel like it's a skill.
You've learned over time 100% I think asking good questions is probably the single greatest skill that an entrepreneur can have because asking a good question shows depth of thought like you can in my opinion you can tell how intelligent and what at what level someone's at based on their questions far more than the answers and if you ask God questions, you get better answers.
5:09
If you're a stupid questions, you get stupid answers.
And so, I think a lot of times, like, even when we're looking at our business, right?
And there's, there's a circumstance or situation or problem that arises, a lot of times it's like, Don't ask a quite like, even my team will ask you a question.
I'm like do you think that's the right question to be asking right now?
5:26
Yeah, because usually it's not it's not important at all.
It's totally different question.
We should be asking like, I'll give you, I'll give you a fun example.
So I had a very close friend of mine.
She does about 50 million a year and she takes about 20 home and she came to me, and she was like, Alex need to bring said, okay, what's up?
5:43
And she said, I need you to show me how I can make five million dollars in extra profit without Doing anything extra and then 60 minutes we did it.
And then she made an extra five million takes many years for four and a half million from one change in pricing.
But like, the thing is, is it was so evident because she was like, she wasn't like, how can I grow Top Line?
6:01
It's like, well, duh, There's A Million Ways To Go Topless, right?
But she was like, how can I?
And she adds constraints her questions.
And so, a lot of times, now, the questions I have have constraints and the goals that I have constraints.
How can I get two hundred million working two days a week?
Can you under million?
I know what I need to do, but how do I do doing two days a week?
6:17
You think different?
Yeah.
I love that.
I mean that makes total sense.
Is there any is there behind that you just said, two days a week?
Like is is it more of a challenge for you?
Or is there a reason you would do it?
Like in two days a week is just an example.
But is there a reason behind that or is it just more to have the challenge?
6:34
It's so like many things, I think there's multiple reasons, find it.
So one is, I think it would be a fun challenge.
The second is, I know how to get thing, I know how to accomplish things through sacrifice.
But I know that when I accomplish things to sacrifice, I end up resenting, the thing, and I don't want to resent the thing.
So, so to then shift the perspective outwards, the only games worth playing or games that you can continue to play.
6:55
So it's like if I'm helping Susie lose weight and I helped her lose weight for six months and then she drops off and then gains all the way back, who cares?
And so I'd rather have Susie just walk every day if she can absolutely keep walking.
And if she does that for the rest of her life, I've genuinely added 10. 20 years to her life and probably made her truly fit in a way that's reasonable and acceptable over the longer period time, which is the only thing that matters and so for the business community, And it's like I know that the person who can stay at it.
7:23
The longest most of the time we'll win because this just I have, there's too much time under the bar.
It would be unreasonable for me, not to win, because there's have too much more experience than everyone else.
And so, if that's the objective is, like, how can I play this game?
The longest then, then the question is, how can I do that?
7:40
And so for me, it's like, all right, well, if I spend two days a week in truly working, I'm going to put quotes here because the other days.
I'm obviously doing stuff.
I'm writing the book and recording videos and things like that but there's a Things that are like I love doing this right?
Those are I genuinely enjoy and if I don't feel like doing it, Was that I think I'd not like, actually inside the business.
7:59
Just other tasks.
Yeah, exactly.
And those are, those are fun creative flow test.
For me like, those are fun.
And so that was the idea is like if I can create the structure under which are circumstances under, which I could continue this for for perpetuity then I will win because I won't quit or switch gears because that's usually I mean entrepreneurs don't really quit, they just change shit because they just can't stand it, right?
8:22
I was going to ask you.
Do you think part of your Fitness background is white.
Successful.
Do you see that Trend among people who have a strong business background and maybe business success?
I actually don't think so at all.
I don't think they're related.
I think that people who have work ethic, then can learn Fitness, but most people who are, who are really into fitness.
8:42
This is, this is what I think, kind of interesting.
I think people who are really into fitness actually are really into fitness and never really developed the work ethic.
They actually just do it because they like it.
And so then they expect and they preach that they're like, I have just been waking up at 5 and like you love taking.
Pictures with your shirt off.
You guys love.
8:58
This is not, this is not you showing it.
Because here's the thing, that same person won't fucking do. 100 messages every day.
Right.
Right.
Right.
They won't.
They won't cold call.
They won't, they won't message.
They won't run ads.
They won't do the stuff that they're supposed to do because it's hard.
And so, they think that because it's hard for other people to do Fitness that, because they do Fitness, they are hardcore or disciplined.
9:20
When in reality they should have a preference or a proclivity to doing something that other people just tend not to Not to do.
But if you find me an entrepreneur, who's a winner and who has the work ethic and then you say, hey going to Fitness that person will be successful.
They might not become a body butter because they're not super passionate about it, but they'll get fit.
9:40
Hey guys real quick for those of you guys who are 100 million-dollar offers fans I love you.
I added in a lost chapter that has never been released.
I'm releasing it now transparently.
I'm doing that to build hype 400 dollar leads but you will have the unreleased chapter it talks about your first Avatar and how to segment customers to make more money.
9:58
You can get it by going to acquisition.com forward slash leads.
Its fo free in exchange for your email so that I can email you when we launched under Miller leads.
And so that you cannot miss out on it because last time I sold out for like eight straight weeks really fast.
So that is my way of making sure that y'all get first dibs.
10:16
What do you think is been the scariest moment along your journey so far?
I have a guess what?
It might be for me in your book, the worst and most painful period was when I started the first gym that was by far emotionally the hardest.
And I think it was because I was the most alone like I travel to a new area.
10:34
I didn't know anyone like when people laughed it was just me.
I had no friends.
I had no family, I had no.
I'd know nothing.
And so I would sit there in an empty gym be like, what the fuck am I going to do?
And so, any was You know me I just but I was so insecure and of having fearing failure and feeling the Judgment of what I thought other people would say about me.
10:54
That that was like the only thing that really compelled me.
And so it was kind of that pain that I was running away from the second probably hardest time was the one that I talked about in the book where we were, I basically lost everything that was that was pretty.
Shouldn't what I read from the book and we'll have a later question on it, but I feel like, you know, my parents had similar feelings about business.
11:16
Yes.
And so forth as yours did and I didn't feel a lot of support.
You think.
There's just, you see a trend among successful people who almost like they're running from not being a loser, or not being disapproved of in a sense because I know how you said that.
That was 100% my motivation.
11:33
Yeah, you know, like doing Michael Jordan, you know, and for him it was the comparison to his brother.
I'll rewind real quick, I think humans experience pain and then it just takes certain types of people.
Take the pain and let it beat the strength into them.
And People take the pain and let it beat the straight out of them.
11:48
And they blame the person who caused that pain is.
The reason they are not successful rather than saying, I will not give this person power anymore over my life.
And so as a result of the pain that they be into me, I will become stronger.
And as, and I will prove them wrong or whatever it is.
And I think that most people though, the the level of success I think in some way in the beginning is proportional to the pain that you experienced.
12:11
But then I do think that there is a switching point because once you have satisfied and I think that you're rubbing it in, This like right now and some of the conversation we've had is like there comes a point where you're like, it's not really reasonable for anyone to say that I'm not successful anymore.
There's no more marginal utility for money like another million dollars or another ten million dollars, truly changes, nothing about my life and so then I think that the motivation has to change and I don't think it happens overnight but I think that it does switch from a fear-based drive to to a to a pool base drive and as a fun quote that I like a lot is that most people don't know the difference between And motivation, most people just say conflate the two they just they assumed the feeling they have right now.
12:51
Maybe some people listening this that drive.
They might think it's motivation but it's actually fear.
And then when fear is gone because you've satisfied all of your needs then they don't know what motivation actually feels.
Is it feels different.
That's a good point.
You know.
I see even on like a YouTube channel that thing took off like a rocket ship bro.
13:11
You know, I think the thing that resonates with people is just your thoughts or like It's almost like where did you get this perspective?
Do you feel that a lot of your thoughts down come from this?
I mean obviously building a business to your size, you have to gain perspective.
But is it more the people who've been around is that the books you've read, or is it just literally just the experience of doing it?
13:31
I think I spent a lot of time not doing much so counter to the Grind culture.
Most of my days update, I don't have anything after this.
I didn't have anything till noon today three days a week.
I have nothing on my calendar.
So you know and so a lot of time, you know, I occupy my time just reading stuff that I you know, that seems interesting and they're usually totally disparate books and it could be anything from like religious stuff to pricing to whatever and I also think that my closest friend dr.
13:57
Kashi is basically a philosopher and he and I spent a long time talking about ideas and I think a lot of that comes into the context of death honestly.
So we talk about death, a lot because I think a lot of people don't like talking about death but in doing that I think we get a lot of perspective on what is important and why.
14:13
And so that's been helpful for me.
When putting together offers getting back to your you know your chapter in your book, do you think people have a natural tendency to make them complicate it or not to listen like when I read it?
It just seems so clear but do you still have people who fight you on it or try to overcomplicate it?
14:31
It really almost no stopping on the book.
Like every person is like I mean we've got a lot of good feedback from the book and I so not really.
I haven't had a lot of me.
I haven't had any negative feedback from the book, so I'm like, waiting for that.
But no, I think, I think it's a fairly clear structure and most people just see it at least two or three elements that they could include in their offer to make it more valuable.
14:52
And most times when people, like, as a thought, experiment for everybody, who's listening to this, The offeree, my opinion besides the marketplace, you are selling to is the most powerful lever you have on.
How much money you're going to make, right?
At least on the, the ability to sell stuff, which obviously is a skill in itself.
But if you're a really good offer, it's much easier to sell, right?
15:08
It makes your job easier.
And so, if I were to say, for example, anyone here, hey, I will double your business in the next 30 days, guaranteed or I'll pay you twice.
What you paid me, right?
That's it.
That is an offer structure.
There's an outcome.
There's a timeline.
15:24
There's guarantee, right?
And I'm only Two people, right?
There's some scarcity for you.
And so just like that that would probably be right now, a compelling offer to most people here, right?
And depending on the price would just, they just have to factored into what doubling the profit or doubling their business would value them, you know, if you're making 10 grand a month and I charge a million dollars for that, then it might not make sense.
15:45
But if you're making a million a month that it totally makes sense, right?
And so then it's a very easy decision for the prospect.
It doesn't take a lot of salesmanship.
It's just a simple decision, right?
Best case, worst case your it is right?
And so, If that's the extreme example, then if we take that extreme and just say how many steps backwards do, we need to take until we arrive at something that's reasonable scalable.
16:06
Yeah, I would say reasonable first and then scalable second because maybe a certain percentage people listen to this.
It's so funny.
There was a guy who I went to high school with, he got furloughed because he was a chiropractor.
So he graduated from chiropractors doctor chiropractor and then got furloughed.
Like the next month after covid and was like, bro, I need to make money and I was like do you want a big money being a chiropractor?
16:26
Or you want to make money, he was like, I'd rather just make money and I was like, okay, so we just put him in Jim watch.
I said, just so weight loss of greater glory god.
And so he's selling and reference, literally 90 days later.
June 20 grand a month and he's stoked, right?
So, but the reason that I brought this up was that before he started making the money, he was like, hey, here's my offer.
16:44
I'm trying to put these pieces together, you know?
I'm afraid that, you know, if I give away too much, it's not scalable.
I was like, bro, you don't have any clients.
Look at what scale issues are you worried about right now?
You have no clients so it's like worry about skilled leader.
17:00
Once you have cash flow and to prove the point of how much I believe in this, I spent two years launching Jim's.
So people like Alex, how'd you build such a big coaching business and Jim's.
It's like because I launched gyms for two years.
I flew out, I should have been the front desk and I sold membership for 24 days and then I flew out and did it again and then I flew out and then I did it again, right?
17:22
And then I had other guys that were flying out with me.
So I was running a sales team and do In that they're like, are you so good at it?
Because I didn't we fucking times, right?
And so, I think so many people aren't that good at the thing that they think they're good at, which is why they don't make me fucking money, right?
And so, anyways, great over.
But in terms of scalability, I think it is far better to get good at the thing and think, how can I provide so much value?
17:41
That's person.
Wouldn't say, no, get the yeses, get the cash flow and then determine what people find valuable when they don't find valuable.
And then peel back the offer until you still have the ultra valuable stuff, but you can, you can pull back some things to make a little more skill.
That's it.
Respect.
And in fact, I mean I didn't do the gyms but I did do the online.
18:00
Yeah.
And that's kind of what made it?
And in fact I got to that point where I had to start to sign.
Am I going to do low ticket Fitness, or am I going to go for hikes to get?
And, you know, I had like trainers lined up out the door, they're like hey can you do this for me?
And that's actually how I got into this.
I never thought I get into this back to your point.
18:18
What you just said something I found interesting that you keep bringing up is when you talk about scaling getting to the next level is not.
Not doing too much.
Right.
So not having too many offers not getting too convoluted.
So is there a litmus test to know when you're adding in too much cheer offer?
18:37
So let's say you have a coaching offer and then you throw in the agency and then you do this done for you that and then emails and all of a sudden you have all these offers it.
Is there a litmus test that to know when it's good idea when it's not a good idea.
It's a good question.
I wish I gave her a perfect answer, but I don't know if I have one.
18:54
Yeah, I don't want to give a false answer, I don't know.
Okay.
I mean, I didn't look.
I know when I see it, you know what I mean?
But I'm in terms of like what framework would I use to say?
This is too much or too.
Little, the easiest litmus test that was like from if we're going big picture, the easiest, let me test that I would think of is are we changing avatars?
I mean, the first the first Plymouth test the second would be, are we changing place in the market?
19:14
And so, so there's four major strategic positions in any market place.
You've got ultra-low Which is like what you can like, va's for $400 is ultra low priced, right?
Then you've got your low price which is Walmart, right?
And then you've got premium, which is more expensive than the average stuff.
19:30
And then you've got luxury right?
Which where demand increases as a result of status and price where the higher the price is the morning status.
That's associated with it.
Now, people, who might be listening this month, think they're in luxury, they probably are, they're probably in premium, which like your program by program, there are premium products, they're not luxury products.
19:46
No one has status associated with how much they paid you.
Right?
And so if I were changing where I sit on that graph, then that would be another thing where I would say, okay, we you still want to occupy one position.
Number one, number two, we want to serve one Avatar, and I think that too, I think part of the reason that the question is so difficult to answer is that there has to be context behind it.
20:09
So like right now we have six businesses that were that were in like heavily in, right?
And so you're like, people might hear that be like, well, I thought you told me to focus on one thing and The answer is yes, but it's also at what point do I have the skill set in character traits that would allow me to do these other things.
20:25
And so I think like, when I started my second business, which is pursue slabs, I did that out of sequence.
I should not have done it as soon as I did it.
Now that I have it.
Now, it took me like took me a long time of failure and suffering during that period of time transition of being CO2 companies that I can.
Now see that in retrospect, I don't know how things would have turned out differently etcetera, but I think that there's a skill set.
20:44
They could you have multiple offerings if you have champions for each of those product lines.
Yes, I think so, because if you can run multiple companies, you can run multiple product lines, but most people don't have the skill set to do it.
So as a broad statement for most entrepreneurs who are under 10 million dollars, a year, I say, focus on selling one product or one channel and then the second going from, you know, three to ten million is just increasing the backend, lifetime gross profit per customer.
21:07
Hope you guys enjoyed that as much as I enjoyed making it for you.
And part 2, we talked about how to acquire customers properly and the formula that I use to approach.
This problem in every business that we have scaled today, thank you guys will enjoy it.








0:00
Hey guys, real quick.
So Leyland are definitely working on our social media presence.
If you guys haven't noticed and we're just breaking now into LinkedIn.
All right.
It's not as bad as I thought it's actually pretty awesome so far and you guys have been really cool in there and people are sharing our stuff a lot.
So if we aren't connected on LinkedIn, it go ahead and let's connect, and let's rock and roll.
0:17
One of the highest leverage opportunities, that exist is finding people to help you do stuff, which is the first level of Leverage.
The next level of Leverage is to compress other people's time as units of money that you raised from them, giving you money to then go allocate on your own just capital.
The wealthiest people in the world.
0:32
See business is a game.
This podcast, the game is my attempt at documenting, the lessons.
I've learned on my way to building acquisition.com into a billion dollar portfolio.
My Hope Is that you use the lessons to grow your business and maybe someday soon partner with us to get $200 and Beyond.
I hope you share and enjoy what's a billionaire morning routine.
0:48
What's the millionaire morning routine, right?
A lot of people ask these questions.
If you look on YouTube you look on Instagram.
You look on Tick-Tock.
It's some of the number one.
Performing content is so, and so's morning, routine X, Y Z's, morning routine, the five things.
So and so does the moment he wakes up, right?
And it's because everyone's curious the question is why and I think if we dive a couple levels deeper it's because they don't know the question to ask.
1:10
Okay.
So they think that at that there's some magic pill or some super 5-step thing that's going to somehow get them to do the work and so the issue is we have to Define what productivity even means.
Right?
What is what is what is productivity productivity is getting more done per unit of time.
That's what it is, right?
1:27
And so what's interesting is that people approach, the problem of the fact that they're not getting enough Done per unit of time.
And they think that I should add more things that are not getting things.
Done to become more productive per unit of time.
Well, that doesn't make sense right?
Why do people not think that way because people don't Define the terms that they use.
1:44
So again productivity more shit done per unit of time and so their solution to that is add more stuff.
That's not getting work done, huh?
Doesn't make a lot of sense.
So, if we were to try and think of like the perfect morning routine, right?
We should think about the reverse of that, which is what The worst morning routine.
2:02
All right.
So how can I create a morning routine?
That would, that would make me the least effective.
All right, get the least amount of stuff.
Done one.
I'll make it long as humanly possible.
All right.
Number one.
Number two, I'd have lots of steps and processes involved.
All right, so that I could use up lots of mental energy before I could even start working, right?
2:21
So lots of time, lots of mental Energy.
Number three is that I would become very, very reliant on that thing.
So, if I don't get this one thing in that, it means I cannot work.
Right side also increase how fragile I am and dependent.
I am on this superstitious process that I've invented or created in my life.
2:37
And the reason I made that sidequest on this is that I saw this, there's this this viral video, which is like, you have to make your bed in order to become a millionaire like it starts at the small things.
And the problem with that is that we're separating fact from psychology, okay?
2:53
Which is if I make making my bed mean that I'm going to do the things that I said, I'm going to do.
Then it's super productive because it means that I'm going to do the things.
I said I'm going to do but it's not the making the bed.
That's the thing that's important is the fact that I'm committed to doing the things that I said I'm going to do that's the point and so what happens is gurus will get on this Superstition around these things that they do but not describe the meaning that they've ascribed to the thing.
3:23
That's the important part.
And so whenever the easiest way to disprove something is to say, let me find an instance where this doesn't exist and I still have the outcome.
That's how you just prove something and like science, right?
And so if there's a millionaire morning routine, then it would have to be the same thing that all millionaires.
3:41
Do, they would all have to have it in common, in order for it to be not just descriptive, but it explanation.
All right, a description is this happened.
Here's all the shit that happened around it.
Did it mean that all the things happened around?
It are the reason It happened.
No, we're just describing it.
But if we explain it as an, it's a causal rather than a correlate, those few things are the things that drive the impact.
4:02
So what, what do all millionaires have in common?
They have a million dollars.
Okay, that's causal, right?
You got five million bucks or something.
Worth a million dollars in order to be millionaire check fantastic.
What else do you have?
Well you have to wake up early tell you right now.
4:20
Plenty of millionaires, don't wake up early.
All right, plenty of earners to wake up early.
What else do you have to have?
Well, you have to have seven streams of income.
Well, all I have to do is find one person who does have seven streams of income to show you.
That that's not true.
Okay, that's gone.
What else we got?
You have to dollar cost average into the S&P 500 for your entire life.
4:37
And that's how you be coming later.
Are there millionaires, who don't have that?
Absolutely, that one's gone.
You have to invest in real estate.
All wealth. 90 percent of millionaires are invested in real estate.
Baby.
But did they become millionaires?
Because they invest in real estate or did they become Millionaires?
4:52
And then then choose to invest in real estate.
Just as a hard asset to diversify their portfolio.
Hmm.
Sequence.
All right, so do you have to do real estate in order coming later?
No.
And in fact, many millionaires, don't do that.
They just invest in it later.
You have to be in software.
5:07
You have to be in web 3, if you want to be rich.
Well, I have to do is find a lawn care, guy who's making ten million dollars a year, by the way, buddy doing 70 million a year with Editorial services for big buildings boring as shit, right?
So both of those just proved that and I can keep going with this and hopefully you understand the spirit of the video which is that I want to communicate a thinking process around outcomes because most people spend most of their time doing shit that doesn't matter.
5:38
And so when we're about to do something people are more effective people who move faster in life, don't actually move faster, they get more done per unit of time.
The definition of Leverage is you get more output per unit of input.
5:53
So if I get if I do a little bit and I get a lot, I have a lot of Leverage if I do a little bit and I are do a lot.
I get a little bit out.
Then I have low leverage and so, when you are becoming more productive, all it is is the act of doing less to get more.
That's it.
So when you hear leverage here, the fancy words, that's what it means.
6:11
And so if you look at that as the lens through which all opportunities in all tasks that you do, Are measured through.
What is the degree of Leverage that I have in this task?
How much do I put in for just how much it get out if you're like, well, how do I measure the what I put in the easiest base unit is time.
6:27
All right, so as much as people like, there's passive income, you were alive.
There is time that expires during that period of time.
And money comes to you over that period of time.
Which means that you simply have some things that you get more money per period of time and less money per period of time.
That's it.
The real estate guys were like, this is totally passive.
6:45
Sure.
How many deals did you look at How many Brokers did you negotiate with how many doses like how did you get all the financing set up whatever.
All of that?
That sure sounds like work and it is.
So they had a more compressed period of time of working but they still had active work over a period of time and then return from that even if you just make you buy a bond on the internet and takes you five seconds, just the act of deciding which one to buy logging in figuring out and making the purchase is work.
7:11
And so, it's only a question from a leverage perspective of units in which is time units out. out, which is money, if that's what we're choosing to use, as our as our metric, time to money, most Nation real quick.
If you are a business owner that has a big old business and wants to get to a much bigger business, going to 50 $100.
7:31
Plus, we would love to talk to you and if you like that would like to hear more about it, go to acquisition.com, you planning on the page and talk to one of our team and see if we can help you get there.
So when we're thinking about what tasks to do, what are the tasks that get us the most output?
7:48
And I will tell you right now at the very end of this video, I'll give you my morning routine.
All right, I'll give you everything that I do between when I wake up and when I work all right stay to the end of that cuz you're gonna love it.
You order your tasks in order of the leverage that they have.
8:04
And so for example, I could make sales calls if I were a business owner that is going to be a one to one input of like I'm do this effort and I get sales out of Now, with that same level of effort, if I could go recruit A salesperson which would take me a finite period of time and then that person replaces that my ongoing support for that person is going to be 23 hours a week.
8:25
So I gained back 20 hours a week of prospecting in exchange for two to three hours a week plus money, right?
And so the act of Entrepreneurship is simply consistently, making these trades of, what can I buy my time back with?
You never completely by back, you just get fractions and fractions down even to the point where you had an entire company leading to one Person and that person's talks to you, right?
8:46
So you've compressed all of the communication cycles of all of these things to one person and you still have the communication cycle, right?
As you still going to talk to people.
And so, you never eliminate.
It's just reduction.
All right.
So these things exist on continuum's.
They're not binaries.
That's why there is no such thing as active versus passive.
It's just, how active is it versus how passive is it?
9:04
How passive is it is?
How much leverage do I have in the opportunity?
What's the discrepancy between?
How much time I put in and how much money I get out?
Okay, which is why one of the highest leverage opportunities.
That exists is finding people to help you do stuff, which is the first level of Leverage.
The next level of Leverage is to compress other people's time, right?
9:21
As units of money that you raised from them, giving you money to then go allocate on your own just capital.
And then the two permissionless versions is from Nepal.
Rebecca is social media.
You can take something one time like this video and millions of people can see it.
I do the effort one time.
The output is very high, right?
9:37
The same degree with Contour with code or software, I could build a thing.
One time.
And then the incremental unit of each person using it, after I take the time to build it, Decreases, which is why Automation and business is a high leverage activity.
So if you can take five hours one day to automate, something that not only takes you ten minutes for the rest of your life per week.
9:54
Then you gain back five hours per week, you get 250 hours a year back.
Great return, right?
And so, I'll tell you what, wrong example of this is that we in Prestige Labs.
We had my finance team was like, hey, we have this manual entry thing, it takes us two hours a week of manual, like, code entry or whatever, to get it done, right?
10:13
I was like, okay, they're like, so we want to build this like, Patch from the dev team because we had a development team to solve this for us.
It was like, okay, so we scoped it out and the dev team said it would take them 10 days to do this to build this patch and the caution the dev team is 3,000 a day.
10:28
Okay?
So it's going to cost, thirty thousand dollars to replace two hours a week.
So 100 hours a year of somebody who is making $25 an hour.
So let's do the math.
So it's going to cost 2500 dollars of man hours for me to get this manual.
10:43
Work done versus spending Thirty Dollars to get the software patch, all right?
Not including any upkeep that, that's going to probably have on a consistent basis, anyways, but the 30,000 or patch.
So it would take me 10 years to get a return on this.
Does that make sense?
Not really.
10:59
And this was the finance department, but they were thinking, like individuals, only business owners.
And so, if you think about ordering your day that way, it's just a question of what am I treating my time for?
And so what I want to wrap this up with is just a quick thing, which is 1 when people give you their advice.
11:16
For how to become productive think, is this adding things that are not work to my calendar.
Number one, number two is of the work that I'm doing.
How much leverage am I getting from that work?
So I can multiply even further the work that I do.
And so, the fundamental equation of productivity of how much output you get is a function of how much you do X, how much leverage you have on the stuff you do, that's it.
11:43
And so if we're defining those things is the Vision for productivity, then the perfect morning routine should be one that maximizes.
The volume of work you do and The Leverage that you create from the volume.
And so for me that looks like waking up having a cup of coffee and getting to work and then ordering my day in the order in which I have the highest leverage activities to the lowest leverage activities.
12:08
That's it.
And so, if you're thinking about what is the most productive way to get things done, you have to do the work rather than avoiding doing the work and think of elimination is the ultimate productivity hack.
Because anything that is not work, is fundamentally not work.
So you are not doing any volume and no matter how much leverage it is, if it's still multiplying a zero, it doesn't matter.
12:29
And so you get the leverage by ordering and prioritizing things the right way of when you are working and then you maximize the amount of work that you do.
And for me, drink a cup of coffee because I like it and I have time with my wife.
And for me that's leverage on my marriage.
I'd this guy reach out to me.
12:44
He's like dude I got this coach.
He's got me doing like morning, walks and red lights on.
And I do a cold plunge and I did my gratitude Journal.
He's like I tell him down my morning routine.
It's like 11:00 a.m. he was waking up a little later.
It's like 82.
I was like 3 hours of my day is gone.
I was like, do you think you'd be more productive if you just Prospect?
It was a small business owner.
13:00
I think for three hours a day.
Would you think you make more money than that?
It's like, yeah, probably.
I was like, doesn't sound very productive then.
So a lot of people People inherit these things that they're hearing on the internet because realistically it just procrastinates them from doing the work and so that just gives them an excuse of mental masturbation or feeling like the productive, but if you Define productivity as units work times leverage, right?
13:21
The amount of work you do per unit of time.
You probably would stop doing a lot of things that you're doing that aren't work.
There's work to be done.
And the question is, how quickly can I begin that work?
That's it.
That is the point.
That is like and eventually it should be like the perfect routine would be wake up and you immediately work because you've trained yourself to be able to do it.
13:42
And so the challenge that I want to issued everyone is if you are one of these people who has a 90-minute morning routine before you start working, try waking up and walking straight over to Begin work, don't even check your phone, walk over and get straight over to beginning your and watch how much that you get done.
13:59
So the job of a CEO or the job, the entrepreneur is to do two things.
First is to properly identify If I the constraint of the business which is why is this business model necked and every business has a single constraint, okay?
Like there's always because it business is a pipeline.
So if I'm blowing traffic or water through a pipe, there's going to be the narrowest part of the pipe.
14:20
The narrowest part of the pipe will be the bottleneck.
The moment I open up that bottle neck, it will then find another bottleneck, which will be the next restriction for the next constraint.
The Java sea is to identify properly.
What the constraint is step.
One step to solve the constraint.
14:37
That is the job of the CEO.
So you have to have the discernment to see the whole system and then properly identify, which is what takes time now, the problem is that most people don't know what the fuck they're doing.
And so they reinforce parts of the pipe that are not the bottleneck.
So it's like, if you've got this narrow part of the pipe here, they're just adding more flow on this side, and that's not the constraint.
14:58
And so to be productive, first, you want to maximize your personal amount of time that you're working.
Cool.
Got that.
But now want to make sure that we're working on the right stuff.
And so the Leverage is occurred where the percentage of our work goes towards D bottlenecking, the constraint as fast as possible and getting to the next constraint and the D bottlenecking that constraint.
15:17
And once you have D bottlenecks in entire acquisition system, so it's like, you know, how to get demand, you know, how to convert, man, you know how to deliver to man, you know how to acquire acquire Talent?
All those things that a business is stable, what do you do?
Increase the front end again because now the bottleneck is the fact that you don't have enough traffic coming in.
So you increase that and around and around you go.
15:34
You always say, can I do more?
And I need two more.
Can I do one?








Company0:00
Most Nation, welcome to part 2 of the podcast that it was Tanner chidester.
On this podcast will talk about how to acquire customers profitably and the formula and mindset and models that I used to do that in every business that I have encountered to date.
I hope they serve you as much as they have served me, if you can actually just narrow it down, instead of making it the faceless like, everyone's opinion.
0:17
But like who's that one person, whose opinion?
You care about?
Then it's asking a more pointed question, which is like, because my opinion of what my father thinks of me more valuable than than what I think of me.
Welcome to the game where we talk about it, get more customers how to make more per customer and how to keep them longer and the many failures and lessons, we have learned along the way.
0:36
I hope you enjoy and subscribe.
Your business.
Is that thing that's impresses me.
The most is the fact of skate how much scale you've had with essentially, and I may be wrong, but in your portfolio, I still believe you don't run hardly any apps.
0:52
Is that that's accurate, right?
Overall, that is accurate.
Well, one of the companies, one of the these runs a lot of that's not Jim much different from Collins alive line.
I want to say.
So to me, that's the most impressive in the reason is I thought my profit margins were high and then I heard yours and I go well shit, I guess I didn't run ads.
1:11
They be that high to so but and what impresses me further is the amount of scale.
So when you're starting these businesses did you just figure out a formula and then you make sure these businesses fit that formula, or did it just so happen that you'd start a business?
You're like, how can we get these leaves without paying for them?
1:29
I think it's both our cell processes honestly.
Now, in terms of the checkboxes for business, I have five that I look at.
So it's my little moniker, its unique expensive sticky, air, and managed with a person of Integrity who is a long-term mindset.
So, those are the five things I'll pack a real quick.
So unique is like, is there something that we have unique thing that that only we can do that?
1:47
We have a unique and it might not even be the thing that's different.
But do we have a unique story that can still differentiate us?
Like for me and Jim wants there's nobody who's had as many times as I have or who did two years of Turner's.
That's Unique angle that I know that I'm better.
Iraq.
Right?
Expensive is going to be just a function of pricing and it's more than it is expensive in.
2:05
Absolute terms is more.
What is the gross profit of the business, right?
Which has a function do with the second thing, you need expensive, sticky air, and the air is the sorry.
The fourth thing is basically no marginal cost.
How can I, how can I sell something?
That costs almost nothing, right?
So that I don't want to have 80% or 90% mornings.
2:21
I want to have ninety, seven and a half percent, gross margins, and the different student in ninety percent, gross margin medicine, and a 95 percent.
Gross margin business is twice And so different fucks up a 95 percent gross margin.
Business is twice as profitable as in any particular Sports business because it means I can, I would have to sell twice as many units writer, for each increment of cost, I can sell two versus one and that is why it's twice as not five percent, right?
2:43
And everyone messes that up.
So unique expensive sticky is how can I make it recurring and have some sort of habit-forming component to it and either it's requiring because of the model or because of how good the product is.
So how can I have some element of recurring that's going to come into it, right?
So unique expensive sticky.
Are those are the four?
2:59
And then managed by someone who has integrity was a long-term perspective.
And then that way they'll make the right calls at the right time and not sacrifice short term for a quick pop.
And so that's in terms of like the businesses that I'm looking at.
In terms of the question about, how do we have such low, adspend related, to our Revenue.
3:14
So this is this has been evolved over time having spoken with all the guys I know are worth 250 million and up what was interesting to me is that the vast As majority of them want to do one time, inputs with compounding returns and so most people do the opposite, they do things that they have like spending money on Advertising.
3:34
For example, you have to come up with a whole campaign.
You have to write all the copy, you have to put money in it and then it stops working eventually, right?
You have to do it again and it stops working eventually.
Now contrast that with, I'm going to write a book and it's and it has to be so good that on its own.
If I give it a ten people that do that, more than 10 people will get it as a result of those first 10 people.
3:53
So then a letter, So each of those 10 people sensitive to people and those people send it to people.
And so right now this book was so most a test for me of that concept given the book in the course and that has actually worked.
So I mean one post on Instagram and that was my promotion of are no ads for this book and it's like a thousand copies of that.
4:12
It's not right?
I mean thousand copies you can multiply the math.
Thanks a lot, right?
But there's no advertising.
And so to round that point off, if you look at the six ways of getting customers, right?
So you have paid ads, you have earned media which is the followers that we all have, right?
4:29
We have owned media, which is all people have given us permission to contact them.
So all of our all of our the followers in their inboxes, the DMS etcetera, your phone contacts ERM and then you've got manual hop out.
I know you know this I'm just saying this for everyone else Manuel a pound which is the actual cold DM.
So same concept, but we're doing it to on a one-on-one basis to people who haven't given us permission.
4:48
We have affiliate.
So people ready have the pool of customers that we have that we can partner with and make a full integration to their business and they can keep sending us new clients.
And then, finally, you have Word of Mouth and referrals, right now, if I were to ask the audience, right, which of those is quadratic compared to, which of those is linear, which of the six is, which they might think first because we're only talking and I can see the comments, I will answer the question right referrals.
5:13
Word of mouth is the only one of this quadratic.
So if I put a dollar in a Rising and I get $10 back.
Then I get then I put $100 and I get a thousand dollars back, it is linear in the relationship, right?
It's a straight line.
Same thing with how about if I do a hundred calls versus 200 calls for a thousand calls, have the same same response, rate more or less law of large numbers with referrals if we make the product good enough, then I can give it to one person and that person gets it to, to give 24, we have 28 and then it multiplies, its quadratic, right?
5:43
And so, when I look at the people who make the most money, they spend all of their time or Russian amount of their time, truly getting product Market fit.
And a lot of people talk about product Market fit but they don't actually ever achieve it.
They get their idea of product Market fit, is that people are buying that is not the way that product Market is actually determined.
6:01
Prague Market is actually determined based on the fact that these customers stay and continue to pay and want to buy more, that's a fun product Market fit.
And so the idea is we should be promoting just enough to keep fixing the product until the product itself, does enough selling force that it becomes a virtuous cycle, but Most people just learned how to make that first dollar and then try and max out and then they're really disappointed by the fact that they're not making as much money or profit as they'd like to make and then also feel shitty about things.
6:27
And so when I look at that if I'm trying to build something that has compounding returns it's like how can I take a one-time effort and really going on the product?
I know enough about promotion to now to make sure that I can get the first sales throw and then keep tweaking this until eventually it is good enough that I get an outsized return on any effort.
6:45
I do and then at that point I'll turn the other ones on Because then making the the advertising profitable is basically inevitable because for every custom, getting big one or two more hostage, yeah, the biggest lessons I've learned from you.
Recently is, I mean, simply I've seen that.
So I'm like, what what can I do?
7:01
Different to where I don't have to Market so hard because I can mark it but I cannot out beat that performance with parking and then also it's wrapping my head around.
Okay maybe these offers.
What do I have to do to change his offers?
What new offer would I need at that criteria?
7:17
Because I had a lot of experience, I think it's easier for me to wrap my head around that, but that me is like what I've seen is, it's like he's doing stuff in a way where it's like, almost funny where it's like, we don't really have to do anything to sell this.
The cold calling, especially, I think is absolutely ridiculous right now.
7:37
You can call someone to offer, so good.
You just like, yeah, I was just kind of do it with you, whatever.
If it doesn't want to pay us and they're like, all right.
I will do it and it's really it's brilliant.
One of the Questions I want to ask is, you know, in the book and I understand this.
But you said if your company isn't growing its time and I think some people don't understand that they think like, well my company's here like it's not.
7:58
Can you can you give maybe an example because you said it really black and white in the book that people can understand what you mean by that statement.
So if you look at the like the marketplace in general, the marketplace is growing at 10 percent, right?
And so if you are not growing by 10% year relative to the market, you are shrinking and so that Means that you are dying and I use grow or die as a very polarizing term because it's memorable, right?
8:23
But fundamentally most businesses, if they are not adapting or innovating will get outpaced by the marketplace and then eventually vanish into nothingness.
And so the idea is that we must continually grow and must continue to innovate to keep our products sharp and and top of the game and you have you ever had you know a time in your business where I finally saw it this year where I feel like this was the first year where I was like, now I got to start changing or we're not going to keep going up.
8:47
Up.
Did have you had that happen in your business at all?
Yeah, I got kicked him the turncoat because mr.
Chips, but I didn't know you well enough then, but I remember I said in his State prayer and I was like, thank you, Lord.
I'm not Alex for mozi during this time.
So, yes, you don't.
9:06
I mean, I definitely definitely experienced it in the book.
You know, your dad questions, whether what you were doing, we're legal, you know, after one of the pictures from your events so you didn't it, We have this port from your family.
What would you say to people who are watching or kind of that same bone?
9:23
I see this a lot with beginners to how to deal with that because it see I think it's easy to maybe say now but I know when I start I don't know how you felt but I got very close to quitting a few times which in retrospect is crazy but in case in the nuts over and over stop how did you deal with it?
9:39
Or how will you deal with such a visual just getting kicked in the nuts over and over again especially do so.
I'll briefly sure that the story that got me.
Got me started.
I think it might have relevance because for me the hardest decision was actually quitting my job.
So that was the hardest decision I had to make because I was actually very good student.
9:57
I graduated from Vanderbilt magna cum laude in three years and I got a good job as a Management Consultant and I got pick him up and so I had I pretty much had done everything that I was told to do up to that point.
I was President for Fraternity.
I, you know, I mean, I was editor of the things like I did all that stuff, right?
10:15
Inside followed everyone's path and I Miserable.
And so I remember I was looking out on my balcony because I own a condo in a high-rise.
I was 22 and I all I could think about was how I just didn't want to be alive.
And so it was and that's why I say like a lot of my decisions have been in the face of my mortality because it's like apparently the only thing to get me to move.
10:36
And so and so what I was facing the fact that like I was like, if I'm driving tomorrow I was like I could just accidentally go in the other lane and like it would be alright, like no one would know, no would be fine.
And I wouldn't wake up and it would be over.
It right?
And so the thing is just like this kind of passive ideation was something that like occupied a lot of my time.
10:53
And so I was like, it got to the point where I was in so much pain of just living this existence that I didn't want to live.
That I was like, well, if we start a business, it'll be doing something that I like and I won't like I won't be thinking about fucking killing myself every day.
And so that was really that was kind of like his when I was faced with my own mortality of like, well, I've got the Judgment of my parents.
11:12
I was like where I could die and I was like well, I guess Judgment of parents is better than death and so that was how like straight-up that was how I made the decision.
But then, even when I did make the decision, I still had the same level of like, fear of failure and judgment and I told you, so and I, we've been right all along and you should have listened to me that I never wanted to hear.
11:33
And so when I started the business, it was just that fear that I had so much anxiety, every hour of every day, which is why I didn't take a vacation until December, 2019.
Hey guys, real quick.
If you're new to the podcast, I have a book on Amazon called 100 million-dollar offers that over eight thousand five star reviews.
11:54
It has almost a perfect for you can get it for 99 cents on Kindle.
The reason I bring it up is that I put over 1,000 hours in the writing that book and it's my biggest gift to our community.
So it's my very Shameless way of trying to get you to like me more and ultimately make more dollars to that later on in your business career I catch the partner with you so that's my give go check it out Amazon and back to the show.
12:16
Yeah, I can, I can relate to a lot of that and I remember distinctly after, you know, finishing football, that was my whole life.
I just want playing the league.
I mean, I was an engineering class out of here laughs and I was like, I can't, this can, this just is not going to work.
And it really hit me because that was like, my.
12:33
I was looking at that for the rest of my life, so I can 100% relates that I didn't even know that part about your story that young.
And for, to answer the question for the people who are struggling with, like, their parents stuff or their sister, or whoever that person is, Like I think the question is like, a lot of people are like, I'm so afraid of what people think, but if you really narrow it down, there's only like two or three people whose opinions you actually care about, and maybe it's just one and so then if you can actually just narrow it down instead of making it the faceless like, everyone's opinion.
13:01
But like who's that one person, whose opinion?
You care about?
Then it's asking a more pointed question, which is, like, is my opinion of what my father thinks of knee more valuable did than what I think of me.
And I think if you can answer that question and hopefully it's like I think what I think.
13:17
Ink is more important than you can take that first step.
I mean, I remember my dad called me, and this is after we had probably taken home 20 million at this point.
You know what I mean, this, a few years ago and he was like, hey, you might want to hear this and I was like, what I like stepped out from dinner.
13:32
I was like, what it was like, you ready?
And I was like, yeah, he was like, I'm sorry.
First time he's ever bought it, it was like, for what he was like, you know, for everything is like, you were, right?
He's like, but In my defense, if it had been in my time I would have been like it.
13:51
Are you saying sorry Dad?
Right.
But I remember when he said that to me though, that my my response was I was like you rooting for me.
Now, when literally everyone else in the world has already recognized that I'm good at this means nothing and I was like if I cared about your opinion I would have never quit to begin with and as I can, you know, when people can stand on stage and the first thing they say is, hey, Mom and Dad, thanks so much for always being there and believing me I was Like I'm not going to fucking say that because you weren't I was like, so I'm glad that that's apology made you feel better?
14:23
I was like, but your opinion, stop mattering to me a long time and so that was the conversation that I had with my father.
Hopefully it was, you know, less targeted than that for everyone here.
But I guess, you know, will conversation you want to have.
And if you never quit, then you won't fail.
14:39
And that is like, that's the prerequisite of Entrepreneurship.
If you do not quit, you won't fail.
And so, they can never say I Told You.
So, until the moment that you give That just resonates with me so much.
Like that's the number one thing.
Like I say that all the time I'm like, as long as you don't quit and you don't have a mental disability seriously and you can make decisions, like that didn't work.
14:59
That didn't work.
Don't do that again.
Do eventually will hit success.
It's just time.
That's it.
It's just time.
Do you think of animated without Laila?
So, I had six gems of formula.
Your, I mean, so I think, I think I had a reasonable level of competence, but I wouldn't have made it.
15:17
It as big or would have taken me much longer.
Yeah, I mean, was it easier with her is?
Oh my God.
I mean everything blew up when I met Layla and that's because I always had half the equation, right?
I didn't have the other half and so half, the equation is marketing and sales, right?
15:36
And she had product operations, fulfillment.
And so that was once I had that piece because I could always outsell my problems, but I just couldn't, I couldn't keep you, but I didn't know.
Didn't I didn't get that part yet, which is, which might be funny for people listening to this compared to how I just talk about the first half of this talk, right?
15:53
But like it was it's because I've learned that lesson, right?
I've learned how much more powerful it is to not have to help tell you, get so much more profitable to make the products exceptional and then get people to buy over and over and over again.
You make so much more money.
And so like, although I came up from the marketing and sales perspective, I would no longer consider myself.
16:12
That I'm just much more of a business person now, at least I consider myself that way, but having Layla As early as I did, I kind of got to LeapFrog a lot of the pain.
I otherwise would have had to figure out the hard way.
It was just like, you take all that stuff because I don't like dealing with that and she was like, okay and that you crushed it.
16:29
And so by doing that, it just blew up and then in retrospect I was like, oh, that was really important.
I need to make sure that that's always there.
And so now when we create businesses, it's like, front-end back-end, shared Ops, and we always have all three with everything that we do.
And then, that way they work on the first try, let me ask you this.
16:46
I mean a lot of people, I feel like I got a good concert the way you do now but everyone's always like what's a day in the life look like Alex, what do you do?
So what is that kind of look like now that you know you stepped out of most things and you're basically just being an owner.
I mean it's like it's like not a lot.
17:03
So like today I was reading.
This book is okay, it's not great.
It's okay.
You know, I was writing these books, I still have book to in book three that are written.
I'm just going to the editing process is now for those, the only things that are set on my Schedules that I meeting with the CEOs of the acquisition.com companies, tell me what those guys, once every week or every other week.
17:23
And that's that's like that's the majority of that's, that's like my those are my have to do is and all the and everything else.
Right now my focus right now is promoting the book.
You know, I wrote it so I figure I should promote it a little bit.
So Saturdays and Sundays.
There's nothing.
I usually have one or two days a week that are completely blank Monday afternoon is when I do the meeting.
17:42
So that was a nice tweak, if you, if you for everyone else here, so number one, heart attack.
Time in the u.s. is first thing.
Monday morning.
And so mentor of mine sold his company for 3.4 billion.
He did heart rate, variability on all of his Executives and found out there were most dressed in the morning.
17:59
So he just pushed all the meetings back until afternoon and everything was okay.
And so I can tell you it it changes the feeling of everything.
It's weird, it's so weird.
I just don't work Monday mornings and like my first meetings that like nude.
That's so interesting.
As first time, I've heard that I might have to try that.
18:15
So interested, it's weird.
It's tripping.
Like it's your like I feel like I'm cheating like I'm not stressed right now and so, all of a sudden, no one else is stressed either.
And then it eliminates this false urgency.
You feel because it's like first thing you gotta do stuff on Monday morning.
It's like now, you know, like because us deciding now verse 4 hours from now is going to change, nothing like the stress levels, go way down, so my Monday afternoon, it's been like three or four hours in meetings and then I have Thursday mornings, I do a little bit.
18:44
Finally these questions.
Alex.
What's next for you?
What's nice for you?
Got the portfolio companies.
Are you just going to keep adding to?
What are you gonna do next?
Yeah, it's all that's.
That's 100%.
My focus was like, how can I play something?
So I spent probably two years trying to think about what the next thing was going to be.
I know you and I have had offline conversation about this but like I had, no, I really have no more marginal utility for money.
19:05
So money only solves many problems and once you've solved all the money problems that exist in your life, there's not a lot more that money can do.
And I recently did my All in my stapler updated it and like I don't have kids and all the stuff that I have I'm going to be donating anyway when I die.
19:20
So like there's really no reason for me to bike.
For me the idea of legacy is kind of silly because a hundred Generations, my gene pool would be done even if I did have kids and if I did have kids are probably giving the money.
So I think it ruins them, which means that I can't give the money to anyone.
Anyways, and even if I did in a hundred Generations will remember who I was to begin with, so it doesn't really matter.
19:39
So all that to say I had to think like, what is my ideal date Look like and then how can I create a company that fits that?
And that was, that was it was like a 2-year.
I have I still have a note on my phone that has like 11 different big business ideas of what I was going to do next and then piece by piece.
19:56
I started Crossing them out until I was like the acquisition not calm when just kept feeling, right?
It kept coming back to like I would have moments where I was like this point might be cooler but I would always come back to that one and so that's why that's why I think I'll be able to win with it because I keep coming back to it and I think that I'll be able to do it for a very long.
20:14
In time.
And so, if I do it for very long time, then I think it'll grow much bigger than anything else I've done.
So for everyone who's listening, we're requiring minority positions in education or training, based companies that are really five million plus like 5 to 15 ish.
The biggest company portfolio is doing 35, smallest companies doing eight million.
20:32
So just for like context that that's, that's kind of the range.
But 5 million plus has kind of that kind of at least where we kind of draw the line.
Yeah.
So we're looking at those companies and saying, hey, we've already done this like a zillion times now.
So You know, helping someone get to 30 million or 50 million whatever.
20:47
Like we understand how to do it.
Yeah, it doesn't.
Isn't it difficult for you?
So guys, thank you so much.
Matt guys, make sure you go to Amazon, get his book and then adds one of your next book, strong stuff up.
The next.
21:06
The next book will drop when I think it's good enough that when people read it, they'll tell their friends.
They're not.
So, you know, I think I mean, it's done.
Now, I have a whole rewrite in my head that I've Rewritten the second one three times now.
So I'll probably end up rewriting it two more times, so I'll probably read it one more time when you're right.
21:23
Alex, are you doing pretty much the heavy work as well?
Like, you're not getting a lot of help I do everything.
That's the I doing listen because it's a lot of people are watching this.
It's not easy to write a book, by the way, so credible in a good books even harder Yeah, it has to be so simple.
21:45
And so digestible that because like, when I'm reading, because I've read this book is zillion times because every time I edit it, I basically read it.
It's like where is it?
That my eyes I get I gloss over like, where is it?
Where I lose interest or where is it that it's like chunky, it's like an have to rewrite it and massage it and how can I break this idea of giving a different example?
22:04
And I think would happen.
The reason I like the writing stuff so much is because I get better if you like, I get better at it.
Explaining the concept.
So, like my depth of understanding, my perspective on on expertise is How Deeply you understand the basics.
I don't really think that there's a lot of advanced stuff in business.
22:19
I think.
It's How Deeply do you understand?
Like, people use the term value, right?
For how long have you heard people say value and no one had a fucking equation for it.
He really provide more value.
Like what does that mean?
Right?
And it's true like even that that equation, if you took a whole book in gaming, those two pages, that was what I got out of the book that was worth the read for me because I was saying they're going.
22:43
So if I just do one of these four things, then that makes it better and then as easier to sell and as soon as you start implementing it or I have at least already.
And so that's what's interesting about that is that it ends up creating scalable Enterprise, right?
Because like You know how to build sales teams.
23:01
I know how to build sales teams, right?
But what really scale sales more easily rather than having absolutely Savage salespeople one that's very important and good and amazing sales.
Training is just giving an offer that would be so easy to sell and then all of a sudden you don't have to take nearly as much time to ramp up.
You don't have as much cost in sales that are not close by new closure.
23:19
When you put them on the roster like there's all these other costs that are mitigated when you have a much better offer and people were convicted about it because they believe in what they're selling.
Yeah. %.
I've already seen that across the board, but dude, everyone, please give us, but thanks so much for your time.
23:34
And I know, you're just so busy today.
The schedule guys, be on the lookout.
I think I'll see you in 10 bucks. 10 bucks.
Well, yeah, he's gonna be writing books and courses.
Absolute killer read.
I loved it as part of why I wanted to do this and he had a birthday yesterday.
23:51
So spam his laws, make sure to bother him.
I think I think he's 22 or something today.
So just make sure some birthday love.
All right.
All right guys, the livestream till next time.
24:07
See ya.
So you guys.
Thank you.

Most Nation real quick.
If you are a business owner that has a big old business and wants to get to a much bigger business, going to 50 $100.
Plus, we would love to talk to you and if you like that or would like to hear more about it, go to acquisition.com, you can play anywhere on the page and talk to one of our team and see if we can help you get there.
0:17
If you sell something for twice as much money and you get 1/3 fewer sales.
So you have 2/3, we used to sell in terms of units, it might freak you out, but if you sell it at twice, the price, you make more money.
And so you got to be able to just let the math do the talking.
Welcome to the game where we talk about a, some more stuff to more people in more ways and build businesses worth owning.
0:36
I'm trying to build a billion-dollar thing with acquisition.com.
I always wish besos musk and Buffett a documented, their Journey.
So I'm doing it for the rest of us.
Please share and enjoy.
We double the profits of one of our portfolio companies in less than eight weeks and we made one single change and we went from making two hundred fifty thousand dollars a month in profit to making over five hundred thousand dollars a month in profit from one single change, all right?
1:01
And so what I want to do is break down what that change was and how you can apply it to your business.
First, I'll give you a hypothetical story that you can apply this to second.
I'll tell you the service that we ran exactly how to do in your business.
Third, I'll tell you how you can communicate it to your team, so you can have the highest uptake rate in your team.
And then finally a walk you how walk you through how to communicate it publicly and I'll walk you through a hypothetical example of a Cavs business because that would be the best music that taught people how to grow their calves and soda cap program and walk through the hypothetical example, end-to-end so you can apply to your business using the same process.
1:32
And so what I want to do is take you through an exercise that I've done on stages and at conferences and workshops and it usually shift the audience in a significant way.
And so I want to just deliver that to you directly.
So I want you to imagine a hypothetical business, it might be like One you have now.
But if yours isn't exactly like this, you can still apply the principles.
1:49
Don't be one of those people.
So I want you to imagine that you have a business or you'd like to start a business that has 100 customers that pay $100 a month.
All right, so I'm trying to use the simplest math possible, so 100 customers hundred dollars a month.
So that means it's doing ten thousand dollars a month in Revenue.
Okay, now let's assume that in order to fulfill those customers.
2:08
We have eight thousand dollars a month in cost, okay?
So making two thousand dollars a month in profit so 10,000 dollar shop Two thousand dollars, bottom line, eight thousand dollars of cost.
All right, that's the business.
You got 100 customers, doing a hundred dollars a month.
Now, if you rub a magic iPad and a genie appears, and this is not any kind of Jeannie.
2:31
This is a very, a business Genie.
All right, so it's a very specific type of Jeannie.
It's a niche Jeannie, and this Niche Jeannie has one wish that he can grant you.
It's on.
He's very, very nuanced Genie.
And so he says, I can grant you one wish in one of three ways you're like, Okay, Jeannie.
2:46
I guess you're giving me the terms now.
He says, I will double your business, in one of three ways.
You need to tell me which way you want me to do.
And so you're like, okay, how do I do it?
He's like, I will snap my fingers and what happened like, oh, this is exciting.
So he said door number one or wish granted.
3:01
Number one is, I will double the amount of customers that you bring in every month.
Okay, That's number one.
First way I can double your business.
Now with this business let's assume that your turn is not that good.
Okay, so people stay for on average three months, okay, so it's 33 percent turn-based, a month, one month, two month, three, and then they canceled.
3:22
All right.
That's that's the way this ghost.
Number two is, he says, I will double your price.
So you have the same number of customers and I'll double how much they pay you, every single month, nothing else will change.
Like, okay, got it.
Door number three, he says.
3:38
Okay.
Now what I'll do is I'll double how long they stay.
So instead of staying for three months, they'll stay for six months.
Okay.
So you're the business owner, you're contemplating which of the three wishes which is really just one way of accomplishing a goal which of the wishes.
3:55
Do you take the genie up on?
So I'll let you Jeopardy.
Listen to this for a second.
All right now really be honest, tell me what your first guess was going to be a b or c.
Okay.
So with door a Or wish number one, whatever I said, all right, if he doubled because it's a male Geena obviously haven't seen any female Genies weird note, so the business Genie says he doubles it.
4:19
So now we have 200 customers a month.
Okay, now, what happens?
Well, if we have 200 customers a month, start 200 customers paying as month.
We now are making twenty thousand dollars in top-line revenue and assuming everything skilled proportionally.
We would have four thousand dollars a month in profit and sixteen thousand dollars a month in cost, okay?
4:38
So double the number of customers, we double the amount of profit, doubled our business, awesome.
Thank you, business Genie, cool.
And if that was you great sauce.
Now, let's go to do three, a tricky area towards this guy door three, he doubled, how long?
4:54
The people went are stayed with you and continue to pay.
Now in this instance, because people are staying twice as long, but you're getting the same amount of customers per month.
Eventually, you will get to the same equilibrium point as the first one.
The exception is that that that wish accomplished does something more powerful which is it increases your LTV now because of that and the additional months that they pay you most businesses, it's more profitable.
5:18
The last month, someone paste in the first month, usually cost of acquisition cost of onboarding.
There's more costs associate with getting a new customer than keeping someone and so if you can double the lifetime gross profit per customer that that's what that does.
Then your cost of acquisition can be bigger than it.
5:34
Could in the first example because I didn't change how much your customers Worth to me here.
I doubled it here.
Which means that I now have a much more valuable customer, which then gives me the capacity to scale in a much bigger way.
And because of that, I still realistically would probably have more profit in this business because I'm spending the same amount of money to acquire the customers.
5:51
Whereas this one, I have to double the cost of marketing to get the new customers here.
I eventually get to the same Top Line but I have more bottom length.
I didn't have to spend as much on marketing.
Does that make sense between these two?
So, between a and C, you pixie, you double how long the customer stays with you?
6:06
All right, if you can do that now, You're like, all right.
Well, what about door b or wish to whatever it was that I said, well, let's do the math.
So let's say we had the same hundred customers, but now instead of paying $100 a month, they're paying $200 a month.
Well, we still have the same cost of fulfilling, the state thousand dollars and our Prophet went from two thousand dollars a month to now, we have literally the extra hundred dollars a month, that's pure profit.
6:33
So we get the 20, and then another 20, and then another 20, and then another 20, and then another 20, then another 20.
So we 6X the profit of the business with one change.
Now for those in the audience who are thinking, but not as many people would buy That story that I told you about, I told you that we increased how much profit the business made.
6:53
I'll tell you the one change that we did was we looked at the entire Marketplace that we're selling a similar service to theirs and it was based on our research, we felt that the market could support a 50% higher price.
And so we literally, and this is already a pretty expensive thing.
We literally did nothing but add 50% of the price and changed nothing about the product.
7:12
Literally nothing.
We changed nothing about the product and guess what happened?
More people bought Why?
Because when something becomes more expensive people perceive its value in a higher way and because of the brand that the person had it was our belief that it was more aligned with the person to have a higher price tag.
7:31
And so people, it actually felt more aligned with what the expectation of the prospect was.
And I'll also bet because I'm poor talking to the CEO or going to do another bump because we think the market can support it now.
Most times in most markets, yes, supply and demand.
When the price goes up demand goes down in most markets.
7:47
Now, not all markets.
More times than not, it doesn't drop by the same proportion.
So if you double the price, sometimes you saw a third fewer.
But if you double the price and you've 6X to the profit potential on a customer, if I 6X my profit on a potential customer and I do it at 2/3, the price that I tripled the profit of the business.
8:06
Do you still make way more money?
And so finding the absolute perfect point of profit.
Many times comes from raising the price, not always, but many times.
There are pricing levers that you can.
Move within the context of the business that will make you more money.
And pricing is one of those very interesting things because it's very tied to emotions.
8:25
A lot of people are very afraid of raising the price because they don't want to break it.
And so the last part of this is I want to talk to you about how to raise the price.
If that is your goal.
Now, hopefully, you thought this was cool because we just 6X the profit of the business by doubling one component.
We could double the customers and go to two to four thousand one.
8:40
We could double the LTV and go from two to probably like five ish a month because we save some money on the marketing, right?
And we have a much stronger business overall but Double the price.
And if you assume that the same kind of amount of customers would buy you six x, The Profit, how much you take home?
That is powerful.
8:56
And a lot of people don't know that which is why the number one lever that you have on.
Profits is pricing and constantly testing, a lot of people to split test their Pages, they split test their scripts, they split test their offers, but the thing that they forget to test their price and it's the strongest lever of all three, levers of getting people to buy more times getting more customers versus just charging more for the same thing.
9:14
That's worth positioning.
How you charge can actually influence the price a lot.
Not now a good where you increase the price and the demand goes up, is called a veblen good.
It is a type of good work, the price itself, confers value to the product as in the higher, the price, the higher, the perceived value people ascribe to it and are more likely to buy because it went up.
9:34
And when you have that you have a huge amount of profit can be made.
All right.
So that's for example, like Chanel can take a bag and go from 2,000 to 10,000 and all of a sudden more people want to buy it, their cost on the bag is the same but imagine they have twice the At five times the price with the same fixed cost.
9:51
They can 20x how much money the bank and if you're like, that's crazy.
That's how crazy wealth is built.
Okay.
So if you're in the sense of you like Alex I'm sold.
I'm not going to focus necessarily getting more customers are not going to necessarily focus on getting the buy more because the biggest lever is getting the pricing.
Right.
Agreed.
10:06
How do I do that?
So the first thing I would recommend doing is not necessarily changing your existing audience because changing expectations on people can be tough.
All right?
And so we want to do is Grandfather them in for now and when you bring new people In you can present the new price.
Now, what happens?
If people who just bought last week?
10:23
Find out that the people who are buying now, get it for more.
Or the flip side, the people who buy for more, find out that last week, somebody got it for Less.
Well, you Market it and so what you do is you you advertise the price.
The fact you're going to change the price is about to increase and so you clear the pipeline whenever that happens.
10:38
Now, what you have to expect is that if you clear your entire sales pipeline because you put some urgency on people to make a buying decision that you're automatically, never dip in sales, the next month because you clear the pipeline Have to give it at least two months of adjustment time, unless you're absolutely bombing on the phone, which then you're like.
10:54
All right, we need to, we need to really look at this.
But the jump should make sense now, that is the first way you test.
Now let's say that you make that test and you need to go back.
So what you do is honestly, I'm trying to think of a time.
We've had to do this.
It's not often I can, I actually can't remember a time where we have increased the price because we're usually pretty judicious about.
11:12
When we do the research of whether we think the price can be supported, there are things called pricing service that you can run and So what we do before we do a pricing increases, we run something called a van, West pricing survey.
And so it works like this, you send a survey to your customers and you say, hey, you asked for questions.
11:29
The first question you ask is at what price point.
Would this service that you have now received, these are customers.
Remember, would the price be so high, that you would even consider it.
All right, first question, second question is at what price point would this product need to be for it.
To be so low that you would never believe it could actually fulfill the promise.
11:46
We have the third one, you say Price point.
Would you say it's really expensive and you have to think about it, you'd but you don't really make the decision to buy it would be a stretch but you do it and it would hurt a little bit.
The fourth question is at what price point would you say?
12:01
This is a steal or this was a bargain but you believe it can fulfill the promise but he just thought it was really really appropriate like really well priced.
So when you have those four data points you then can graph those and you actually get the edges of something called wtp which is willingness to pay.
And so when you have those edges, you see at this price point and mind you, it's going to be it's going to be a band.
12:21
So you have four bands on this on this thing.
And if you want to get really Advanced with it, you ask for other pieces of data, about the person, what's your current Revenue level.
How many employees do you have?
What industry are you in?
And so then you find out that some Industries might value your same thing more.
So then what happens is you create a product Suite, that's appropriate to the right customers and so from there you're able to price appropriately to the needs or the value that a certain person's getting.
12:45
So for example, if I'm very wealthy and One can give me five percent more on my money.
To me, it might be worth five million dollars a year right to somebody else.
It might be only be worth a hundred thousand dollars a year and so that discrepancy we want to see if we can capture that in pricing by simply adding a couple of little features and making it specific to that Avatar.
13:07
Now if you want to go the third step on this survey that makes it even more powerful is that you asked for two more questions.
The next question is, of all the services that we offer all the Things.
All the value that we brought.
Do you want to list everything else?
You're like, you might have 24-hour support.
13:22
You might have a Facebook group.
You might have calls that you attend.
You might have a promise of some sort that you make, you might have trying splinter out every little individual outcome that you have that you deliver with the service or product that you sell you list all of them out, might be 20 things.
And you say, if tomorrow, we were to eliminate everything from our service, you for one thing, which would you want us to keep.
13:46
And then the second question is, if tomorrow you had to eliminate one thing of all of these 20 things which would it be that it wouldn't affect your decision to stay with us no matter what?
And so there you get the most valuable thing and you get the least valuable thing and when you have 100 people are 200 people.
14:02
Take that survey, you get to see clusters of lots of people value this thing.
Not a lot of people value this thing.
This is what most people are willing to pay on the high end.
This is what most people are willing to pay on the low end.
This is way too low and people won't believe that it's that's valuable and this is way too high.
14:18
And so then you can actually plot those on a demand curve and say okay, if we race to hear this percentage of customers would buy.
So you multiply number of customers by number of people willing to pay the price and that will give you the gross revenue and you should know your cost of fulfilling and that will give you the maximum profit point on the flip side.
14:36
If you say, what is the lowest Price perspective you multiply the number of customers by the number of people who want to be a pop by that lowest price.
And again, you multiply by the gross margin.
And so in those two instances, you'll be able to triangulate where I have the price point where I'll gain the most market share and where the price point is exist, that again, the most profit and then strategically within your business, you find The Sweet Spot work with your strategy of growth, where it makes the most sense.
15:00
If I were a platform, I might have a lost leader product that just tries to gain as much market share as possible on the flip side.
If I'm trying to build an Enterprise business, that pays me over time.
And cash flows because it's an asset.
I want to keep for a long time that I might find this profit thing and kind of slow grow my way to Enterprise Value.
And so, when you run a pricing survey like this, you no longer make guesses at how to price, there's a science to pricing so that you can optimize for the right customers the right price, the right profit for your business right now.
15:29
And so if you don't know how to do that stuff, it's normal.
You can Google more about it, but that is generally how we approach pricing it acquisition, not come with our portfolio companies, so that we can make the best pricing decisions, make the most profit and ultimately grow the business in the way that we deem most effective for the strategy.
15:45
And that's why we're able to Triple profits for, on average for the businesses that we work within the within the 12-month, simply by reconfiguring the product suite, and the pricing associated with the avatars that we serve who caused you guys already know that.
I don't run any ads on this and I don't sell anything.
16:01
And so, the only ask that I can ever have you guys that you help me, spread the words we cannot more entrepreneurs, make more money, feed their families, make better products and have better experiences for their employees and customers.
The only way we do that is if you can rate and review and share this podcast, so the single thing that I have to do is you can just leave review but they can 10 seconds or one type of the thump.
16:20
It means the absolute world to me.
And more importantly, it may change the world for someone else.
So, because we were coming in and we hadn't done pricing surveys yet for that business.
But we really thought it was underpriced based on what we knew it's really well.
What did you know?
Well, there were two other players in the market place that we're both bigger, which is a great indicator.
16:39
By the way, is if you look at the people who are the biggest in that space, they probably run a couple pricing surveys.
When I say big, I'm really looking at businesses that are probably doing 30 million or more, you know below that people usually don't take pricing a seriously and so maybe a 10 million but like still like multiple millions of dollars a year and so both of them businesses Had significantly higher price points and had similar value propositions.
16:59
And so we felt really confident that we actually wanted to double the price.
The CEO in particular was really hesitant as you can imagine because it's an emotional choice and you know the fear that people are going to buy but this is a really important point.
If you the founder and your team is not sold on the price point, it will not work because the psychology still matters more than the math.
17:20
And I mean that like, you have to be super sold.
And so the way that we would communicate this to the team, Is I would ask them to sell me on why it's worth more than the price that I want to increase it to.
So before you tell them the new price have them sell you and why it's worth 50% more than the price, you're going to change it to.
So let's say we had a 5,000 our product that we're selling.
17:37
I would say hey and we're going to bump it to 7500 for example.
I would say hey sell me on why this is worth ten thousand dollars okay because like guys is a price change coming so I need you to tell me why this is worth ten thousand dollars every single reason why it's worth ten thousand dollars, right?
And they're going to sell it and Andre, testimonials Etc to get amped up.
17:54
Also, by the way, those guys.
Make more money when the price goes up because the percentage but they're making goes up, so they make more money, so they should be usually pretty light and if your sales seem very resistant it might be the wrong culture, the sales team because any such thing that I run always was like, dude, when can we raise the price point where he's ready, because every time we braise Bryson, they're going to pay bump right there.
18:10
Like getting themselves pay raises so like they should want to do this, right?
So communicating the team and making sure that you the founder are super.
Bought it on this.
Like you need to pitch them.
Like, you need to sell hard on why.
This makes sense.
Why it's good for the business.
Why it's good for the customer?
18:25
Why A more invested customer will actually get better results, why?
This will actually help the backend team fulfilling a better way.
It'll give us more gross profit to actually deliver at a higher level and talk about that virtuous cycle of pricing, which is in the 100-mile offers book.
It's one page, virtuous cycle of price, you can read it.
18:41
And basically you can say that pitch to them the books.
Not handset.
So like hopefully it isn't breaking.
It was well.
So how do you communicate the price increased occur customers.
So there's two scenarios either your increase in the price and current customers or your not increased.
So if they're grandfathered in, you can let them know that their got grandfathered in and to chill and to be like double down on the fact that they're getting even more value than they thought they were right now.
19:04
I have never really liked doing that because I like always having the card if I want to raise the price on them in the future I can which is why I don't like lifetime deals lifetime pricing, any of that stuff because I just don't know what the future is going to hold.
What if inflation doubles, right?
Like I that's why I don't like lifetime deals.
So I don't normally do that.
19:21
If you want to do that you can and that's what you should do.
But that's not my wreck and so Normally to the existing audience, I just won't say anything because it's not really a concern of theirs because they've already paid.
They, we've already agreed to fill at this price and they've agreed to pay that price.
And so expectations have been set and met done for the new customers that are coming in.
19:39
We communicate externally that we're going to change the price that we're going to raise the price so we can generate more sales and get people who on the ledge too close.
But beyond that, that is the communication.
It says, Hey we've dialed in our processes, we've doubled our number of success stories.
We've, you know, you talk about all the things that you've invested the time taken and the heh.
19:56
Effort spent to improve the quality of products and services and you're saying, because of that, we are going to raise price.
It's so that we can further invest in the business.
Further invest in hiring team and talent my gym on secret books actually has a letter, but that's that I have the exact sentence, the gym one Secrets book, but inside of the letter you basically just want to show that you're not you're not just taking it put in your pocket right now certain percent of that you are going to do but you're taking that because you want to build the infrastructure, the business and so you talk about the things in the past that you've done to further invest, Things that you would like to do now that you're going to do things if you like to do in the future to further improve the quality of the thing that you're selling, all right?
20:33
And so that's why you communicate.
Now if you are going to raise prices on your existing clients which is the hardest thing to do.
But if you are going to do it and we've taken many, many, many many, many many, many businesses through this process, especially on the gym cycle, we had to do it a lot.
You have to really take it seriously, and you need to write a letter and you want to hand sign it, and it's been so many customers you have.
20:52
But if you're a small business, I would recommend like hand signing the thing to socially.
Take it seriously and after explaining all the pros of the things that you have done to improve the quality and the things that you would like to do to improve the quality, then at the very end, this is a tiny human Nuance.
21:08
I say PS, if this is going to materially affect your life is in, like you won't be able to buy groceries or, you know, pay your rent.
Please let me know and I'll see if I can figure something out.
And so what happens is, most people read that they're like, no, that's not going to happen.
And so then it doesn't happen and then if they do reach out then you ask the questions.
21:23
Like, are you not gonna be able to pay your mortgage or you're not gonna be able to So, that's really important because like, we will figure it out.
They're like, well, no, it's like, all right.
Well, then, is it just that you'd like to pay less because me too, you know, I mean, but I have to think long term about this business, which is, when you asked me to pay less, you're asking me to deliver less, and you're asked me to not invest in the business.
21:41
So, is that what you're asking me to do?
And then usually the person like will?
No, I'm not saying that.
It's like, okay, cool.
And so, usually resolve this situation.
So that is how I approach price changing in each of those scenarios.
Okay?
So let's walk through a hypothetical business and the steps that we would need to take in order to to increase the price.
21:56
That that's what we decided was the right call.
So the first thing we would do is we survey the existing audience using the van West or pricing survey.
We add in the segmentations and let's say this business sold a 12-week grow your calves program and let's say was $1200 for 12 weeks.
Very simple, right?
So that's what that's what the program was.
And on the first third of the survey, we're trying to find out more about the customer.
22:14
So we're like, hey, you know, what was the main reason that you bought this was there an event that was coming up?
That incentivize you to do it?
What's your income level?
What's your job?
What was the primary way that you found out about us, right?
So it's like okay, these are the things that We know about the the Avatar.
All right, cool.
And probably age.
Yeah, agent gender is probably probably you guys.
22:31
But you know what, ladies you probably want the guests to because who doesn't want caps?
And so we've got we've got those client demographics.
Okay?
Second part is the for question to the Venn Westar.
What if it was super expensive, whatever way too cheap?
What if it were a stretch and then what if it were a bargain, right, there's the four questions.
22:47
Cool.
Now, we say, of all the things that we do in our calves program, which is the book, the training, the nutrition, the stretching thing that we have the, the 101 calls for accountability, the buddy system Item that we've that we've put together, she have an accountability buddy, the, the small groups that we have you guys train together the cohorts, the intensifier exercise that we drop every Saturday.
23:03
Like all of these things that we do in our value stack, which of these.
If we only had one of them you would keep and which of these we got rid of one, you would lose and not care, cool.
Now we know that's just good data for us in the future because also in our messaging will talk more about this stuff and less about this stuff and if it doesn't add value and it cost us a lot of money in one of our businesses, we eliminated in The sounds terrible but customer support in that business was not deemed valuable and it was The second biggest department of the whole company.
23:28
So we actually, as unfortunate as it may sound, we got rid of that entire department and nothing changed.
No one left, it didn't change anything.
And so it just was not valuables literally an appendage that we thought was providing value.
That wasn't any ways.
That being said, you take that data number one, number two.
23:43
Now, we communicate it internally first.
All right, so we got to communicate to the team that can be the sales team secures, the marketing team talked about how this pricing change.
That we've determined is the right change.
Why?
It's the right change exciting?
Exciting cool now.
Now then we communicate internally to our customers and our lists, right?
24:00
So we say, hey this is what's happening, this is why it's happening past present future.
This we did to get here.
This is why it's important.
Now this is what we're trying to do later, we're investing the business because we want to fulfill our promises which is a point that I forgot to mention but I will say right now which is the strongest argument position is always the moral High Ground in any negotiation, the moral High ground.
24:18
And so if someone says, I don't think you should raise your price, you would ask them.
Like, do you feel like I shouldn't fulfill my promises to people?
Is that what you're telling me?
Because like out of Integrity?
I can't I can no longer provide the service that I have now because I know what a better service looks like and I will fulfill the promises that I make to people.
24:35
So is what you're asking me to do.
Not fill promises and be out of Integrity.
Made is honest, the versions like well, no, I'm not asking you do that and like the moral High Ground is unimpeachable.
It's it's you can't counter it, right?
And I was like, if you can't afford it, that's fine.
I understand that.
But I, if I'm making this promise to the public that I'm going to solve this problem, this way, then I'm going to do that.
24:53
And if this is the pricing, This is required in order for me to fill out, promise to the fullest degree.
I will do that period and it gives you a moral High Ground that I had this conversation.
Okay, so once we've done the survey, we made the decision, we've communicated internally to our team, then we communicate it to our existing customer base.
25:09
And then, finally, now we bring it up to the new customers for coming in.
So we hit our list up to let them notice.
We have the urgency in Step 4 and then the last step is now we officially have this new price.
Now, what we want to do now is expect the fact that the change in price will probably result In fewer sales by total volume.
25:27
And the reason for that is because we cleared the pipeline before the price change it happens.
Now, once you have that, you have to let it shake out, you have to let it settle and its really trying, it's very difficult to do that because it takes guts.
Well, once you make that you let it set up, then you just do the math and let the math do the talking.
25:42
All right, which is we sold this.
Many people at this much profit per unit will we make more profit at this new price?
Because if you sell something for twice as much money and you get 1/3 fewer sales.
So you have 2/3, we used to sell His units.
It might freak you out but if you sell it, at twice, the price, you make more money.
25:59
It's you got to be able to just let the math do the talking.
All right, so in our hypothetical case scenario, let's say we bought the 22 thousand dollars or three thousand dollars because we found out that that was the price that that was right at that sweet spot that was the stretch but they'd still do it.
We might have just 2 or 3 X2 profit of the business by making that one change and maybe because calves are the coolest thing ever.
26:21
Got even more people to buy it because they thought they really could get the results that we said.
We were going to From experience.

00000:00
Real quick.
Because you guys already know that, I don't run any ads on this and I don't sell anything.
And so, the only ask that I can ever have you guys that you help me spread the word so we can have more entrepreneurs, make more money, feed their families, make better products, and have better experiences for their employees and customers.
And the only way we do that is if you can rate and review and share this podcast, so the single thing that I have to do is you can just leave review will take you 10 seconds or one type of the thumb, mean, the absolute world to me.
0:25
And more importantly, it may change the world of someone else going on.
Everyone hope you guys.
An awesome Saturday.
This was totally an impromptu thing, but I saw something on my Newsfeed and I was just like, man, this is a good despite be a good video.
So, why we don't copy and why, this might make you more money.
0:42
So, What's a really things people always.
And I mean I don't know if you've been in this space a while, but a lot of us consider a lot of consider as innovators in the gym space is that we're always coming up with the next thing and what's new and the reality is that the majority of the revenue in the income of the profit goes to the first mover in the marketplace, right?
1:05
So we were the first ones to do a lot of things and the reason because of that were rewarded for it, but I want to tie this back to To ring the gym.
So I remember there was a time where I was.
So I had one location this time, and we were doing pretty well, I'll probably take it home like 10, 10, 10, 12, somewhere in there.
1:28
This is probably the first six months of owning my first gen and so I was like wow this is awesome and there was some other guy done you know down the street who was always you know claiming he's crushing it all the stuff and so I remember looking at one of his things and also I'm not I'm not going to try and do that and And what ended up happening is they didn't work and I learned this lesson that is has been so profound to me and it's it's kind of like this most people suck at everything in general.
2:01
Like most businesses aren't good at what they say they're doing.
And other businesses who are in my space.
Are also usually don't know what they're doing either.
And so why should I copy those guys, right?
Like, so if you're a CrossFit, right?
And you're like man, where should I get my pricing?
If you look at Marketplace.
You're just going to get really cheap prices.
And then all of a sudden you're going to start having cheap prices and you like, huh, all these other she has, if she prices, why am I not making money?
2:21
Because they're not making money, but you didn't know that, right?
You didn't know that, they're not making money and so you happy, someone who sucks.
And so I now have faith in the fact that most people don't do their research.
Most people don't actually try and figure out what is working, they just?
Yes, everyone's just guessing and so I have absolute confidence in the fact that if we start doing something and we approach it like we're gonna do this, This right?
2:44
We're going to look at it.
We're going to test it.
We're going to research it then I know when the actual answers come back on my phone, these are winners.
These are the actual winners and so if we copy we're usually copying people stuff that sucks.
It doesn't even work and we don't know that it doesn't work.
But now now I'm telling you most people don't know what they're doing.
3:01
Most people aren't making any money, so don't copy them, right?
Focus on your customers.
All right, look at them.
And then think what problem is their biggest problem that I can solve and then just start trying to solve in your own way because if you look at The people try to solve it and they're going to kind of pollute what you do.
3:16
And then it's going to look like Mickey Mouse copy caption, right?
You know, we'll just like everyone else's stuff and then it won't be special.
So people are like, how did you build this Guru business like overnight?
That got so big, is this like I didn't look at anyone elses your business, I was like, well, let's start with the end in mind, how can I help Jim owners the best, right?
3:32
I was like what we need, full-time customers for right?
That's what I would need.
I would need someone to help me with all that.
I don't need to help.
Help get unblocked, the bottlenecks on Tech stuff.
So that's where we have 11 full-time, American red blooded.
You speaking support staff is because we start with a problem, we try to solve it, right?
3:48
But if I looked at every other you know, every other Guru business, right?
I'd look there.
And I'd be like, okay, I guess I got to do a couple of events every year and then give them a Facebook group and then we'll do a call once, you know, once a month and that'll be, that'll be our, that'll be our entire business, right?
4:05
But we didn't do that.
And so then all of a sudden now we're Innovative, right?
We like totally reinvented the space in terms of how we deliver service but it's because of how we approach the problem which is I'm not Look in.
This is why I don't like the whole.
There's a lot of things that I don't like.
I don't like the whole funnel hacking aspects.
I really don't.
I'm not a fan of it because what it does is you don't learn the lessons and you also don't know why some doing what they're doing.
4:23
So when it breaks, you don't know how to fix it, right?
When you make your own stuff, you own the whole process and you know why you did this and you test it.
And if it works, then you do love better improve, right?
When you look at the rest of the marketplace, first of all, it does is just totally narrow.
You like narrow, your ability to innovate anything, because you have this preconceived notion of what it should become.
4:43
All right.
And so why was quietly?
Why was all of our meal plan systems?
We are gym kind of like new and different.
And like how do we think about like, a restaurant eating out guide and it's travel guide.
And, and how do we have other things is because we were starting with the concept of like, how can I help this person lose weight, and where do most people struggle with it?
4:59
Right.
It's not just well, here's a meal plan and our workouts are like this, whatever, because that's what everyone did.
So if you look at your customer focus on the customer, look at their problem.
They try to solve them.
Then you're going to come up with a radically new way of doing it.
A lot of times because you didn't let yourself get influenced by the rest of the marketplace, which big secret, they're not making money in, they're not good at what they do.
5:22
Hey guys, real quick.
If you're new to the podcast, I have a book on Amazon called 100 million-dollar offers that over eight thousand five star reviews.
It has almost a perfect score.
You can get it for 99 cents on Kindle.
The reason I bring it up is that I put over a thousand hours into writing that book and it's my biggest gift to our community.
5:38
So it's my very Shameless way of trying to get you to like me more and ultimately make more dollars to that later on in your business career I guess a partner with you.
So that's my give go check it out Amazon and back to the show.
Most gyms don't make money.
5:54
Don't know why would you pop it?
They don't even make money, right?
You know, work.
And so that's why, you know, like like why do I why don't I look at any of the guru businesses that are out there because they probably suck at what they do, right?
And I'm saying, okay, I'm trying to be negative about them.
6:11
I'm just saying that if like Yeah.
I mean they would be better, right?
Like if I'm why would I copy them?
They may be bigger and growing faster and going nuts.
Everyone copies are stuff because they don't know how to make stuff that works and it's because the process is foreign to the right.
6:27
The process goes like this.
Look at a problem solve it and then figure out how you can do it over and over again.
So it's consistent, right?
But all you have to do but no one does that to people are lazy, right?
And they think they have to Mickey Mouse or copy stuff, so you will be better if you don't copy people and then you will become an innovator.
6:45
And then when you're an innovator, you get to enjoy the entire curve of revenue and profit.
So people who are running huge opportunity ads, right?
Like six years ago, right?
Got to enjoy all of the benefits of the entire curve for everyone else started doing them right?
7:02
Then they stops working, right?
That's what happened.
And so if you're an innovator, you just get to enjoy the entire curve rather than being an early adopter, late adopter, whatever, and then mass and then it stops working when everyone else gets into it.
But you starts by looking at the customer and just seeing what you can do something to make their life better.
7:20
So don't copy people, they don't know what they're doing.
Just don't like most people sucking what they do.
Like, most people don't try.
Most people don't try hard at all.
Anything, like in life, you just go through it like this.
And they don't just try like, you know why?
7:37
Like, because I've had are a nurse or a nurse, will be like, how do you guys have such high success rate there?
Like, it's insane.
How is it 95% of the gyms that?
Work with have ridiculous results.
Like we're trying to get there trying to get 5% to go to 10% of their people get results as I because I just, we did just, you know what?
7:55
I'm going to make an info course and then I'm gonna sell it first and then I'm going to make it as you going to make it an eight week module, and every week, I'm going to make webinar and I'm going to record the webinar teaching and then put it in there.
That's not useful.
It's also not, it's not a Consolidated way of displaying information like instead, but try and get someone On a product, which is a result that actually happens and thinking every single way you can go wrong and then try to fix every one of those ways and then still do it and then take complete ownership over every single person, doesn't succeed, right?
8:26
So anyways, just ownership.
Just Own It, own it, do everything yourself, just own.
It don't don't look at anyone else because everyone else isn't good.
No, one else is good at their stuff.
Don't copy them.
And they probably copied someone else and it's so diluting so bad.
You guys that.
I think your problem isn't working.
8:42
So start the problem on the solution. give it to him and you'll be all the happier for it and honestly, We, I don't look at what anyone else is doing.
Have you noticed that all the Jim grew fond of look exactly like my not right?
Everyone noticed that they look like mine.
8:58
Who's are copying our stuff?
Okay, be there so well they don't know.
It was something funny semifinal sucks.
Mike sucks.
The murder that like that's the crazy thing I was at phone hacking live and this guy sat down at our table and he was like, okay dude I got your photo.
I have to ask you questions about this because you said your links is you want you to start a quiz.
9:16
He's like when I get there it reloads and it says survey but there is no sir.
Irving.
He's like so I'm thinking is the reason that you did that and then the application page doesn't really have a private.
Like it slower like is the reason to do that because you think about consumer psychology in this you like kids hole Theory, worked out of why you did this.
9:33
I was like oh no dog.
I've never split test it and I was gonna do a quiz then decided not to.
So I just left the link the same.
He was like it was like his world was shattered.
I was like yeah because we just started running and started working so I didn't mess with it.
No wonder, you're like to your videos don't work on the page.
9:48
I was like, oh yeah, yeah I need there.
He thought he was like some master plan of Why the videos didn't work was like oh it's a show that like there's some sort of scarcity or something like that.
But I was like nah man because the reason that it works is because our acquisition system so strong and then we can have with such high ticket that we can all spend anyone anyway.
10:04
So it's really matter for phones.
They're bad because I didn't focus on, right?
So everyone focused on the wrong thing, even when they're trying to copy us because they don't know why it works, right?
And if they just made another own, they probably have something at least, at least they can compete this if you different You're mean, and it would be unique of their way of trying to solve the problem.
Rather just Mickey Mouse and enjoy and everything else does.
10:21
So anyways, don't look at your competition.
Most of them aren't good at what they do.
Most of them, like people who claim they are, a lot of them still are neither.
Like and I'm not just talking Jim's.
I'm talking like people who sell copying services and maid services and Lawn Care Services.
Most people are just really be over, right?
10:37
And it's because they just looked at what everyone else is doing in there.
Start doing the same thing and what do you know, they get the same to your first results?
Like if you just look at the problem try and solve it think like how can I Creatively solve this issue in the best way.
Possible as if you get unique unique methods and then you can reinvent an industry.
10:52
So anyways, lots of guys just some Saturday morning thoughts.
Don't copy.
It's just, it does not serve you and you also feel like you're happy person and don't be offended.
When people copy you, it just means that they can never be which is really refreshing in some way because you know that if if someone's always doing what you were doing, they will never beat you like I'll never beat you.
11:13
They're admitting that there s and so The biggest the best thing in the world that happens to me is when somebody who was perceived, as bigger than me early on started, copying what I was doing because that means that you give up the mantle opinion, a bitter, you give up the mantle of being legal.
And that's it's the first step to losing.
11:30
So anyways, lots of guys you guys are amazing Saturday morning, thoughts putting together some cool stuff but for all my gym with you were on the call.
You see how cool is the pitch right?
I would have heard so much of that thing.
I can't wait to see everyone's numbers when you guys start using it.
11:47
John Kriss Barnett and Becca Spencer.
Lots of guys talk to you.

So enjoy that and let's start the podcast.
Gary Vee Not have Gary Vee to Mentor him on his career.
0:32
I did I do right now.
We all do and so many of us will pass Carrie and I don't think Gary mines.
The wealthiest people in the world see business as a game.
This podcast, the game is my attempt at documenting, the lessons I've learned on my way to building acquisition.com into a billion dollar portfolio.
0:48
My Hope Is that you use the lessons to grow your business and maybe someday soon partner with us to get to a million dollars and Beyond, I hope you share and enjoy.
I see this thing that happens all the time and in different lenses people approach them differently.
So like when you are a kid and you learn arithmetic first, you learn your numbers and then you learn how to add and then, you know, you level up, you learn how to multiply and then you level up from there and you learn, you know, how to do algebra, when you get to algebra, you don't think, man.
1:13
My arithmetic teacher is a fucking idiot.
I can't believe they didn't teach me this stuff.
It's like, dude, you weren't ready and you had to have the arithmetic in order to get to the multiplication.
It's not that.
That teacher is an idiot.
It's that, that was the sequence.
And so when Our first teacher that teaches you the basics, and you have more advanced teacher later.
1:29
It doesn't mean you should shit on your first teacher.
It's like that person.
Got you ready to receive the next thing?
And I think that when I was earlier on my career, I I definitely did the other way, you don't.
I mean, I was just like this guy didn't know anything.
This guy is the guy rather than seeing it like you would see any other thing that you'd have in school, right?
1:48
And so that was the first point that I wanted to cover.
The next point is, this is more to the mentors, which is like I've had the opportunity in the You know, the gift of being able to Mentor, whatever you want to say, you know, provide advice counsel, share my experiences and a lot of people consume those things and a lot of people hold me in a regard and most people who are winners or competitive, it's just like who you are, right?
2:10
You want to win, you want to beat everybody.
Cuz that's that's part of the competitive drive.
But I think there's like a there's a comma there that needs to get put in which is that you have to accept two things.
One, is that you were going to die and no one is going to remember like real real.
2:25
Like 10,000 years from now.
No one's going to remember at all.
Number two is that when you're at the end of your life, the people who are going to be our by your bedside or not, the people you Vanquish, but the people that you helped.
And so, when I think about that and I know that I have passed a lot of the mentors that I've had in my career in terms of financials Etc.
2:44
And I really early rod used to think that made me better than them better at the game of business.
I was better at whatever but I think that as I've had a couple more years and some more more scars I've realized something different which is that I was only able to get better than them because they gave me the Head Start.
3:03
They were like, hey man, step on my shoulder and you can you can reach that that next next branch.
And I think that if the mentees and the mentors, both see it that way, then the mentees will stop shitting on the mentors that helped them and the mentors will stop trying to hold back secrets that have propelled them further because the point is not that you're going to beat One, you're going to get really old and then you're going to die.
3:29
And as you're getting older, they're going to be people who are younger, who had a head start.
When you're like man, these guys got so easy.
That's the point of progress as a civilization and so rather than lamenting that the Next Generation has it easier.
I thought that what we all say is I want my kids to have it better than I did or I want the I want to make the world a better place.
3:51
Well, that's what making the world a better place.
Looks like is that they have a head start.
And so we say Say that this is our mission with our business.
We want to make the world a better place.
Want to make an impact.
We may want to make positive impact on people's lives and then when it actually happens, we resent the kids for the fact that they didn't have it as hard as us.
4:08
It's like that was the point.
And so I think, if we can shift the perspective from the mentor side of, like my point is not to beat the progeny of point is to forges as far as I can look back and be like, hey, watch out for that hole.
Watch out for that rock, keep going, keep going.
4:24
And the thing is as they move through the That I did that.
We tread three times faster than we did because we already cleared all the trees and then they get to the next non clearing and they have to start hacking away and hacking away and hacking away to forge the next PATH.
4:39
And then they become the mentors, turn around and the Next Generation moved six times as fast to cover my distance and their distance, right?
And so like we really do stand on the shoulders of the Giants of the stand, on the shoulders, of the people who came before us.
And so, when I think about like the gratitude that I have for, you know, the Aguirre V's who like, he's, you know, whatever 13 11 years, 12 years older than I am.
5:01
And he's forced so much of this path that like, I didn't have to think about how am I going to create this whole thing.
It's like not judge.
He already had a blueprint.
I can just start laying that out immediately execute rather than having to spend six years, figuring it out, right?
And the same degree there are there are guys who we have in our portfolio right now who are in their 20s, who are making twice, what I was making total in their 20s.
5:25
What?
I was making it 30 and so like I could either be like fuck these guys.
I'm gonna hold my secrets because I want to be better than them right or and they could also be like I'm better than he is right.
But if they came to me below and then now they're above, then, like that was the point like they should.
5:46
And like, I'm not going to be number one, but I'm going to still fucking repeat your.
I mean, I'm still going to go after.
I'm going to go for gold because I got guys who were ahead of me and I'm still going to go.
There, you know what I mean?
And so I think that that's the that's the beauty of being a human here.
I mean, like you're going to live, you're going to die, you're going to learn some things and you want to teach you the next guy.
6:06
And as long as the next guy honors, the fact that guy died on the battlefield to give him these lessons and come back.
And they have to recognize that they're going to die on the battlefield to for the Next Generation to pass them.
Then I think that it makes the conversation in the community, much more productive and much more collaborative rather than the shit talking of, like I better.
6:24
I'm this guy had it easier.
Man, if I had that kind of advantage, of course you didn't.
That was why we did?
What we did was, to have to pass, only a base, to make the world a better place, make an impact.
If people had start, that was the point.
So like they have it easier than us mission accomplished.
6:39
If you look at some of the greatest success stories, a lot of them talk about their mentors.
So like Warren Buffett had Paul Graham who is his his mentor early on.
So he wanted to work for him.
A quick story on that was that he said, I'll work for you for free and Paul Graham told him your overpriced because he recognized that he was the one Who's going to be giving far more to this relationship, even if Warren gave him his time, he still was going to be on the losing side, but he still did it anyways because he recognized that Warren had a gift, right?
7:05
And Warren past him in his career.
And you'll notice that Warren isn't like, man, I'm so much better than Paul Graham.
Like, I passed that dude in my like, 40s.
He doesn't talk like that because you honors, the fact that Paul Graham got him to this point.
And when he and Charlie Munger talk about it, they talk about what they learned from Paul Graham.
7:22
And then what they then had to learn on their own, it's the next Evolution in investing.
And if Paul Graham it had Paul Graham, he might have been Warren Buffett but he didn't only Warren.
Got Paul Graham, right?
And so, Gary Vee didn't have Gary Vee to Mentor him on his career.
7:41
I did I do right now.
We all do and so many of us will pass Gary and I don't think Gary minds but Gary didn't have Gary.
I've got Gary.
But you know what's different is that there's a 20 year old and might be you who's watching this.
This and you've got me and I'm I'm I'm accomplishing things at a pretty fast pace and you're going to do it faster than me and I love it.
8:04
That's the point.
I'm still going to be hustling trying to beat.
You don't get me wrong but it's surface-level not deep down.
You know what I mean?
And I say this because I had this narrative and it really impacted the way, I saw mentors, and how I saw other content creators and how I saw, you know, people giving advice.
8:20
And when I see you guys were in their 60s, I'm like, man by the time I'm 60, I'm gonna be 10 times as wealthy as so I'm going to be, you know, I'm going to have 10 times the realist and I'm 10 times the other things, right?
Yeah.
But if they had themselves as mentors, they would too.
And so it's like I'm trying to like rub it in someone's face who's literally been doing nothing but feed me and help me right?
8:40
And so they say if you if you want to go fast go alone if you want to go far go together.
And so I think that if the narrative changes and the mentors realized that the mentees are supposed to beat them and that if they beat them, it's a sign that the mentor was a success, not a failure.
Like that's the mark of the good Mentor is that all the people they teach rise above them.
9:01
If you were mentees in the students that you have and the people that you help in the two people that you teach, don't move above you.
It means that you're a bad teacher, not a good one.
It doesn't mean you're so much better than everyone else.
It means you're so bad at transferring the skill because everyone should be able to move up from your experiences faster than it took you to get there, like think about that.
9:18
Like so for everyone who's got the education business as a side note, if you've got an education business and no one's doing better than you because you're not Willing to give the secrets that you know, are really the things that are driving.
You're not you're not some superhuman, you're not, I promise you.
There are so many smarter people on Wall Street than you promised there are.
9:36
And so if none of those people are moving ahead, it's because you're not really teaching.
It's not because you're better even though your ego wants to say that, So like that's the goal, but I think that if we if we make that the new definition of success of a teacher's that the students surpassed the teacher, it's not that the student no longer needs the teacher, the student, whatever is that like they should move faster through those careers and then get to the point where they're both looking together with his experience and his Raw Talent, looking at the new landscape setting.
10:03
All right, what do you think we should do?
Real quick guys.
If you can think about how you found this podcast, somebody probably tweeted it told you about it.
Should it on Instagram or something like that?
The only way this grows is through word of mouth and so I don't run ads, I don't do sponsorships, I don't sell anything.
10:20
I only ask is that you continue to pay it forward to whoever showed you or however you found out about this podcast that you do the exact same thing.
So if it was a review if it was a post, if you do that would mean the world to me and you throw some good karma out there for another entrepreneur.
Yeah, I think we go, you know, I tried that of thing over here that I haven't shared with you that my stuff then we can both March together, right?
10:41
And so I just think it's a it shifted my perspective in terms of how I saw my mentors and the how much they serve me and how much I would rather honor them now rather than rub it in their face that I'm younger and I'm making more money than them.
Of course, I, they help me.
I get asked a lot of times because I have this quote, give away the secret cell, the implementation with your business, right?
11:00
And what that's what we do, right?
It means selling the position.
We're going to sell it.
We buy the abilities because we Bye-bye, you know minority interest in business, by the way, for doing three dollars or more in your business and you want to have helped go to amazon.com.
But the reason that I make this stuff is that like, I say this all the time like I'm going to die.
And the only thing that will be left, will be the, the documented stuff that I've been able to share the books that I write the courses that I make.
11:20
And realistically, the courses are probably fate, so the books might be the only things that are left with given enough time, right?
And so I also do this because I forget this stuff, like, what I'm in that when I'm in it, I was when I want to be making it because if I'm looking back, you forget the Nuance.
You forget the details.
And so, I'm trying to do both things which is build a bigger business while documenting.
11:38
And this is one thing that I want to like, explain Rudy, I spent about half my day now, writing the books and outlining the books, and making the framework, so that I can communicate it in a really simple way.
If I wanted to make more money, I would get half my time back and just double down on building my business faster, I wouldn't be doing this so like inherently, I'm giving up my future upside to have more people have the opportunity to crush me or I can see it is.
12:04
We have the opportunity to help way more people at skill, make the world a better place and I think that when I'm 85 and I look back, I'll rather have lived that life because I don't think that I'll have a difference between being worth 10 billion and 20 billion when I'm 85.
But I do think they'll be a big difference if I try to get there by hoarding everything and making one guy's life better rather than everyone's life better.
12:26
I think I experienced a lot of Joy knowing that other people don't have to suffer as much, which is the set funny thing of like they didn't have his heart as us.
It's like, well, I thought that was the point, right?
And so when I hear somebody's like, dude, you help me get my business from 10,000 to 50,000 month are like, dude, I we're walking around outside yesterday and some it's like, dude, I did everything you have and we're doing four million dollars a year.
12:45
Now, like he was like emotional when you saw us like, walking around and like I can't meet everyone, and I don't have the emotional tie, but just knowing that it's happening.
It makes.
Making the hard times easier. and for me that, you know, I find meaning in that, Because it feels worth it.
13:03
It feels like it's not just me trying to do this for myself as we try to do this for a lot of people.
And so like if I'm failing over and over again at this thing, I know that once I figure it out, I'll be able to help hundred people cheat code their way through it.
And not spend five months, figuring something out or two years figuring something out like I was stuck at Mid 30 million for three years, which to everyone watching to, like boohoo that's not the point is that there's another guy who's going to get to that point.
13:25
And he's going to move right past it like in a blink of an eye because I've had the right advice that I didn't have right Arden of the context and so So, the amount of scale that that person be able to help immediately 200 a year later, two years later because of, that is the point.
And so then I can get more leverage in terms of like making myself, feel better, that all these other people are doing well.
13:44
So when I go through the hard time, I can think about that and it gets me through it if this change your mind about some of the shit talking that you've done to a teacher or to a mentor who was earlier on in your career because you pass them, or they taught you, part of the way and then somebody else taught you, more of the way.
Like I only ask now it's just like shoot that guy text and be like hey like respect I appreciate You because I can't tell you one how much it means to the mentor when they get that text.
14:07
And I also think to it'll help you spit out the poison that you had about the hate that you had.
That wasn't real.
It was only made up in your head.
So Caleb and I were talking about Gary and how Gary Forbes, the way for so many people and how some people will get further than Gary did by the end of Gary's life.
14:24
And it's not that Gary, that doesn't say that Gary's bad.
It shows that Gary's really good.
Because the point of a good teacher is that the It does pass the teacher.
And so I wanted to break down that concept because it was something that really has shifted.
My perspective in the mentors that I've had in my life and how I saw them before during and after my experiences with them and on an ongoing basis.
14:43
And if you have mentors, you have teachers in your life, I guarantee you that in 10 minutes or whatever, this ends up being, it will forever shift.
How you see that relationship for the benefit of both of you?
It does pass the teacher.
And so I wanted to break down that concept because it was something that really has shifted.
My perspective in the mentors that I've had in my life and how I saw them before during and after my experiences with them and on an ongoing basis.
And if you have mentors, you have teachers in your life, I guarantee you that in 10 minutes or whatever, this ends up being, it will forever shift.

What's up guys?
I made a short podcast, it's two parts, this part 1 with a manual, Bola crazy story, guy recites me, 100 times.
And said, I promise you, if you will come on, my thinking, cap fine up again.
And again, I really did want to do it is like, if you, if you say yes, he's like, I will get every single human being.
0:17
I know to show up in this podcast.
I was like, alright, man, I'll do it and motherfucker messaged every human, he knew and got like, 200 people live and I don't think that was size of his audience at the time.
And I just always, Had my respect for that.
So I want to tell you guys for listening and hopefully you get as much out of that as I did.
0:34
But the first half the podcasts all about making high, ticket offers I think you guys will dig it.
He got pretty tactical with it because he's like rent, real ground Grassroots right now.
And so if you're in that position, I think it'll totally apply to you.
So enjoy.
Welcome to the game where we talk about how to get more customers, how to make more per customer and how to keep them longer and the many failures and lessons, we have learned along the way.
0:57
Hope you enjoy and subscribe.
And when I went to your book was no one changing the cheese on people having to move from one needs to do that because they feel that I'm not able to get clients in this Village.
So maybe I should just switch my new channel, get clients and how exactly those darts not solve the problem of coin plant acquisition.
1:19
So fundamentally as long as you are not selling newspapers which is what I give us.
The example, the book as long as you're not, truly selling ice to Eskimos as long as you're, you're selling.
Something that people want which a lot of times is the problem, right?
As long as you're selling something people want, if you're if you're a marketer for example, you're trying to sell, you know, getting more leads are making more sales, everyone wants that, right?
1:39
So that's there's there's really no disconnect there, the issues usually that you have a lack of skill in some way.
And the problem that arises is when you start trying to switch avatars or switch niches, you end up having to start over again because you have to learn the Avatar refilling, the desires, you have to learn how to speak to them.
1:54
You have to learn what their problems are.
And the thing that I kind of go with is that All of those will work, but none of them were work if you try to make them all work, right?
So you have to, you have to grow through elimination, right?
Because I'm a big believer in the theory of constraint, will grow to the constraint that we have and most people.
2:12
And this is a, this is one that maybe everyone in the audience can resonate with when I see an entrepreneur who's doing a million or 5 million or 10 million or whatever.
And they say well I'm going to start this other vertical.
I'm going to start this other thing.
What ends up happening is that this one goes up and their main one goes down and they're still doing ten million dollars except they have more overhead down.
2:29
And so So you can't be CEOs who companies write that like, think about how many, how many publicly traded CEOs, exist?
That are CEOs of two companies.
There's only one person that anyone ever gives and they say you on must but he's actually not, he's not the operator, he's the owner and founder of those companies and yes people who run them.
But the point is is that you're probably not Elon Musk if you're still struggling to make your first sales.
2:49
So if that's the situation then let's just cross them off the equation and say that no one is doing CEO of multiple companies and so the issue is a lot of times with the definitions, right?
So it's like I'm owner.
So you You hire one person because you're one person.
You figure.
Oh well I'm one person, I'll hire one person.
They were going to have a past the business.
3:05
But the reality is that there's so many shades of what we do because we're really just fractionally doing like, eight different jobs, right?
So your your head of customer service your head, your VP of sales, your Senior Chief marketing officer, or CEO, you're also owner, right?
And you're sure you're doing all of these roles and see maybe replace the Fulfillment but you still have to be CMO.
3:22
You have to be still VP of sales yourself to be the owner.
He's something all, these are their hats.
And so, if you're trying to imagine doing that, For two businesses or three businesses, it becomes it becomes a work equation.
That doesn't work and people can't solve it, right?
3:37
And that's why they burn out and give up because they're stretchy thing.
There's not enough heat for the amount of pans on the stove.
And so the, the formula of, in case anyone's listening, I'm not sure how to develop the audience's, but 402 a million, which is most people are starting out, right?
It's just, it's 111, all right, it's one product to one avatar on one channel, and if you're like, well, I'll do One product, one Avatar Wan Qin on each of my businesses.
4:02
No, no one product to one avatar on one channel and you will fail and you will continue to fail until you succeed.
And then at that point, it will begin to work.
And most of the time.
In my opinion, the reason I started all the the series of books that the offer is that getting customers shouldn't be difficult.
4:18
The difficulties should be in the Fulfillment which means being good at your craft.
All right, because what happens a lot of times people think they need to learn more promotion, more sales, and that's true to a degree, right?
But it's in my opinion.
Easier to Just make more compelling offer, do more for your clients, even if you only have a handful of them, that is not scalable.
4:35
And that's okay because you need to generate cash flow and make sales, learn as much as you can get better at your craft and then in time, create a more scalable offer.
As you learn what they value, what they don't value.
It takes you time with doesn't take you time and as you also only get better, right?
And so that's kind of like the Tesla Model to.
4:50
It's like you start with the most expensive thing at the top you start there and then as you build that and you and you brand position is being Elite there, then you can do a mid-level and then over time you Trickle down and do a larger lower cost item for the base of the pyramid.
Most people do it backwards and do it wrong and, you know, try and compete against lots of people when they're not, even that good.
5:09
And that's the reality, right?
Is most people don't make money because they're just not that good at the thing.
They think they're good at is, if they were good, then they would be making money.
When you said you started in, was it - passivity I notice.
When I tell people charge more, you know, statutes, you know what they say, I'm gay people who pay me that money or you know, how do I I get me that moisturize.
5:31
So how do you usually communicate that to overcome that particular man challenge?
So people will pay you for the value.
You're currently trying to provide.
That's the issue, right?
Is that they won't pay you for what your comma for, what?
You're trying to provide them, right?
5:47
But if you try and provide in excess of that.
And so as a thought experiment or thought example, think of this, let's say, we said, if you're selling any kind of B2B thing, right?
We should be like, how to increase how much money did?
Let's just, let's just start there because there's a People going, you're probably in that space.
Yeah, if I were to say, I can double how much you're making or if people aren't making money here serving, they say I can add ten thousand dollars months, your income within 90 days guaranteed or I'll pay you twice the cost of the program at the end of the 90 days.
6:14
How difficult would it be for you to sign people up?
Not hard at all?
How difficult would it be for you to get someone to pay you ten thousand dollars to make ten thousand dollars a month?
Well considering colleges graduate people who are going to make 50,000 hours after waiting for years and people pay two hundred thousand dollars for that.
I think it's reasonably believe that.
People pay between ten twenty thirty thousand dollars for that skill.
6:33
And so then the question is or what I would normally get after that is like well I can't do that Alex I don't know how to get someone I can't guarantee that outcome and it's like aha.
Then let's solve the problem which is that you don't know how to do that.
Now we have a solvable proposition that we can get better at whereas I don't know how to get customers.
6:50
Sure that is also solvable thing.
But in my opinion, you would be best served honing, the craft and finding a way to fill in such a way that you could guarantee that Within reason, and if that's the thought experiment and On The Other Extreme, you have by my saying and maybe you win and maybe you don't.
7:07
And I get paid either way, that's the essence of what most people's offer is if we just boiled it down to Soup To Nuts, right?
So if this is one extreme where everybody says, yes and wants people to buy from you and on this extremely of is very difficult to get customers.
There are somewhere on this Continuum, ideally one or two shades from this side, right?
