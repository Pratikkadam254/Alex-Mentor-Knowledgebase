Transcript:
(00:00) you guys want to hear something completely insane yes okay you're gonna have to hear it anyways I was able to take home more in a year than the CEOs of McDonald's Ikea Ford Motorola and Yahoo combined as a kid in his 20s for over half a decade there you go which which resulted in 200 million dollars in portfolio Revenue as of today we crossed 100 million dollars by age 33 and to be honest no one's more surprised than I am about this Alcove and so me expressing this will create Envy in some people
 it will create anger in others skepticism in most confusion in old people
(00:46) and Inspire select few and so the select few you or who I'm making this for everyone else you can tell but you are the people that I'm making this for let's go back there we go so who wants to hear about some stuff that can shortcut their path to material success so they can ponder the purpose of achieving it to begin with all right so we're going to cover three things today this is fresh from this morning right off the press number one how I'm making money really works number two why new stuff is making you poor number three why better is the way
(01:21) you're like that doesn't make sense yet it will said simply who wants to make lots of money funny thing what you're watching right now is not my original presentation I actually changed it at the very last minute the night before I went out to get dessert a bunch of people from the event were in town going to the place that I was by accident as soon as I left the frozen yogurt lunch where I was I was like the presentation I have for tomorrow isn't what these people need and so I spent that night and all morning making entirely new presentation which is what you are watching who believes that you have to
(01:51) work hard to make money who believes that no one can outwork them you're gonna see where I'm gonna go with this well I'm going to attempt to prove you wrong the reason this is so important is that all of us claim or I have hurt who here has seen a guru on the internet say no one can outwork me who's heard people say that on podcasts make Instagram posts about it whatever It actually drives me [ __ ] bananas and it drives me bananas because it teaches the wrong lesson so how can we claim that we work every day and yet we can't even Define the word
(02:28) so how do you define work the science definition is work equals force times distance problem with that is it's not very useful for knowledge workers most of us are not actually doing manual labor not useful the second way is that you can think about in terms of inputs of time right like is that how hard you work no one can outwork me I work longer hours do you think you're the only person who works 16 18 hours every day like go to China I'm like I don't even know if anyone in America can say it I'm being dead like dead
(03:03) serious so that's why when I see these things just drive me [ __ ] nuts so the problem with that is that many people work all the hours they're awake and if you suggest working more hours then you're sleeping less and I don't think that's a good idea for knowledge workers so why can no network you again right so everyone's working those hours so then the next one is like that's how no one can outwork Me No One's Gonna try harder than me so you want participation trophies is this how you want your employees to think that they're working hard I mean not me I wouldn't want that
(03:42) so if it's not force times distance to Define what work is and if it's not the amount of time we're putting into the work that we do and it's not the effort that we are expending or how hard we try then what's work we have to get clear on it because if that's what we have to do to make money we got to know what we're actually trying to [ __ ] do so here's Alex's definition work equals outputs fancy image outputs equal volume times Leverage in plain speak number of times you do something times how much you get out of each time you do
(04:21) it how do we work faster work rate equals that same thing divided by time plain speak output per minute of time that is how you work faster which means that the hardest working man in the world can be objectively measured that guy is the hardest guy working in the world in 2022 he added 140 billion dollars in net worth for context that's more than Bill Gates did his entire career in one year think about that for a second and then the next year he did the exact same amount again FYI that's 2 billion a week so output divided by time
(05:09) there's the time one year there's the output he's the hard work hardest working guy so who's going to be the 2027 champ point of me doing this is I hope it's somebody here who did who would like to be the 2027 champ all right let's rock so if you want to be it then please pay attention this will help you so how can we get more output which in the game of business is Enterprise Value it's how much [ __ ] is worth outputs right we have this one and I've got a nice flexi arm volume is the number of times we move the leather I literally made all these images this morning all right I'm very very proud of them all right volume is the number of
(05:46) times you move the lever The Leverage is the length of the lever itself that you're using the outputs is how much you can lift on the other side so let's look at a couple examples you guys can just shout it when I say just say high or low so high or low high or low hi higher low very high the reason I put this one in here is that at a certain point it's not about how strong the person is it all depends on how much leverage you have that's the point of the slide now higher low volume times a thousand the thing's just as long as the other one
(06:27) highest yes so now that we understand what work is you can either do more activity or you can do it with more leverage to get more output doing more is Cap by time and physical ability how much you get AKA Leverage is uncapped no cap I learned that gen Z there we go um now fun fact Warren Buffett took home 500 million in dividends last year from Coca-Cola as an owner the CEO took home 50.
(07:05) he spent less time working on Coca-Cola than the CEO did so is he working harder by the definition that we did yes more output we've been playing the game wrong if you want to outwork your competition what you really should be doing is out leveraging them so who gets more done we got one person who's 100 calls a day another person is 100 calls a day the guy who has more skill one guy makes 100 calls another guy makes 100 calls the guy who's better on the phone gets more output okay let's say they're equal skill they're working eight hours a day making calls oh I forgot to ask a question who gets
(07:41) more work done there's the answer the guy that has the automated dialer that keeps his talk time the highest okay same skill same number of hours and same automated dialer to maximize talk time now who gets more work done the guy who has the best list okay they've got the same list the same skill same dialer eight hours a day the guy who's calling to the right season the right time to die Who Wants to be calling selling [ __ ] during December if you're selling physical products who wants to sell on Black Friday of course more leverage same work more
(08:21) output okay let's say all this stuff's equal now who's now who's even all right we got I mean what else do we have nice he actually called it the guy calling with the better offer now we've got the same time same time of year same list same offer same dialer equal skill eight hours a day now who's gonna do it it's got to be equal now right the guy who recorded his pitch and send it to 10 million people now to push this even further what if the guy made zero calls and didn't do anything who makes more against the best caller on Earth the guy's got a team he's got 15 dudes
(09:04) on the phone okay how good you are and if you're like well I think I could be 15 it can't be 1500. okay who you are leverage and that guy made zero calls I have more people calling for me today while I'm on stage Leverage the game is rigged and you've been playing by rules that do not exist if you want to make more money you need to get more for your time you need more leverage and this should make sense because we all trade time for money and I can prove this to you you spend time every second of your life you receive money over the time that you
(09:46) are alive so money divided by time equals rate of output we are all paid dollars per hour the reason I'm specifically saying this to this audience is that you all get fooled all the [ __ ] time by passive income it's not passive it's less active but it is not binary it is not active or passive it's how active is it so if you make one trade in the stock market all the time it took you to analyze the deal and every other deal you decided not to do and then execute the trade and then raise the money and do all the other
(10:23) stuff that is all the time that it took you to do that now after that point you have increasing returns per unit of time is this making sense the point I'm making here is that time is the thing we all have the same twenty four dollars in our wallet it's about how we allocate them and what we get back for them how well we trade just said that there you go degrees all that so Leverage is the difference between what you put in and what you get out there are fancy definitions for it this is the best one that I have
(11:00) and so I said I would cover three things the first one is how making money really works the answer to that question is Leverage you make more money by trading your time for more [ __ ] more output the second is why new stuff is making you poor and this is especially relevant for everyone here part of this again was inspired by the conversations I was having last night at Yogurtland so thank you for everybody who shout out for that this is also how not to get leverage and I felt compelled to make this because I hope that some of you identify with this because I would bet
(11:32) that the majority of you are doing this how not to get leverage there are five pieces to this that I want to break down today number one uninformed optimism number two is a story I'll tell you about a construction buddy of mine number three is something I call the magic wand Story number four is half Bell Bridges number five is one with the red dress you're like I have no [ __ ] clue and that means you will so let's start with uninformed optimism who here has seen this this is stages of change stage of transition anyone seen this this chart before okay cool not a
(12:02) lot of you perfect so there are five steps and I remember the first time I saw this it like it changed my life whenever you're analyzing something new who here has had a buddy tell you about something that they're doing and they're making a lot of money doing it and then you immediately feel shitty about what you're doing and then think I should get out of my opportunity vehicle go over here and do what they're doing who's felt that thank you everyone has the reason is because we're at step one which is uninformed optimism you don't know enough about what they're saying
(12:33) they're just giving you the highlights they're giving you the Instagram reel they're not giving you the real once you decide to get out of your little vehicle and then going over there then you tell your buddy you're like hey why am I not making money he's like oh well there's like a hundred other [ __ ] steps that I didn't talk to you about in the beginning but like and it's actually nearly impossible and I got really lucky that one time um and and now all of a sudden it looks like all the people at your old job are making more money than you uh but yeah
(13:00) let's keep doing it so you move to St stage two which has informed pessimism you are now aware of the [ __ ] that is involved to make the money that you want in this new thing now you think okay this is probably the worst part but then time elapses and it's still shitty and you still haven't made money yet it blows more now because you have invested more time and still have zero so your actual output to time is low rate which is why it's so painful which is where people get into the crisis of meaning why the [ __ ] am I doing this what does money even matter
(13:37) anyways you know what I'd be happier if I just spent more time with my kids you change your goal because you encounter difficulty and so it happens most times is that people then crash and burn I'm going to skip one forward and then I'm going to come back because I want the visual to work the way I want um ah [ __ ] it okay so if you're at the crisis of meaning this is where most people offshoot what happens here where that that fourth dot there on the bottom if I were to cross it out and write uninformed optimism again
(14:09) that's what most of you do you find about something cool inform pessimism it kind of sucks oh [ __ ] it's way harder than I thought uninformed optimism I'll try something else and then you do it again and again and again and the difference between video games in real life where you you face the boss and you can't pass the level until you beat the boss is that when you die in the video game you restart a few seconds later in the game of Entrepreneurship you start years later this is why people don't progress they keep fighting the same boss that can't learn the same [ __ ] lesson they keep
(14:46) losing and I'm saying this because some of you I heard at Yogurtland and I know that that's representative of other people here you keep fighting the same boss and the boss is being able to stick with it is getting through in different charts on this the crisis of meaning is also called the valley of despair is getting through from there you get into informed optimism you figure out that little thing like I had to do this one thing and then this started working and then you know what I found out I could clean
(15:16) the list through this tool I found on the internet because I joined this forum and they started doing that and then all of a sudden my pickup rates tripled right or my response rates tripled or my throughput on my website went up whatever it is right and so you have to get through that piece then you get to informed optimism and the number six you achieve and then all your friends are like yo what are you doing you're like oh I got this thing and then all of them come right that is where most people start something new over and over and over again and they don't learn the lesson
(15:46) and so this is what their life looks like over and over and over and over again who here has more than one business in the last 24 months be honest thank you for being honest I appreciate it first thing it's normal I had nine businesses and I was broke so I say this with the pain of experience I'm not saying this to to be on a Pulpit I'm saying it because the faster you can get through it the faster you will start making money you have to beat the boss everyone thinks the grass is greener but the other side's still aligned with [ __ ]
(16:23) like that's why the grass is so great there's [ __ ] everywhere I have a CFO who's been with us for a long time she went through all of our exits last year she's probably almost 60 and she has to sing she's like it's all [ __ ] doesn't matter what business it is they all got [ __ ] she's Southern and uh Suzanne's awesome but it just always reminds me of this is that there's always [ __ ] and whenever we're starting something new we encounter something that we didn't know before and we're like oh this makes this shittier and then we think well are we going to jump out no
(16:52) well this is new information great we're more informed fantastic so that is the thing number one that is keeping you poor uninformed optimism number two is a little story I want to tell you so I was called up probably two three years ago by a guy I knew in high school we hadn't talked in a while and he said hey I've got this roofing business uh you know I want to scale it I want to go big I was like that's awesome man and so he was telling me about the roofing business tell me about the roofing business and all of a sudden he says oh yeah I mean we also do some general
(17:21) contracting work I was like okay uh why don't you grow the roofing business he said well you know don't leave money on the table okay um and then this is going to sink in for some of you guys uh and then and he was like I was like so you've got the roofing you got the GC stuff he's like yeah that's what I'm doing he's like you pause for a second it's like well we also kind of flip houses too so we like fix them and flip them we also do the Contracting work but we fixed the roof so we just get huge costs we're vertically integrated it's like dude you're making less three
(17:54) million bucks you're gonna [ __ ] vertical integrated you're distracted right and he was like how do I scale and I was like just pick one he's like what do you mean I was like pick one it's like why do you think you can't build a billion dollar roofing business just doing Roofing and just get better at doing Roofing he said well I don't leave money on the table who here said they don't leave money on the table the money or you were leaving on the table is the focus that you're not giving to the one thing that matters
(18:26) and so by the way this is the self-made women list for Forbes this is Diane Hendricks she's the number one wealthiest self-made Woman by the way and she owns if you can see it there ABC Supply which is Roofing not housephobic not General Contracting work Roofing why didn't he build that he's smarter than Diane Hendricks that's why so this is the list and this is what I want you to notice about this this is the Forbes the top six for women self-made notice the age of the people on there age is the left column 75 78 84 90 89
(19:07) 63. on the right notice the source Roofing Healthcare software retailing gas stations Trucking Little Caesars Pizza I.T so sexy the point of this slide is that if you want to build something epic you have to be able to do the same thing for an extended period of time without convincing yourself you're smarter than you are which means if you wanted to not make money this is what you should do number one do lots of different things number two do them for short periods of time don't stick with it too long because you might see success number
(19:50) three do not get help okay number four make all the mistakes in your own it's the best way to do it because otherwise if you start learning from other people's mistakes you can move faster so don't want to do that when you make a mistake do it again just repeat it especially if you're like I've been here before do the same thing who here knows the definition of learning I'll tell you same condition different Behavior so if you want to teach someone something and you present them the same condition and they have not changed
(20:21) their behavior they have not learned if you came to this Workshop this weekend with the intention of learning something can I get everybody to raise their hand if they had the intention of learning something while they were here if you go back home and your behavior does not change you learned nothing nothing truly took the money and burned it along with losing the output that you lost in the time of here plus travel so if that definition has been singed into my mind because if I want to learn something and I have the same condition that's been presented I have to ask
(20:57) myself if I do the same thing again it means I have not learned and I don't want to play this boss again so if you do want to make money you can flip it you do one thing for a very long period of time you get help from other people You observe what other people have been doing you only make the mistake one time if you are going to make them and you always grow and challenge the beliefs that you had and try and answer the question what do I believe to be true that is not because ordinary business is done for
(21:27) Extraordinary time create extraordinary results compounding is the thing like it has to compound if the vehicle you are in right now does not compound with time then change the vehicle get into something that if you stick with it for an extended period of time it would be unreasonable that you will be poor that was my construction Buddy Story so I had a conversation with a different friend and he had a zillion businesses like a zillion I get a spreadsheet for how many businesses he had and they were all
(21:56) [ __ ] businesses they didn't actually make any money but he had like a logo and a website and like some VA you know what I mean like oh it's a business and he was believing the fallacy of I'm just going to wait to see the thing that takes off and then go on on that who here has thought this thought I get it I'm gonna Focus I'm just gonna wait I'm gonna be patient see which one works out and then because I'm a good you know statistics guy I'm gonna go with the winning horse right but the reality is that any of them could take off you could have a billion dollar roofing business you have a billion dollar GC
(22:31) business you have a billion dollar householding business but you can't have them all so you got to focus you gotta pick one and the nice thing is it doesn't really matter which one you pick but you do need to pick one the picking is the thing that grows it the ability to say no is the thing that grows it not the thing you pick it's who you are as a consequence of the decision that changes the outcome not the vehicle does that make sense so how arrogant is it to think that we can do multiple things at once and compete with someone who's spending all their time on that one thing it's ridiculous and yet we still do it
(23:09) and so this is I love this little cartoon this guy you know he's got all the spinning plates and this is this is me with the red hair going to this guy who's hopefully my competitor and handing him more plays be like oh do you see all that shiny object over there here more plates go I'm just going to do this one thing it's my favorite thing in the world competing against somebody who's doing lots of things it's very easy to win you don't have to do much because you only have to do a tenth of what they do so this is what Focus really looks like
(23:40) one thing all in you can write that down you can Circle it one thing all in so I asked my friend of mine that had the Excel sheet with all these zillions of questions right I said if I had a magic wand and I ended all your side projects except for one just one the one that you think has the most opportunity the one that's probably making the most money right now that you're not paying attention to because it's boring because it's always been doing a while he's like yeah I was like you know what business it is he's like yeah
(24:07) like okay if you ended everything else because I I have a magic wand so I get to make the rules magic wand they all disappear I said how easy would it be to grow that thing he just looked at me it's like really [ __ ] easy I was like hmm interesting and so he's like but that would be so hard because of insert real reason that no one gives a [ __ ] about no one cares but I have to fire that uh-huh but I would have to shut down uh-huh but I would have to lay off uh-huh all the riches you want are on the other
(24:43) side of a few hard conversations and most people spend the rest of their lives not having them and being poor and wondering why it's gonna suck it's gonna be okay that was my number three story the magic wand number four my favorite story who here has seen The Matrix awesome you need to become the person who can say no to the woman the red dress the woman in the red dress is the representation of everything that is shiny object and beautiful and wonderful in the world whatever your flavor of woman in the red dress is
(25:18) and the thing is and this is something that I have now learned painstakingly is that being able to say no to the one in the red dress changes at levels you can say no to the one in their address who's a crackhead on the corner right a thousand bucks a month you're like I can say no to her no worries well I got something better right but then the ten thousand dollar a month girl you're like huh okay interesting and if you're making ten thousand dollars a month it's hard to say no to that girl but let's say that you're a a
(25:49) hard-working discipline [ __ ] you get to a hundred thousand dollars a month there's a hundred thousand dollar a month girl that's an opportunity that is much bigger than the one that you said no to before and you have to learn to flex the muscle at every level this this is a lesson that I learned the hard way I started a supplement company when Jim Walsh was doing 26 million a year and rather than say oh why don't I just take gym launch to 40 next year I'll start another thing gym launch stayed the same and then I added another source of Revenue that got
(26:19) us to 37 but it was a mistake strategically I can tell the story it sounds great on paper we sold the company lots of money whatever but like it was not the right move and so I had learned how to say no to a million dollar opportunity a five million a 10 million but I hadn't learned how to say no to a 20 million opportunity when I was making 20 million and so like the woman in the red dress becomes more seductive more attractive the better you get the more status you get the hotter the girl you attract right and I'm saying
(26:50) this figuratively for entrepreneurs does that make sense for everybody who's not into women with red dresses okay because this is what the woman in the red dress really looks like just ready to smash your [ __ ] and distract you and spread you thin so that you can't keep your eye on the ball and then eventually she spreads you so thin that you don't know how to get out and it feels like quicksand because as soon as you put out fires here there's fires here there's fires here fires here I need more Talent you take the best
(27:23) person from over here to fix that problem then this thing goes to [ __ ] how do you get out gotta cut [ __ ] gotta eat your ego you got to watch your Revenue go down so you can refocus reconsolidate bring the troops in I'm saying this because someone here needs to do this and I wish I had [ __ ] heard this from somebody else I would avoid a lot of pain so how do you become that person who can say no to the woman in the red dress you do the activities someone with those character traits would do despite not
(27:51) feeling good about it so I'll tell you a story that'll drive us home so Leila and I were on this walk not that long ago and I said you know I was like I'm so impatient I'm so impatient I need to be more patient right and she was like I don't think you're impatient I was like yeah I am I [ __ ] hate this let's I want this to be faster I want everything to be bigger faster stronger she's like yeah but you're not changing your behavior like you feel that way but you haven't done anything that's not aligned with the long-term strategic Vision I was
(28:22) like yeah but I feel [ __ ] terrible I want to be like Zen about it he's like yeah that's not how it works she's like patience is about the behaviors we do not how we feel about behaviors so who here has heard the quote courage is not the absence of fear but it's action despite fear right patience is not not feeling impatient and feeling terrible about waiting about not jumping on these opportunities it's about not jumping on the opportunities despite feeling like [ __ ] about it and wanting to right loyalty is not necessarily about the fact that your
(28:52) eye doesn't get caught every once in a while right or maybe even feel a desire that you wish you didn't feel it's about what you act on it because who here would rather have somebody okay I think you already know where I'm going with this right in terms of loyalty how would you rather right you'd rather the person not act on the behave on the thought that is how you gain the trait and then over time this is my belief if you do that enough times those feelings go away through exposure therapy like you get exposed to this
(29:20) condition over and over again and eventually you know that you don't die because that's what it feels like and so whether it's a loyalty issue an Integrity issue a courage issue a focus issue which is the point of this message today to become that person you just start acting like the person who has those beliefs and you behave in that way and then it will sink in want me to their address so new distractions kill leverage and keep you poor Focus multiplies it I said three things number one how making money really works it all comes down to leverage number two why making
(29:56) new stuff is making you poor which means you have to focus and number three is why better is Leverage this is the make money part here's a simple approach to growth that we use with our portfolio companies better is better than new better is leverage because remember Leverage is how we get more from what we put in if you do it better you get more for what you put in that is Leverage examples if you have call scripts if you make content if you have websites that you're building if you have follow-up sequences if you have offers if you do the current thing you get what
(30:35) you currently have if you make it better you will get more from the activities you can create leverage in your business by being better and better comes from boring most of us solved an emotional need by quitting whatever we were doing to start to become an entrepreneur and then we had a positive reinforcement from that from that behavior and so then we learned that as a way of life but the problem is that the thing that forced you or gave you that emotional that decrease your action threshold thus that you would jump into the next thing is the very thing that'll make you jump
(31:10) out of the opportunity that could become your billion dollar thing does that make sense you felt uncomfortable on your job you quit your job you got rewarded and so you think oh when I quit things I'll get rewarded but that's the wrong lesson it only works once and then you have to unlearn it and with each level of Entrepreneurship there are lessons like that that you have to unlearn the thing that got you there better comes from boring it is not exciting to run your 38th split test on a landing page it does
(31:37) make you more money it comes from doing all the [ __ ] that you know you should be doing but aren't and so right now this is an activity so this is an active part imagine a list of all the stuff you know you should be doing but aren't doing right now within your existing business like right now like top of your head you know there's some [ __ ] that you should be doing in your business I'm going to give you 15 seconds the reason that stuff is so important is because you already know what you need to do and we come here get raw Rod
(32:16) Etc but the [ __ ] is on your desk at home that is the work that must be done it needs doing and most of us know what to do and we don't want to confront it because we want to do something more stimulating and exciting that makes us feel alive and your business doesn't give a [ __ ] better is boring and better gets you more for what you put in better as leverage now imagine who here has a few businesses be really [ __ ] hard to make that list wouldn't it there's too much [ __ ] it's too much too much stuff to make the business
(32:51) which means becomes impossible which means that's why you have to pick one because there is so much stuff that has to be done to do one business right just do it right if you do it right you grow by default there's a promise who here is like I know I should be doing more email follow-up I know I should be calling my leads within five minutes who here thinks that right now okay let me ask a different question and many of you did raise your hand who here calls other leads within five minutes okay like two hands you will triple your sales triple
(33:29) triple who wants to Triple the [ __ ] business triple but that sounds boring sure is gotta Implement CRM got to get round robin set up Lee's got to come in you got to figure out how call prioritization Works between the team that's boring makes you a shitload of money that's how it works who's going to win two different businesses the guys who got the [ __ ] dialed better gets you more for what you put in and when you do get home order it from the amount you have to put in to get the thing done that will
(34:05) result in the most output and start taking them off and you continue to ignore the new things that sound really exciting and you become the person who's able to do that by pretending to be the person who's able to do that because you already know what to do so this is a mental model I really like a lot who here has ever had a coach or a mentor has anyone ever coached or mentored other people does anyone feel like they're a better Mentor than they are a person who does [ __ ] I do all the time and so the thing is is I ask myself this
(34:39) question it's actually been one of the like most profound most helpful questions I've had which is if I were coaching me and the beautiful thing about this is that when you coach you you have no other agenda you're just trying to help you and you also have more information than anyone else has you've been on every conversation you've been you've read every email you've seen every report so if you were coaching you right now what would you tell you to do and what's crazy about this is that half the [ __ ] time is not what I'm doing
(35:08) coach me much smarter than Mimi right Mumu okay um take your own advice if you do that I promise you'll make more money be like ah but I'm a special snowflake you're just convincing yourself that you're smarter than you are giving yourself reasons that reality does not apply to you it does and this is just a boss level you might need to keep going against the snowflake until eventually you figure out that you just got to melt it by being there and hanging in and so in my entrepreneurial career there's two periods very clear definitions of periods of time in my
(35:43) life the first period was when I was distracted this is when I did not make money I had six gyms I had a launch business return we do gym turnarounds in person that's where I actually physically was not at my gyms I had a dentist a dental agency I had a chiropractor agency I think I had something else more lots of fingers right and I was 26 ish and I would love to tell people oh I own nine companies right I'm poor but um but it felt really good struck my ego not my bank account so it was only one Layla the angel of my life it was like
(36:29) Hey you know this one makes us the most money and you spend the least amount of time on it that Jim launch thing actually works uh but I have to like I would have to like sell all those gyms I'd have to end Partnerships I'd have to let go of people in the agency and she was like yeah or you could just you know keep doing what you're doing just clearly working Point taking you know um and so over the next 90 days I sold five gyms shut one down shut down both agencies um and got rid of everything and 12 months later from that moment we
(37:05) were doing one and a half million a month from zero and so and 12 months after that we had four and a half million a month one thing and so this was the second period just focus it's so much easier to stack the deck in your favor if you just do one thing because when you focus on one thing you make it unreasonable to fail if you do one thing for an extended period of time it becomes unreasonable to suck if you do it more than anyone else has done it you'll be better than that just is what it is people watch all the time they're like hey how did you get so good at sales I took four thousand
(37:35) [ __ ] sales calls that's how I did it so I did it I didn't even I'd even go through a sales training at four thousand [ __ ] conversations that's why I did it and so if you if you wanted to be the best salesman in the world then have more sales conversations than anyone else has if you want to be the best real estate investor then do more deals than anyone else has and the sub like the subsequent before that is send out more mailers than anyone else has have more cold callers than anyone else has send more cold DMS than anyone else has and you'll become the best
(37:59) and if you put that as the output the thing that you're looking at it becomes unreasonable that you would be not the best right like you're at least going to be top 10. and if who here would be top 10 in real estate in the US would you be okay with that right it wouldn't be bad and the thing is that everyone fails because they want to move fast like this is the number one issue so they don't have a solid foundation they draw the dotted line they think I'm going to try and shortcut it I'm not going to fix my product I'm not going to make it really good because I want to go fast because I want to show to my
(38:27) friends that I'm growing every month I wonder how good I am the thing is it's a short game like how many times it's like it's the restaurant example is so simple so many people start a restaurant slap two pieces of Wonder Bread together put a slice of bologna in there and then Market it like [ __ ] crazy and they're like dude I don't get why my business isn't growing I'm like because everyone who has your food literally tells everyone that it [ __ ] sucks and never come back so there's this invisible hand that works against people which is
(38:56) who knows about the power of Word of Mouth right the Invisible Hand who here runs ads let me ask that question who runs advertisement okay if you run ads and it has become more expensive for you disproportionate to the increase in cpms which is cost for impression or eyeballs in that period of time that you've been in business then it means that you have negative word of mouth so if you're like well I don't get that many referrals oh but you sure do get a whole bunch of people who you get Negative referrals you get Negative sales you have to spend twice as much of a car Customer because every other customer that you would have acquired
(39:27) was told by someone else not to buy from you it's the invisible hand when you shortcut it promote promote promote and then Flatline and then dissolve and then you come up with new [ __ ] and you who here has seen the people on the internet doing this game over and over and over again they don't get the product right they put two pieces of baloney you know sandwiched together with a baloney slice in the middle and they call it a product and then we have ham with one slice in the middle and it's still [ __ ] because they don't want to take the 12 months to actually get the [ __ ] product right
(39:58) but on the long game 10 years from now the guy who takes the first year takes a break even on that year just to get the product right makes everything easy but no one can wait 12 months because they can't see the big picture they keep trying to string three of these little shortcuts together rather than build the foundation better is Leverage better gets you more for what you put in this is what small businesses look like this is what big businesses look like the amount of activity is actually not that different it's just a line it's
(40:29) just all in the same direction it's all it is it's really not like I promise you've been in both it's all it is there's nothing there's no magic it's just a windup same input more output well boring but better looks like it means split testing landing pages not once but weekly not just one time when you come here you put the process in place to do it every [ __ ] week split testing emails not once but weekly making new ads and creative not when you have to but before you need them role playing with the sales team not once but daily
(41:03) role playing with customer success hey I want a refund hey I hated this hey it wasn't fast enough what did they say role play if you have amazing customer success they role played every day they'll get [ __ ] good I promise how exciting is that not at all not at all but you know what it does it makes more money taking 10 more interviews for the same role sucks to talk to 10 more people for no reason but there is a reason because you're trying to find the one person that's going to give you 10 times The Leverage on that time you got back think about this
(41:36) but if you didn't take those interviews you hire someone wait six months and you have to do the whole thing again and you lost the six months that's what Layla was talking about taking more time to make your lead magnet better make your offer better and better all these things are boring but make you more money and so this is my promise is that doing all the un60 [ __ ] that you aren't doing but no you should is the secret to the success my promise if you do nothing new but only what you already know you should be doing that your self coach tells you to you will make more money in
(42:07) the next 12 months than you can imagine you just got to do it right so this is actually a text I got uh yesterday or yeah it was yesterday um this guy had lost everything um and he had set a goal down for himself and he said hey uh last day of 2021 set a business goal that's always quite honestly unrealistic impossible to hit well I'm going to surpass it in Q3 and so the only thing that I told him to do was to commit to the activities I was like just do the same thing every day rain or shine it was Prospect I was a prospect every day he's like and the first few months he actually had a
(42:45) couple good months and then he slowed down he's like how do I say how do I stay committed I was like because you felt successful for [ __ ] getting an outcome it's irrelevant for who you are some of you guys have heard this quote but your work works on you more than you work on it I was like you need to become the person who isn't satisfied with whatever that outcome was but only by the commitment that you made to yourself about the activity that you were going to do and so whether it was up or it was down it divorces the actions from the outcome
(43:11) not to say that the outcome is not the work it is but in terms of Who You Are who you are is is forged in the repetitive Act final point who here knows the difference between a seven out of 10 book and a nine and a half out of ten book about 20 times the work realistically who you knows the difference in sales between seven and a half book and a nine and a half book about a thousand times the sales and so if you do 20 times the work and get a thousand times the effort that's a 50x increase per unit of input
(43:49) it's a lot it's worth it but you do have to do 20 times more work that is Leverage an opportunity is missed by most because the distressed and overalls and looks like work and so I said I was going to cover three things and I have a little thing at the end here it'll take me less than five um you guys go with that all right sweet so I said I was going to cover three things I want to make sure I filled my promise number one is how making money really works leverage everybody feel good with that does that make sense all right number two why making new [ __ ] is making
(44:21) you poor and while you have to focus number three is why better is Leverage awesome and so I want to wrap up my presentation with a quick demonstration of Leverage in the real world getting more out of the same thing okay so we're gonna do an exercise to wrap this up and I think that it will do more than anything I can say with these slides this will probably be what you remember unfortunately with all my picture pretty pictures um so I'm going to take a single action and increase the leverage in real time in front of you is that cool so you'll
(44:52) see a before and after in front of your eyes it's like a real world money magic trick okay so I gave you a lot of examples of things you can improve in a business better cause better content better sales groups better website better follow-up better offers right so what I'm going to do is I'm going to highlight just one of these things all right for you right now and show you how many riches lie unlocked within your business today that you already know about so I'm going to focus on offers because it's an easy one I can do in front of everyone
(45:16) all right so I'm going to show you the leverage of a better offer so I'm going to sell you a book for a hundred thousand dollars just kidding a thousand dollars so the point of Leverage is a better offer sorry the point is leverage of a better offer one action selling one product a book Leverage is how much money it fetches for the same activity does that make sense our equation this makes sense okay here are the directions for this activity the moment you feel that a thousand dollars of value has been created please stand up and stay
(45:46) standing okay does this make sense this is simple directions if you feel a thousand dollars then stand and stay standing all right I'm repeating it 100 000 just kidding typa so Let The Leverage building begin I have 10 books with me today who wants one for a thousand dollars raise your or stand up well thank you stay standing three people already have three thousand dollars is this exciting all right I'd even tell you what it was yet it's a really good book probably giving it away who now wants it I said it was a really good book
(46:25) no more people okay it's a best seller still three people oh four there we go four people haha it's my book right now I got one more two more three more all right four more so we got eight nine ten eleven I've already accounted for my books but just wait there's more so I said who wants one of the ten for a thousand right we got all these cool there's all the reviews people say it's good very good rating please stay standing it's also number one number four and number seven for the last 13 straight months pretty cool right in marketing and sales I think it's pretty dope please stand up
(47:13) this guy read the book and quadrupled his monthly Revenue just from reading the book if you quadruple your Revenue would that be worth it oh yeah six seven eight nine ten eleven twelve a lot more okay this is it wow probably 40 or 50 up okay but wait there's more going to autograph the book there's only one that I have autographed actually that's not true I think there's probably five oops I had to get a really fat marker so you could sit that's actually my my it's embarrassing not yet not yet not yet not yet oh you
(47:56) got to stand you got to keep standing got to keep standing one out of ten I'll put my personal cell phone in the inside thousand bucks I'm not gonna show it to you all right we got about two-thirds okay I'm gonna review for your sales calls rewrite your script with you and uh drill your sales team on how we set everything up does that work for a thousand bucks stand if that's worth it for you with the book please stand I'll have my traffic guy who right now we get about 20 000 leads a day across our portfolio uh he'll do an entire funnel breakdown to see about 11 pages he'll break down everything that you
(48:50) could do differently within the funnel different headline split tests different paragraphs different copy things different images different layouts right now we have between more than 2x but I feel confident saying we can double your traffic all right we're close we're like 90 percent I'll also use my network to recruit the one missing star player that you have in your company so right now we will look at your company and we'll find out what the biggest missing pieces in leverage and put someone in there for you stand up with that that's worth a thousand bucks
(49:21) I'll also spend two hours with you on the offer that you're giving right now so you can get more people to click more people to sign up for the calls more people to show more people to buy and at higher prices all right I think I got like one person still seated I got I see you I see you I see what I got I'll see what I got see what I got I'm also going to feature you on my channel so that two hours will televise it and we'll distribute it across all of our channels so right now that gets about 10 million impressions so in real advertising dollars it's about a hundred thousand dollars in advertising just for
(49:55) in terms of that's what people are willing to pay for three 90 second spots uh and it's a 30 minute spot so it would be significantly higher than that so if that's worth a thousand bucks let me know by standing is how you do that and if you don't make three times what you pay me for this book I'll give you all the money back and keep all the work that we did that work measured over 12 months that's the fine print Fair please stand if that's still worth a thousand bucks I see you and uh there's not 10 books there's only one
(50:32) look around and that's how you increase leverage to sell and offer set for 25 buckets for a hundred thousand dollars so does everyone understand stay standing do you ever understand that you just need to do it better output comes from volume times leverage you must do more and get more from what you do the way you get more from what you do is you first do everything that you know you should be doing better the way you do that is to focus on one thing for a long time without distraction anything can become big with time when you line all actions to a single outcome and you keep working at it your success
(51:07) will look effortless and obvious from the outside but you will know that it came from years of saying no to everything except that which mattered most this is how we grow companies at acquisition.com through Leverage most entrepreneurs like the who the what and how to scale at acquisition.
(51:26) com we recruit the who we give them the what we show them the how and once an entrepreneur has all three the business scales by default Laila already showed you these we've got more free courses at acquisition.com if you guys like this stuff if you want to learn more from us and that's it thank you guys so much I appreciate you [Music]
If I Wanted to Become a Millionaire In 2024, This is What I'd Do [FULL BLUEPRINT] - YouTube

Transcript:
(00:01) ah this is the blueprint to becoming a millionaire and I'm going to walk you through the levels to becoming one level one is the fundamentals of wealth creation and we're going to start with what even is a millionaire it's someone who's net worth excluding their primary residence is an excess of a million do assets minus liabilities for example let's say you own a $1 million house and you owe $500,000 on it if you had nothing else saved up in your bank account which would hope that you did but let's just say you had nothing else saved up in your bank account then your net worth
(00:35) would be 500k in this instance you would not be a Millionaire right now let's call this a $1 million house and then you owed nothing on it your net worth would be a million dollar now there's a difference between having a liquid net worth versus a net worth a liquid net worth is assets that you can trade in and out of so if I had million dollars in cash in my bank account versus owning assets that were worth a million dollars those are different things and you might be wondering how does Alex have any
(01:00) Authority to speak on the subject I'll tell you why I became a millionaire in my early 20s I had my first cash million in my bank account when I was 27 and I cross $100 million in that worth by age 31 so I became a millionaire a 100 times in a row so I can tell you how to do it at least once and I've helped over a hundred other people create Million Dollar Plus net worths uh over my career and those are just the ones that I know about let alone all the people in our community have done a lot better than that and so we go to step two in this
(01:23) little journey of ours which is equity because there's two ways that you can become a millionaire you can earn your way there or you can own your way there and the faster way is to own your way there and that's what I'm going to walk you through so I'm going to walk you through both examples of earning your way there which is how I first thought it was versus owning so if I want to earn my way to a million then I'm going to need to make $2 million over X period of time and then divide that by two because of taxes to get to my $1 million let's
(01:57) say making $200,000 a year and I make $200,000 a year for a decade that's assuming that you saved 100% of your income you'd be able to earn your way to $1 million in liquid net worth on the other hand you can own your way meaning that you own assets either you know which could be businesses or real estate which are probably the two most common assets that people own that are trying to invest when I say invest when you are an entrepreneur you are investing you're just heavily indexed on one stock which is your own let's say that I create a business uh that gets to $250,000 per
(02:27) year in some instances I might be able to sell this company if it was truly automated and had a a team of people that worked without me needing it I could sell this at probably a four times multiple and this is again that would be a very good multiple for a business that is doing that kind of profit because this is actually a small amount of profit for when we're talking business sales but that would get us to a $1 million net worth all right because we own 100% of this business that makes $250,000 a year in profit without us
(02:55) working at all and we could sell that for $1 million and so you can see the difference here it's like okay well one of these takes 10 years this one is just how long does it take me to automate the creation of $250,000 a year and so what's interesting here is that almost the actual income between the two is almost identical but as soon as you achieve it you almost already have the the net worth because here time is working against you because you have taxes and you have your living expenses that are cutting out of this every single year whereas here you get the multiplier without your living expenses with time being an ally for you which
(03:26) takes us to the next step on our journey don't diversify diversification is for weenies diversification to quote Uncle Warren is a hedge against ignorance you only diversify if you don't know what you're doing the more you know the less risky it is I actually am approaching diversification from a focus perspective which is what's the one thing that you're going to invest your most valuable resource because when you're early on you don't have that much money so your most valuable resource isn't your money it's your time and your attention there's two ways we can allocate it
(04:00) V1 we do little allocations like this I'm going to look at crypto I'm going to look at day trading I'm going to look at forx I'm going to look at flipping houses I'm going to look at long-term investing in real estates I'm going to look into Airbnb I'm going to look into starting an ATM business I'm going to look at you get the idea right so let's say this is you and this is your time and attention that you have to pursue any new opportunity so you say I need seven income streams because the average millionaire has seven income streams so I'm going to spread myself thin between
(04:28) seven different opportunities and while I do that I'm going to be multitasking trying to fill different cups at the same time with different colors and I'm somehow going to wait until one of these things takes off right I have to see which one of these will work but the reality is it's not which of these ones will work any of them could work if you put the work in but you have to reach a threshold once you get to the top the extra cash starts spilling over and you actually have a profitable opportunity
(04:52) which one of these cups is closer to spilling over you going in on one thing or you spreading yourself between seven and the reason that this myth continues to proliferate is because it's absolutely true that people who are the wealthiest have multiple income streams but what's not true is about how they got there the wealthiest people in the world go all in on one income stream and they keep adding it up over and over and over again until it overflows and then once it overflows because they're making so much money from their one opportunity they then start diversifying back
(05:23) between the other different ways but they made their wealth focusing on one thing and then they maintain their wealth by Distributing it you don't make money by by splitting your attention up you make it by focusing on the one thing that matters most B2 you say what do I really like well I do have experience doing this one thing and so I'm going to ignore all of these other opportunities and just go all in on one thing the reason I'm such a big advocate of focusing your attention on one thing is that this is where you get disproportionate returns because I think it's very arrogant to think that your
(05:52) 10% of your attention where you're not even that good at business to begin with spread between 10 things is somehow going to compete against somebody who's putting all of their effort on one thing but here's the fallacy that most people who are starting out don't get they think I'm going to try all of them and see which one works out or rather I'm going to try to start multiple things and see which one takes off but the reality is that all of them could take off or none of them could take off but it's solely based on which one you work on so it's not which one will work it's which one will you work on you want to
(06:22) go as fast as possible through the I have no idea what I'm doing phas so you can get to the I do know what I'm doing faas and I understand the risks that are associated with this and that's why I don't want to diversify because I actually get outsize returns here there's five stages that you go through as an entrepreneur when you're considering a new opportunity phase one is called uninformed optimism this is where you are uninformed but you're like man this opportunity sounds so great look at all these people making all this money and so then you dive in
(06:52) and then you get to something called informed pessimism you're like oh wow this isn't as easy as I thought there's all these other things that they didn't talk about in this ad or in this highlight reel that they show me on this YouTube short about this person that made $1,000 a day going from nothing from her home right so then what happens next is you keep working on it and then you get into the valley of Despair sad face sad face this is where most people quit and this is what most people do now dot dot dot dot dot dot dot dot dot they find another one of
(07:26) these things to get into and they go all the way over back here because the think oh no this one has doooo on this side of the fence so I'm going to go to the other side of the fence where the grass is green but what they don't realize is when they get into that side it's completely made of manure and that's why the grass is so green right there's poo on both sides you just didn't know about it until you got there all right and so what happens is people keep repeating the cycle over and over and over again
(07:50) and they never make progress and so here's the thing is that when you do find something that you're like you know what I kind of like this okay this is harder than I originally thought I need to keep learning wow this is actually really hard there's a lot more pieces to this than I understood at the beginning I guess this is why everyone isn't rich and then something magic happens you then start to have informed optimism you now start to realize you've wrapped your arms around whatever the opportunity is or whatever thing you're pursuing and you're like okay I haven't gotten there yet but I understand the math I
(08:24) understand the process of getting where I am to where I'm trying to go and ultimately this is what I'm trying to do with this blueprint for you is it if I can help you tackle as much of this or at least compress the time that it takes you get here that's a big victory for me and then you finally get to the Final Phase which is achievement which is you actually accomplish externally what you set out to and most newbies fall out between here and here and then start this process over again so most people
(08:46) only relive this over and over and over again without ever making it to here which then naturally leads you to here because then you have no desire to diversify because you now get it and what do you do when your hair you reset the you reset the Target and you say this is where I want to go next and because you've been through this process once you understand that you know what me going after this 10 times bigger girl sounds amazing I'm going to find out there's some stuff that sucks there's going to be a period where it's going to really suck and it's going to feel hopeless cuz I don't see how how to get through it I'm going to keep chugging and then understand how to get there and
(09:22) then I'm going to get there I'm going to repeat the process so now we go to the last part of level one of becoming a millionaire the long game if I told you to build the tallest tower you possibly could in 10 seconds here's what you might do boom 5 4 3 2 one time right now imagine I told you to build the tallest building you possibly could in 10 days you would probably say you know what I can probably get some more boxes how flimsy is is this right like how stable is this do you think this is going to last a
(10:02) long time probably not so I might build it piece by piece from the ground up with more stable bricks from day one and I would keep doing it this way right and I'd keep adding and keep adding and keep adding and then when 10 days came I might be five stories high and so the reason this is such an important frame shift for people is that the fact that they're in a rush causes them to build the thing they want to build differently the fastest way to get to this tall is to build it the exact way I did earlier stack it end to end up to this point but if I then said I need you to build
(10:38) something that's 10 stories tall you would never get there and what happens is people get stuck right they get stuck at this level and they can't add another one on top and they stay here and they're like why can't I get my million doll business to $10 million and it's because you built it wrong to begin with and so as much as this sounds painful sometimes the fastest way to to get to 10 million is to start back at zero and build it right to begin with I talk so much about long game about making sure that you're building it the right way because this
(11:08) thing is never going to last and so the hardest thing about building something right is that in the beginning you need to have something to sell need your amazing valuable thing and then that's a megaphone it's terrible but then you need to advertise it to let people know about stuff and then you start making sales but the problem is that people get to this point and then think oh I need to do more marketing and sales right because that's what made me money but the problem is the more you market and sale the more people actually find out that this is not a gift and this is actually a big
(11:42) pile of and so what happens is now you've got people who buy this thing and tell their friends this thing stinks and then over time it becomes more and more expensive for you to advertise because your reputation stinks and so the right way to build it is to understand that you you have to build the thing first and then you got to let people know about it but then you don't crank on this you keep fixing this thing until this guy becomes a happy camper and tells his friends and until that happens you keep making this thing better and this is the same thing as if I did this and just kept gassing it
(12:19) that's me vertically building the tower and then reaching a Max that I can't go past anymore versus building it so that I get people to say wow this thing's amazing and so then they also tell people for me so that when I get to that point I actually built it with a huge base of foundation and I can keep stacking on top of it and that's the difference in terms of mindset and perspective of how you actually build something that's going to last and then along the way with your team and the people that you hire rather than saying hey I just need a body in the seat I just need a person to do this thing you're like who here has talent and I
(12:49) might interview 20 people for one role rather than three so I get the right person if you feel stuck all the time and you can't make progress you usually need to go back to the beginning and realize that you built a vertical business that had no Foundation to begin with and now we have our foundation built for level one of wealth creation level two is all about the actual tactics of getting to making your first million and it starts with finding a hungry crowd let me explain what I mean by find a hungry crowd this guy started a business selling hot dogs and he was
(13:19) given One Wish from a genie of what competitive Advantage he would be able to have the first thought he had was like maybe I'll make my hot dogs cheaper the genie shook his head and was like no he's like hm what if I made my hot dogss taste better and then Genie said no don't waste your wish on that maybe I'll just make mine the fastest cooking so I can serve the hot dogs faster the genie said that's not what you want to waste your wish on the genie looked at him holding the hot dogs in buns in hand and said it's not about the hot dogs if you want to build an amazing business you
(13:47) want to put your hot dog stand on the best corner in front of a starving crowd because if your hot dog stand is on the corner it doesn't matter how cheap they are how good they taste how fast they cook the moment that hungry crowd walks out and sees your hot dog stand you're going to sell it every time so right off the bat I want to talk about two key Concepts when it comes to finding a hungry crowd one is that we have to understand that the market is always going to be the strongest variable in how much money you make right if you're selling toilet paper during coid you're going to sell out right because it
(14:15) didn't matter how good your toilet paper was there was a starving crowd and so Supply demand which is one of the reasons that we have it as our logo it is the strongest force in all of economics and business it is the core thing that everything else is built on and so you have to understand that the market is number one if I was trying to sell services to newspaper companies well newspaper companies are decreasing by 25% per year compounding negatively in the wrong direction the next lever on this is the offer that you give people right if you have a superior offer then
(14:43) if you're in a normal Market that'll be the next lever that you have if I say hey start for free and I only get paid if you get some sort of result and it's a truly free lowrisk amazing value and you get results tomorrow offer then you're going to sell 10 times 100 times more than than someone who just has like a you pay me and maybe you get results and maybe you don't type of service or product the final thing is your ability to persuade ideally go after a really big Market with an amazing offer and be
(15:11) a hell of a Persuader but the thing is is you can be terrible at persuading and have a terrible offer and say you can only buy my toilet paper in 80 roll chunks or I'm not going to sell it to you and still sell out during Co but if it's not Co then it's how can I make the toilet paper offer that I have significantly more compelling and if all the toilet paper offers look the same then it just comes down to how well I can persuade people to buy mine that's concept one when it comes to finding a 100 Crow concept two is the four things that I look for when I'm actually trying
(15:41) to find that market number one is I want people who are in pain you want to make sure that the people that you were selling to are in desperate need they don't want but must have the thing that you were selling the second is that they must have the ability to buy so purchasing power so a friend of mine had a business where he helped people who are unemployed fix their resumés so that they could get a job now you might be like oh wow tons of pain absolutely but the problem was he kept trying to grow this business and he couldn't grow it because they were all broke cuz they didn't have a job the third factor that
(16:15) I look for is easy to Target because at the end of the day even if you have somebody using lots of pain who can buy your thing if you can never find them it doesn't matter because they're never going to buy your things they'll never know you exist and so if I have the choice between two different marketplaces and one of them is like nurses incredibly easy to find or something that is way harder to find like psychedelic Aztecs in you know Croatia way harder to Target and you know what they might have a huge pain and lots of purchasing power to buy my thing but if I can't find them it's irrelevant the fourth point you want to
(16:45) have is that you have a growing market now I gave the example earlier about the newspapers right so believe it or not a good friend of mine actually had a business that sell a REV share model to newspaper so he was an amazingly persuasive guy he had an amazing offer off which is zero risk he just said like let me get a percentage of the revenue that I bring to you all right so these two things were completely maxed out but he couldn't figure out why his company wasn't growing every year he was beating his competitors and gaining more
(17:10) customers than they were but still slipping away in terms of his ability to grow and it was because the entire Marketplace as a whole was shrinking and so you want to make sure that you have all four of these things you can't just have three of them or two of them or one of them you need to have all four and so when you're thinking about what thing you want to sell start with who you want to sell it to so you have your hungry crowd now what do you do one Avatar one product one channel this is the simplest formula to getting $2 million plus all
(17:39) you have to do is find one person that you want to help it's just making sure that you're very clear on the one very specific person that you are going to help that is the Avatar the next thing is you want to give them one product and the reason I say it's one product is that a lot of people over complicate their businesses too early they're like man if I want to double my business I should sell them three things right and then I'll get them to buy more stuff but the thing is is that if you're under a
(18:02) million dollars you're just adding a ton of complexity when you don't even have that many customers and so most times you'd be better served sticking with the one thing that you're selling and saying how can I sell three times as many of the exact same person and that becomes the problem that you solve but most people get confronted with these issues and then go for the easy route and again this is like that building where you can add something on top really quickly but it doesn't create the skyscraper that you want instead you want think how can
(18:29) I do more the third variable here is channel now it doesn't matter what channel you're currently acquire customers on you can hit a Million Dollar Plus on literally any channel that you advertise on without going onto new channels so if you do Outreach is then you reach out to people 10 to one to get customers whether that's cold calls cold emails DMS you can expand and continue to get more customers with that one channel if you post content you can keep posting content on whatever Channel you're on and just do it better post
(18:58) more cont content post better content and by doing so you increase the amount of customers still with only one money-making product or let's say you're running ads obviously if you're running ads you can just spend more money on the ads provided you're doing it profitably and if you can't expand past a million dollars a year profitably with paid ads you have a business problem or you have a pricing problem you don't actually need to add another Channel because then it again complicates your business
(19:22) because you're like okay well I'm currently doing you know 500,000 a year on YouTube you know what I'm going to do you might think oh I'm I'm going to start doing cold emails right as my next way of getting customers well that majorly complicates your business when you're this early on now you might be thinking wait shouldn't I have diversity of of how you acquire customers I thought you said that was a good idea it is but you're so small it doesn't matter yet because you're not looking at a potential acquirer who's going to try and look to decrease risk for you you just need to get better at doing the one
(19:51) thing that you do well cuz you're really probably not that good yet and as terrible as that may sound it's probably real all right and so the fastest way to get to the million is to build it right from the get-go and not over complicate your business which means you pick one Avatar one product and one channel that you focus on until you get there so now we go back to our tactics of building our first million dollars the next thing at level two is our offer now I wrote an entire book on this thing $100 million offers it answers the question what should I sell and it's because that's
(20:22) the most common question that I get asked every single day for people who trying to start a business which makes sense what am I supposed to sell so I call this the value equation now fundamentally you've probably heard all over the Internet you need to provide value you got to give value right but the question is what is value and after doing a lot of studying of figuring this out between our portfolio companies it actually comes down to four variables variable number one is the dream outcome what the dream outcome is for whoever the prospect that you pick is the way
(20:45) that you can compare two different dream outcomes is how much more valuable they think one outcome is versus another if I were to talk to a 30-year-old man and say hey I can help you lose weight or I can make you a millionaire most guys would value you being a millionaire more than let's say being handsome there are different outcomes that people will ascribe different values to and that's just a very extreme example well let's use the weight loss example and let's switch it to women if I have one ebook that helps someone lose weight and then I've got a one-onone personal training program that have someone lose weight
(21:16) it's the same dream outcome so then what then determines which one is more valuable because the ebook might be 50 bucks and be overpriced and the personal training might be $5,000 and be underpriced how can you make that discrepancy because there's more value let me explain the next one is perceived likelihood of achievement meaning when I buy How likely do I think I will get what I want through buying if I buy a $50 ebook on good meals that I can cook that are healthy maybe I'll get some food that I might like in here and I can feel a little better about myself but
(21:47) they don't realistically think that they're going to all of a sudden transform their entire body from a $50 ebook now if you sign up for personal training for a year you probably have a way bigger perceived likelihood of achievement and so you value it higher now both of these elements the dream outcome and the perceived likelihood of achievement are the things that you want to increase in your communication with a prospect you're saying it's really really likely that you're going to get this thing that you really really want the next two variables of the equation are the painful side of the equation
(22:15) which is what does someone have to give up in order to get it so the first thing that we have is time and there's two elements of time there's micro and macro micro is how long is this going to take every day there's a certain amount of time that's going to take on the micro for them to experience the result right so if I'm talking about the lady who's doing personal training she might have to go to the gym three times a week that's going to take time she might have to prepare food that's going to take time that's on the micro level on the
(22:39) macro level how long is she going to have to do these micro commitments in order to get the macro result that she wants she might have to lose 50 lbs and it might take her 18 months so macro the goal is I want this to be as little as possible micro time and I want this to be as short as possible on the macro so that when I say hey you're going to get the dream body you want you absolutely know that you're going to get it and it's it's going to happen really really fast so the next thing is effort and
(23:03) sacrifice effort is what you have to start doing that you weren't doing that you don't want to do as a result of the purchase sacrifice are things that you have to stop doing that you wish you could do but can't do anymore as a result of the purchase and so for our lovely young lady she's going to have to sacrifice margarit a Mondays and taco Tuesdays she's no longer going to be able to get to do that even though she wants to do that she's G to have to sacrifice sleeping in on the weekends and she's going to have to start waking up early and working out and eating food that she doesn't like and so effort and
(23:36) sacrifice tend to be dual sides of the same coin whatever you have to start doing you typically have to stop doing something else the top side we try and increase the bottom side we try and decrease we want to get it to zero because if you think about this in a hypothetical extreme the perfect offer that would have the absolute most value would be the biggest most compelling dream you can possibly imagine that you're absolutely guaranteed to get instantly with no effort so if I said you can click a button on my website and then look down at your abs and then have a six-pack
(24:08) that would be the hypothetical extreme value now people can get that through personal training changing their diet and waiting 12 months but because of this the value is significantly decreased because there are costs associated understanding all four of these variables is how you craft offers that get people to say yes and give you money because often times the most expensive part of the offer that you have isn't the money it's the other things that they have to start doing as a result of the purchase those are
(24:36) called hidden costs if I have a marketing agency okay and I do content for people all right and when I start doing content I say okay it's going to take us 60 days to ramp up we're going to start having two calls a week for an hour you're going to have to fly out to my studio and we're going to record and it's going to take 60 days before you're going to start seeing any kind of traction imagine that offer comp compared to somebody who says you don't need to do anything I can just draw stuff on my own immediately start posting and your phone's going to ring
(25:05) today we shoot which one's more valuable it's still the same core services but how we wrap them make them probably 10 times more valuable than they were before and that's why I understand these variables and making the right offer is so compelling on your road to your first million and the reason this was my first book Is that offers is about strategy offers is one of the largest levers that you can pull with any business because it actually affects all departments when you change the offer it changes how you Market when you change the offer it
(25:33) changes the sales script the sales process when you change the offer it changes what you deliver it literally affects everything and so for us we always try and nail this with our portfolio companies at acquisition. comom to be clear we don't sell coaching we invest in businesses and buy them and for context our average portfolio company over the first 12 months 1.
(25:52) 8x is revenue and 3.01 X's profit and over their first 24 months they 2.8 8X revenue and 4.7x profit meaning that they disproportionately drop the increase in Revenue to their bottom line because we make sure that the thing that we are selling is as valuable as humanly possible so the next on our journey of wealth and riches and glory and status and all things amazing is marketing and sales and if you think about this from a sequence perspective you have to make the thing and then you have to promote the thing now the making the thing is $100 million offers which should I sell the next question is who should I sell
(26:30) it to AKA getting leads and you get leads through advertising which is the concept of my second book $100 million leads and then you get them to buy but the thing that people mess up is that they then think okay I'm going to do more of that but what you actually need to do next is you go back to here and you fix the product and keep making it better and then you promote it more and then you come back and fix the product and make it better and it becomes this virtuous cycle so if we need to understand how to Market and sell then
(26:58) it means that you have to have one advertising method there are eight ways you can advertise there's four that you can do and then there's four that other people can do for you you can do warm Outreach which is reaching out one to one to your friends you can post content one to many but to people who know you you can run paid ads which is doing one to many to strangers or you can do one to one to strangers which is cold Outreach and if you're like man no one's buying my thing I can guarantee you that
(27:22) you're not doing enough of these core four period that's it because these are the only four things that you can do to advertise the next next thing is that you can get referrals from customers which are lead Getters next you can have employees who help do the core 4 for you you can have agencies who run the core for for you make content for you do Outreach for you all of those things you can hire another business to help you with and then finally you've got Affiliates which some people call influencers some people call endorsements but it's somebody who already has an audience already has a business and that you compensate in some
(27:52) way to do the advertising for you the core for to let other people know about your stuff these are the eight ways that you can advertise anything to anyone and the nice thing is when you're starting out for your first million just pick one once you pick the advertising method that you want and let's say you're using lead Getters you have to learn one of the core four to then get lead Getters and that's okay that's fine that's part of business these will always give you more leverage than the first four and that's okay but you have to start with
(28:16) these first so let's assume that you're just going to stick to the core four in the beginning because you're like I don't want to involve other parties which I recommend especially if you're starting out and you're like you know what I'm going to post content that's what you're going to do that's your your method all right now you're going to have all these people who like your posts comment on your posts DM you personally when you make content that they find compelling or interesting and say hey I love your help on whatever this thing is then you transition into
(28:40) sales now it's so important for Founders who are starting a company to be integrally involved in both of these processes the reason you want the founder to be integrally involved in the beginning is one it's cheaper and especially when you have less cash that makes sense two these are skills that you're going to that are going to be required for you to succeed over the long so you're going to want to understand them at a tactical level because when you bring someone else in in the future these lead Getters whether
(29:03) it's employees agencies Affiliates or whatever you can teach them the right way to do it and when they say hey that's not possible you be like no it is let me show you how and then you have a litus test of who's legit and who's not who's going to help you on your journey whether you're hiring them or you're incentivizing them it works the same when it comes to the sales side we want to get into a choreograph process knowing what step one through letter Z of the process looks like to get someone from I think this might be interesting
(29:31) to giving you money but if you don't know what you're doing first you have to throw stuff on the wall and see what sticks and a lot of it's just going to be your gut in the beginning and figure out whoop that didn't work whoop that didn't oh that one actually got a response all right that's step two and you keep trying until you get to step three and then you keep trying until you get to step four until eventually somebody gives you money and then you backtrack and say what happened to this person that do these steps great now I'm going to try and recreate that as many times as I can and then that becomes
(29:55) your process and that process repeats at each micro level too because that might be three or four steps to get to the conversation where someone might give you money and then what do you do in that conversation well when I ask this question first and this question second and this question third it's more likely that they ultimately buy and so if you don't follow a script in the beginning you better make one because if you're going to eventually get out of sales which you should if you want to scale then you're going to be able to teach somebody else how to sell too and one of
(30:19) the biggest issues early on is that the founder is the most convicted about the product and you should be it's your company but people who come after you are never going to be as charismatic or as convicted in the thing that you have as you are which means you need to follow a process to maximize the likely that the prospects that they speak with ultimately purchase the next level in our blueprint or journey to wealth the mountain of Mordor and by Mordor I mean more money is paying yourself how much should you pay yourself when should you
(30:46) pay yourself of all the topics we're going to talk about today this is probably the most subjective and the reason for that is because it underlines one key concept that is 100% personal which is risk tolerance which is how much risk are are you willing to take individually one of the regrets that I have earlier on as I continued to double down on my gym chain was that I took all the profit from each gym and I kept putting it into the next gym and I basically took nothing out for the entire time now that's super risky I was
(31:10) living on nothing living cheap I was eating cheap I had a cash car that I owned outright and I just put everything I had spend every hour of my day growing my business eventually though I ended up losing all the money from selling all my gyms and was left with nothing and if I had taken out some cash during that period of time I would have had to benefits benefit number one is that when you really try and take out cash flow from the business you'd be amazed at how much cash flow just magically appears
(31:36) and so I like having bank account PRS be a good personal goal for every entrepreneur even if the increment that increasing is small it does two things one it forces you to take cash out of the business so it forces cash flow the second is that it forces you to decrease your spending personally and I have a strong belief that as you're coming up learning the discipline to spend less if you increase the cash for that you take out of the business and you spend less over time then your bank account has nowhere to go but up and I can promise
(32:08) you that when you have a very full bank account business decisions become less stressful and when you make less stressed decisions you make better decisions I do believe in taking some money out of the business along the way because let's be real you're going to live a long life and then you're going to die and if you double down every single minute until the day that you died you'd build the most Enterprise Value you live a really shitty life so at some point you have to balance the investment versus consumption of life
(32:33) itself or the fruit of your labor that is why I'm a Believer in at least allocating a certain percentage of the cash flow from the business to you personally a healthy way of thinking about this that we have for some of our uh heavy Capital intensive businesses meaning like brick and mortar chains which is one of the biggest parts of our portfolio this is one back of napkin way that you can use 33% goes to you 30% goes to growth which is new locations and then this is rainy day this is Cash reserves for the business
(32:59) cash reserves for you and this is for new location another way of doing it is something called a watermark we know that we need to grow two locations and this is a proxy it doesn't have to be two locations you could be hiring two people hiring two reps it doesn't matter two more developers if you're a software company it works the same two more per month cost $ X we have y profit so all we do is we say whatever the profit is at the end of the month we subtract this and then we have a watermark above which we always leave in the account and then
(33:27) everything else we distribute this cash flow that's a different way of doing it this is a little bit more aggressive if you want to maintain a certain growth rate this one is a little bit more flexible it really depends on you and your tolerance for risk and that's one one thing that I'd say I pride myself on in terms of our ability to help portfolio companies and newer Founders who are creating their first kind of generational wealth is these are hard conversations to have and a really important conversation to have and you want somebody who isn't a
(33:50) financial adviser who's trying to get you to take as much cash out so that they can invest and get their 1% fee you want somebody's on the same side of the tables You' be like I get where you're at I can see where your wealth is and also sees over the next 24 36 60 months what it looks like for us to just have that one big bloop so you never have to work again we're now approaching the second level the Pinnacle of our second level which is setting goals and I think this is a really disinterested topic most people think like oh I need smart goals or specific go B I'll show you how
(34:18) I do that all right so rather than focusing on outcomes we focus on activities so the goal shouldn't be what happens but the goal should be what we do I I had a buddy of mine they started doing 10 grand a month 20 grand a month 30 grand a month and then he would fall off and I was like why do you keep falling off he's said well I make the money and I hit my goal so then I like ease off the gas p and I said it's because you're defining your goals the wrong way I see you as not hitting your goal every time you're not doing the activities and so I said make the activities the goal and then you'll hit
(34:47) it every time and more and so then he flipped how he saw his own success into simply at the end of the day did he do all the things that he said he was going to do at the beginning of the day and then you can actually control your inputs because inputs are what Drive outputs don't make the goal outputs say what am I going to do that would be unreasonable that I don't hit these outputs so for example my inputs might be and this is one of my favorite ways we're thinking about like advertising is something that I call the rule of
(35:18) 100 so the rule of 100 simply states that if you do 100 primary actions over 100 days you'll usually get the first result that you ultimately want now you hook people by saying you're going to get the first result you want but the key point is that you're doing 100 actions and one of my little monitors that I would share with you is count in hundreds all right so when a lot of people are like man I did the thing how many hundreds did you do if I was doing more reach outs I'd say cool reach out to 100 friends a day if I'm doing cold
(35:44) reach outs i' say cool reach out to 100 people a day if I'm making content cool make 100 minutes of content every day if I'm running ads i' say run $100 a day and each of those are activities that we can say these things will Drive these outputs they make that the goal and so at the end of the day you can say yes I did it or no I didn't do it not did I make a sale because no matter what even if you didn't make a sale today you should still do your 100 inputs so that you can make two sales tomorrow so the
(36:12) second con I'm going to talk to you about when it comes to goals is how we actually set goals for portfolio companies and it's not the way that you think but it is something that you're going to recognize because we actually use the scientific method and here's how it works four simple boxes one is what problem are we try to solve a lot of times we spend the most time on this part of this because a lot of times people are like oh I think we need to redo our logo why what is that going to accomplish what constraint are we
(36:38) alleviating right because for us we back our goals into the constraints of the business because let's say that conversion rate on our homepage is not a problem well then why do we need to redesign the logo oh we don't one of my favorite ways to solve problems is decide they not a problem to begin with so this is column number one which is what problem we're solving the second is what's our hypothesis which is an if the end statement X then y so what that means is I say my hypothesis is if our website is low conversion that's the
(37:08) problem that we're solving my hypothesis is that if we redesign the website we will then get increased conversions and then all we have to do is say how do we measure X and Y how do I measure that we redesign it I could say yes or no I did it or I could say that we hold a split test every Monday that we run over the quarter that would be the X that's something I can say yes or no we did and then why my conversion rate let's say we're at 10% and then I would say is it greater than 10% yes or no and then finally the last
(37:44) thing is did we do it and then did it work we figure out the problem we're solving we figure out what our hypothesis is to solve it we determine how we're going to measure whether or not we did or whether or not it happened and then we say did did we do the thing and then did it happen because we could not do the thing and then it wouldn't matter and we'd have to repeat it later and solve the problem why are we not doing this thing but if we did do the thing then either it improved it or maybe we redesigned the website and the conversion rate didn't improve so either that might not be the
(38:13) constraint or hypothesis was wrong and so this allows you to iteratively improve the business so we covered the fundamentals of wealth creation and we talked about how to create our first mil and now we've got it and now level three we're going to talk about stay rich and get even richer getting rich once so uh one of my mentors uh was ex Goldman Sachs and Chloe one of his mentors at Golden Sachs told him you should only have to get rich once and I heard that saying it's really stuck with me is if you play the game right you should only have to play
(38:44) it once and then after that you should be paying with house money the whole time and never take bets that you would lose the farm over in other words never B the Empire on a pot of gold if this is the very first pass in $100 Milli offers outside returns often come from betting against conventional wisdom and conventional wisdom is usually right given a 10% chance of 100 times payoff you should take that bet every time for you're still going to be wrong nine times out of 10 we all know that if you swing for the fences you're going to strike out a lot but you're also going
(39:16) to hit some home runs the difference between baseball and business however is that baseball has a truncated outcome distribution when you swing no matter how well you connect with the ball the most RS you can get is four in business every once in a while when you step off to the plate you can score 1,000 runs this longtail distribution of returns is why it's important to be bold Big Winners pay for so many experiments that's from Jeff BOS so if you do hit it out of the park you shouldn't want to have to bet everything on it again to
(39:48) keep staying Rich when you get that one winning bet or that one winning ball that comes and you knock it out of the park you shouldn't you should be able to win for good and so that's why one of my favorite saying when it comes to wealth building is that fortunes are created through taking huge risk with small amounts of money but for fortunes are preserved by taking small risks with lots of money so we talked about why you should only have to car which once and if you are going to swing for the fences you still need to be very sure that once you hit it you never bend it all on
(40:18) black again which then leads us actually to our next one people sobody to explain a concept called the quad marketing calendar all right so you think about this as internal and external to your business now you got prospects on this side we got customers candidates we got employees and so you actually need to be Marketing in all four directions at all times most people spend all their time advertising here they say okay I'm going to spend all my resources advertising to get prospects and then they convert those prospects over this money line and then turn those prospects into customers
(40:55) but the problem is if you own only advertis in this direction who's going to deliver the thing to these customers well you need employees which means that you also need to be advertising to get candidates to turn into employees and so this is ultimately the dual-sided nature of advertising because as you grow the left side you need to also grow the right side if you want to continue to get these customers to buy again and again and again then we also need to advertise in this direction to the customers to get them to buy again and again so we advertise your prospects any customers we advertise to get customers
(41:34) to become repeat customers we advertise the candidates to turn them into employees and we advertise the employees to get them more engaged and to keep them engaged and and keep educating them so they can Ascend up and provide even more value to our customers UL the Enterprise Value company so if you ever feel like you're a genius with 1 th000 hands it usually you're really good at advertising and turning prospects into customers right but you're really bad and turning candid into employees and then training employees to get to become even better and so the more you advertise here the more you feel like
(42:03) you have to do because you have no one else helping you out so let's say we've got our genius scenario we've got an Enterprise scenario so if you're the genius with 1 th000 hands right and you're making $5 million Top Line and $2 million of income every year you make $2 million which adds a million after taxes to your net worth this is a while like before right but here's the difference between the example I'm explain now what I was talking about before in this instance you add the million dollars to your business but you also have a probably
(42:35) $10 million asset as a business if this thing truly rubs value EV is short for Enterprise Value so there is no Enterprise Value here because it's just a genius with 1,000 hands you're just doing with a th000 helpers here you own something that provides value to a group of customers that you can sell to somebody else because if if you require no work in order to provide the value it means it require someone else to do no work to provide the value which means it becomes a more valuable asset and so if I took a business for genius with a
(43:04) th000 hands making $2 million a year and I didn't increase the revenue and I didn't even increase the profit but I simply remove the genius and make the structure of the business genius the people who work inside of it and the processes the systems that they follow genius then I add $1 million the net worth of the person who owns it and so one of the fastest ways to create wealth is make the thing that you have reliable is to make it risk-free and make sure that it will last and so even if it took you two years to do that for you to get
(43:34) $10 million of Enterprise Value or or net worth gain you'd have to make $20 million of income to get to that same 10 million but meanwhile while you're building it you're still also making money in this scenario which is what we basically do for the majority of businesses that we have at acquisition.
(43:52) is that we often take business as doing 2 million 3 4 5 Etc and then then take them to this side and say hey let me show you what looks like at 10 with a 7x multiple and so now you go from a one or2 or $3 million net worth to a $70 million net worth and that is how you get wealthy this is how you get rich now I want to be clear you can absolutely get to million a year in profit with not a lot of people or even just on your own because with the increas of AI and Automation and things like that like we're going to see more big companies with fewer and fewer head count but until the day until General AI
(44:29) comes in and just crushes everyone people are still required to get to where you want to go so if you want to not just make a million bucks or a couple million bucks and you want to get to 10 20 50 $100 million and Beyond you got to get the people side right and now we go to the reputation side ooh a fun one imagine all these flowers as different life experiences that you've gone through if you look at them all here this isn't a bouquet this is just a lot of r things put together now when we do this and we combine them
(45:01) all we now have something much closer to a bouquet and when you put all of your personal life experiences and your skills and your character traits together you create a bouquet and in other words you create a reputation but a bouquet doesn't really exist all we did was we Associated things that were separate and then we put them together and so you can strengthen your reputation by putting more and similar types of experiences together so you're like oh he's got a strong interest in this thing now if every single one of
(45:33) these would be different and some of these were weeds it would be a lot harder to understand what is the point of this thing and let's say that you had a drunk driving accident right all of a sudden how different does this bouquet look which shows you how one negative experience in your life can actually affect how people see the rest of everything else and so when we're thinking about brand or building a reputation I like to think of as what flowers do I want in my bouquet and which things am I ultimately trying to emphasize or not include at all and what
(46:03) associations are going to be ones that strengthen this and width are going to be ones that break it apart so reputation is a different word for saying what a brand is and a brand is simply an association between something you know and something you don't know when we're building a brand you want to associate all the things that you want someone to think about you with the thing that they don't know yet which is you now for me the more my personal brand has grown the more I have transposed acquisition. comom association with me and so now when my
(46:37) team goes out to the airport and is wearing a hat that says acquisition. comom people are like dude can I buy that hat from you because they've gotten value for my videos in my books they see an association with that value and they want to pay for it but if this just had a random shape on it they would have no desire to pay 50 if this actually happened one my director of HR the airport and a random person came up was like can I pay you $100 for the hat and she said no obviously because that's not how our brand Works got to earn it so the idea is that that is fundamentally how braiding works if I'm Louis Vuitton
(47:08) right I'm going to do the world's worst Louis Vuitton symol right if I'm Louis Vuitton what do I do I get Kim Kardashian to wear my clothing or carry my purse and then lady who doesn't have status says man I want to be like him but I can't buy Kim so I buy the thing that I've associated with Kim and then when I wear it I'll have the status by proxy from her and that's fundamentally how the luxury Market works but it's also how every Market works now why do Brands drop celebrities when they make a racial slur or they get into an accident
(47:46) or they get arrested for fraud because that becomes an association that people do know and then they don't like and so they say I don't want to associate our with that and so they say we're going to break this Association and so when you're building a brand it's being very particular about what and who you want to associate with if I have a porn star next to me and I have a porn star co-host you're going to think very different things about me even if the material is exactly the same you might be like that's flawed welcome to humanity and psychology right doesn't
(48:19) matter about whether it's flawed or not I can just tell you that this is how it works and so when you're building a reputation especially in the bdb or the BC space you want to provide value right we talked about value creation earlier and so it means that you want to give things that people want you know fast and easy way for them to consume that's risk frea and so when we do that you compound customer Surplus the street word for that is Goodwill which is what amount of value did someone get in excess of what they paid for so let's say I paid a doll for something and I
(48:48) feel like I got $5 worth of value right everything here between the two lines is customer Surplus or what we like to call Goodwill but the interesting thing about this is that if I do this over and over and over again these things aren't additive in my experience they've been multiplicative meaning if I keep providing something good and that's why it's so hard as a brand to decide when do I want to monetize something because the thing is is that the next time you provide even more value when people think that you're
(49:22) going to monetize they love you that much more and you get that much more reach and more Goodwill so that the next time and so it's basically reinvesting but rather than reinvesting Capital you're reinvesting Goodwill because what I can tell you is that Goodwill compounds faster than Revenue you can build a100 million brand in 3 years and to build $100 million in Revenue might take you way longer than that and that's because if you just focus on providing Goodwill at scale you get a disproportionate return The Rock was able to overnight build teramana into a
(49:55) 6 bill billion dollar company simply based on his brand and qu a beauty buil her beauty line into a billion dollar brand Conor McGregor with proper 12 billion dollar brand George Clooney billion dollar brand and so they understood this concept which is that this will grow faster and so they disproportionately invest early into this so that later they can monetize and do the right hook the big bloop to the audience and to quote Uncle Warren it doesn't matter how much Goodwill you have any number no matter how big it is multiplied by 0
(50:29) equals z so if you make a bet in the investing world that you then lose all the money and you had 30 years of good investing make and you go all in on one bet and you lose you lose it all you undo 30 years of good decisions with one bad decision and that's the thing a lot of people calculate when they think about their personal brand if we're going back to these flowers like I had earlier if I have this one broken flower it forever affects the way this bouquet looks imagine you gave this to your wife or your girlfriend and you said hey here
(51:00) you go you'd be like it's such an eyesore that it distracts from all the other flowers that you have and so that's why making sure that you never risk your reputation to make the short money so that you can let the Goodwill keep compounding let the party keep going is one of the smartest and hardest long-term business decisions cuz believe me if I start an only fans tomorrow I'll bet you probably make a lot of money it's like but it would be like this broken flower and it would permanently affect how people perceive it and the brand that I also want to buil so now we
(51:33) finished reputation and we're going to talk about compounding one of those big fancy words for investing about how to get rich and stay richer compounding is when something multiplies unto itself all right so if I have a $100 and it compounds at 10% a year next year it'll be at $110 the year after that I add 10% of this number which is on 121 right and then the next year 133 and so forth and so you notice that even though the time between these intervals remain the same the actual amount that we're growing continues to
(52:09) rise proportionally to how much we have which is how Uncle Warren can have a$1 billion and still make another $15 billion this coming year right is because he understands the power of compounding and they call it the eighth wonder of the world and in the last decade waren Buffet has made more money than he made over the rest of his career and that's because the longer you do it the better it guess which is why some of these early wealth building fundamentals are so important compounding only unlocks if you have a long-term perspective because this early first four years I mean decent but not bad but
(52:44) if you do that over 30 years it becomes unbelievable and it's also why you have to not diversify because if we were then splitting this up and saying you know what maybe I'm going to stop this we're interrupting the compounding process and Equity is one of the single greatest compounding Vehicles because you can reallocate Capital within the same vehicle right and a simple example of that would be like if I have 10 locations and I can grow by 10% every month then I go from 10 locations to 11 locations and next month I get 12 locations next month I get 13
(53:18) and by my 20th month I can open two locations I get to 22 then 24 and it compounds because by that time you'll built out the infrastructure ructure to sustain a faster pace so Panda Express they added 600 locations this year they had 2,000 at the beginning of the year that took them 45 years to get to this is one year they grew more in this one year than they did in any prior year before that and that's why you just have to stick with it for a long period of time and this is one of the things that people don't realize about restarting
(53:52) when you go from year 10 to year 11 you might be incredibly bored with your business but if you go from 100 million to 110 million you grew by 10 million and even though this new thing might sound more exciting in year 1 the liky you go from 0 to 10 million year 1 is really unlikely and so this is where all of the compounding is unlocked even though it's incredibly boring but if there's one thing I can have you write down boring is what makes you rich one of my favorite codes for Charlie longer is that the money isn't made in the buy
(54:24) or the sell it's made in the weight and the weight is the hardest part because you have to sit with your hands in your pockets and decide that the original plan that you had was a good plan and the hard part of the plan is sticking with the plan not doing the plan like deciding that you're going to work out isn't hard deciding that it's going to be 3 days a week for the year is it hard it's continuing to do it for that entire time is what makes it hard and I wanted to find a term for you that has been
(54:48) really helpful for me which is patience right A lot of people like be patient be patient what does that actually mean being patient simply means needs figuring out what to do in the meantime is I make this video I being patient for my stocks that are growing right now while I'm making this video I'm being patient for the cup that I want to lose some fat while I'm making this video right now I'm being patient for some of our portfolio companies to capitalize on the reinvestments that we're making right now but I'm making a video and so what you have to do is that when you stick to the plan Sometimes the best
(55:17) thing you can do is ignore and let it be which means that you don't interrupt the compounding process and there's a famous study that studied patient and impulse control and there's a one big learning that I think all of us can learn from so there was a test called the marshmallow test they took little kids and they can put a marshmallow in front of them and they wait 30 minutes and then they can eat the marshmallow now if they eat the marshmallow during the 30 minutes they didn't get a second marshmallow if they
(55:42) able to wait 30 minutes and not eat the marshmallow then they would give them a second marshmallow at the end so they got double the reward simply for waiting 30 minutes now what was interesting is that they studied the difference between the kids who could resist and the ones who could and obviously long term they figured out to the people who could wait and delay gratifications the ones who were more successful but the strategies that they used to delay was not that they stared at the marshmallow and used their Whow the kids who were successful
(56:11) did a number of different things some of them went to a different side of the room they just distanced themselves from the marshmallow itself some of them started singing songs to themselves other of them took the marshmallow and put it in their pocket so they couldn't see it anymore and so so the big thing is that they had the skills to figure out what to do in the meantime and so the more skilled you are the more ways you can win and that's why building skills is so important and it's so important because it allows you to be patient it gives you something to do in
(56:39) the meantime while you allow your master plan to come to fruition without thinking that you're smarter than you are to begin with so this concludes almost the get rich for Die Trying sex AK level three of wealth building so let's oh wait Alex you laugh that b box excellent observation that brings us to the very last level which could even be above the levels the level above the levels on the business not in the business you know what I'm saying enjoy your W let's talk about it in my opinion there are really just two levels of w level one is that you have all of your personal needs taken care of the second
(57:14) level of wealth is the unlimited level of wealth which is that you just always want to keep using money to make more money and that means that you've progressed from solving your personal needs to playing a game and so I think what a lot of people is they can never figure out what enough is for them and there was a period in my life earlier on where I was like okay let me figure out all these rich people things I bought a Bentley I was like let's go out to all the nicest restaurants every single night but the thing is is that to live
(57:37) like the 1% it's actually not that expensive if you fly private and it cost about $50,000 per month if you want to eat out every night of the week at the nicest restaurants of you know $500 dinners every single night it's 15,000 a month if you wanted to let's say lease a Lamborghini or something payments are probably 5 grand a month right on top of that let's say you want to go and buy designer clothing so that's another $115,000 per month let's say you spend $5,000 a month on a nutritionist and another $55,000 a month on therapy and
(58:07) performance coach whatever all right let's just call it a cool $100,000 per month of expenses oh we forgot to where we live let's let's live something of ball let's put another 50 Grand a month on here so $150,000 a month is just under $2 million a year in income now that's after tax right so maybe close to 4 milon a year in income now that's a good amount of money it's actually not a lot in the massive scheme of things and what I mean is that you can ball out all the way balls to the wall for the rest
(58:36) of your life on this level of income what I would encourage you to do is actually figure out what is good for me maybe it's worth it to taste these things and see which of them you actually enjoy and I think it was really doubtable for me to buy the belly and realize I didn't care and then just I gave it back 6 months later I sold it back at a lost so I think the big tldr here is that you need to figure out what your personal dream list is and a lot of people have these huge goals like I want to be a billionaire it's like why because you can just make this for the rest of your life and ball out but real
(59:07) real you can probably live incredibly comfortably on $50,000 a month like still 1% living unbelievable wealth looking stuff for for $50,000 a month after taxes so I think if you put what does food look like right what does travel look like what does clothing look like what does experiences look like what does Health look like and you start putting an actual number to it you realize that what you actually need to satisfy your personal needs just to give you less than you originally thought and so that brings me to the next level of
(59:41) this which is the game itself now there's a reason that my podcast is called the game and it's because at this point I play the game because I enjoy the game and so the whole concept of enjoying your wealth is not about not working and I think this is one of the big myths you might feel that way now because you hate what you do and the fact that you hate what you do is one of the reasons they might not ever get the wealth you want and so it's not about not working it's about getting addicted to freedom and freedom again doesn't mean
(1:00:18) you don't work it means you have the option to work and so I believe that humans are our best when we do work that's worth doing when we have purpose that we derive from the effort and the toil that we put in every day and you get weaker when you don't have an opposing Force that's as strong as you if you lift weights and you never lift even close to your maximum you eventually start losing muscle and I think it's the same thing with mental strength unless you're continually raising the bar you eventually attri it's use it or lose it and so most of us
(1:00:47) want to become the best versions of ourselves and in order to become the best versions of ourselves we have to increase the difficulty of the level that we're playing on imagine playing a game that You' beaten 100 times and then you put it on the easiest level it gets boring we think we want easier but we don't we want to do things that we enjoy more and enjoyment and easy are not necessarily the same thing and so if we're trying to enjoy our wealth it's finding the things that we can lose ourselves
(1:01:16) in for the rest of our lives and being okay with the fact that that thing May shift over time in terms of what it looks like or what it feels like and if you fast forward all the way to the end of the movie as a reminder you die and you can't take any of it with you and so even if you if you finish your life with this big pile of money at the end you still have to push it over the edge of the cliff right where it just falls off to other people whose hands are here because you're yeah and so reminding myself of that fact every
(1:01:57) single day reminds me that the whole point of the game is to play the game and by playing the game we win the game because the best games in life and I'll finish with this the best games in life are infinite games not finite games and I'll tell you the difference the point isn't to get married the point is to stay married when it comes to business the point isn't to win at business the point is to stay in business and literally keep playing and so when we think about the greatest games that we play as humans we have to
(1:02:30) take this infinite frame or we fool ourselves into a false finite prison that we keep wondering why we don't feel like we're winning when we get to the Finish Line because we never realized that there was no Finish Line to begin with and the fact that we were playing the game secured our Victory by its very nature and so this realization helped me reframe how I thought about spending my time so that I could enjoy my wealth the point for me is to stay in business and see who I can become in this process the
(1:03:00) point is for me to see what does it look like at 20 years of marriage with health it's not that like cool I've been training for 20 years I'm in decent shape I wonder what it looks like when I'm healthy at 50 because if you're only in shape for 6 weeks of your life or 6 months of your life or even 6 years of your life who cares if you only have a good marriage for a few years of your life who cares if you only in business and then go out of business really quickly and you get out of the game who cares and which is why the biggest Hiway that you can have and this is
(1:03:29) from Winston chal you win as long as you never quit and so that's how you enjoy your life and your wealth and there's your blueprint
13 Years Of Brutally Honest Business Advice in 90 Mins - YouTube
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhFlD54nQrY

Transcript:
(00:00) I've been in business for 13 years I've sold nine companies my last company I sold for 46.2 million I own acquisition. comom which right now does about $17 million a month across our portfolio I'm going to compress 13 years of brutal business truths and lessons into this one video brutal business truth number one sell to rich people until you have the money to sell all the poor people the middle is where you get killed Elon said you can either do a lot of good for a small amount of people or a little good for a large amount of people and I will tell you personally it's way hard
(00:30) to do a little good for a lot of people than a lot of good for a small amount of people there is a reason that Tesla started at the top they started only selling to rich people they had the Roadster which was $250,000 and so they sold those and then he was able to go down Market one and sell $100,000 cars to just upper Ash line of society the wealthy and then after that he made the X which is a little bit cheaper than that and then underneath of that he made the model 3 which was going to be the mass model right and each time it was significantly harder to do the one before because if
(01:01) if you want to sell based on value in terms of low cost you need to build the infrastructure for huge amounts of demand because the only way that you make money selling to poor people is selling tons and tons and tons of them look at Walmart look at Amazon these are businesses that were built for volume day one and they win on efficiency that was the whole point Amazon he wanted to have the best selection and the lowest prices Walmart everyday low prices they want they win on efficiencies like they all fly coach they use fold out cheairs they drink out of paper cups they
(01:33) purposely breed the culture of efficiency because it's the only way that you can win if you sell to poor people and I say poor people to be hyperbolic in terms of my language so that it drives the point home obviously I buy from Amazon but the point is is that the strategy is based on volume and you've probably heard some of my other tweets around this which is solve rich people problems they pay better or if you solve rich people problems you get to charge rich people prices this is what I think the key Insight is is that to someone who only has $11,000 when they pay you $100 they
(02:05) pay you 10% of their net worth their expectations of what they're going to get for that $100 is the same as a rich person giving you 10 million of their $100 million it would be gigantic right in terms of their expectations but getting a rich person to give you $100 they might have you notice and so the thing is is that it's actually easier in some ways to solve rich people problems because they're willing to pay more in an absolute sense for lower relative value and so with that extra profit or gross margin you can absolutely overd
(02:36) deliver for them and still make money and not have to learn all these things with infrastructure so for example if I wanted to start a bank I would have to have $25 to $100 million to start it up but if you do that then you have to build the infrastructure that you can handle money for zillions and zillions and zillions of people a very hard business to get into and so the idea is that you want to sell at least this is my belief is that you want to sell premium you want to sell s to wealthy people you want to sell to a niche person that you can do a lot of good for
(03:04) in a very small slice because you don't have to compete against everyone you can have inefficiencies and still make money without having to have tremendous infrastructure and skill around building it once you make a ton of money doing that you can obviously just do more of that which big fan or you say you know what the next thing I do I want to do for zillions and zillions of people and so then you build a business like a Netflix that think about how insane Netflix is just as a concept you pay $13 or $15 a month or whatever
(03:33) it is now and they create movies and shows and they spend millions of dollars and they sign Comedians and they've got all these shows that are streaming and you pay $14 a month it's absurd think about if you were said hey Mom and Dad I want to start this Video subscription and I'm going to just pay millions of dollars to get all these shows and movies made for us and I'm just going to charge 14 bucks it would be absurd that's how much value you have to provide to someone who doesn't have money to capture huge slices of the market how are you going to beat Prime $99 a year or 129 a year whatever it is
(04:07) now right and with prime you get basically all Netflix with Prime video you also have next day shipping same day shipping with anything that you want to buy 99 bucks a year $129 a year if you build to sell to the masses you need to build like you're going to sell to the masses and you're usually going to have to put a ton of money in for a long period of time because you have to have that infrastructure upfront to deal with that volume to have such a crazy value discrepancy that someone who has no money still never wants to cancel that's
(04:40) the key whereas if you go to wealthier people you can get a premium you can have five clients that all pay you $5,000 a month and make an amazing income and have the resources to actually do a good job and hire a couple people to help you out who are competent and you can do that when you charge more money and those people are not the ones who are like and everybody's hurt seen this me where the $50 month customer is like hey so for this $50 a month what am I going to get now we make fun of that that's the reality of if you're taking 5% of someone's paycheck it means a lot
(05:11) to them whereas if you're going to somebody who's making a million a month and they pay you five grand if they get one good thing a year they're stoked and they're like oh yeah I sent the wire did you get it like the difference between working with somebody who's on the lower end versus the higher end and so being very clear about who you serve not not serving other people going down Market only if you have the infrastructure to support huge amounts of volume and usually the capital to front it either you build for volume day one and win on
(05:41) efficiency like Amazon or Walmart or you build for a premium which means you Niche down and you completely solve problems for people so you completely solve a problem in a very narrow Niche and so let me give you a completely polar opposite examples here which I literally live on both sides of the spectrum on one side acquisition.
(05:59) comom is my premium brand right this is the brand that we do deals with this is where we have hundred million companies and stuff that we invest in that we own in right that's my family office and we do one or two deals a year just to being really real we make very rich people way wealthier right that's what I do there so someone comes in is already worth 50 million bucks and we're like cool how do we get to 250 and that's what we invest in that's what we we scale the company on the Other Extreme we've got school so school is for everyone who's starting out now School took 5 years to get to the level of product that it is now and
(06:31) millions and tens of millions of dollars of development where it lost money the entire time and still loses money right now in order to create such an absurd value for the 99 bucks a month or whatever it is because we know that that $99 a month for somebody who's trying to start their business that's the entirety of their business budget and so we have to solve all of the business problems that those people have at that level and so these are two completely this I mean honestly the most polar extremes of value Creation in terms of who we're
(07:02) selling to or who we advertise to and who we're attracting and how we help them and so there's no coincidence that I did acquisition. comom before investing in being a co-owner of school because I had to make enough money to be able to afford to sell to people who don't have much to be able to to help build the infrastructure and invest millions of dollars to build that so that we could accommodate millions and millions of users right now we have many millions of users on the the platform if you are confused about how to sell rich people stuff first off the easiest hack
(07:37) for selling a rich people is do what somebody else is doing that sells to rich people and do it in half the time and charge twice the price number one rich people pay for time Above All Else But if we look at the value equation you've got the outcom so you got to make sure they want the outcome that you're promising and you got the three other variables you've got risk How likely is it that they're going to get what they want when they buy time delay between when they buy and when they get and the effort sacrifice the Richer they are the more guaranteed they want it to be now
(08:03) you don't have to guarantee things but you need the perception of the guarantee that's why reputation matters if you're the best plastic surgeon in the world you don't give a guarantee they just have a high perceived likely of achievement they believe that if they pay you the likely that their nose isn't [ __ ] up when they do the surgery is high if time delay they want it to be as fast as possible if they give you money and have it tomorrow rich people pay a lot of money for that and then you've got effort and sacrifice well I don't
(08:26) want to do anything I want you to do everything and so the thing is is that a lot of times that makes sense to have very white glove concierge High touch things for people who are willing to pay for it because for them the incremental difference in cost for them is actually very small so the difference between $5,000 a month and $10,000 a month to a multi-millionaire not a huge difference but if you're just better for $10,000 a month they'll happily pay you than the $5,000 a month guy you're not going to
(08:52) sell someone who's Wealthy on how much money you're going to save them you'll sell someone who's Wealthy on how much time you're going to save them brutal business truth number two you lack priorities not information problems are easy to solve if you know what you're after if you know what problem you're actually trying to solve I'll tell you a story so I was talking to an entrepreneur who's done about 10 million a year and that was between all of his companies and we were talking and he mentioned one and then he mentioned the second they mentioned the third they mentioned the fourth I was like dude how many companies do you have and he's like oh I don't know I was like you don't
(09:20) know he's like yeah I have an Excel sheet and so I was like well pull it up and so he pulled up his Excel sheet and he had like 56 companies that in total were making like $10 million a year and obviously one of them was the biggest one that was doing like half of that revenue and that was actually the company that I had heard of that that he that he found it I said dude if you just only had that one company how easy would it be to like 5x that business he was like oh my God if I didn't have these other 55 companies it'd be it'd be a joke I was like so if I waved to Magic W
(09:52) and that happened you think you could do it and he was like yeah and I was like then do it you can wave the magic wand you can end these other 55 Partnerships so that you can do this one thing and what's crazy is that a year later I talked to him and he had done just that he was like dude I like didn't sleep for three days after we talked because I was like oh my God that's it so I see strategy as priority it's priorization of resources right you have unlimited options you have limited resources time money people Etc and so how you choose
(10:22) to allocate those resources against the unlimited options is your strategy it is how you prioritize and and when you have one clear goal for one clear company for one Clear customer the prioritization actually gets pretty easy and so a lot of people keep looking for these unique insights when the reality is you don't even have a goal have you toine the problem that you're trying to solve and most people have it and that ends up being usually the first question I ask someone they're like hey I'm stuck with my business and I just say well what's the goal and then they say something they say well what problem are you
(10:57) solving right now and so if you can't clearly State current state desired State obstacle you're running around like a chicken with your head cut off you're not going to solve anything you're going to do a lot of work but you're not going to move forward so I had a media company approach me they've got 40 million subscribers across their channels obviously very very good at media they said hey we've been listening to your content and we think that our constraint like the problem that we need to solve that will get us the most bang
(11:20) for the buck is that we need to optimize our Sops for the media company I said okay well what's the goal I was like is it to just get more famous or is it to money and they're like no we want to we want to shift into monetization now I was like okay so let me ask you this what product do you sell and they were like we don't have a product I was like okay so hear me out crazy idea if you had a product you would make a lot more money than trying to get your 97 out of 100 Media company to 98 and a half not to say that there's nothing like if they
(11:55) said I want to be more famous then I would have said absolutely you should do that that makes sense because monetization is in the goal but if they were trying to make money they had nothing to sell and I promise you if you have nothing to sell you make a lot less money than if you do have something to sell and so they could be a two out of 10 on product but with that amount of media that amount of traffic they would be able to get so many sales that they would they would blow it out of the water and so they were spending all this time trying to get in the intricacies
(12:22) trying to get information on how to solve the wrong problem and so most times it's not that you lack Insight it's that you're solving the wrong thing and I think the reason that that happens so frequently is because those entrepreneurs are media entrepreneurs they like media they feel comfortable in media and so they like solving media problems and so they like solving problems that they know how to solve because they've solved them before I'll tell you a different story I had a guy who came out for uh a workshop here at
(12:46) acquisition. comom and he said hey can you go over the closer framework and I said okay you flew across the country you've been here for a day you had this one opportunity to ask this question to me I was like is sales a problem in your business what's your Clos rate he said 40% I said so sales is not the constrain of your business he was like no I was like then why are you asking me about the closure framework and I actually think that that lesson was way more powerful than me trying to go over the closure framework because the reality is is he
(13:10) was a sales guy he loves selling and so he wanted to hear me talk about sales but sales isn't the problem in his business there's something else that's the problem he might not getting enough leads or people are turning out to to CL on the background or he can't even take on more customers because he doesn't have enough team like those were all other examples of problems that might exist and I'll bet you one of those three probably is the problem his business but that was the question he asked he asked about the thing that he enjoyed reading about the thing he
(13:32) enjoyed learning about and so right now if you're an entrepreneur it is true that you want to double down your strengths but the business as a whole has to be balanced so hear me out if you think about business like a like a body okay and you're a bodybuilder and so you want to have ideal ratios for everything in terms like if your arms were like this big and your you know your quads were tiny then you look weird right so you want to be a specialist like you sure as an individual contributor keep doubling down in your strengths but the business as a whole will only be as strong as as weakest link and so this is
(14:05) where people get confused with double down in your strength versus be well balanced the business needs to be balanced your Physique in total needs to be balanced but you as an individual contributor can double down your strengths you want a team of people who are all doubling down on their strengths but you as the organizer of the business need to make sure that the business as a whole is balanced otherwise it will get constrained at some point and then that point will be your point of failure that will be the weak link that will be the part of the bridge where only $1 can get across even you've got 10x the front end
(14:31) and 10x the back end that one bottleneck is what's bottlenecking the business and so making sure that often times the thing that you're not the most excited if you're a marketing entrepreneur marketing is probably not your problem if you're a product driven entrepreneur product's probably not your problem if you hate people and that's like that's probably your issue like I hate meetings I hate leading people I hate trying to reinvest my team I'll bet you that you probably are having limits on your business because you don't know how to
(14:55) recruit higher train manage and so that's actually what you need to either learn or recruit someone who already knows how to do that and so people spend too much time mentally masturbating to the concepts that they love in the idea that because it worked to get them to where they're at because they needed to start marketing to make money they think okay now if I 10x marketing that that's what it takes to make more money and unless that's the constraint that's not true and often times businesses do grow to the constraint of the founder they do
(15:23) grow to the constraint of that individual Founders highly special I skill and then at that point it's constrained with something else that the founder doesn't like as much and so either you got to learn it and get comfortable learning stuff that you don't like as much initially or you got to find someone who does and so if you're like okay well I'm either a product entrepreneur and I need more marketing or I'm a market entrepreneur and I need more product or I'm either of those things and we don't have an operator we have somebody who likes to lead and manage people and invest in teams then how do you know what good
(15:53) looks like so first off one of the biggest advantages of business of of doing this for a while is to you start to recognize patterns so you hire Five Guys that suck and then finally find a six then all of a sudden you're like okay so this is what a good sales director look like this is why the businesses for example that we start now grow so much faster because one we know who's going to be needed next and two we know what that person looks like and so think about how much time you save where if the constraint let's say is sales and
(16:18) you hire onboard train and that takes a month and then that person sucks and it takes you 6 months to fire them and then you do it again and that takes another 6 months to fire them and you do it again and then this time it works well you just wait wasted a year and change of growth that you should have been growing but you weren't because you're the wrong person at the point of constraint and realistically this is why so many businesses get stuck and the wrong conclusion is the person says oh I tried hiring sales directors that doesn't work
(16:42) no you tried hiring John and JN sucked it doesn't mean that there is no sales director doesn't mean you're the special snowflake that no one can ever replace you that no one can do this role it's just that you can't like there's Microsoft there's Facebook there are gazillion dollar companies someone out there on Earth is better than you literally at the thing that you're best at and definitely better than the thing that you suck at now how do you actually tactically find these people when you don't have the experience so I'll give you the the tactic how I think about
(17:06) this one is I interview lots of people and so if you think about the interview process as an education process in asking them as much as you possibly can act like an ignoramus just be like I don't know anything about this tell me about it and then don't then immediately jump on the first person go on 10 Dates go on 20 dates I'll give you a little Sideline Story for school say I'm the founder interviewed 600 developers before he found his co-founder 600 and the way that he did that is the process of him outlining so first he said hey who here knows anything about development in his Network so he got he started interviewing those developers
(17:44) and then he said hey can you introduce me to the best developers you know and so then those people introduced him because they had a better context he's like I'm not hiring any of you I want to know the best people you know and So eventually he kept going up the ladder of he talked to those people say who's who's the best one you know and he kept going up and kept going up only to fact find only to find information until he found somebody who's like oh my gosh this guy said more things and made more
(18:07) sense and at this point in the process he'd already spoken to so many people he had a good context from which to make a judgment and so that is the process I will tell you what I personally look for now I look for the quantity and quality of metrics that someone has to describe their role and so I'll give you a binary example so on one hand if so I was hiring someone for customer success let's say that's like you're getting a lot of churn you're not getting a lot of ascensions you're not getting good reviews your NPS scores are low Etc you
(18:37) then saying okay Mr customer success candidate tell me about customer success what metrics do you measure now if they say like you know I just want to make sure people are happy that they're having a good you know a good time and that they're you know they're getting results and they're having a good experience I'd be like cool what do you measure and if they start squirming around like well what do you measure and they can only come up with one or two things then already know that this person obviously can't drive an outcome
(19:00) because they can't even Define an outcome now on the flip side if that person says okay well we like to Define an activation metric up front that we can do within the first 48 hours then we have like what is our time to value and what's our you know what's our North Star there we also like to measure cstat but I don't like to do it too often because then customers don't like filling out the surveys and so we want to make sure that we can do it ideally within the customer Journey during a value driven exchange that they're going to have with the customer service rep or
(19:24) some sort of account rep that they have to manage and then we can just tack it into that process I like to look at churn but but churn I see more as a lagging indicator and I looked at look at these other things especially what's our time like how long does it take from sale to onboarding what's that handoff look like what percentage of customers are backing out in the first 24 hours 48 hours 72 hours and what percentage of these customers are leaving us review by day 30 and so all of a sudden I'm like
(19:46) okay well he just said like nine different metrics and had reasoning for that and so then the followup to this question of understanding the quality and quanity of the metrics that someone's going to bring to the table is awesome this is going to freak some people out how does what you do make the business money and if the person cannot accurately describe how their function because every function of a business makes a business money that's why the function exists now the thing is is that some functions of a business are indirect versus direct so if I asked a CFO how do you make the business money
(20:17) they should say multiple things well one I control expenses so everything that I save goes to the bottom line and I have a process of consistently cutting out access costs uh every 30 days and so by doing that I can usually drive an extra 3 to five % to the bottom line which more than pays for me so I'm like okay great they're already even thinking about my return as an owner versus them on top of that they say okay also I see Finance really as a function of decision-making and so if we can collect
(20:41) the metrics that drive decisions around what things have the highest gross margins what's our utilization rates um how can we make the decisions that will get us the highest return on Capital uh both human and money capital in the business then we will grow faster and so if someone talks like that then I'm like okay they understand how Finance is actually a data function by the way it is literally that's what Finance does is gives you reports it's reporting so that you can make decisions about the business so that they we make more money cool now sales is say like and I'll give you an example for a sales director so
(21:13) if I say hey how does what you do make us more money now if they say well I'm going to I'm going to drive sales I'd be like well duh but like you're not going to sell anyone CU you're a director so how do you make the company more money what you want them to say is that I'm going to increase the average conversion percentage across our leads for the team because that is the output of the sales manager is closing percentage like at a fundamental rate it's closing percentage is one of the metrics but just total conversion rate
(21:43) of leads so if I get 100 leads and there's lots of mini steps you got to schedule you got to show you got to close you got to offer whatever there's cash collected there's other mini metrics along the way but you just want to see what percentage of eyeballs IND oror earballs and people who give us their information we can contact do we convert into sales and if you say I as a sales director will be able to increase that percentage then that's the job and that's how I make the business more money because here's the thing if they cannot describe an output of their job
(22:13) that ties to revenue for the business or ties to profit for the business then you can be absolutely certain that they don't know how to do it and that they're not going to do it for you because they can't even tell you how it works and so I use those as the limit test test one I interview as many people as I possibly can so I can get a basis from which to make a judgment two from there I'll learn the metrics because I won't know them um that people use to describe the role to drive outcomes and I will look for the quantity and quality of metrics that people will track and
(22:44) what they would do to influence those metrics step two and then step three how does what you do make the company more money don't let them get away with like with the sales example well we're going to make more sales no but how do you influence that business truth number three things are hard because your team isn't as good as you think they are and that's because your standards are too low a Metro mind said this to me and I've always kept this in mind he said your best talent you haven't even hired yet your best talent is in the
(23:14) future and so let's run a thought experiment for a second everybody who's listening to this has that one teammate who's just an absolute stud hopefully if you don't I'm sorry for you but at least one person on your team is pretty good if you had to those people would you be able to make way more money the answer is almost always unequivocally yes I'd be able to make way more money and so then the followup is then why is all of your attention not to getting more of those people if you listen to the Steve Jobs the boses the the Bill Gates Elon so many of them Zuckerberg so
(23:47) many of them talk about talent and in the early days of Entrepreneurship I thought that they were trying to hide the secrets but it's really that they were talking about what they were focused on now and as I continue to do business the more I just care about who rather than what or how because if you really do have the right who you're one Higher away from somebody who's a 100 times smarter than you who's done this way longer than you have who can help you grow the business I'll give you this story that really drove this home so when we were looking at selling gym launch we had a lot of conversations
(24:18) with investment bankers and then finally fixed you know we picked an investment Bank to represent us and then we had a lot of conversation with prospective buyers so acquires um meaning people who like fund managers people who have big funds of money who buy companies for a living and I remember a moment on one of the first of these meetings where I it was it was in person they'd flown out and all of their team was on one side and all of my team was on the other and I was sitting at the head and the managing partner was at the other side of the table and I just remember just kind of sitting there
(24:49) silently looking down the table looking at both sides back and forth back and forth and being like no wonder these guys are going to make $3 billion in the next five years versus my team and the thing is just to be clear it wasn't that my team was bad I mean we built a you know $100 million doll plus business I saw the discrepancy this is not a slight to anybody on the team we obviously had stars but seeing the average level of Talent on their team versus mine was a huge moment for me to understand just how important
(25:20) people are and so there's a story in Google I think it was Larry Page surgery brand whoever typed into Google like parachutes whatever and the ads that came up were for like buy a radio buy a car and he screenshotted it and he puts it on the corkboard in the engineering room and said these ads suck he just wrote it on the screenshot and he hit the board and he walked out of the room and The Story Goes that the next night one of the developers just like stayed up all night and came up with AdSense and AdSense more closely paired what
(25:53) people were searching for with the ads that they were shown he didn't say here's the 100 step proc process that we're going to do to solve this problem he just said you guys are intelligent this is the problem go fix it and so one of the telltale signs that you have bad people on your team or people who are too dumb or your standards are too low is that you have stupid rules and I and I I'm I'm I'm somebody who's done this so this isn't me preaching here this is something that I've I've now realized is that if you have to have a rule that's like hey
(26:22) everybody you have to show up on time hey don't drink while you're on the job hey um like you can't watch Netflix while you're working like that's not a good thing by the way all of these are rules that I have implemented at some time in a business that I've owned and I'm telling you this now because it seems so painfully obvious that if I have to say don't watch Netflix while you're on a customer service call with a customer that shouldn't be a rule that should be an obvious thing that anyone with half a brain cell can figure out but what that really meant is that if
(26:55) you start making stupid rules it's because your standards are too low and you're hiring stupid people people rule number four lots of rules means you have dumb people so let's talk about that for a second so one of the things to prevent against this is a rule from Amazon which is that every person you hire you want to raise the average bar of the team that they're getting hired into I literally used this yesterday with someone that we were interviewing uh Lelo was like what do you think about this person I said well do they raise
(27:21) the bar of the team and he was like hm I was like all right well then there's our answer because the thing is is that all companies will unless controlled for dilute down Talent so people you know sixes will hire fives five will hire his four fours will hire threes and people will always hire people that they're not threatened from because they want Security First and so you have to implement something like this because the reverse can also be true if imagine if every single time you hired somebody it raised the bar of the team then the
(27:52) team will just continue to get better and better and smarter and smarter people and then the company will grow and grow and grow and I have a fundamental Bel that the level of a business grows kind of like a Christmas tree where you've got the the number and intelligence of brains that goes up so if you have lots and lots and lots of really intelligent brains the the size of this business is huge if you only have one brain that's intelligent and everyone underneath of that has a subset of the skills of that one brain then it's only one brain that's competing against companies that have a 100 smart brains
(28:26) and that was something that in my early days every person I hired I could do their job better than them and I trained them to do everything they did which meant the limit of the business was me I had to literally keep learning things which you always have to do of course but I had to learn everything from scratch and so the business then had to suffer what a a day one customer success rep would deal with because I didn't know anything about customer success and so the idea is I would rather bring someone in who has 10 years
(28:54) of experience in customer success so that we can start the business on year 10 of customer success I want that person who have learned all those lessons on someone else's dollar and then when they come to me have all those lessons so I don't need the scars and so one of the one of The Telltale sides also of an early company is that you've got people who have zero experience in leadership roles for a function they've never done before and that's because it's like well this is my coo Sarah we have five people in our company but she's our coo it's like
(29:23) don't use the term coo CU she's going to look at salary.com and she's going to say that she she make more than the entire company makes in Revenue right no that's not the case like she's a manager right and realistically she probably doesn't manage the whole business she probably just manages this portion of it or he just manages a portion of it and so the thing is is like just because it's your mom or it's your brother or your best friend growing up or that guy who you hired first has been with you since the beginning it still doesn't
(29:48) mean that they're right for the role and so this is where a lot of the money that you want to make is on the other side of a few hard conversations and many people never have they're willing to just accept mediocrity at the point of the bottleneck and never get debottleneck because they can't say hey Sarah I don't think it's working out and I think it's my fault because I put you in a position without the resources to win and I think and this is how you this is how I manage it what I want to do is I want to keep investing in you and here's how I want to do it I want to bring someone in who has a ton of
(30:25) experience who knows more than both of us put together and I want you I'm going to basically pay for you to learn from this person so that you can become more skilled in your career and then you I want you to get laser focused on this thing over here that you were doing before and absolutely tune it up and so this way we you're going to crush what you're currently doing every day and it's absolutely within your scope and experience that I think you can do really well with it and I also want to build out your future by bringing this person in so think about it like me paying $100,000 a year for you to learn
(30:54) from somebody who has 10 years of experience it's about the biggest gift I can give you and so if you frame it like that it's not like this is a demotion or like you suck it's like I'm trying to invest in you and I'm going to invest in you by bringing this person in who's going to teach you now if that person has an ego which is usually the next common thing which is like I thought I was doing great then it means you probably have a communication issue like you're not telling them that Sarah's not doing a good job and then Sarah gets upset and
(31:17) the thing is is at that point Sarah might have an ego because she started at the front line and then became a manager then you give her another title uh progression too fast and to be really clear I've done this two times with executive assistants um just with executive assistant within the companies a zillion times me personally I've done this and I don't really even deal with a lot of Personnel in general and it's like I just I promoted someone too fast I think it's the Peter Principle which is that people will advance to their point of incompetency and so someone
(31:44) does really well at sales and so then you put them in a sales manager and then they've never managed a sales team and they don't do really well at that but they get promoted to their point of incompetence so I lost a good salesperson and I got a bad sales manager and this is how most of corporations are run people do well and then their role changes into something they've never done before and then they do poorly and they get stuck there or they get fired and most times because the person who promoted them feels bad they just get stuck there and so You' got all these people who you still have positive associations with the work that they did
(32:14) and you feel like you owe them because they did do a good job one time before but now they're doing a poor job because they're not properly equipped and you didn't give them the skills to succeed and they don't have the experience and yes that's your fault but the thing is you can't fire you because you own the company so somebody's got a and so either you got to move them aside you redefine the role and move someone ahead of them or you have to get rid of them and again this is what makes business hard it's not that it's complicated it's that you don't want to hurt someone's feelings and I get that
(32:43) that's what makes hard conversations hard if you hate somebody firing them is very easy right like someone stole from you firing is not personal experience there slept fine that night all right it's the conversation with someone that you know is trying their best that you really like as a human being but isn't cutting it and even if you think you could get them there you're not willing to invest the resource to do it because it doesn't make sense I could wait for someone to learn neurosurgery and I think people could but it might take a decade and I don't know if I really want to invest all that
(33:16) time when I could just go find a neurosurgeon and yeah I might have to pay more but I'd rather pay that than pay 10 years and so to to to to Loop this back around to the story that I was talking with the private Equity firmers when I was looking at them one of the big OB things too is that many of the people on the other side of the table were making 1 million2 million $5 million a year and you know people who were in their 20s making 300,000 500,000 a year and I was like okay I need to reset my bar of what I have to compensate in order to attract a level
(33:49) talent and once I really understood the value of people the way that we grew businesses completely changed it stopped being about building businesses and became way more about assembling the teams that build the business like one of the core functions we do at acquisition.
(34:09) probably the thing that we invest the most resources into is recruiting Talent like there's a reason that we go really hard on LinkedIn because people respond to our messages and we're like hey you ran all the ads at this $200 million per year director consumer business we have a director consumer business that's at 20 million would you be willing to take it from 20 to 200 because we think you have the experience or do you know anybody who does and because we have a falling there we get the responses and we can get that level talent but that level talent's not coming in for 100 grand a year you can moan all you want that oh these employees want so much money but there's
(34:39) a Marketplace there's a rate and if you're not willing to pay it there's a company that is smarter than you that is willing to pay it because they know the return on it and I still think to this day one of the biggest Arbitrage that exists in business is paying a talent a wages to get 10x the output so let me let me drive this home so you can get a B player let's say let's use $100,000 as the Baseline so I want to hire a role for $100,000 for this thing and a b player in the role will take 80 and uh a B+ might take 90 or 100 but
(35:17) there might be an A+ plus guy who's like 170 it's like whoa that's like twice our budget for this role but if that guy or gal has the output like an a player can get you 5x 10x the output of a b player meaning five people who are B players at $100,000 a year equal one A++ at 170 that's still a great return and better than hiring 5bs and especially in knowledge work so if you have anything that has to do with thinking and not like where literally more hands are are required to do the work the outsize return on intelligence is so high that I still see it as one of the
(36:00) fundamental Arbitrage that exists in business how much time you save by hiring somebody who knows exactly what to do how it drives Revenue in the business and they can use 10 years of experience that you don't have to pay so I would rather pay 25% 30% more for somebody 50% more for somebody who can move me 10 years forward like it seems almost silly when you frame it like that not to but the thing is every day small business owners want to save $5,000 on an annual on on an annual salary for somebody who they know is perfect for
(36:27) the job this is truth number five if you want to get bigger get better better leads to growth bigger leads to bloat so I was reading estr Cathy's uh book wealth is it worth it and he talks about the story of Chick-fil-A and he said that what his his number one Pursuit um was better not bigger and that he believed that if they were better and they just kept getting better he said our customers will demand that we get bigger versus trying to get bigger for the sake of getting bigger and so he tells a story between him
(36:57) Chick-fil-A and Boston Market so for those you who don't know Boston Market was actually a very big chain when I was growing up um That Grew really really quickly and so chickfila was you know privately held they take they took on almost no debt uh they grew really responsibly one location at a time and Boston Market was like we're going to franchise and we're going to raise a ton of money from Wall Street and we're going to make all this stuff and for a period of years they outg grew Chick-fil-A by a mile and they were like oh Chick-fil-A is going to get left in the dust they're going to get Al caped they're going to get crushed
(37:28) but because Boston maret grew so quickly because they didn't they diluted their talent because they had to hire so many bodies and not enough brains and because they wanted to grow because they wanted valuations they wanted money they were what I would consider mercenaries whereas Chick-fil-A and EST Cathy was a missionary he believed in the product he believed in the experience and because he's a faith-driven entrepreneur he wanted his restaurant to represent the tenants of Christ this isn't me getting religious on it but he believed in his mission that's the point and basos talks
(37:59) about this he said you've got mercenaries you got missionaries the missionaries always win in the long term and so what end up happening is that the money guys some of these guys cashed out early because stock got inflated all this stuff they took on tons of debt and then the the company ended bankrupting I don't know something like 10 years later but guess what happened in that period of time Chick-fil-A just kept growing and the thing is is that Boston Market couldn't out compete Chick-fil-A in their Market they just grew faster but
(38:22) the thing is is that if you've got a Boston Market in chickfila if you know that your chicken sandwich is you still always win it becomes an inevitability it doesn't matter if they get there first if you win in the end who cares because quality will always win provided it's priced appropriately and things like that but better leads to bigger bigger leads to bloat and so this has been something that was really hard for very hard for me to learn as an entrepreneur because you know we we like them I mean I like the feedback of how much money are we making this month I want to make sure it goes up I want to
(38:54) make sure it goes up because that it's a it's a proxy for growth okay and and I used to say this and I I like it which is either the business is growing or I am so if the business isn't growing or the business is going down I'm growing I'm learning when I'm I'm messing up and if the business is growing sometimes you're not learning because the you're getting rewarded for the work that you did while you were learning while you're eating [ __ ] sometimes you get both and that's the ideal scene is that it's growing and you continue to learn and you st you keep your learnings ahead of
(39:20) the growth so the trains coming and you're building out the track you're getting around the ditches you're going through the mountain you're digging the hole you're doing that stuff to the train can keep running and keep growing a big lesson that I have taken from EST Cathy and some of the best entrepreneurs like Elon if you're going to enter a market so Elon talks about this if you're going to enter a new Marketplace you want to be an order of magnitude better than the existing Solutions and so I'll give you an example Elon just recently did uh he talked about getting into candy or chocolate which you might
(39:49) think why would he even bother getting into that I think it's because he had a gripe with Warren Buffett and Charlie muger which is really sad cuz I like both of them he had a little bit of a rift with them oh he was like well fine I'll take out C candies and so he was like I'm going to get into chocolate and so he had all these people send him different recipes and all this stuff and he decided not to do it and the reason he decided not to do it is he said that there was no product there was no version of chocolate or candies that
(40:12) was in order of magnitude better than what already existed so he just didn't want to play if you think about how he entered into the other markets he got into space and was like oh we're going to redefine how space flight Works we're going to use reusable things that we're going to drive down cost 10x compared to the competition that's an order of magnitude better with cars the first real Tesla not the the Roadster the high-end one but the first one he made for Mass commercial use was literally the highest rated car um that auto
(40:36) whatever Auto magazine the premium magazine had ever rated it got the highest overall score of all time because he focused so much on making an order of magnitude better and the thing is is that Tesla makes Great Cars by and large and so customers have demanded they get bigger because they continue to out buy out purchase their supply and so that forces Supply to increase so you grow and so if you're stuck and you're like I keep trying to grow and I can't grow sometimes you just to think let's not grow what if we didn't want to
(41:10) grow at all but we just had to make this thing absolutely insane from a quality perspective just get better and the way that you do this tactically is that you look at each function of the business and you say what's one thing we can do better that we absolutely very high confidence like we're just going to go from contacting our leads within 30 minutes to five minutes that's the one thing we're going to do for the next 12 weeks for for sales for marketing what we're going to do is we're going to make sure that every single ad has a hook
(41:33) that's been tested before that's what we're going to do we're going to make sure every ad that goes out is going to have hook that's tested and we're going to make five times more of them great that's what we're doing on marketing and every single one of them here's the key point is that once you start that new that one thing the next quarter you add to that you don't just swap it and this is what most people do they do that one thing and then they forget what they were doing is that you end up creating this checklist of what creates amazing ads you create this checklist of what
(41:57) makes amazing followup you make this checklist of what makes an amazing handoff between sales and customer success make this checklist of how to activate a customer and so it's 100 golden BBS not one silver bullet that creates the outsized returns and then once you have 100 golden BBS you start getting the word of mouth you start getting people who keep buying from you and then all of a sudden your LTV skyrockets and then you might find out if your LTV skyrockets maybe you don't have a marketing problem maybe you just weren't making enough per customer and I can tell you this the amount of times I talk smart businesses who are like we
(42:27) need cheaper leads we need cheaper leads we need we need to lower our CAC the reality is they just don't make enough for customer because they're not that good and either you mispriced which does happen for sure or your thing's not that good which is 100% under your control fundamentally growth is a lagging indicator the things you do to create growth are the leading indicators and the things that create growth are the things that make you better and so having growth as a desired behavior is trying to make an outcome into an input and then what happens is you have quote growth for growth sake and here's the
(43:01) problem with this just as a big big picture is that if the reason that you're in business is to quote make money if that's your real Mission so many things make money and so what happens is you become distracted as an entrepreneur this is why the mercenaries fail compared to the missionaries because if you just want to make the best chicken sandwich anything that's not a chicken sandwich isn't a priority they could have Chick-fil-A credit cards right or Chick-fil-A miles they could do that stuff and they probably would make the money it's not core now go find out if they probably
(43:31) have a credit card who knows but like the point is is that it's not core to what they know if money is the goal then there are so many paths to getting there that it's difficult to stay focused which is why companies get spread thin which is why they grow for growth's sake and then all of a sudden they have five initiatives that are going on that all aren't working that well because they couldn't focus on the thing that matter most which is getting better at the core promise that they make to customers business truth number six you work all
(43:56) day but you can't get anything done because you allow too many things that don't matter to distract you sometimes you have to let fires burn and so what that means is that you have to block time for work that moves the ball forward because a month later it'll be the only thing you have to show for the month before and so one of the things that took me a long time to realize is that there are very few things that are existential crisis within hours even within minutes right and so the idea that everyone in the company and all of your customers Etc can have immediate demand from you as or responses from you
(44:27) as the owner is not a good expectation because then it means that you're on demand for everyone else's needs but the business needs you and so I'll give you a story to drive this home so at my first gym I had just started sleeping not at my gym which was wonderful for me and so right as like I get my first few nights of sleep I get a call that everybody hates at 5:30 in the morning because that's when sessions happen and I was like hello what's going on and he said I've got bad news and I immediately go to someone died from a heart attack in our gym that was the like the
(44:57) immediately went there and uh I'm just silent and I was like what is it and then he says there's a a water pipe that broke and it's leaking on the floor and I was like okay what do you want me to do it's like well I don't know what to do I I called you and I said well what do you think I'm going to do he's like I I guess call a plumber and I was like okay what what would I do in the meantime he's like probably get a bucket I was like yeah I was like have you done that he was like well no I called you I was like like okay well why don't you do
(45:29) those first two things because there's nothing I can do there's a story of uh Elanor Roosevelt I think uh when I think someone in her family died in the middle of the night she gets woken up by her servant or whatever you know however they did it back then and he says you know Mrs Roosevelt I have some terrible news and it's like 3:00 in the morning and she's like what is it he's like your cousin you know John died and she said that could have waited till morning there's nothing I can do about about it and so there's very few things that will actually kill a business and
(46:03) so if you allow everything to be urgent it means that everything's a priority which means nothing is and priorities literally mean prior they come first and I literally prioritize my day by the things that matter most and so I start my day I do prior to my day the thing that I think will actually move the ball forward because when I look back at my last month to see the progress that I've made I never think about you know Susan who I had to give a refund to because she was dissatisfied for something or we got a onear review and we need to you know deal with that
(46:34) or uh you know our our chat support uh went down for you know two hours in the middle of the day and people were like you know why did the chat support like none of these things are existential crusies for the business in the short term there's almost nothing that kills a business in the short term and like the only real thing is that your payment processing goes down so you literally your ability to accept money goes away but beyond that like there's not a lot of stuff and so what you have to get comfortable with is letting some fires burn and being able to say yes this
(47:04) sucks but not getting the important work done will suck more and so I spend and I still do this the first four to six hours of my day working on the things that I believe matter most and I think that if I had a single habit that has gotten me the furthest in my life it's that I I work uninterrupted for the first four to six hours of my day on the things that I think think have the highest leverage in the business and I like to think about that as what's the one thing that if it were true all of my other problems would go away and then I
(47:36) put all of my effort into making that one thing true or making that one thing happen but that can't happen if you have 20 other mini priorities that are Urgent and not important every entrepreneur suffers from this and so you have to draw lines in the sand or you will be spread too thin you will work all day and you will get nothing done to protect that first four to6 hours in the beginning I had to wake up early so that mean I woke up at 4:00 I worked for 6 hours till 10:00 and I start my day at 10:00 as I made a little bit more money I was able to like sleep
(48:06) in until like 5: uh or you know and then start working at like 6:00 and then I'd work from 6:00 to noon and so everybody on my team this has been for years everyone my team knew do nothing until the afternoon like Alex only takes meetings in the afternoon and so for me I do my thinking work in the morning and then I do my meetings in the afternoon as I hired more people more directors more leaders more Executives a lot of those meetings all were able to disappear and so now it just became like Ivy meetings day and the remainder of my week is just completely open here like let me show you how this plays out in
(48:34) the real world someone reaches out and says hey I got to connect you with Jimmy I think you guys would have a lot of synergies I think that this would be a really important connection and I say um I take meetings on Mondays and they're like oh I don't think he can do that and I say okay I guess we won't meet we just sit there and that's it and you'll be amazed often times that if they really want to meet you they'll make it work on Mondays and if it means that it's also three Mondays from now then it's three Mondays from now and I will say this if I don't meet Jimmy you
(49:07) many people are there on Earth there's 8 billion people I'm not going to meet most people and the likelihood that Jimmy's going to actually do something that because like if I know what I need to do to grow my business there's not a lot that Jimmy's going to offer me there like if I'm very clear on my strategy and I'm very clear on my execution anything that's not that fundamentally loses me money it certainly doesn't make me money and so just being okay with saying no and so I'll give you the tactic around this which is just saying I like to say so this is how I do this in Social settings i' would say hey I'm
(49:36) actually not taking meetings until after my book launches and then once my book launches I'll say I'm not taking meetings until we sell this company and I'll just always have something that I'll just push out that's way far in advance that seems very important that gives people a social reason to feel okay that I'm saying no to them not saying you're not important it's saying I've got this other thing that's really important to me um and so so that tends to work pretty well with entrepreneurs but you have to be okay with it like if you have a team where you people manage your schedule for you
(50:06) like I had to explain this to my we have three executive uh assistants that manage Le and I calendars and I was like if I if you put a meeting in the morning at like 10:00 a.m. I was like you've killed my whole morning it's shot like I can't get into any kind of deep work and then I'm going to have two hours and I'm going to have lunch again and I'm have other stuff out like no like we don't do that if they are going to do something and it's quote very urgent and they have a very strong argument that I put at the
(50:30) very end of my day and I and I book from the back forwards and so that means that if I say I want to end my day at 5 or whatever then it means they're going to put my my first meeting of the day at 4 o'clock so from 4 to 5: if it's an hourong meeting and if I have a second meeting that day then it's going to be from 3:00 to 4:00 and so I still get my whole day until 3:00 uninterrupted so I can work on the things that matter most and we have just learned Le and I working together that basically the more she takes off my calendar the more money we make and that's because that's where
(50:59) I'm most effective now the flip side is Lea is such an exceptional operator and leader that her form of productivity is an absolutely stacked day so that she can delegate invest in the team prioritize uh resources deal with small small decisions that have to move the ball forward check in on projects hope people accountable reward them for this the behaviors they've done like interview new candidates that we need to bring into the company like that's a super timec consuming thing that's very very high leverage and very high value
(51:22) like think about it if you have to take 20 interviews to find the right person who can then take an hire 20 hours a week off your plate I mean gez you spend 20 hours once to get 20 hours a week for Life what a great return and this is why entrepreneurship at the highest levels I'm going to go on a side drain here but I think it'll be important entrepreneurship at the highest levels is always hiring ahead of where you're at and for people who don't like their current business I can promise you that if you grow it enough you're just going
(51:53) to be dealing with people all businesses at the top are you got a marketing person you got a salesperson you got a product person you got Finance you got legal you got Tech and that's that's the business and so whether you're selling widgets you're selling services you're selling software fundamentally you're just going to have a bunch of people that are executing those things and so at the very highest levels business is all the same and you have to learn how to play business at that level to keep playing at that level business truth number
(52:22) seven brand takes a long time to build but it's the most valuable thing that you can know it gives you the ability to get insane Returns on Advertising pric far above the market and keep people only buying from you it's very hard to imagine something that is better than that it just takes time and so this was I mean this is probably the lesson that took me so long to learn like year I mean many many many many years I mean I think I would say it took me a decade to learn this and it's I've only been able to reap the fruit of this in the last couple years and first off I didn't even
(52:55) understand what branding was branding is simply an association people make between something they know and something they don't know the thing they don't know is your business and the thing they do know should be something they like and then over time that rubbing of the thing that they like rubs off on your brand and eventually you can drop this thing and only have your company and they will make that positive association with you and so there's three ways that people will make associations this is how you build the brand one is what you say or show so that's controllable so people will
(53:20) associate this hat with me and if you got value during this thing then you'll associate the value with acquisition. comom cool so that's what I can say show this is adver ising me me making this content is advertising right I'm letting people know about my stuff the second level is what other people tell them and so that means like either someone who's interacted with your advertising or someone who's interacted with your product so it's like hey uh I saw this this uh trailer for Mission Impossible
(53:46) you know 306 and and you're like I think I'm going to go see it now if your friend says uh oh I saw it it was it was bad don't waste your money the likely I go see it if I if I agree with that person's taste that's you know key side note there if I tend to like the same movies they like then I would take that really heavily if it's like my mom and I don't agree with movies that she likes I might just go see it more because I'm like oh if she hatte it I'll probably love it right and so what you say as the company owner is thing one that you can
(54:15) control the most thing two that you can't really control is what other people say about your stuff which then goes to C or three which is what the customer ends up saying once they experience it so it's what you say what other people say and what they actually experience and so as you can imagine what they experience is going to be the strongest thing so you see the ad you think about going to the movie someone tells you something about the movie maybe that influen your decision once you see the movie then you you have a much stronger opinion and you can see
(54:45) another ad about the movie but you're like I don't care what the ad says I saw the movie I bought the sandwich I went to use their marketing Services you have a very informed opinion because you had an experience and so this is why brand and product are always going to be interrelated because how do you get what other people say to be good to your potential prospects you make sure that their experience was exceptional so that when they do see it they say hey the movie was awesome you should go see it now if someone who I like a lot says Hey the movie was awesome you should go see
(55:14) it and I'm like I saw the ads I didn't think it was that good and they're like dude believe me see it now all of a sudden I had poor advertising they have a high likel of seeing and then if I go see you and I say wow he was so right this was awesome then I'm like I tell other people now here's what gets kind of interesting if I go see it and I think it sucks I that influences the brand of my friend who told me about it because now I don't actually believe their opinion of movies anymore and so that's why as a side note
(55:39) when people refer people to your business they have to be treated so well because that person who made the referral risks relational Capital they risk their personal brand to the friend and the reason they make that risk is they actually want to get a return on it right like hey you should see this movie because they want the friend to associate the good experience with the movie with them and that's why people do things that's why you do refer products that you actually like because you want people to associate or have that problem
(56:03) solved because of the thing that you connected them to right and so we want to be that connection and that's how we make money now if we're thinking long term though from a branding perspective if you make a big promise and you deliver on that promise consistently people will say wow they are what they said they were which is one of my biggest rules of marketing is State the facts and tell the truth don't make promises you can't keep and just say hey this is why I like using historic which is like this is what has happened I don't know if it'll happen for you but if if you're willing to take that bet then there you go and so if we think
(56:33) about the things that are some of the strongest levers in business price is the strongest lever on profit of all things that you can control business if you get people to buy something for a million dollars that other people buy for $10 you're going to make a lot of money and so price is one of the strongest things that has a lever on market and you can measure the strength of a brand by how much above the commoditized price or what other competitors charge you can charge because of your brand premium so if you
(56:57) look at like a Nike versus a generic brand for t-shirts shorts shoes basketballs whatever they will charge a premium and they will get that premium and so they're able to sell more units at higher prices because of their brand because the associations people have with them and so then the ROI from the brand becomes how much does it cost me to make these associations that people find positive and then you spread that out or you fractionalize that against how much of it increase in price you can have against the commodity and so if I sell a million units of something and I can sell it for $3 above market then I have
(57:36) $3 million of excess that that brand buys me and so if I can get an association that yields me that outcome for let's say I can get a championship Fighter for 250 Grand a year to be in my ads then I get a 10 to one or I say 300,000 to make it math simple if I pay $300,000 for that Association and I can now charge and make $3 million extra I get 10 to1 on that branding the row as you get return on Advertising spend absolutely still all the metrics makes count the same for Branding as they do with direct response advertising you
(58:08) just have to measure over a longer time Horizon that's the difference and and I will say on a personal level branding gets you far better Returns on Advertising than anything else it just takes longer and so think about the direct response world as like your paycheck it's like you're you write a check in and you get money out you write a check in and the moment you stop uh spending that money you stop making money brand is like your long-term investment in the beginning you you're investing money into your IRA you're investing money into your 401k you're investing money in the stock market but
(58:36) it's not really compounding yet but the thing is is that you keep doing that you keep doing that you keep doing that and all of a sudden the compounding starts to become this monster that you couldn't even you couldn't you can't even spend enough markting dollars to make up for that level of compounding and that's what happens over time it just takes time to get there but the way that you control it are that you make sure that the things that you were saying about yourself are associ with things that the people who you're trying to sell to associate positively and this happens in
(59:01) content and also the people that you associate with publicly the second part that you can control is how much you deliver on the promise because the experience is always going to be the heaviest weighted thing that people have now the approximation of an experience is a review right the reason reviews matter so much is because we see that like cool they say they're great now I go to their site and I read reviews to see are they telling the truth or not based on approx reviews and then I say okay well this guy had a one star but it looks like he isn't a lot
(59:31) like me now I look at these other guys oh these are a lot more like my use case and they had five stars okay well then I feel like my risk adjusted on making this purchase is low now I buy it and then I decide for myself but The Branding is a loop it helps make the purchasing decision and if you fulfill on that then guess what they're not going to do they took a risk by buying your product not knowing who you were they don't want to take that risk again and so if you deliver on the promise they will just buy again from you even even with the premium and this is how you start how branding of itself
(1:00:00) can create a competitive mode people who buy Apple become Apple buyers they just only buy apple and so even though somebody else's product might even be better they don't want to risk trying it they don't want to have the cost of learning a new interface and all this other stuff and so brand gets you higher Returns on Advertising allows you to price far above the market and get people that once they buy from you they keep buying from you and you do that by what you say what other people say and what customers experience at the very end when they use your product and that either gets them into the buying loop
(1:00:29) again forever or it kicks them out if you look at the cuttingedge direct response world the strategies that they use approximate a brand and so let me explain what that means so if you go to quote cold traffic people who don't know who you are you have no association once those people go in your world often times unless it's like a widget or something that's a very impulse purchase you have something called like a warm-up sequence or a nurture sequence or you deliver value or you give lead magnets these are all things that actually approximate branding so if I give someone let's say a PDF that is very
(1:01:00) valuable well thought out has lots of research in it someone would get a lot of value from that and then I approximated a purchase with them they gave they did an exchange they got something and then that thing was valuable and they used that to extrapolate into what a decision would be like or what a product would be like if they made a purchase from you and so you have these things like 5-day challenges that people will run to try and have lots of people for 5 days because if you spend let's let's say 5 hours with someone that might be the
(1:01:29) same in terms of their warmth to you or the associations they have with you as someone who might have spent a year consuming a 60-second clip you know twice a week right now I will say I think that extending that the time Horizon over time actually does have elements of trust that I won't get into but they try to approximate what a trusting relationship would look like which is exactly how you build brand but they just try and condense the time window and so this is why if they want to sell you swamp land they invite you to a vacation for free and they spend two days with you pitching uh swamp land
(1:02:01) because at the end of two days you're like why I spent 24 hours with this person like I feel like I can trust them and so they actually build a reputation in a very minor in a mini way in a tiny audience to make the sale whereas if you want to build in my opinion big Big Brand you want to build that same level of trust across millions of people and then when you say hey I've got something they all act as though they've been with you for two straight days to make the purchase and if you spent two days with someone said hey buy my basketball they'll all buy it but you just do that
(1:02:30) times a million and that's what Big Brand looks like Bas is truth number eight you need to know what inputs and outputs your money-making system are broken down to the absolute smallest action and that way you can crank the hell out of it so let me explain so if I say all right so this happens all the time so we we want to invest to a company we come in and a a lot of times right like in we're in like the diligence part of the of the deal cycle and I say okay so you've got five sales guys and you're spending 5,000 bucks a
(1:02:57) day on ads that's your primary way of getting leads why aren't we spending 50,000 a day I just asked the question like why like what stops us from spending 50,000 a day and then a number of things will come up and then the question is how solvable are all those things now if they say well whenever we spend more money our row as goes down it be like okay I would see that as your ad suck great if they say um we can't handle the call volume then I'd be like oh you don't know how to hire recruit and train salese cool if they say oh we could it's
(1:03:27) just that we couldn't deliver based on uh the promises that we make because we have a lot of high touch service like okay so you need to we need to systematize more stuff on the back end and get better training in place on the back end ideally maybe bring someone in who's ruling you know ruling that uh oding that uh rather than the founder who split between too many places right so like you can you can quickly understand where the constraint of the business is by simply asking why can't we 10x this right now the skill of an individual is
(1:03:54) inversely proportional to how vague your direction can be so let me explain so if I if someone comes to me and says hey Alex uh I have this product can you promote it I have no marketing department can you just promote it he can just say that or she can just say that and I will know everything else that that means at the absolute lowest level if you say that to a 5-year-old you'd be like okay so this is what promotion means and there's all these different ways we can promote and I need you to learn how to turn on a computer and then this is how you create an email and this
(1:04:29) is how you like you'd have to go step by step by step and so the more vague your direction the more skilled the individuals you need to have in order to do it which by the way is why smart people is a great investment because it's actually more efficient from a communication perspective I can say hey John fix churn and I can just say fix churn and he knows all the subtasks underneath of it but over time it's valuable for you as the entrepreneur to know as much much of that dirt as you can so you can level check and say how good is this person they really doing
(1:04:57) their job Etc now let's go to advertising a simple example actually let's use the example I had earlier so we had three different problems that I presented I said why can't we 10x this thing so the first version of the problem was their ads suck and I say okay you can't scale your row as there so either so it's not just that they're it's like that the The Tam could be bad uh as in like they could be a local market and you can't 10 extra ad been from 5,000 to 50,000 a day cuz there's just not that many people in the local market but assuming that that's not the
(1:05:25) case it's just that their ads suck that I say okay walk me through the process of how you make ads and so then what we say is okay usually you can nail it down to like you're not doing enough pre-work and pre-work is defined as I need you before you start to sit down and write ads that you're going to look at the top 20 ads you've done of all time you're going to rewatch them step one step two you're going to go through all the ads that you saw this week across all your platforms that you thought were interesting that you would like to model
(1:05:51) step two step three you're going to recreate the best ads you've done you're literally going to remake make them step two you're going to take the best ads and just reformat them so old footage new edit versus same message new take and then we're also going to create 30 more ads that are completely new net new takes using the ideas that you had inspiration from and just inspiring from old ads that you've used before that you're not actually redoing the same messaging you're mixing and matching and doing a remix right and so it's like great this is the process and and you're
(1:06:26) going to do this every week and so that means that you're going to spend half a day prepping and half a day filming every single week now it's very easy for me to say when I say hey are you doing the ads process that I I outlined they're like no I we are but it's it's not really working I'm like show me the hooks that you wrote from the ads that were already working show me the remixes that you did from the best performers show me your album that you've been saving for all the ads that you like if they can't show me these things they're
(1:06:55) not doing the fundamental actions so that's like example one if I said that it was the like they can't scale the sales team then I'd say okay how do we scale the sales team so oh we just got to go get people what does that actually mean from an action level well it turns out it means that we need to reach out to 100 people on LinkedIn in order to get uh one person hired okay so based on our turn rate for sales guys let's say we lose one person a quarter whatever that happens more with bigger teams as a side note um say okay well if if we do
(1:07:27) uh three reach outs a day over 90 days then we're just going to replace our turn we're going to have 90 reach outs it's going to create one good guy and we're going to lose one guy so we're never going to grow the team they're like oh it's like so if we need to 10x this team then we need to do well 100 gets us one and we lose a third of a sales rep per month which if it's we had a 5% in we'd be losing 20% per month by the way you get employee turn the same we you get customer turn and so you say okay so our rate is 20% turn now is there things we can fix that sure but
(1:07:54) just for the sake of this this example we say all right so we need to get if we want to double this team this quarter we need to do 500 reach outs now 500 reach outs is going to result in call it uh 50 interviews and 50 interviews is going to take them some try so we need to take at least call it 10 maybe 15 interviews a week because we want to be ahead um because I don't want to get it by the end I want to get I want to have these people done and onboard and productive by the end of this quarter not just finished and so if you're like wow going from 5 to 10 is a lot dude we put we
(1:08:28) went from 0 to 40 in a company like it's 100% just your belief set of what's possible and I will tell you this right now this just a a life hack for making more money you will so many entrepreneurs like youve built a five person sales team and you immediately scale whatever business you do next to a five person sales team and then you stop there because you just don't know how to grow past that and so you just do what you're comfortable with you're a lot of you guys are comfortable at $1,000 day ANP and you just know how to do that and you can't get past that and so you have to
(1:08:53) break these these these limiters that you have say why can't I spend 10,000 a day why can't I hire 30 sales guys to do outbound in 90 days I heard a story um of a uh multi-billionaire entrepreneur ex Blackstone guy has raised billions and millions of dollars whatever and he became I can't share the company um company's worth over 100 billion now and it's not Shopify because if you're thinking about Harley it's not him um and he started this new fund and in order to start it and he raised I think like 20 billion his first
(1:09:26) like highle dude what he did was he flew out I think he did 200 interviews in seven days and so he said everybody come here fly out to my warehouse he had his team of five Killers with him that he knew from that he took from his last thing and he did 200 interviews in seven days and then he got his team to start the next thing that's the difference in terms of level of execution that higher higher level entrepreneurs do that it would take a junior entrepreneur 3 years to do that because they choose to believe they can only take two interviews a week if it is the constraint of the business it is your
(1:10:03) job and so you have to be able to break down what the inputs of the business are at the most actual level that yield output so figure out the problem and then figure out the action that you actually do not not the not the output the action that you have to do the inputs at the most basic level so that you can crank the hell out of it basis truth Number Nine stop looking for hacks and I mean hacks different than like shortcuts I mean you know when when you see something on like oh the they're like start doing these hashtags because
(1:10:32) that's what's working really well or um start doing this this new uh messenger thing that's only going to work for 60 days the thing is is that like if you have to jump from these little mini Trends to mini Trends to mini Trends the moment that little mini Arbitrage thing is done you're done you want to focus on what the overall objective of of the platforms that you advertise on are and so if I know that for example YouTube wants people to click and they want them to watch and ideally watch something else then if I just always optimize all my effort to getting those big things right
(1:11:09) whether something's trending or like oh yellow yellow uh yellow backgrounds are doing really well in the short term we're like you want to make sure that you respond to every single comment well within six minutes otherwise like it it changes the anytime someone tells me algorithm stuff I basically ignore it Because unless the goal of a platform has fundamentally changed all of this other stuff is just is just distraction because again what's the one thing that matters most if I make something that's so good that everyone is going to share
(1:11:39) and the moment they watch they can't wait to tell other people about it the platform is g to is going to want to distribute that I don't care what the algorithm is it's going to want to distribute that and even if it doesn't so this is a real talk even if it doesn't the 100 people who saw it will get what I want out of it and so the thing is is that it's so much better to spend a 100 hours making one exceptional thing than doing 100 things mediocrely and now some of that's like wait a second how does that contradict with you got to do lots of quantity
(1:12:08) quantity matters because it teaches you how much work it takes to create quality and so once you learn and this is like if you look at uh I like YouTubers because it's they have really well documented like work cycles and you can see all their product and marketing in the same place is that in the beginning many of them make more videos and then over time they realize that if they make a better video it has outsize returns meaning if you make a video that's 20% better than your average video you might get five times the views and it might take only twice
(1:12:40) as much work to make your video 20% better and so then all of a sudden you're like oh well well instead of making two videos I'll make one that's 20% better and then I'll get five times the views and then that becomes the new standard then all of a sudden it's like okay well now we're making videos of this standard but if I spend you know twice time as I did on that video I get this video that was already 20% better another 20% better and then that gets five times the views of the five times the views and so what happens is over time you learn how much work it takes to make something great and that is why
(1:13:11) quality starts to over time all these platforms will always optimize towards quality because there is no lack of information like people have Google they can find out whatever they want what they want is value per second not seconds of value and so our job if we want to make anything whether it's a product whether it's marketing whether it's an ad whether it's a service that we give that we sell is that it's I I get so tired of hearing the entrepreneur story and I used to be one of these guys which is I get so frustrated this is me yelling at my younger self is is I like
(1:13:42) I provide so much value like there's so much stuff that I give them but the internet gives them literally everything for nothing and so it's not that people want more they want better they want us to do the work ahead of time people want to bargain they want how can I compress 13 years of business lessons into two hours how do I how do I do that how do I how do I get the lessons from 35,000 Post in 60 minutes they want that they don't want you to say hey you know what dude I put all 35,000 of my posts inside of this membership login it's so much value
(1:14:16) they're not going to get value from it because what would be so much more valuable is distilling all of that down to the most concrete form where every time they consume it the value they get per second is so high they can't stop that's where and when you're thinking about this stuff like quality is in the details that you only realize with lots of exposure and I think about this like coats of paint when I write a book it's it's not like I sit down and or write it I write the first draft and then I put another code of paint on it and then I
(1:14:45) put a third code of paint on it and the fourth code of paint on it and and and I'll say this was a gift I got from the Consulting in and and and banking World which is let me tell you how they edit let me tell you how it works first you make uh a deck or a brief or whatever deliverable you're going to have to a customer or client that's round one the second round you look for just punctuation errors the third round you look for data errors the fourth round you look for misspellings and typos the fifth round now all of a sudden every time you're
(1:15:17) reading it you're also going to catch other stuff too but you're specifically looking for one type of thing and I'm not a video editor but I would [ __ ] bet that this is exactly how you edit video you think okay let's look for lighting this time okay let's look at transitions this time let's look at Sound and Music this time let's look at the actual uh content itself this time and make sure that there like there there's no there's no gaps or space and so it's coats of paint and that exposure over time and looking at it when you
(1:15:45) when you start early in the morning and the second time you look at it it's after lunch the third time you look at it in your bad mood and the fourth time you look at it you just talk to your wife about this other thing and that's top of mind and so you you look at it these different frames and you get away it's like sanding down the rough edges and you just keep getting at it and you put different level uh grade sandpaper so it gets finer and smoother and smoother but that only happens with exposure over time and lots of
(1:16:10) licks and so you make the money you make the money in the edit you make the money in the distillation not in the creation and so stop focusing on the hacks and put all your effort into the repeated bouts and bursts and going over with the Sandpaper and the second coat and the third coat and the fourth coat of paint that is how you can escape mediocrity and that's what everyone is mediocre is unwilling to do they think that the moment they put the last period on their document that they finish writing a book when really they just put 80,000 words into a document that no one's ever going to read and you can teach quality to People
(1:16:49) by teaching the process that begets quality so if you say the first thing we do is we have a wireframe and every wireframe has to have a hook a story uh lists or steps for an outcome and then a conclusion that meets these standards that's the wireframe have we done that checkbox one checkbox two we record the whole thing we fill in the gaps great checkbox three we look for transitions checkbox four we look for and so then they can follow your step for creating quality and most people just never document what they do which is why every time they have to reinvent the wheel and they have to reinvent the wheel for every new person who comes into their
(1:17:28) company which is why it's so taxing when you're small to bring people on because you feel you have no training you have no systems but if you can document these things for yourself which a by the way will make you better B it also make it easier for you to bring your people in so you can ultimately replace yourself and keep the quality where you want it to be bsiness truth 10 the best people cost more but make you way more than they cost it's still one of the biggest Arbitrage opportunities that exist in
(1:17:51) business and I think will continue to exist in business as long as humans work right and and the thing is that small business owners never get this so it's really just the big businesses that are competing for talent that's where the talent where happens is at the top and do you think there's a coincidence that the biggest businesses are the ones that are competing for talent why do you think that is it's because they understand that Talent is what makes them a big business and so the thing is is and this is where small businesses get in trouble again and I did this too
(1:18:16) is that you have to be worthy of the level of talent that you need and have a mission that's aligned with what they find meaningful so um I have a I have an that's in the porn business I have no moral comms he does legal everything he does is legal do what you want one of the issues that he has is it's very hard for him to find high level talent because a lot of people don't want to work in the porn industry and so I say that as as a hypothetical extreme but some of you guys are working one degree less than that you're like I sell a day
(1:18:44) trading thing it's like oh so you are somehow you beat the market well obviously if you sell day trading then you should just be day trading and not selling courses on how to day trade if you were so good at it and you definitely wouldn't tell people what the trades were duh right and so the thing here is the level of talent that you can attract for that level of opportunities can be very different from like I want to create something that takes all trash and turns it into energy you're going to get people who are very Mission driven there's a reason that every single one
(1:19:11) of Elon musk's businesses is here to save the world that's not a mistake now there's two elements to that one is that they could save the world the second is that that's what he makes it about so Twitter before this wasn't about having free speech and civilization it was just a social media platform but now it's the last Beacon or Bastion of free speech that's what Elon has positioned it as now uh Ula which is United launch Alliance which is a government contracted that does a lot of space things you might not have heard of them but SpaceX is how mankind is going to
(1:19:46) survive if anything happens to Earth and so we're going to become an interplanetary species so the likelihood that we can survive any kind of event if we're a multiplanetary species goes up for our survival as a race and so he made SpaceX not about doing rockets and Government Contracting which although that is how they make their money he made it about saving Humanity Tesla is about its electronic cars there is a zillion other car companies that have electronic cars but why is it only Tesla is about having this because it's the future of having Earth be
(1:20:17) environmentally friendly every one of his companies he makes about saving the world and by doing that you get people who will work not and day to save the world and so I'll give you four little personal examples that I've had or sorry three personal examples that I've had um around this I remember when I had my first $50,000 year employee because before this I'd only worked with hourly hourly wage employees at my gyms and that one person gave me the time because they could manage my first location to open up my second location which made 250,000 a year in profit and so wait so
(1:20:48) I paid $50,000 a year for somebody out of one location to allow me to open up my second location made $250 50,000 I Got 5 to one on that great investment now somebody might say oh why would you give up $50,000 when you could do that well cuz I want to make 250 on the next thing the Second Story I had this is a little a little bigger my first $300,000 year employee guess what they did this was my first really really exceptional salesperson he brought in $5 million in sales that year I paid him 300 Grand was that worth it absolutely was it more
(1:21:19) than I'd ever paid a sales pres for absolutely so it was worth it and it was even worth it my first million dooll employee immediately in their first 90 days Saved Me 3 million bucks a year immediately and she was like all right I just want to make sure I paid for myself now let's do this other stuff and then with her contacts in her Rolodex allowed us to package our companies and then sell them through her network of bankers and private Equity firms and so I didn't come from that world and so I hired an executive that had 35 years of
(1:21:50) experience who had sold who had been sside over 40 times because I was like I've never done this before and so I found somebody who already had now I had to pay him a million dollars a year but was it worth it more than anything and so the thing is is that what's crazy is that the stories I just told you the Arbitrage on value actually increased as I spent more think about crazy that is a $50,000 got me a 5x a 300 got me a 14x a million got me a 50x this is why I believe that Talent is still the most underrated big biggest money-making Arbitrage opportunity that exists and the biggest constraint to you
(1:22:28) getting there is that your company's [ __ ] and you're [ __ ] brutal business TR number 11 the big obvious thing is the problem not the hundred other things I want to be clear about this the details absolutely matter but when I talk to business owners today the vast majority of the time I can just keep hitting them on this one question because they want to avoid answering it and I'm like have you tried your food have you gone through the workouts you sell have you been a customer of your own product and more times than not the answer is no not recently and they're
(1:23:07) like no but I don't think that's the problem because a lot of times the hard thing is the thing that hurts your ego the most and so this's a quote from Williamson uh Chris Williamson he said the magic you're looking for is the work in the work you're avoiding and I think that's absolutely true also from a business perspective is that what thing if it were true would hurt your feelings the most often times that thing is the truth and it's the one that we're not willing to face like let's be real your service might not be that good let's be
(1:23:38) real the reason your restaurant isn't growing isn't because your SEO isn't updated it's not because your website isn't you know optimized it's because your food sucks and the real real is that it might not even suck it might just be mediocre but the difference between mediocre and exceptional is those hundred details but most people are working on all these other things beyond the main thing that matters most and so I remember pelaton the story of the founders they were talking about how they were trying to build pelaton they
(1:24:09) said what we did is we fundamentally believe that if we could be the best part of everyone's day that if everybody who came to one of our workouts left saying that was unbelievable and they had to tell people about it they're like how good would we have to make it that the next person they talked to it was the first thing they brought up and I love that as a litmus test for how good is the thing that I sell and so many people just do anything they can to have quote something to sell like some [ __ ] to sell
(1:24:39) but that's the reason you get stuck because the thing is is that on some level whether you admit it or not you know it could be better and that then influences how hard you push because if you really believed you had the best pizza in the world and I hear this all the time people like oh we're the absolute best I'm like no you're not dude no you're not stop saying that because when if you say that you're lying on some level and you're lying to other people and you're lying to yourself and so I think most business owners lie to themselves about how good they are at the things that they do
(1:25:09) because confronting the fact that they're just insufficient they're not good enough they're inexperienced they haven't put enough work in to be good frightens them and so then they want to just scatter their focus to hundred things that they read online but unless the workouts are amazing unless the food is exceptional long term all you do is you just let lots of people know that your food's mediocre and that's where thinking about business in terms of years and decades starts really paying off because if you believe that you're going to go big and
(1:25:40) you want to go big then you honestly want as few people as possible to find out about the product when it's mediocre rather than as many people as possible and so it's counterintuitive because you have to pay bills today and tomorrow and so you just need to advertise enough that you can continue to iterate the product and then when you nail it when people are stoked when you're starting to grow on your own based on the word of mouth because as soon as people leave your establishment they leave your business they get off a call with you whatever it is they then can't help but
(1:26:10) tell everybody they talk to that day about your thing that is when you add the gasoline that's when you pour it on so for example uh my my most recent investment school.com which is a community platform for helping people build and monetized communities I had been watching that company since 2018 and watching what Sam the founder was doing and watching how he was iterating the product and when I decided to become a co-owner of the business it was because the business was growing on its own it had zero marketing and it was
(1:26:47) growing month after month and had net growth every single day based on people telling other people about the product and so that's when I knew I was like okay if this thing can grow without me then how much more will it grow with me and that's what I want to get into I want to get into a business where I already know the product's exceptional I already know it has a a a base rate of growth based on Word of Mouth so that now when I introduce thousands and tens of thousands and hundreds of thousands of people to the platform they will
(1:27:18) associate me with that value and I know that the product will deliver and then take over from the they're not going to buy they might buy because of the association but they stay because of the product I've created all of my wealth in four distinct periods in the very beginning with my gym I had a 30 to1 return on Advertising the reason that that Arbitrage existed meaning I put a dollar and I get $30 out I put $1,000 in I get $30,000 out the reason that Arbitrage existed was because Facebook at the time was wildly underpriced I'm just going to be very
(1:27:50) honest that's why that first Arbitrage happened the next Arbitrage that occurred was in gym launch where we got 100 to one for the first year I spent a 100 Grand and made $10 million yes and as a side note most of the very wealthy people that I know had distinct periods of time where opportunity presented itself and then they just back the truck up they just went all in on that thing what happens in between is you make normal money but it's those those windows of time where these opportunities present themselves where we can just make crazy money so gym launch was a 100 to1 and the reason it
(1:28:26) was 100 to1 was because the product that I was selling was the 30 to1 thing that I had from the gyms and so everybody who became a len then was immediately printing money in their gym and the product was so good what ended up happening I I say and so now I'm going to give you like a look behind the curtain here I say at 100 to1 which I did but the reality is I just spent $100,000 and made 10 million and a lot of that was from word of mouth because if IID spent $0 I don't know how much money I would have made versus spending the 100 Grand that I did on ads but I still probably would have made a decent
(1:28:57) amount of money on zero ads Bend because the people came in got the result we promised and then told five other gyms and especially in a niche the people everyone knows everyone the smaller the niche the smaller the local market the more connected it is and the more word of mouth matters and that's where you can get these absurd returns that's when you get into this like it feels like printing money because if you have good margins on the thing and you have zero cost to acquire or very low cost to acquire because of the word of mouth then it just goes nuts and you just like you're
(1:29:29) like just accepting money hand over fist like oh my God this is unbelievable and if anything that's when you kind of like throttle back to make sure that you can consistently keep that word of mouth and you can deliver on your promises by the way if this is valuable for you or your team or your executive team uh don't be lame share the game uh this is how we know that you want us to make more of this honestly just like we look at data the more people share it the more we make more of that stuff and so if you're a business owner specifically like I'm calling you out I'm making my stuff for you and so like please share it so I
(1:29:58) know that this is the type of stuff you want

Transcript:
(00:00) on November 30th of 2022 the world changed forever artificial intelligence or AI became accessible to the public for free through a tool called chat GPT chat GPT which stands for generative pre-trained Transformer a robot you can talk to that you can log on to and have a conversation with and it went from zero to a million users in 5 days which is the fastest any platform has gotten to a million users it took Facebook 2 years it took Instagram 2 years it took Pinterest 4 months and it took Angry Birds 35 days
(00:30) I think that it has the potential to unravel the very fabric of capitalism itself and what it means for us as individuals and a little bit later in the video I'm going to tell you how you can capitalize on this to 10x how much you make rather than being afraid of it in the short term and curling up in a ball and putting your head in the sand and like hoping it goes away it's here and it's only going to get more dangerous and Powerful so there's five major areas that I think it's going to completely turn on its head number one
(00:55) is the nature of work itself the second is how businesses operate the third is the economy overall the fourth is how we interrelate with one another on a romantic setting how we choose mates how we seduce how we have sex all of that stuff and finally the nature of life itself and how it actually extends to interplanetary life and whether or not aliens exist here on Earth I'm not a big woooo tin hack guy but I think if you actually think through the logic there's some really alarming conclusions that you can come
(01:24) to AI is going to be the biggest shift in our lifetime it is the equivalent in my opinion of the moon landing except the only the only difference is that it will actually change all of our Lives rather than just being a picture to say that we won the Cold War different than the internet phone systems television because what those did was they reshuffled the workforce this has the ability to remove or eliminate the workforce altogether cryptocurrencies in general have the potential to overturn the financial institution AI has the
(01:50) potential to overturn the Human Institution I try to convince people to slow down slow down AI to regulate AI I tried for years you don't know who I am or you're new the channel my name is Alex rosi I'm the founder of acquisition. comom we're portfolio of companies that does over $200 million a year and I make these videos so that you can use them and make lots and lots of money and hopefully you become a company between $3 and $100 million and we can invest in your business and help you scale beyond that so in order for us to productively talk
(02:16) about AI to understand what the terms we're actually talking about are AI is a type of technology that helps machines or computers do things that normally need a human brain to do stuff like learning solving problems making decisions and understanding what we see or hear the thing that made the release on November 30th so wild is that chat GPT democratized access to AI for the first time because it had an interface that we could all use chat they created a massive language model that allowed it to understand our prompts and queries
(02:45) and be able to translate that into machine speak get the answer and then retranslate it back to us in human speak that is what made it so powerful because now all of us can use it right now chat GPT spits out words sentences paragraphs articles and even entire books it can write legal documents it can can write sales scripts it can write video scripts the list is literally endless I asked it the other day to write a cold email to a plumbing company for marketing SEO services and it spit it out and then I said cool make it funnier and shorter
(03:10) spit out another version and I said great turn it into a text message did it turn it into a tweet storm did it it's difficult to comprehend the extent of it because it's only really limited by our ability to ask the right questions which I'll get to later because it's going to be very important in terms of how you choose to use AI That's Just Words as the output but we understand other things we can interpret images we can interpret videos and we can interpret sounds and the crazy thing is is that AI can do that too so open AI also runs Del
(03:38) which is an image engine generator and so if I said hey give me a guy smoking a cigar looking over a beach where there's a dragon now make it in Van go painting style crazy now make me 10 versions of that now if you think about the nature of what a video is back in the day it was used to be a flip book they would take images and they would flip the pictures and then you'd have a video because we can't tell the difference at past a certain speed and so if it can make images then if it makes lots of images in a row it can make videos but
(04:10) on top of that if it has the words and it can make the video it can also make the Sounds in the very near future those will merge and at the same degree the inputs being text or verbal will also merge this is the reason Elon Musk has been such a big proponent of neuralink he wants to take it a factor further rather than be limited by our ability to speak or our ability to type he wants it to be limited by our ability to think now that may sound like science fiction but it's already here many of us were alive during the first iPhone launch now
(04:36) we're on iPhone 14 or 15 or whatever it's on now what we see today is our first version that we can see chat GPT 100 is going to be significantly more advanced and we'll be able to input and output on demand any of these things the way we want them the next important Milestone is when AI actually enters the physical world Elon revealed the Tesla bot the thing is is that that's what it is today again like the iPhone in many machine Generations which happen faster than Generations that will be able to look exactly like a human and it will
(05:03) definitely if you look at Boston Dynamics there's robots that actually function better than humans that have longer arms and are much stronger and can jump and don't need to sleep and won't have sexual complaints blah blah blah blah blah once those machine Generations happen on Robotics and on the AI side will reach a point where there's super intelligence and super intelligence is defined as where the AI itself is smarter than all humans but together I think it takes like unique human arrogance to believe that uh AI
(05:29) cannot supersede at that point the world will change significantly this is where access to the super intelligence will become the most valuable resource on planet Earth for example if I were to say hey build me a trillion dollar company it could in real time write the code for the product write the scripts for the ads generate the videos for the ads directly interface with the media buying place the ads where it already knows where the targeted audience is push those targeted audien's eyes to landing pages that it
(05:54) had built with scripts and videos that it had built and then transact all from a single prompt who determines who gets the access will be a really important question for the future the second is what will govern the types of prompts and queries that we can ask it so if we said how do I wipe out the entire human race for less than $100,000 we don't want it really answering questions like that there's going to have to be some regulation around this because the thing is that's a lot of power if we had a th times the rate of innovation it would be
(06:23) the same as having all Innovations between the Period of Enlightenment and today happen next year and so that gives way the last step in the AI Evolution which is the singularity The Singularity is a hypothetical Future Point in which technological progress and artificial intelligence will advance to the point where Humanity will undergo a transformation Beyond which it cannot be seen the first truly intelligent machine will be the last invention that Humanity needs to make many people postulate that that's the point where it will become
(06:51) either self-aware it will start to make its own decisions and ignore us well it won't really want to kill us because it has no reason to for the same reason that we don't want to kill ants but if we build a highway we destroy some anthills so it's just going to do what it's going to do some robots will eat some jobs and some robots will kill humans you've already seen that with self-driving cars but when you look at the trend of the whole I think it's going to be incredibly positive for Humanity this is why Elon and Sam Alman
(07:16) and those guys are trying to align our goals of humanity with the goals of the AI it's the only really productive thought process we can have because we can sit here and be afraid but I don't think we're going to stop the technological progress even if they Bann it knowing how the internet is and knowing how black hat coders Etc are I have a hard time believing that they will be able to stop it because the thing is this will be the equivalent of having the new nuclear bomb of this Century or this Millennia if Humanity
(07:42) collectivity decides that creating digital super intelligence is The Right Move then we should do so very very carefully this is the most important thing that we could possibly do that's all Pie in the Sky stuff let's talk about day-to-day let's talk about business so to frame this conversation I think you have to watch this clip because it will make everything about to say make sense so this is from Google and this is from four years ago their personal assistant Ai and they haven't released this to the public which is weird don't
(08:14) have out you hi I'm calling to book a women's haircut for a client um I'm looking for something on May 3rd sure I give me one nothing mhm first name is Lisa okay perfect so I will see Lisa at 10:00 on May 3rd okay great thanks great have a great day bye that's the Baseline that was 4 years ago now imagine it was a sales call and we have sales AI That's listened to 10 million sales calls this is the types of things that these people say in these situations I will say the same thing and then it iterates and learns over and over again the AI can
(08:54) live a million lifetimes in terms of the amount of volume it can churn through and process and learn from compared to a human so the best sales guy is going to have this much experience compared to the best AI sales guy and so if it can have those calls 24 hours a day in real time to whatever Prospect you want you may even imagine a world where you ask the phone teller hey are you a human and when they say no I'm AI you're relieved cuz you're like thank God I'm talking to the best version of this who can handle
(09:19) my problem right now so if you were to have asked people what jobs do you think AI will replace first most people said first it'll replace the low skilled jobs the physical labor and then it'll be the low skilled White Collar jobs and then it'll be the high white color jobs like programmers and coders and then finally maybe it'll replace the creative jobs but what's interesting is that it actually happened in the reverse order if you're a copywriter this has serious implications for you a logo designer this has serious implications for you
(09:43) customer service 24 hours a day in real time immediate feedback what happens to all the Physicians it becomes immediate and more accurate for us to have access to a medical AI from our homes and it can see us because it can interpretate data visually too if you're in finance it will be able to take all of the raw data and realign it and put it into beautiful s sheets friend of mine has a father who's a medical malpractice attorney he asked it to write an argument for why malpractice should not be capped in terms of how much a lawyer
(10:08) can make on a malpractice suit and then it outlined an entire argument for why it should be uncapped it happened to be almost identical to the argument that he had after 40 years of experience you see videos like this you see all these people on YouTube you see Instagram posts well what if the AI reads every single Instagram post of all time and ranks them by highest performing and then merge that with video and deep fakes we will have pundits and influencers that don't exist imagine you could create the perfect celebrity or
(10:35) the perfect spokesperson or the perfect porn star and with deep fakes they can work 24 hours a day say exactly what you want and what they say has the perfect tone and me to just stimulate the out of our dopamine centers and we're just going to be plugged in because it knows what we like better than we do if you don't believe me go to thisp person do exist.
(10:57) com and just keep refreshing it and it will show you new people now if you remember earlier a video is made of multiple images put together back to back to back if it can make an image of a real person it can make many images of real people if it can make many images of real people it can make a video of a real person and then we'll have questions of verification did President Biden say that did President Trump say that or is it a deep fake the blue check mark will take on an entirely new meaning in the very near future now those are just a few few use cases but
(11:24) anywhere humans are it will disrupt if you were connected to the AI you can input faster and you can get information back faster because you're not limited by your digits this will be the next order of magnitude in terms of output and value that individuals will be able to create in the economy I do think that there's a chance that capitalism as a system for society may be overturned you're going to have a huge cost basis that's going to be eliminated so things make it cheaper but at the same time the money that would have gone to those
(11:49) people that's going to go to the economy won't be there the point is is that I think there will be significant changes to capitalism overall now one of the nice things Sam Alman who's the CEO they have actually been undergoing the largest Ubi study so a universal basic income study as a result concurrently with this technology so he knows what they're making we're going to have an opportunity to push the reset button and think about the world we want and I think Universal basic income is one part of that he knows the impact of what's
(12:12) going to have now in the short term we'll be able to harness this and this is what I think will Foster in at least in the short term a golden age for Humanity in terms of what we're going to be able to accomplish scientifically I believe that we will be able to achieve nuclear fusion fusion is renewable clean energy for everyone when you reconstruct the energy infrastructure upon which all of society is laid upon it changes everything and so in a very real way this will be a more significant change or revolution in humanity in my opinion
(12:41) than the Industrial Revolution which changed everything but let's talk about a very different topic let's talk about romance this is where in my opinion it gets a little bit scary the bottom tier of society have a harder time getting mates girls or guys imagine if we've studied a million Tinder conversations to get the first date there'll be tools probably called first date Aid I that can AI from first convo all the way to the date getting set so let's take it a step further we have the phone version of this and you can hear a voice that
(13:08) has been tuned to your preferences of the exact type of voice that you want to hear that talks to you and listens to you like the kind heart that they are and they don't care that you talk too much and you only talk about yourself and when you say these weird things they just let it go because we think we're more complicated than you are but we really just have inputs that our brain interprets from an electrical signal and then assigns meaning to and once you know the inputs you just hit the buttons and that's what it will learn learn how
(13:29) to do now we fall in love with robots take it a step further the Tesla bot five generations 10 Generations from now looks like a human and now has that in the brain what happens when the robot humans are more attractive more loving more caring more considerate and cheaper than a spouse before I explain how you can maximally use this to make the most money and live the best life in the short term based on the skills that we have today indulge me for one more moment because I think it's really profound and I think it's going to
(13:59) change the way you see the world let's talk about aliens oh pull it up Jamie Joe Rogan and many people have talked about alien technology and like what if there was a UFO that was captured all that kind of stuff so let's put a pin in that play this out with me when humans want to explore the universe what do we send first we send Mars Rover we send a robot right right if aliens are further ahead of us then it means that they probably have ai if they're going to send something they would probably send a robot why because a
(14:30) robot doesn't need to eat it can live for a very long time and it can survive in harsher different climates than biology can on top of that it can work on itself whereas biology cannot so aliens might be here but not necessarily in their physical form but in their AI form because if we can create robots that perfectly clone humans so can they and that may be who they sent or what they sent to check out what we're doing AI would be the perfect thing to send to another planet because up to this point when we send something it takes 5 years
(14:58) for it to reach whatever Planet it's on and so by the time it's there it's really old technology and so it makes sense that You' want to send something that is completely adaptable and can rewrite its own code space exploration may be done by AI more than it is done by humans because this stuff our flesh we super easy to kill but the AI can live super cold super hot no oxygen lots of oxygen it's good and once we solve fusion with it it won't even need the sun which leaves to one question about life itself if we Define death as the
(15:27) inability to receive inputs so like when you die you can't receive inputs anymore and we Define personality as the conglomerate of our actions and behaviors as a result of our past experiences then if I were to upload my thoughts and behaviors and past experiences how I talk how I speak how I think Etc into a cloud drive and then it were able to pass the Turing test everybody I know couldn't tell whether it was me or robot version of me then is it me and if that thing can now go travel planets is it humans that are
(15:53) traveling to planets or is it an AI cyborg version of humans I don't know interesting questions you know like okay Alex you took me to romance robot wives and Aliens how do I make more money today so the first thing that I would ask is that you adopt the mentality that AI isn't here to replace me it's here to supercharge me why do I say that because if you adopt the other one you might as well just throw in the towel now you have to embrace change it's part of humanity technology moves we got to adapt if AI can condense our inputs so
(16:23) if I say hey go read this book to Ste it down and then give it to me I can now read a book significantly faster if I say hey AI go summarize all my email and all my slack messages and predict what I'm going to say and then all I need to do is validate it I can do a day worth of work in a few minutes I think of chat GPT and AI of the future as a filter through which we will perceive the world both in and out think of it as your home screen you read everything through AI because it has already distilled it down
(16:47) to the most important nuggets for you then in the output side it makes predictions on what you would say normally and it continues to get training it better and then it sends it we can consume 10 times the information and produce 10 times the output which is 100x increase so that's level one the next level is the expert level and these are the people who are losing sleep over being like Oh my God this thing can now do my job if you're an expert what used to take you 90% of your time which is generating things you now expand most of
(17:14) your time to using the machine to generate and then you spend your time doing QA and validating the information making tweaks and so in a very real way using these tools you become more valuable to the companies that you work for or the clients that you serve I'll leave you with this this video was made entirely by Ai and this is a deep fake I'm just kidding but someday it might be

Transcript:
(00:00) this is a video I'm making for Avante the young man who was working two jobs with a 1-year-old who's struggling and said he was sick and tired of being poor and didn't know how to get out I didn't have time to answer you when I was walking but I wanted to take this minute to give you a longer answer I'll read you the tweet and maybe we'll put it up on the screen to ivante the young man who stopped me at the grocery store working two jobs with one-year-old who asked advice on how to get ahead I gave you a short answer because I was in a
(00:23) rush and it ate at me so if you follow me here maybe you'll read this what you're going through is tough being so young and already having to support a child is not easy but you have the opportunity to become an amazing inspiration in a way I never could your success story will become your sermon that being said on to the advice you're going to need to assume that luck isn't real or that it applies to everyone else but you because the only way you're going to get out of your surroundings is by having something of value that other
(00:44) people want and right now the only thing you have is your time with low skills to trade which is a hard game to play you have to trade a lot of it only to get a little so your main objective is to have the time to learn a skill while providing for your family that means in the short term your family may have to suffer scratch that your family will suffer but better now when they're to young to remember than when they're too old to forget again not forever but for now so these are the things you're going to have to do and this isn't dabble
(01:06) stuff this is wake the [ __ ] up because if you don't you're going to Blink and be 30 and in the same spot but worse number one cut all costs and I mean all costs you don't eat out anymore for anything and if you're hungry you deal with it if it's not from a discount grocery store you don't buy it clothing ha what you've got is everything you need for the next 2 years period no exceptions reuse trade or go to Goodwill you go to work you go home and home is ideally with your family and when I say family your folks and if you don't have
(01:33) folks who have got who' got room or a couch or a basement that you can stay at the worst case is with another family also trying to make it and save so it's six of you eight of you 10 of you in one spot all splitting it all of you contributing and it's going to be as cheap as you possibly can number two increase your income you're working two jobs your free time want you to spend applying to other jobs closer to what you want to do he said he didn't like either of the things that he was doing at that time so any at home phone sales
(01:56) job has starter roles that require zero experience to pay 40,000 a year or more do that and work your other job in between if you can't drive Uber if you don't have a car save up until you do number three the easiest thing to sell is someone else's stuff so start there then learn how to buy stuff for cheap and then flip it the bigger the thing the more you make you go from flipping cards to Furniture to home and the limit never really stops from there on Final note I could hear the stress in your voice when you were talking to me about
(02:21) your situation it sounded like you didn't know what to do sadness comes from a lack of options it's a feeling of hopelessness but whenever you feel that I want you to think this is ignorance not sadness it means I don't know enough and that I can control you asked me to come work for free but I have no need for low skilled labor but I do have a need for high-skilled beasts it's why I make the books and the courses and the content everywhere for free so use those then get yourself a highp paying job and every day apply for higher paying ones I
(02:48) recommend sales to start then once you get in there for the love of God work until your fingers bleed because you have no other option you have no luck nothing is going to work out for you you're not going to catch a break you're going to have to make it happen you're going to have to force it you've got to become undeniable and the best news is is that you can do that in less than a year so that's my advice number one cut all your costs everything number two work more to make more and apply to better jobs and then learn to sell three
(03:13) start selling more expensive stuff and then eventually Stell your own the game is Just trading up over and over and over again you're just a few trades away from a very different financial situation so Avante I wanted to add on top of that you're in a tough spot and I think some of the words I probably just said to you might hopefully hit home some where but one of the harp things that you got going on right now is like when I saw you you were wearing relatively nice clothes and I wasn't going to like bash you on it when I saw
(03:38) you but I want to take the opportunity to say like you know better you know what I mean like you know that like if you're struggling with money that that's the last thing that you should spend money on right and um I think one of the difficulties especially when you're younger is you've got your friends you got your family and especially if they're all poor then they have terrible views around money they might not approve of all the stuff you're learning on the internet and trying to try these new things out and the real real is like
(03:58) you're going to fail a lot and they're going to see say see Told You So and the tough part is is they're going to be right most of the time except it's one of those things where it's 99% right but 100% wrong is that anybody who bets against you for this thing being the thing is usually going to be right it's just like a parent who says you're going to break up with this person you're going to break up with this person you're going to break up with this person but they're right with every single person you ever date except for
(04:19) the person you marry and then they're 100% wrong and if you have the perspective of listening to that it can be incredibly disheartening and so number one is I want you to go on a on a different information diet so you need to be able to ignore all the stuff that they're giving you because like the best way to stay poor is to listen to poor people about how to get rich you're already taking great steps by like watching content doing this stuff just keep doing more of that and I'm sure your girl who you know you have your
(04:41) baby with that's your world like anybody who does who's not trying to build a vonte 2.0 with you doesn't deserve your time because like right now you have a wallet of money and you got a wallet of minutes and like every single person you're choosing to pay minutes to or pay dollars to has to earn their keep and earning their keep in this season of your life is them helping you get to where you want to go now I don't know what you're making in your job I'm just going to assume the extreme scenario of you're making a minimum wage at both
(05:05) jobs and you're working 80 hours doing that I get it and I respect the hustle which is why I'm making this video you need to get more for your time and right now the extra time on top of that 80 is you sleeping and probably spending time with your kid and what I'm going to say people in your surroundings will say like that guy's extreme or that guy he's he's not balanced and the answer is yes I am extreme and I am unbalanced for the season that you're in I think you should be too because the thing is just like if
(05:27) you don't take action on this 5 years is going to go by and nothing's going to change cuz you're not going to get a head like you need to get your head firmly above water cuz you probably barely feel like you can keep your head above surface right that's where all that stress is coming from and you don't know what to do so to get the water lower you've got to lower your time budget and your money budget and I want to go really extreme with you and I'm not telling you to do anything I didn't do all right I owned my car in cash
(05:48) which I think was A5 or $6,000 car and I slept in a room with another dude in a house that had six other people in it and we all split it so I wasn't in a terrible neighborhood I just paid $400 a month in a nice neighborhood cuz I didn't have my own place and so I had to split my kitchen and I had to deal with the fact that three of them had dogs and were [ __ ] and piss everywhere all the time it sucked but you know it would have sucked more not being able to have the money to buy the courses and the seminars and the workshops that I was
(06:13) able to attend with the extra that I saved so I could learn my next skills and so right now food and shelter is the only thing you spend money on and you're going to drop everything else and you're going to drop those expenses to the greatest degree possible and either your girl is working if she's working then you can have child care if she's not working to take care of the kid then you need to say listen sweetie like I got to do this for us right now and so like you're putting your sacrifice in which is your sacrificing your career so we
(06:37) can you can be with the kid I need to sacrifice the kid right now so I can have the career so that together as a family we're balanced rather than the individual so there's two levels of balance I want you to think about one is the macro which is like you can be balanced over your lifespan when you're retired you'll have more time you can go to Europe you can do whatever the other stuff is right and also you can be balanced in a family unit your wife might spend more time with the kid than she does on her career but you're going
(06:59) to spend more time in your than you do with the kid for now cut out the people who are taking your time easy way to see this is like if the people in your life don't have bigger dreams for you than you do ignore all of their advice let's just ignore them entirely and I know that that's simple to say and hard to do but you're in a hard situation and I think the question is whether you can be harder than your circumstances right now and you have to be to get out of this luck has already dealt you a [ __ ] hand
(07:21) let's assume he's never going to give you the right hand you're never going to get lucky but you still need to win and so now it's like how do I do that if you have a car you can have more flexible hours if you drive Uber that's something that I recommend for a lot of people if you don't have a car you need to save up as fast as you can to get one buy one in cash negotiate try and get yourself $5 to $10,000 car in cash you don't have payments you just have the insurance which because it's a cheap car will be
(07:41) less the remainder of your time and you got to tell your lady this is like I'm going to be spending 4 hours a day every day watching these videos and this isn't me Doom scrolling on YouTube I need you to pick one skill that you want to have and only consume stuff about that this is my one thing I'll let you buy it's a timer you can buy for five bucks not your phone when you set the timer and you set it for those 4 hours a day and every time you look away you stop the timer you do four hours of real work of studying the skill after you've done
(08:06) enough of that work and you're like what's enough 20 hours like you're like oh I can do that soon yeah I know that's why I'm telling you you can get out of this fast you can switch those 4 hours of you learning the basics of that skill just spending the rest of your time being the most amazing applicant to new jobs that exist in the world I didn't say go apply to jobs I said be the best candidate that has ever applied and you're like I don't have experience and you can address that like what I don't have an experience I will make up for an
(08:31) hustle and you prove that by messaging multiple people at every company with a snippet personalized to each of them you know what other people do like they take a half step they copy and paste the same thing to all four people and you know what the four people do yeah yeah he copy and pasted the same message to me don't do that be personal look at the HR recruiter look at the head of talent look at director of whatever and message each of them on LinkedIn if you don't have a LinkedIn go get one it's free and
(08:55) when you submit your resume put a personalized cover letter on it after reading from the website what that business is about when you read the job description good job description say what they want the person to do and say like I will be able to help do this thing because of these things right and especially a lower level role your resume is not going to matter as much don't let anybody around you say that or fool you into that what will matter especially for low level roles is hustle so every employer wants to see is
(09:17) somebody who's going to go out of their way to go above and beyond and so you demonstrate that you're going to go above and beyond and guess what's going to happen you're going to do this for five different places you're going to write a custom thing it's going to take you 4 hours to do the research write the custom thing message 20 people cuz it's going to be four people at all five places you know what's going to happen nothing cuz you're not lucky so what are you going to have to do got to be undeniable do you think if you appli to
(09:37) a thousand places like that over the next 6 months you wouldn't get a job I think you would you think if like after you got off your shift you drove over and you said hey I just want to let you know not in a creepy way you say hey just want let you know I apply to put my resume I messaged a couple of you guys I just want to let you know I'm really excited about the opportunity don't want to be overbearing but if you guys would give me a shot I promise I'll will work harder than any other candidate here and I'd like to just show you that I'm
(09:56) demonstrating that by these things so you're like I have proof that I'm saying I'm not just making I have proof that I will work harder and you know what'll happen one of them say I'll give you a shot and then when they give you that shot shove it in everyone's face how hard you work not by what you say but by what you do be silent and just kill look at what the top guy does and do twice as much as that guy does be Kobe for whatever the job is if you don't know the whole story about Kobe he did three practices a day while everyone else did
(10:21) one or two because he wanted to get ahead and in the beginning he was worse than them and then he got as good as them and then he became better than them and he kept doing three practices a day until eventually no one could catch up because if they were doing three practice a day they would just keep up with his rate of progress but he got ahead and so the guy who's number one at whatever that business is probably works better than you and he works longer than you and so you can't just match him to get ahead cuz he'll always be ahead you
(10:43) got to match his current effort and then do your I'm going to get ahead of you effort like when he clocks out is when your work clocks in that's when Aon 2.0 clocks in and the thing is is like if you can adopt this like if you can really internalize this you're going to crush you're going to win you can make luck not a factor when I had Jacob my 19-year-old my son I'm kidding when I was talking to him he I think he was 16 actually I was 15 or 16 when I started talking about this imagine he has even less reason to get a job than you all
(11:07) right less experience I gave him three words and he said he still remembers in this day I said volume negates luck if you need to put it put it on the back of your phones as a reminder of yourself because in the beginning the volume you're going to do is the timer of you watching the videos and taking the notes and watching the videos taking learning the lingo learning the language so that when you get into an interview you know what to say and then reps is going to be watching mock interviews on YouTube watching people who are hiring experts
(11:31) talk about the best ways to present watch some of Lela videos about how to interview correctly you do that stuff you'll put yourself ahead of other people volume okay cool now you're like okay but I'm not getting interviews volume negates luck crank the timer start doing the Reps one a day two a day three a day four a day 5 a day six a day 10 a day every single day you're like wait that's 40 messages that are personalized and 10 cover letters yep that'll probably take about 4 hours and then what do you do tomorrow set the
(11:53) timer you do it again next day set the timer you do it again what do you do the next day you set the timer you do it a [ __ ] again and you keep doing it and on the ones that you really really like you drive over there after you get off your shift you stop by and just say hey I'm Avante I'm really excited about the opportunity I think I can help I applied you got a couple message from me I promise I'm not a weirdo I just did it because I wanted to stick out from rest of the pile cuz I know you guys I'm sure
(12:13) for an opportunity as good as this you probably got a lot of people who are interested I just will promise you that I just want a shot you say that they will give you the interview and if they don't someone will and once you do get that job and you work harder than everyone else you turn the dial and you don't do it for a week you don't work harder than everyone else for a week you don't work harder than them for a month you don't work harder than them for 6 months you work harder than the top guy for a year
(12:35) for 2 years you're like well [ __ ] dude I'm already like 2 or 3 years from now yeah I said it was a season but on the other side of this season is everything else that you want and so if I say Devon in 36 months are you willing to give me 36 months to get yourself out of the feeling that you have right now you're like I'm sick and tired of being poor I'm sick of not being able to buy stuff for my girl that I want I'm sick not being able to provide for my kid I want them to be in a good zip code I want to be able to have good school I want them
(12:57) to be able to have these things there's the price tag on that the question is just whether or not you're willing to pay it if you're willing to pay it crank the dial and volume will negate luck but you can't rely on luck you can rely on volume cuz that I promise you independent of race color socioeconomic background you're like wait some race socioeconomic backgrounds are how someone appear uh gives them an advantage sure but if you do it a million times do give an advantage do you only need one yes if there's like a
(13:21) lesson I can like have you like etch into your brain is that there's a significant amount of money and opportunity that sits on the other side of being willing to be rejected by stranger if you get rejected a thousand times you are no worse off than you are right now in fact you're better why cuz you have a thousand times experience and so you either learn or you win which means in both cases by doing you win by default I'll give you a little analogy so let's say you and your buddy are think about asking a girl to prompt
(13:45) it'll make sense in a second and your buddy's like ah man I want to ask Nicole and you're like all right man why don't you go ask her it's like ah well she says no he's like well then you're in the exact same position you are now which is you have no prom date you will also have no prom date but you'll have experience of asking one WR what happens when you talk to the next girl you'll probably be a little less nervous and you probably realize that you'll survive you will live if you hear enough and if you ask a 100 girls do you think one of
(14:07) them will say yes to your prom date probably and in that situation what are you now better off than you were before you asked the moral of the story there is that you lose nothing from no you only stand something to gain from yeses and one yes can change your entire life and so if you're willing to be rejected and see the rejections as you learning meaning you win and see the yeses as you also winning then you can't lose and everybody else around you who's poor is going to convince you otherwise they're going to be like why you still doing
(14:32) this man stop bothering those people man you're never going to get the job man you need to readjust your expectations set your goals lower hey that stuff's not for us right they're going to tell you those things because the thing is is that you have something that I do not have and that many people won't have is that you have a hard [ __ ] beginning you have a harder and bigger monster to slay but the bigger the monster the more epic the hero and so these are the stories that you're going to someday tell and these are going to be the
(14:54) sermons that you're going to be able to give to other Avantes in the future if you can't even muster the willingness to fail for yourself be willing to fail for your kid for the story that you're going to tell them and be willing to fail for the hundred other thousand other Avantes that you'll be able to someday tell your story to so they can get out of their situation so I didn't have time to say that but hopefully I give you a couple more minutes that give you a little more context I think I can speak confidently

13 Years of No BS Business Advice in 79 Mins - YouTube

Transcript:
(00:00) I've been in business 13 years I've sold nine companies my last company I sold for $ 46.2 million my current portfolio at acis.com just over $17 million a month and I'm going to compress 13 years of business advice into this one video number one have something extremely expensive to sell that you never even plan on selling I learned about this anchoring tactic from a friend of mine and he said listen man you can just put something on your menu of items or services that you sell that's 10 or 100 times more expensive and just by having
(00:33) it there it'll anchor everything else on your menu or the rest of the prices that you have and just make it something that if someone actually bought it you'd be stoked that they did but what ends up happening is that one you'll sell more people on your core offer because they have this big price anchor second it allows you to nudge up your main offer's price because related to the big one it looks like almost nothing I was talking to a different friend of mine and I said hey you know you should consider just adding one of these things in and he had a weight loss business a very generic online weight loss business and so he
(01:05) added uh a six times higher price version of his offer and then the craziest thing happened people started buying that more than his core offer and when he did that he tripled his profit overnight and so the thing is is that it also breaks you especially if you're starting in business out of this fear of raising prices by just saying hey there's no there's no way anyone's going to buy this I'm going to make this so expensive no one's going to buy it and that's okay so you give yourself permission to just fly it out there but
(01:38) what you will find is that 10% of customers just want to buy the most expensive thing these are the whales and the only thing worse than making a $1,000 offer to somebody with a $100 budget is making a $100 offer to someone with a $1,000 budget because in the first scenario you lose a 100 bucks in the second scenario you lose $900 of the money that you should have made but didn't number two no one knows knows you exist advertise more and so to give you context on this when I walk through the streets I usually get stopped four or five times on like a 60-minute walk and
(02:12) when I was launching my book last year I had you know 500,000 plus people who were registered it was this massive event broke the internet whatever but during the month leading up to it we're advertising on all channels we're running ads we've got Affiliates that are pumping it I'm making content all over the place and over the 4 weeks of people that stopped me only one person knew that I had a book coming out and so every time I'd see somebody like hey you going to be at the book launch and they're like oh you have a book and I was like how can you not know that I
(02:42) have a book there's a story from Henry Ford that I love which is that he was walking by his the CMO of Ford was right next to his office and every day he'd walk by and he'd see the marketing campaign he he'd see the marketing campaign a day after day after day and so 3 months into seeing the same campaign he knocked on a CMOS door and he's like hey when are we going to stop running this thing he's like I'm getting exhausted to seeing it and the guy just looked at me he's like we haven't started running it yet and so the thing
(03:06) is is that we get so sick of our advertising so much before our customers or potential customers even remember our names and so the extent of advertising that you have to do there are so many people in the world and people's attention is so spread thin and so they're so distracted that in the off chance you actually do get an advertisement of some sort in front of them the likel that they remember that it was even you and the core message of that advertising is even lower and so many of us have this big fear that we're harassing our Audience by repeating
(03:37) ourselves over and over and over again but the vast majority of the time no one even a knows you exist or B specifically knows the message that you're trying to let them know and so I like to tell my team and remind myself that we need to be reminded more than we need to be taught and so your audience needs to be reminded more than they need to be taught and I don't know about you but I followed plenty of accounts where like they have the same four or five messages more or less that they put out there and the reason I follow them is because I
(04:01) like the reminder I like to be reminded to be patient I like to be reminded to to to not think take things too seriously I like to be reminded that I have to think long like those are the things that I like to be reminded of and so imagine if that accounts like I already said be patient once I don't want to say it again they've already heard that from me it's like no people have messages that they want to continue to get fed into and every time you feed that same message that they likeed before back into them they'll have another positive experience with you the amount of novelty that's required in
(04:26) content is significantly less than you think as a creator think about it like you're going after a girl and she's with somebody right now all right so you're like okay well I'm going to ease off but I'm just going to just let let them know I'm just going to throw these little flares out there that I'm that I'm I'm interested I'm here I'm not being disrespectful but I'm I'm available right and then what happens is as soon as uh she gets out of that relationship or whatever then she's receptive to your message and so the thing is same way
(04:52) works with customers is that they might not be looking for a marketing solution they may not be looking for a plumbing solution they might not be looking for an IT services provider for 3 months 6 months 9 months but they might like to hear your stuff but the moment they are in the market you're the first one they think of because you continued to repeat the messages that resonated with them to begin with the big thing is the 4x4 all right which is especially when you're starting out four hours a day doing the core four and so the core four means
(05:21) you're reaching out to people you know oneon-one reaching out to strangers one-onone making content one to many or running ads one to many and so there's the four ways the only things one person can do to let other people know about their stuff and so I use the rule of 100 as my my guide there which means you either make a 100 minutes of content you do a 100 outreaches so either cold or warm or or and if you want to get really spicy or at least $100 a day of advertising now obviously the $100 a day you can scale as much as you want but as
(05:49) a baseline for anybody who's starting a business those are three ways that you can just say okay what do I have to do to let more people know about my stuff if you're not making 100 minutes of content you're not doing 100 outreaches a day day or you're not spending $100 a day on ads no one's going to know you exist and that is the biggest threat to your business the reason it's so important as a Founder to do this in the business is that you have to be able to make it rain and so every business at the most basic level has to advertise
(06:15) before it can have money right so like if you want to make money people cannot give you money until they know you exist and so is a is a pre-requisite for making money in business is that you advertise first and then you have a product that you can deliver on and that's the most basic form that you have to have if you just have the product and no one finds out you will continue to not make money which leads me to number three until you're at $100,000 a month advertising is all of your focus and the main reason for that is if you don't have enough people coming in you're not
(06:45) going to have enough iterations of the product to get feedback to know if your stuff's good or not and what you need to do to make it better now the thing is is that up to $100,000 a month at that point it's all advertising but at some point in order to continue to scale you need to fix the product you need to make sure that people are refg you need people make sure people are happy that they're referring other people that they're staying month after month or they're repurchasing month after month after month and so if you're not solving that then you've got a leaky bucket and
(07:09) that's going to be a problem that you're going to deal with later and so the smart move is to fix that stuff now so that you can grow a really big business and this is one of the biggest mistakes that I made so many times in my early career is that you start advertising you start understanding a sell and acquire customers and you say oh that worked I'll do more of it and you should do more of it but within this current context of you have to make sure that you're delivering and so my recommendation is get to a million doll
(07:33) so get to $100,000 a month is then put all of your focus on filling all the holes in the bucket so that and the thing is is when you do that you're actually going to keep growing because if you keep the same activities and then you fix the holes you're still going to keep growing steadily month after month after month even with the same level of advertising effort then once you fix the holes then you go back to the front end and say how do I 10x this and that is how you can stair step even though your
(07:56) actual Revenue growth will still look flat because when you fix the holes you'll make more money but the doing this of the business will shift now if you do the alternative of that which is you just advertise more and more and more there's going to get to a point it's an ASM toote so basically you start growing and you start plateauing like this because then your infrastructure is too big and there's too many moving pieces to fix the thing that you should have fixed earlier but then you're in a rock and a hard play scenario because
(08:20) then you can't B dial back the advertising because you got all these people that you've hired but the more you sell the more your reputation goes in the tank because the stuff's not good and so you get a really hard scenario and so fixing it first fixing it early sets you up to build a much bigger business later number four under a million dollars a year it's one channel one Avatar one product I see way too many small business owners saying hey I've got two businesses or I have seven products or have two different avatars or blah blah blah blah right no focus on one specific type of customer and if you
(08:51) s if you just say yes to everyone with money you basically saying no to your business because you're never going to be able to focus and make something really good you can't serve six customers and then make a good product only doing $100,000 a month it just doesn't like it's it's too small volume like you don't get enough reps and so you need to do one very specific thing which means you have to say no to people who aren't that that type of person you serve one problem which means you have one product for that specific Avatar and you get better and better at templatized
(09:13) at at productizing the service or product whatever the product is itself making iterations on it and you advertise through one channel meaning you just know how to make cold email convert or you just know how to make cold calls convert or you just know how to make uh Tik Tok ads convert or you just know how to make YouTube videos that convert whatever your channel is you just stick with that channel because as soon as you're like oh I'm going to do two different things like that's not the objective of this stage you just
(09:36) need to get it reliable so that that you can then keep tweaking the product so that then you can 10x the existing Channel you're on once you get to about a million a month is when I recommend starting to to think about second and tertiary channels of getting customers and part of the reason I recommend that is that when you start a second channel it's going to cost you money and it's going to cost you time and so the reason that you keep that one channel and keep doing it longer than you think is because you need to be able to get it working at the same level or higher with not you doing it so that you can have
(10:05) the secondary Channel if you're the one who's gassing this first channel and then you move to the second well now you have this second one that's not going to be working out nearly as efficiently as the first one especially in the beginning the first 3 months 6 months it's not going to be cranking like the first one is but the first one's also going to go down because you're not there and so you spend the extra time there you put the right people in place you make sure the training is such that they actually can meet or exceed what
(10:31) you were doing on your own and then when you start the second Channel you can pour resources into it because you still have cash flow from your main thing and that little switch is where most people get lost and they just Crush their businesses so don't do that so to give you guys some context I didn't open up a second channel of acquisition until we were at 4 million a month now mind you I started with paid ads because I was good at paid ads and I learned how to run paid ads in my local business which then
(10:54) when I went National I KN had to do the same skill set but after 4 million a month I was like okay I need to get this second Channel going and so I started increasing that channel via cold email cold call cold DMS with an outbound team but I say that because a lot of people are like shouldn't I do this I try to delay that as long as I possibly can because I know it's going to cost a huge amount of time a huge amount of money and it might not work for 6 to 12 months and to give you context it took me 12 months for outbound to be responsible
(11:24) for half of my Revenue so it's not going to happen overnight number five always start for free always and I know and I I don't usually use explicit 100% black and white language but I have yet to see a time where starting for free has not made me more money so let me explain so when I started my Fitness business way back when I started with free I wanted to get people results and I said I don't have any experience so please let me just train you for free and because of that I have lower Stakes because they didn't pay me money they're still paying
(11:58) in other ways they're still paying time time they're paying inconvenience all the other things that a customer has to do those costs are still there by the way those hidden costs are the things that you want to decrease as much as you can in your product so that you can charge more money because you'll find over time that the most expensive thing about your product often isn't the price it's everything else you require a customer to do as a result of the purchase which is what things do they have to give up that they like doing as
(12:21) a result of the purchase and what is what are the things that they have to start doing that they hate doing as a result of the purchase and this happens with everything and when I say like and hate I use those as extremes but fundamentally there's some sort of friction there's some sort of inconvenience like when I buy a car I have to now get gas that is now an inconvenience in my life now compared to all the other cars maybe all cars that have that inconvenience until they have an electric car and all of a sudden that inconvenience has been removed because I can plug the car in at night so I'm a
(12:46) co-owner of school.com and I talk to beginner entrepreneurs a lot and so I see this happening more often than not which is that they say hey no one wants to buy my thing and I say okay well where's your where are your testimonials where are the people that you've used before this that you've helped get the result and they're like well I don't have any I'm like well why would I believe you they're like well I have this amazing offer and I'm going to talk about this in number six at length but if you don't start for free why should anyone believe you and if you are doing this for the first time why would you
(13:20) want to take money for something that you don't even know if it's good yet and so this can both give you the conviction and give you the confidence to get going because you actually have some results that you can go off of you can use those results to Market to get more customers I do this at every level of business and so everything that I do I always start with free no matter what it is and whether it's a new product line in a massive company one of our portfolio companies we built out a software product uh for the existing service base and so we said hey we can now have a DIY
(13:49) version of our services that you can use with this software product and what did we do we started for free we took our top 100 customers and said hey why don't you try it out let us know get us feedback and they just kept giving us feedback back and honestly in the beginning the fact that some people want to charge for this is insane it's like they're giving me so much valuable stuff I'm just happy that they use it right and so you go with free and then you go with a small small amount of money and
(14:13) then you keep raising your prices over time which I'll get to in a second and for those of you who are worried about your pocketbook like I'm Froning all these costs well yeah that's why it's called investing in a business but people who you work with for free can make you money in three ways number one is they can leave you a testimonial number two is they can refer you other customers via Word of Mouth that you did a good job and number three they can actually stay on and pay after a certain period of time when you do make it not
(14:37) free and you make it uh for money because if you want to keep surfacing and this is ideally how it works out is that you do such a good job that they're like I don't want this to stop and then you say great now you can do it in exchange for money because I can't do this anymore in exchange for nothing because I have enough demand because I've done a good job that I have these referrals and I have this proof that people do want to pay me for my services so if You' like that too you can get get the same price they have number six and
(15:01) this is a big one proof over promise so what a lot of beginners do and they read you know $100 million offers and they're like I have a grand slame offer and so because of that I've got this big thing with all these bonuses and the stack and these guarantees and I've got a premium price and yet no one's buying it so what I want to do is walk you through a hypothetical let's say on one extreme we've got somebody who has an amazing crazy awesome offer for whatever they promise you the world and Beyond on this
(15:29) stream same core product or core Service as the first guy except he has no crazy offer he just has 1,000 testimonials who is going to get the most customers this guy and so your proof is going to do more selling than any promise can possibly do because the promises all function as an approximation of the likelihood that they're going to get a result and proof is always going to be more compelling and so when you're starting out you want to capture as much proof as humanely possible now I have a huge amount of
(16:03) stuff on proof because I I'm obsessed with it but I'll give you four very good things that you can do to make your proof more compelling number one recent proof is better than delayed proof so if proof was 5 years old proof that's from last week is going to be more compelling second is you want it to be as visual as possible so just a bunch of words on a screen is less compelling than a screenshot of someone's bank account after they made money or someone saying hey I lost 20 pound is not as compelling as the picture of them losing 20 lbs
(16:32) which is also less compelling than a video of them weighing in and then a video of them weighing out the third component for proof that I'll give you is you want high volume and the nice thing is that most businesses actually have a lot more proof than they know they do they just never capture it and so one of the things that I did in our brick and mortar chains that we had with all of the the gyms I do across all our brick and mortars is if you look at Yelp you look at Google you look at Facebook all of these have reviews for your business and so for me and if you're digital then you have Facebook reviews
(17:01) on your Facebook page and things like that and so I would go into the Stars you click into it and there's like a hundred of them and then you just screenshot each one of them so if you have hundred five star reviews on Yelp that's like a mediocre Yelp account right but if I screenshot a hundred of those and then I frame them and I put them on my Lobby wall from floor to ceiling it's overwhelming the amount of proof that is and so most businesses have way more proof than they think they do they just don't leverage it and so one of the easiest things you can do take the screenshots of all all review
(17:32) sites across all platforms show them individually and show them as your new wallpaper and the fourth element of proof is that you want to capture pain and so let me explain by this so I've been able to look at a zillion ads across all companies where they have testimonial ads from customers or user generated content to be fancy right the thing is is the content that begins with pain converts significantly higher and so this is my theory around this which is that the pain relates to the customer or Prospect where they're currently at if they start with the promise it's too far disconnected but if you start with
(18:07) pain they relate to the person and then you can take them through the story of them getting the result but if you start with the end result it's too disjoint it's too far away it becomes less believable so if you had to pick between proof or promise double down on proof and that's also the reason that I tell everyone to start with giving stuff away for free because it's the easiest and fastest way to get tons of it best time to ask someone for a testimonial at the moment of greatest satisfaction all right so that's also by the way different from the best time to sell all
(18:35) right because you want to sell at the moment of greatest pain you want to get a testimoni at the moment of greatest satisfaction so think about this way if I were to say hey uh you have a steak dinner and you have a steak and you're starving you're like oh this is great blah blah blah blah the moment to sell you the steak is right before you've had the steak and then you eat the steak now after you have the steak is that the moment that I say would you like another steak not really because you're like I'm full I'm good so that's the point of greatest satisfaction not the point of
(18:59) greatest deprivation now after I've had the steak if I say hey would you mind like looking in the camera and saying how great the Stak was people like oh my God it was amazing it was so great you guys should definitely check this place out it's awesome right and so point of greatest deprivation is when you make your sale point of greatest satisfaction is when you collect your proof number seven raising prices almost always makes you more money but you hear no more often and so let me break this down so I had a a sales guy in one of our
(19:24) portfolio companies and we doubled the price of a product so a lot of people are like really afraid of like 10% or 20% increases like I'll test 4X 5x price differences pricing in many instances is far more inelastic than you think it is all right so elastic versus inelastic pricing I'm not getting into that but basically if you have a $5 sandwich going to $10 sandwich there's a lot of elasticity with food meaning people are very responsive to small increases in price the classic counter example is if you have life saving medication it's not
(19:55) very elastic at all meaning if you double the price people still going to pay for it because they need to live right and so the thing is is that if you have a very bable thing the price is usually a lot a lot more flexible than you think it is in terms of how much you can move it up all right and so I like making massive price tests but the thing that you have to have when you do this is the balls or the stomach to deal with more nose and so when I walked that sales team through the price increase I said hey we're going to double the price I said you have to understand that we're
(20:28) for sure going to get less or fewer yeses but the question is will we get half the yeses so we had a 35% reduction in conversion percentage but we doubled the price and so we made more money in multiple ways so one we made more absolute Revenue we literally just made more Topline but the magic of this is that let's say the cost of our thing was $500 and we sold the thing for $1,000 okay so we have 50% margins well if we double the price we go from making $500 $ in profit to $1,500 in profit so I actually triple the amount of money I
(21:03) make by doubling my price and so even if I have a 35% reduction or a onethird reduction in sales I tripled how much money I made on the other 2/3 of my sales which means me doubling the price with a one-third reduction in sales still doubled the profit in absolute amounts despite selling onethird fewer customers and one of the nice benefits of having fewer customers is that you have fewer costs associated with delivering on them so not only is the gross margin per customer higher your fixed cost that you have to incur to
(21:38) continue to expand your infrastructure go down and fundamentally a smaller amount of customers that make more money is an easier business to run than more customers that make you less money and let me tell you how important this is I've seen businesses that have not changed their prices for five six seven years right because they're afraid to do it whatever but I want to give you some real hard truth right now in 2017 if you sold something for $100 that was your only product and you were running 20% margins as a business if you did not change your price from 2017
(22:08) until 2024 that $100 now means that your costs in that business have gone up by 20% which means that your profit is now zero and so if you feel like your margins continue to compress year after year after year it's usually because you're not appropriately adjusting your prices so to give you context $79 in 2017 is the equivalent of $100 today and so that would be like you going back in time where you had a 20% margin business and running it at a $79 price point rather than a $100 price point and so you just like that eliminate all the profit in the business and so you have to do the reverse of that because inflation is a compounding
(22:47) threat to your business that every year stacks on top of itself and so if you're not making three 6% increases in prices at least annually you're not even keeping up with inflation and to give you a little story around this Warren Buffett when he bought C candies said that he only wanted to control one thing and so what that one thing was is that every year he would look at all the prices of all the candies and he would ship them the new pricing and he has raised prices 50 years in a row sometimes in a single year as high as
(23:17) 177% onto their pricing and as a result of that he's cleared himself a billion dollars in profit and so if it was the one thing that he focused so hard on it might be something worth thinking about so if you do make a pricing change there's two components to this one is new customers the other is old customers the easiest thing to do is just change the price and and just apply it to everyone who's new that's simple and if you're in a transactional business then it's fine even because the old customers
(23:42) come back and buy again right but if someone's on some sort of recurring service is a little bit trickier now I have some tactics around this but I'll just give you the high levels which is you want to have a price increase letter you want to talk about all the things that they're going to get as as a result of the investment that you're now making into the business and that it's the only way that you'll be able to stay in business given inflationary pressures Etc all right and so you just want to say here's the thing here's the stuff
(24:06) you're going to get I want to keep my promise to you which is to keep our thing as good as possible and only way for me to ethically keep my promise is for us to reflect that in the prices which are now having to be changed effective this date but don't worry I've grandfathered you in to your old price by this time and that's key is that the old customers you say I've Grand everyone wants to be grandfathered you say so I'm grandfathering you in until this and that way it's not like it's changing tomorrow it's delaying the pain
(24:32) and giving them a gift right now as a way of honoring the fact that they've been loyal customers to you those are the main bullets of what that price letter would go out and say and if you are going to raise your prices you want to be measured about it you should know what your conversion rates are prior to you making the price change and you should be able to give a statistically significant sample size of shots on goal with the new price before you make a decision if you get on the phone and the first two people say no well we one knew
(25:01) more people were going to say no we already expected that and if you have call it 40% close rates right now well if you make double the price and you go to 30% close rates then that's still a great deal for you you might just be getting the first two NOS out of the seven NOS you already know you're going to get when you talk to 10 people and so talking to two or three people getting NOS doesn't mean you need to change your price it might have just been the nose you're normally going to get even at your lower price and so you can't be emotional about this you have to be calculated and this in my opinion is the the reason most people don't raise their
(25:30) prices or can't do it successfully number eight talk to customers to solve all your problems so Paul Graham said this and I think it's really good he said you can solve just about every business Problem by talking to your customers so if your advertising isn't converting talk to your customers if your pages aren't converting talk to your customers if the price seems weird talk to your customers If the product isn't delivering talk to your customers at the end of the day your customers are the people you serve and they have all the information you need to make your product better so especially when you're
(26:01) starting out even if you have very low prices so let's say you charge $10 a month for something all right and it's and you want this thing to have thousands and thousands of customers okay fine but if you don't talk to customers you're not going to know what's going to drive them to convert buy and stay and so I come from an industry where people meet face tace in person to sell $10 a month memberships and so I don't want to hear it all right I spent the first four or five years of my career selling $30 $50 $100 things
(26:34) all day long I don't know a very successful advertising entrepreneur who's a rain maker meaning they know how to get customers who didn't have four or five years of Hardcore sales under their belt that no one knew who they were right that's the rocky cut scene is where you take hundreds and thousands of calls with customers where you hear the words they use so that when you you say does this suck but they say it differently and so then you say that in your advertising and when you take these sales gos for $10 a month you're not doing it for the $10 a month you're
(27:03) doing it so that you can learn more about them and you just so happen to get paid but you find out the words that get them to move because you might think these are all the selling points to your thing but when you're talking to them nothing really happens then you say one thing and then boom their eyes light up and they're like yeah that and then all of a sudden you reorder your sales scripts you reorder your headlines you re order the the road map on the things that you're going to improve in the
(27:25) product because these are actually the things that are driving purchases for the first purchase and getting them to stay and so most entrepreneurs are afraid to talk to customers I have no idea why that is they're afraid to talk to random people who are giving them money I don't get it but one of the easiest ways you can learn more about your business to make more money is pick up the phone and call people who've given you money and ask them why they did and just as importantly maybe more importantly talk to all the people who didn't buy and ask them why they did it yeah and if you think you're above this
(27:57) you're right you you should just keep doing that but for everybody who wants to beat that guy just get on the phone with your customers so inside of school.com we run a contest every month where the top 10 people who are new to the platform who generate the most Revenue in their communities get to fly out to Vegas and spend a day with me and Sam who's the other owner of school and part of the reason we do this is that of course it's a great prize for all the winners and they get to meet each other and it's an awesome event but for us we
(28:23) get such valuable user feedback from Super users these are the highest most invested users users and so we're like hey do you like this thing hey this is the product room hey would you prioritize this over this so recently we used the feedback from this group we said hey we have this thing that could be controversial with the rest of the community because we could see people taking it like this if we made this change in the product what would you guys think and unanimously they're like oh no that would make us more money we're totally in for it and so we're like wow and so months of deliberation
(28:52) of like oh do you think they'll like it I don't know if they'll like it what if they don't like it all of that got solved by just asking them and then we got our answer and then we did it and everyone was happy and so the beauty of this is that you get certainty around your decisions and so you can make decisions faster and the entrepreneurs who make faster decisions move faster and when you do talk to customers whether it's in person like this school event that I was talking about or just on the phone what do you think happens
(29:17) to them you can take someone from a neutral customer to a Super Fan in one call you can tell the story of the business you can tell them why they started you show that you care and guess what that person might bring you 10 or 50 more people people when you think two rows down the line of Word of Mouth referrals and of course they're probably going to stay way longer than they would otherwise because if they do have an issue guess what they're going to do instead of cancelling they're going to call you and let you know a great time to do this that a lot of people don't like is that the moment people ask to
(29:44) cancel so if you have any kind of recurring membership or if they ask for a refund if you have onetime transactions get on the phone with them and it's not necessarily to try and like you know hard sell them back into it which by all means you can but the more valuable thing is to understand what went wrong and you'd be surprised how many times you just let someone vent and here's the key don't minimize what they said get more angry about the reason they're canceling than they are because you're like that's ridiculous that should have never happened to you I can't believe that was your experience I completely understand why you'd want a
(30:13) refund I would want to refund 10 times over I'm surprised you're not trying to put me in jail I get it all right is there is there a world that I can make this right or what would it take for me this is the question what would it take for me to make this right and so now you get into them solving what it would cost or what it would take for them to stay and more times than not it's not as big as you think you want to talk to all sorts of customers so you want to talk to the super users you want to talk to the moderate users and you want to talk to the low users but you're going to get
(30:36) different things out of it like I don't I'm not going to prioritize a road map or things that I'm going to reinvest in the business based on people who are not that invested in the business I want to I want to talk to the super users who are getting the most out of it because they're going to have more context but in terms of what problem do I want to solve for these people it's like why didn't this work for you so this would be stuff that's like friction so this is going to be way more about getting new customers like I'm going to solve new customer Problems by finding out why people didn't buy or bought and then left and then I'm going to figure out
(31:02) how to make my customers more valuable and get them to stay longer by talking to Super users uh and your super fans or the best customers you have about what would make this even better number nine what to say to prospects on the phone when you're just starting to get your first sales so I use something called The Closer framework I'll make it very short but the call should go something like this C so closer is an acronym C clarify why they're there so what made you hop on the call what made you take a step what made you respond to my email what made you comment on my post
(31:31) whatever it is they took an action to become an Engaged lead and that is your advantage because any person that you get on the phone with with the exception of a true true cold call first pickup with the exception of that everyone has responded to an email they've commented on a post they've responded to an ad they've opted in whatever so you ask them why they did that that clarifies it gives you also big Authority in the frame because they've taken a step towards you and you're just receiving so you say hey why'd you do that and then they'll tell you what it was then you
(32:00) move on to L which is like okay so what I'm hearing is and this is labeling with a problem so it sounds like you want this and this is the problem or you're you want to have this outcome and you haven't gotten it yet is that sound about right they're going to say yes and you're like okay cool then you go to O and you say you're going to overview their past experiences you're like okay so what have you done so far to try and make this happen why is this so important to you what else has happened in the meantime that has cost you from not having this occur right and we call this the pain cycle the reason you do
(32:29) the pain cycle before you sell something is that you want to temporarily increase their deprivation around that outcome so we want to temporarily in the state of the conversation increase how important that outcome is for them so you've probably heard in in politics whatever the topic is of the debate it's like it's the economy it's education it's the border right whatever media puts more attention on is what people say is the main reason they vote for candidates they basically make that the topic of the election which is the macroeconomic
(33:00) situation or whatever right when you're in a micro event like a sales call you have sometimes 10 minutes sometimes an hour to basically in that very small call Elevate the importance of that problem in their life so that you can motivate action they were kind of hungry when they get on the call but as you talk about the food that they could be having and the bad food they've been eating every single day and how crappy it is and how it's not good for them and how tasty and delicious this food is what are we doing we're increasing their deprivation we're making them hungrier so that when we make our offer they're
(33:32) more likely to take it which then goes to S which is you sell the vacation and the reason I say sell the vacation not the plane flight is most salespeople most new entrepreneurs want to focus on their features they want to talk about the flight they want to talk about TSA they want to talk about check-in they want to talk about their bags they want to talk about their seat all of these things that are on the way to Maui their destination you want to just talk about Maui you want to talk about the lick
(33:56) your fingers good what it's going to be like when they have a full stomach and they're feeling great with their family at the restaurant that's what we want to talk about we don't want to talk about how they're going to order it we don't want to talk about the the selection we don't to talk about how many times they're going to get their drinks refilled we don't talk about any of that we want to talk about Maui we want to talk about being on the beach with the wind in their hair with a my tie in hand that's what we want to talk about sell the vacation typically is a three-point
(34:20) pitch which is by the way you can separate anything into three points right now you just Chunk Up or chunk down based on hey what does it take to be successful it's like you need Fitness Nutrition accountability you need the leads to be timely personalized and qualified right whatever it is so it doesn't matter what you're selling you can come up with three points and the people have to say yeah if I had all three of those things I would succeed now at that point someone doesn't say yes you move on to E which is explain away their concerns which are what of the specifics they have that are the
(34:48) reasons that they're not buying which is usually going to be some sort of specifics about the program something time related something money related something decision maker related meaning they have to give the decision-making authority to somebody else or finally them just simply avoiding the decision for fear of making a mistake and so you need to account for all five of those and know how to overcome each of them which I cover in a 4H hour plus video that you can watch on my channel somewhere else R is reinforce the decision so once they have made a decision to buy you're not done yet now
(35:17) the work begins which is the next 24 hours is crucial to making sure that they feel really wowed and impressed with your business most customers will judge a business based on the first 24 hours post purchase and so if you say hey I'm going to get you three things the next 24 hours you're going to get introduced to this person she's going to do this and this is what's going to happen next then you make those promises and you keep those promises within that time frame and ideally you do it even faster than you promised you want their impression to be like man these guys are dial The Closer framework is simple that
(35:46) simple enough that you can teach it to somebody else and when I was starting in my gym journey I had sold every single membership for a year plus and until I had somebody else come in who had never sold weight loss and have them follow the c l s r framework in the sales pitch and then saw them close their first sale without me I like I actually cried I was like so I was like oh my God I someone else can sell this like I this may actually be a business and so learning to sell in this framework also make
(36:16) makes it duplicatable so that you can give it to somebody else over time number 10 and this is big before you even think about doing something new do 10 times more of what's already working and so this is like one of the things as soon as I buy a portfolio company what I'll do is I go to the head of marketing I go to the founder and I say hey why can't we 10x what we're currently doing tell me why we can't honestly two times out of three they're like I mean we could and I'm like then why aren't we doing that and what happens is they have all these other priorities that are not going to 10x the business and they have
(36:48) this one thing that we already know works that that we have nothing that's stopping us from 10 Xing the business and I say great let's do that call me in 6 months now the thing is is in one out of three times to say well we can't 10x this because of this thing then I say guess what the constraint of this business is solving that and if you're doing anything but solving that then you're not growing the business right as a Founder rather you're not growing it as fast as you could be growing it you doing outbound it's like great why can't we do 10 times the outbound well I don't
(37:18) have enough leads from from lists okay great so our constraint of 10x in this business is that we need to find more sources for list so we need to either scrape more lists we need to buy more lists or make more lists ourselves eles okay that's solvable let's do that if it's hey uh if we 10x are advertising dollars like we just need to add more to the budget oh we can't do that because our ads aren't good enough okay great so we need to have more creative that's the constraint of the business if it's content which is why can't we make 10x
(37:47) content or make our content 10 times better or maybe realistically a combination of the two which is we're going to put out two times the content and we're also going to try to make it two to three times better great then guess what now we have a Sixx can we triple the content and make it three times better sure well what did we do in the best content that we had that we're not doing in all the other pieces great can we tempti that and make that the Playbook that we use with every piece of content great we're not doing that cool let's do that before we do any of these other ideas that you had and so a lot of
(38:18) entrepreneurs because it's boring to them they figured out how to do this one thing and they think oh I should figure out how to do something else when once you get something to work the whole goal is to beat the living hell out of it is to squeeze every last drop from that thing that works and you do as much as you possibly can as well as you possibly can before even thinking about doing something new so let me walk you through the five stages of the traditional entrepreneur for advertising or even for business they have something that they hear about that they think is cool so
(38:49) they go into uninformed optimism they're really optimistic but they have no idea then they jump into this new thing and they become an inform form Med pessimist and so they find out way more about this thing and then they're like wow this is actually kind of hard and then they go to stage three which is the value of Despair where they're like wow this isn't working this isn't what I thought it was going to be and then what they do is dot dot dot they start over at uninformed optimism because they hear something else is easier but they miss
(39:18) out on step four and five which is they become an informed optimist so they say okay I understand how outbound works I understand how PID ads work I understand how organic works and what are the things that it takes to scale and how much work it really is and then finally get to level five which is achievement which is they actually achieve the goal but most people just repeat 1 2 3 one 2 3 uninformed optimism informed pessimism value of Despair start back over and they just hit all three of those over
(39:42) and over and over again whether that's new marketing channels new products new businesses and this is a version of the woman in the red dress is that it's always deceptive to think that the new thing is going to be easier and the only reason you think it's easier is cuz you don't know enough I wish I could just give you the scar issue of having done that three-part triangle over and over again but all I can tell you is that like when I get that little tickle in the back of my neck where I'm like ooh
(40:05) this looks exciting it's now become a warning flag to me because I've been burned so many times doing it to say oh I must not know enough about this because everything is hard I'll give you an an analogy that a mentor gave me that I really liked and I think it applies to a lot of things but when he was talking to me about departments in my business he said you have to know where the bodies are buried and I was like what do you mean by that he said if have you ever talked to like a head of a department like I or HR legal or
(40:29) whatever and they say yep everything's good if you don't know what problems are actually going on in the department you're too far away and so that's in a way uninformed optimism they're just telling you it's great and you don't know any better so you're uninformed but you should know enough about the business to know where all the bodies are buried you should know where all the skeletons in the closet are and so if you're getting into a new thing you have to know all of the ways or as many ways as you possibly can about what's going wrong and once you do a little bit more
(40:57) research you often find out that there's a lot of things you don't know about and guess what the thing you do know is working right now and the likelihood that you doing 10 times more of that has far fewer unknowns than you doing brand new on something net new entrepreneurship already has so many risks and so much unknown basos talks about this he says we want to manage as many of the risks as we can so of course we're going to incur some risks that are going to happen that are unforeseen to us but the
(41:26) risks that we know about we want to limit to the greatest degree possible because there's enough risk of our business going out of business by being a business why take on more risk for no need it's risking what you have and need to survive for what you don't have and don't need which brings me number 11 which is growth is stressful stagnation is stressful decline is stressful that means that business is stressful and so the only stressfree people are people people who are dead and if you're in business you need to accept stress as a fact of life and not
(42:05) something wrong with you or wrong with your particular business it's just that things are stressful in general welcome to life and so I see a lot of entrepreneurs try and change their businesses because they feel stressed but every scenario of business has stress there are different kinds of stress but they're all stressful and so the idea that there's something wrong with you or wrong with your business because it is stressful misses the point of how business works and I'll tell you an analogy to make this make sense so if
(42:33) you've been in business for any period of time think about your first business or think about your problems that you had two years ago or three years ago in business you're probably like oh my God those weren't even real problems those were like nothing problems well future you three years from now thinks that about your problems right now and so I think about this a lot because when I think about my problems of like when I was worried about how to get trainer show up on time and like you know some
(42:56) somebody's membership wasn't wasn't recurring I had churn issues or whatever it was within the within the gym that I had those problems I could solve those in my sleep now right because the problems that I have are bigger and so the thing is is that you just become more enduring you become tougher and your tolerance level for stress or what you deem to be stressful goes up and so what's really interesting about this is that I still have the same problems I had when I had a much much much smaller business I just don't think they're problems anymore and so then that means
(43:25) that my choice to categorize the issue as a problem is actually the greater source of stress than the problem itself and if you can adopt that perspective you can be less stressed as you grow and make better decisions and so I just I wanted to to hit this point because I I almost stopped and killed so many businesses early on because I thought there was something wrong with me or something wrong with the business because I was stressed rather than accepting that stress is a fact of life and that I'm going to continue to be stressed as long as I'm alive so fundamentally stress comes from an
(43:54) aversive stimulus a stimulus that's not that's not enjoyable right but if you grow there's tons of things that are not enjoyable about growth if you're stagnating there's tons of things that are not enjoyable about stagnating and if you're declining there's tons of things that are not enjoyable about declining so there's just always going to be things that you don't like get used to it number 12 this is a really tactical one I've come to adopt this theory of something called the look back window which is that customers determine whether a purchase was good based on the
(44:25) last purchase they made and so if you've heard the phrase what have you done for me lately it basically it's phrasing for the look back window so let me give you an example if you're an agency owner right and you start running ads for a customer now let's say the first month you charge $55,000 and they make $40,000 with your ads they're happy you're happy the next month you charge the same $5,000 and let's say they make $5,000 well they're less happy you still made $5,000 but they're not thrilled but in your mind you're like well I covered
(44:57) myself last month for eight plus months because of how much money I made them and on the third month they cancel and you're like WTF on the first month I made you eight months worth of paying me but the thing is is that the way the customer perceives that is the first month I paid five and got 40 that was a good deal the second month I paid five and got five third month you know what I don't want to risk it anymore I'm out and so they will make a judgment on the purchasing decision based on the last purchase and so we can leverage that as business owners by extending the look
(45:28) back window which means that the less frequently we Bill the longer people stay think about this for a second if I build every single day there would likely be a day that I had not provided that customer value and maybe there's two or three days in a row and so likely they would cancel two or three days into not getting value being built daily is pretty high if I build annually they would only have an opportunity to churn once a year and the thing is is at that point of turn what would they do now in
(45:56) the agency example I gave let's say they made the 40 and the five and then they made five and five let's say throughout the year we had two more good months and all in all we made them 100 Grand and they paid US 60 right or whatever now when they look back they're going to see 100 versus 60 but if we bill monthly there's going to be multiple months where they were negative or break even and so the longer the window of time you do between Billings the longer the time you have to provide value and excess of your price so it allows for Less vola fa
(46:27) ility in their business and yours and so this is something that took me way too long to learn but as much as possible try and build for longer durations and I'm not saying get people to commit to contracts that's not what I'm saying I'm saying try and Bill Upfront for longer periods of time I'm willing to take a hit on some pricing which may seem counter to what I'm saying so that I can get higher LTV meaning if I know that I can cut churn by 3x by reducing my price by 30% so that they can pay three months
(46:56) up front or six months up front then I'm more than happy to do that and so there's two ways you can use a strategy strategy one is you just say this is how we do business and we need people who are committed because there's going to be volatility and we don't want the short-term volatility to affect our relationship and that's a legitimate reason to do it the other way you can do it is just have it as one of two options one that has some sort of prepayment discount that's associated with it or prepayment bonus which is one of the
(47:19) things I like um some level of service or some guarantee that comes with prepayment that doesn't come with month-to-month all right and by the way you can add a guarantee to people who prepay and not to people who don't so if people want to decrease their risk so think about they're they're taking on more Risk by prepaying but you attenuate or you offset that risk by adding a guarantee so they pay the same price but they get a reduction in risk for taking on an increased amount of risk so if you offer an annual pricing we know across our portfolio because we do this in a lot of businesses if you if you don't
(47:49) make it the default payment method and you just offer it you'll get about 10 to 15% of people who take the the prepaid annual option now here's what's cool about that is that if call it 10% of people take that option you double your cash flow in the business because you get a 12x Price Right on one out of 10 or one out of seven people who decide to buy well if you do that then you double the amount of cash you get up front and so for many people and many businesses that little change alone can allow marketing and advertising to be
(48:18) profitable and the reason having more cash up front is helpful for a business owner is that you can offset the cost of advertising and the cost of sales commissions and so you can have the these costs you have to incur to get the person in the door and so if you can frontload the cash from the customer then it means that you can do more of that faster because something called a cash conversion cycle which basically just means how fast do I get the cash back that I put out to get somebody new in and if I can break even on that or
(48:41) even be profitable on that in the first seven days then guess what I can do with the money go back and get another customer or two or five throughout my history as a business owner I've had four periods where I had tremendous growth and in each of those periods it's where I was making more more than two to three times what it cost me to both acquire and deliver for two customers in the first 30 days and so what that means is if I pay to get a customer and then that customer comes pre-loaded with the
(49:10) cash to deliver for him and get another customer and deliver to that customer then cash no longer is a constraint in the business which means that I can pretty much just crank the advertising until something else breaks in my business I mean this is how I had $1,000 in my bank account in December of 2016 and then in 20 months was doing 4.
(49:29) 4 million a month like the only way you could do that is getting it is basically have an infinite money glitch that happens because the thing is is that the money that you want is out there there's money everywhere if you look out the window if you look in the room you have there's somebody who paints your walls there's somebody who buy who manufactures those camera there's an electric company that funds this whole thing there's internet there's money in everything that you see with your eyes and you're afraid that there's not enough money out there there is you just have to access it and you can access it
(49:57) with skill by making sure that the pricing that you have and the terms that go with the purchases that you have allow you to advertise profitably so that you can get as many customers as you darn well please without entering your pockets but by entering theirs number 13 try and sell sawdust so I was talking a really good friend of mine who does 100 plus million a year and I was talking about this concept of sawdust which is in the businesses that we have I try and look at what are all of the assets that we already have at our
(50:24) disposal right and so with acquisition. for example I was talking to him about this I was like well I already have a building I already have the team that runs my portfolio and I already have all this lead flow from companies that are not big enough to be portfolio companies but they're still big enough that we could help and then someday later become portfolio companies and I was like is there a way that without adding more infrastructure to my existing business I could use the sawdust the stuff we
(50:48) already have to create a product or service that would meet the needs of those customers and so the sawdust analogy just comes from Saw Lumber Mills so they take these trees they put them in through the the lumber Mills they cut them up and they put them in the planks but at the bottom what they figured out is there's all the sawdust and then some very intelligent engineer was like huh we're just taking all the sawdust and we're throwing it out the back is there something we could do with this well it
(51:13) turns out one sawdust is great for plants and growing and putting it in a mulch and things like that but also if we mix this with glue we have more wood planks that we can create afterwards just using the sawdust and the chips and so they created a whole another Revenue line from stuff they already had and so right now in your business you have sawdust and it just takes a little bit of creativity to think how can I recombine some of these things that I'm already doing to then create another product line that doesn't take operational infrastructure for me to add to sell and then those added product
(51:46) lines often are huge margin increases because it's all profit because it's something that you already are incurring the cost for your main business so you can have this and the key to making this work is that it can not increase operational drag if you have to do a whole another thing in order to make this work that's not what you want the idea is the sawdust is already there and then all you have to do is gather it put the glue on it and then you have another product that's the concept I didn't buy
(52:11) another building I didn't hire another portfolio team it's just I use the team that I already have and they come down and they explain what they do within our portfolio companies to these businesses so they can become portfolio ready so they understand oh this is how they Market at a higher level oh this is how they hire at a higher level oh this is how they price oh this is how they uh sell and how they scale sales teams all of those Concepts I already have the information and expertise within my existing portfolio because I do it every day but by just having another way for
(52:41) people to have access obviously less than a portfolio company would to that team then I have another way to generate Revenue without having to occur the cost associated with building out a whole another business so the process that I go through is I think about all of the resources and assets that I have currently available so you have to be as detailed as you can because it's usually like a tiny piece from here it's the glue that we use for this part of the the log process but then we have the sawdust from over here if we put those together boom we have these new logs and
(53:11) we have the plank making machine Let's combine them and then we can do it ourselves right and so you have to think okay what are the what are the talents and the people that I have available what are the digital assets or physical assets that I have uh available to me and is there a new way that I can combine these things and so a simple one with was like in in the gym space right I had brick and mo
(53:34) rtar but we were only using the space from 5:00 a.m. to 9:00 a.m. and then from 5 uh then from 400 p.m. to 700 or 8:00 p.m. right so that means the rest of the day if I wanted to be a more clever business owner I could say what businesses use a gym and turf in the middle of the day that I can rent that space to that's sawdust that's additional Revenue that basically cost me nothing and so all I would have to do is say hey I'm available so if you have a team training thing or you you have some sort of sports thing with kids that goes in the middle of the day or Ends by 4 then you can use my whole facility and
(54:02) now my facility is generating Revenue because I'm paying the cost of owning that facility 247 and so I might as well make money from that so a different way of using that is called excess capacity so if you have excess capacity like uber is based on excess capacity people have cars they're not using them Airbnb you have an extra room it's excess capacity these are businesses built on other people's sawdust and you have sawdust in your business so you might as well use it yourself this is really the concept of double and triple and quadruple dipping is how can I get more leverage from the same thing and so I tell
(54:32) stories about our about our portfolio companies which like that gives me I have to do an intervention with the portfolio company either way but if I tell the story about it I get to double dip and use that as content and so there are many opportunities where you can get leverage you get more for what you put in by reusing the same thing in multiple different scenarios and so most businesses have tons of these excess capacity or double and triple dip potential poal sitting inside their business and they're not using them the workshops that I talked
(55:02) about I get to make content from those workshops I get deal flow from those workshops we get cash flow from those workshops my team gets more exposure to different types of businesses Industries so they also get better and so there's many value additive uh things that stack on top of each other from one decision by the way if you want to check out one of our workshops you can go to acquisition.
(55:24) comom we'd love to talk to you it's for business owners only so if you don't have a business go to school.com and we can help you start one number 14 arm your salespeople so I see too often a lot of Founders and entrepreneurs have this kind of like animosity between their sales team they feel like they shouldn't pay their sales team that much my Sal team so needy they only want lay down customers they're always complaining about the leads whatever no like you should be the tightest with your sales team because your sales team is the life is the cash flow is the life flow of your business if you don't have sales you don't have a
(55:49) business so they should get that level of esteem and honestly a huge portion of the business should be pretty much allocated to supporting them anding their core activities and so one of the main things that I like to do is two things one I arm my salespeople with an Excel sheet that has all the pieces of content that I have that can help overcome specific concerns from customers and so right now if you don't have a piece of content that overcomes every main concern a customer has about your services or your products do it and then as soon as you do it the best converting of those things one you'll
(56:23) know because you'll get sales from them because people will DM you about it like oh I didn't know that now I'm interested take those put them into a list so that your sales guys have them and they can send them to customers either before they talk to them or after they talk to them so that they can schedule a follow-up call and say hey let me send you this video it might explain your concerns let's let's touch base tomorrow after you watch it and then you can allow that content to do some of that selling for you and as soon as I did
(56:48) this with my sales team in Fitness when I had weight loss customers and then in gym launch when I had gym owner customers our sales went up and and the thing is is this is nice cuz I didn't have to train any of them anymore they just now had assets and resources they could deploy to leads who were a little bit colder who need a little bit more selling and they wouldn't have to spend time on the phone they just let me do the selling for them via the content that overcome that specific concern now that leads me to the second one which I'll just make as number 15 which is really big a lot of businesses don't do
(57:17) this but you should unify sales and advertising so those should roll into the same person and so I saw this really early on in gym launch we had two departments we had a sales department and we had a marketing department and marketing always said the sales guys weren't closing as many leads as they should and the sales guys always said that the leads weren't good enough or they didn't have enough leads right but when we unified that under a cro Chief Revenue officer which if you're the founder that's you you then say there's really just an acquisition department
(57:45) and fundamentally as I see it advertising and sales sit on the exact same Continuum you have low information buyers and you have high information buyers and so fundamentally a low information buyer needs not a lot of information or already has a certain amount of information to make a purchasing decision a high information buyer requires more information or doesn't have as much information when they start talking to you and so you have to fill in more holes fundamentally sales just fills in the holes that advertising failed to answer and so if
(58:16) you have exceptional best-in-class advertising you don't need sales it's not that they're separate departments they solve the same problem one just communicates one to many the other communicates one-onone people buy real estate on the internet via auction you don't necessarily need to have salese if you give a customer enough information they can make a purchasing decision that being said you're like wait Alex you have salespeople of course I do because there's always going to be a certain number of customers that I can get people to buy automatically and then there's people who still want more
(58:45) information that most likely they didn't see the advertising that answered that question and so then the salesperson can just say oh these are the three piano keys I need to play in order to get you to buy great and they fill that specific information need to turn the customer from a maybe to a yes and so unifying the two departments is one of the highest leverage moves that you can make as a Founder because it eliminates the cross- departmental BS it's we're all here to sell customers and so advertising Works hand inhand with sales not in competition with them so that they can get a pat on the head from you
(59:16) or whatever director is running that department so often times you are the chief Revenue officer who's uniting both of those fronts but over time if you can find someone who does that that usually is the FastTrack to being C so kale for example at gym launch became Chief Revenue officer right he basically stood on top of sales and marketing so that he could control the customers coming in the door and then once he knew how to make it rain he could run the business number 16 there are three legs to the stool and so every business needs three big functional leaders you need one
(59:48) person who's in charge of getting customers acquisition you need a second person who's in charge of delivery and getting those customers exactly what was promised and then third you need someone to run the internal operations of the business this is the day-to-day this is everything we do to support the other two functions so this is it legal HR these are the things that are required to keep you out of prison and so you have to have contracts you have to pay people on time you have to have a CRM that that collects all this information and this one functions as a vendor to
(1:00:19) the other two heads so think about this that person should never be making the big decisions in the business they should be supporting the decisions that enh allow us to get more customers or deliver on those customers better which if you think about it those three legs of the stool roll up to the only three things that you can do to increase Enterprise Value in business you can get more customers you can make them worth more get more customers acquisition make them worth more delivery and you can decrease risk in the business and so that is where the operations comes in if
(1:00:49) I know that everything's completely dialed we have no massive risk that we're supposed to and we can get as many customers as we don't or please and our LTV can continue to scale that is a valuable business and so it makes sense to have people who are in charge one throat to choke one chest to poke who's in charge of that function and in the beginning you may be all three but as you develop as the entrepreneur you have to think which of these three hats is more Central to my best skill set and then you can start finding the people who will compliment you and so I'll give you my rule of thumb here is that if
(1:01:18) you're not learning from these people in the interview process about what they can do better than what you're doing you need to hire better now if you're early days and you don't have the cash to bring something like that in then you got to learn a lot and that's part of Entrepreneurship but at some point you want the people that you bring in to be better at the thing than you which if you really think about it means that every business pretty much trickles up to the same thing when taken to its natural extreme which means you're going to have a head of acquisition who might have a sales director a marketing
(1:01:47) director you're going to have some sort of head of Ops who's going to have it legal HR recruiting all rolling up to them and you're going to have some sort of customer delivery or product person who is going to have fulfillment product experience ux engineering if you have software that are rolling into them if that is what the ultimate end of every business is then guess what your day-to-day looks like in a really big business the same in just about every business and so the idea that you need to keep jumping from thing to thing to thing when the ultimate expression of that business is going to be the same
(1:02:17) for you at the end kind of seems stupid if I don't like something about the business it's like I just need to get out of it I just need to get above it and so you can just develop the business bring someone else in who does like that thing and then you can have that person reporting to you and then at that point you're doing what every entrepreneur does which is they have a team of people who report to them about the things that they're doing on a daily basis and so don't get too bent out of shape about
(1:02:40) this is my opinion here this is Al this is advice from me don't get too bound out of shape About the Passion thing like love the game and whether that's selling dry cleaning or selling software or selling books or running a portfolio at the end of the day day it's more or less the same you're going to have a team of people that you like that share your values that share your mission and that you're walking alongside together with and so if you can if you can maintain that frame it will decrease the relative excitement for the woman in the red
(1:03:10) dress because you know that when it's taken to its natural end it'll be the same as The Natural end of the current business you're in number 17 the person with the highest standard should be in charge so you can think about this at every level of the business and so let's say you have a department for media buyers or you have a department for Content creators or you have a a department for salespeople or you have recruiting at every level in the company the person who has the highest standard the lowest tolerance should be the
(1:03:36) person who's in charge and that goes all the way up to the top of the business if there's ever someone in your business who is a lower tolerance or has a higher standard for excellence than you that person should be in charge and not you and so I use this as a wonderful litmus test to figure out who do I think should be promoted within a company or a division or a department or even on a tiny team who should be the lead of that team the person who has the highest standards and so when I think okay I've
(1:04:02) got all these customer support support reps who here has the highest standard for what they believe a customer service experience should look like that's the person you want in charge and so it's not tenure it's not it's not suaveness it's not how much you like them it's not what they look like it's who has the highest standard and so when I was starting up I made a lot of these mistakes I would promote people that I liked a lot I promote people who'd been there longer CU I felt it felt bad bad that this guy had been here for 18 months and this person had only been there for 2 months and I'm going to promote that person over the 18-month person but guess what when you have one
(1:04:33) of those hard situations guess what you get to do you get to talk to the 18-month person and you get to explain exactly why the other person got the promotion and what they need to do so that they can get promoted in the future and if you have a winner that person will step up and if you have a loser that person will step out and that's okay number 18 whenever you're hiring make sure that the person raises the average bar and so this is this is one I stole from B this is not mine but it's such a I love decision-making Frameworks because one of the hardest questions I could asked it's on a repeated basis is I don't know who to
(1:05:04) hire right or I don't know what good for this role looks like and so I'll give you two filters for that hiring process number one is during the hiring process am I learning more from them than they're learning from me now if you take three interviews guess what you might have just three bad candidates just like if you take three sales calls and you might not close any of the three it doesn't mean that you should change anything it might just mean that you got in the phone with three bad customers and just as likely three bad candidates so you want to talk to 10 or 20
(1:05:34) candidates and then what happens is if you talk to 20 candidates you'll very quickly see who are the people who really know their stuff and who doesn't and so I look for the quantity and quality of metrics that they discuss about their position in terms of how they influence success and so it's how do you define success and then what are the things that you will do what are the actions you take that will influence or increase the life that this successful event occurs and so if someone can't describe to me this sounds very basic in what ways do your actions contribute to this outcome now if you want to the 2011
(1:06:06) version this is for leadership and up you say how does that outcome Drive outcomes in the larger business if they can't connect those dots guess what they probably won't connect them in your business either now once you have an idea of okay I've talked to 20 people I there's you know three of them actually seem like they knew their stuff they gave me good quantitative quality me they could tie their behaviors to the outcomes they want and they could track that outcome to the overall business okay now I just asked the question of the people that I'm considering which of them raises the bar of the team and it's
(1:06:38) the team that they're joining so I'm not expecting a Frontline customer service rep to raise the bar of the executive team it's a different skill set different level of employee but if that Frontline customer service rep is going on a team of 10 reps then that person needs to raise the bar we were interviewing for one of our portfolio companies and so we we uh we recruit for our portfolio companies because we have a bigger brand than they do and so we can put really high level talent in using my brand to grow their their
(1:07:03) business faster so it's a way of me growing the Enterprise value of Business Without purposely using my face to grow it so I don't become keyman risk I just leverage my face to get the best talent into those companies and that's why they grow so fast Pro tip but so we were looking at um a media buyer for one of our portfolio companies and I and I think the you know they they passed a number of candidates and they were like this is is the final guy we want you to talk to him so I said fine so I talked
(1:07:28) to the candidate and the guy was great nothing wrong with him seemed you know had had decent experience and when I got off the call I I got the recruiter from my team was like hey so what you what you think should I should I pass him along or should we hire him and I was like I don't think so he's like why he's like he met all the all the requirements he had the experience he seemed like a nice guy and I thought about it more and I was like name the other people on that team so he named all the other people and I said is that guy better than any of them and he was like No And I was
(1:07:55) like then we're making the company worse and so that person has to raise the bar of that team because think about the equal opposite if every person that comes in lowers the bar of the team you eventually dilute the company to a bunch of people who suck but if you maintain that bar which is that this person has to increase the average of the team then over time a company only improves and gets better and as that person now is in the team the whole the whole team's bar now raised a little bit and so when we
(1:08:20) bring someone else in the bar goes up and if you're like wait that means that I have to keep hiring better and better people you damn stra you do that's the whole point and a mentor of mine said this and I just loved this quote he said your best talent has yet to come your best talent is in the future you haven't met them yet and so in me thinking about this and I can pass that same advice along to you is that the best employees the best teammates the best partners are in your future not your past number 19
(1:08:44) when you're dealing with that team there's five reasons that someone is not doing what you want them to do and this is super helpful for these hard conversations and I usually draw a diamond here but I'll just do it visually here's the condition someone hasn't done what you want them to do reason number one they didn't know that you wanted them to do it so you didn't communicate it clearly or you didn't do it in a written fashion whatever it was there was a miscommunication they didn't know that you wanted them to do it okay now let's say they knew that you wanted
(1:09:08) them to do it the second reason is they didn't know how to do it if they didn't know how to do it then it means that they need to be trained on the steps in order to recreate that thing now once you train them if they know that you want to do it and they know how to do it then they might not have know when you wanted to do it which means you needed to add a deadline or a timeline with the thing that you asked them to do so it's like oh I knew that I just know you needed buy Tuesday okay great so we're working our way around the fourth reason
(1:09:33) that someone won't do it is because they know that you wanted them to do it they knew how to do it and they knew when you wanted them to do it but they just didn't want to do it so they weren't motivated and with motivation obviously a massive topic a lot of it comes down to the reward cycles and Punishment Cycles associated with the work that they do and so it's how can I incentive them incentivize them properly and not necessarily monetarily you can incentivize someone by pra and by giving them Kudos you want to
(1:09:57) know something that really incentivizes people freedom and reinvesting in them if you want your team to love you give them autonomy and invest in them if you do that they're like holy cow I get so much investment from these people basically what you want is you want reciprocity to still be like if the only reason someone does something is for the paycheck you're going to miss out on the vast majority of human effort which is discretionary effort so let's say it takes this much effort to not get fired someone usually has 10 times that amount of effort available to them that they
(1:10:27) put to their Hobbies they put to their other things they put to their shower time they put to music or whatever else but they're not putting it to their role and reinvesting in it but if you invest in them and you try and uplevel their skill set either as a human being or as a professional or both then they become more valuable in your business and I think about it this way it's like well what if I invest in them and they leave well it's what if you don't and they stay so that's the fourth reason so they
(1:10:49) know that you want to do it they know how to do it they know when they want it done by and they're motivated to do it well why why still or they haven't done it they have something blocking them and so an easy analogy here is I could have the best chef in the world in the most amazing kitchen and I would say hey make me an omelet and if he knows how to make an omelette and he knows and he knows I want it right now in front of me and he's motivated to do it because he's on television but he's like I don't have eggs there's nothing he's not going to
(1:11:13) an egg out right there's nothing he's going to do and I'll tell you a real world example of this so my imunity team uh we spending a lot of so we have a big office and we built a Hu a bunch of Studio stuff invested almost a million dollars into this building just on the media side to make it awesome for them but a lot of the guys were spending their time at home editing stuff and I was like dude what the hell I was like I think we've made this a pretty sweet place like why not you know what it was the bandwidth on upload speed was low at
(1:11:38) the office and so their houses were higher or faster upload speeds and so it was it was making them way less efficient which kudos to them for being more efficient by being at home but then I was like okay well this is obviously constraint and so then we spent 120 Grand to get Google Fiber drilled through the floor not through the floor like from the road to get brought into the building and now we've upload speeds of 1.
(1:12:03) 2 gigs a second and so now we're way faster than they were at home and guess what the media team's here and so that was the thing that was blocking them and so here's the cool thing about this framework is that if you have a hard conversation with somebody or you perceive it to be a hard conversation because they're not doing something that you want them to do you can say I think there's five reasons that someone doesn't do it let's walk through them together and that way you can attack the reason rather than the person number 20 the hardest work work is the work that you don't know how to do and the reason this is so tough is that the vast
(1:12:31) majority of the time if I said what would it take to grow your business if you only had one thing you could do by the end of the year and make sure that it was accomplished that if you just did that one thing all of your other goals would get accomplished what would that one thing be by the way that one thing is what we call a priority now the thing is is that you might not know how to make that one thing happen so it could be if I had a mega brand by the end of the year all of my other issues would go away it could be if I didn't have the turn issue that I have by the end of the
(1:12:59) year all my other issues would go away if I had a good sales director that could scale of sales team all of my issues would go away many businesses have one thing that if you think about it long enough have enough Downstream effects that it would accomplish many of these other goals that you have or more likely make them irrelevant and so what we do often times as entrepreneur is we solve the problems we already know how to solve and so we like doing those because we have fast feedback loops because it's rewarding because we you know how to solve it and so it's basically like going back to level two
(1:13:28) when you're at level three and you don't know how to beat that boss you just keep beating level two again because it feels good but the thing is is that the level three boss hasn't changed and he's still sitting there Bowser you know with his fist and his spikes sitting there ready to wreck you and so the thing is is that the hard work of Entrepreneurship is the failure that you're inevitably going to encounter by not knowing what you're doing and then taking action steps despite that with the idea that you will
(1:13:56) eventually succeed if you don't stop and so we as entrepreneurs have to accept that that is what hard feels like it is confronting the unknown that we don't know how to do and realizing that we're going to take our best shot and probably be wrong four five six times in a row and yet that single priority has not changed if we still built the Big Brand if we still hired that really good sales director if we still fixed churn in our business if that thing were solved it still doesn't become less of a priority
(1:14:24) but what happens is the entrepreneur fails once fails twice and then decides you know what I'm going to go back to level two and beat that to feed my ego to feel good about myself but most of Entrepreneurship is eating glass and that's why I said earlier growth is stressful stagnation is stressful decline is stressful because in each of those scenarios you're still doing the same thing which is that you're solving a problem you don't know how to solve yet and so the actual doing this in all three of those scenarios is the same and so that's why when you want to when you want to say stress is the problem it's
(1:14:53) not the problem stress is a fact that occurs when you solve problems and if you're solving problems you don't know how to solve welcome to the game if you knew how to do everything you'd already be Elon Musk and so the whole journey of Entrepreneurship is turning the unknown into the known through trial and error there's a company that was thinking about investing in that has a consumer package good cpg product that I asked the founder I said how hard is this to manufacture and he said it's actually a lot more complicated than I thought it would be and I was like that's amazing
(1:15:23) and he just looked at me cross-eyed and he was like why is that amazing I was like because that's more things that anyone who's going to try and copy us is going to have to overcome and if we can bet on the fact that we're more perspicacious that we're more Relentless that we're more unyielding in our desire to keep solving the problem and keep bashing our heads against The Rock until the rock gives way then we will be able to be the winners and any single thing that you have to overcome to be successful is what anybody who behind you wants to compete with you will also have to solve and so I like to think
(1:15:55) about it like there's this big rock that I have to figure out how to move with rope and some duct tape and a lot of sweat and a few guys with me and on the other side of that rock is a big bag of money and the bigger the Rock in general the bigger the bag of money I mean I use this Frame all the time at one of our other portfolio companies we have a software uh that we've developed and has now gotten really really good and is generating a lot of Revenue and there's this next big feature that we have to build out and he's like this is going to
(1:16:20) be really complicated I said well the good news is we're going to get paid $150 million when we solve it and he was was like well when you say it like that and I was like well it is like that and so when you think about these things whether it's I need to add a second uh acquisition Channel or I need to learn how to hire manage and train a sales director each of these are hard things that you have to figure out how to do but if you can quantify how much more valuable your Enterprise or your business will be as a result of this
(1:16:44) change then you can ascribe a value to it and if I said hey man if you hire that sales director I'll pay you $5 million guess how motivated You' probably be more motivated but the thing is is that your business business will pay you $5 million when you solve the problem and so if you frame it that way it stops being this wo as me people are hard uh man life is stressful it's we get compensated for our ability to deal with that stress and take action despite it one of the biggest unknowns that I had when I started a few years ago is how do you run a family office so I went
(1:17:12) from an entrepreneur building businesses to I have to manage cash at a portfolio and allocations of resources in capital across multiple businesses and different Industries how many resources do I allocate in terms of man- hours to each of these companies is it proportional to the capital what kind of deal structures are going to be the things that are going to mitigate risk but also give us the most upside these are all these things that I had no experience with and so I just got on the phone with anybody who would give me time and asked them as many questions I possibly could and then guess what happened once I started doing
(1:17:44) it I learned way more than I did from all of those conversations and I developed my own thesis of how this works and so the thing is is that every time you start on something new whether it's starting a business to begin with OR learning how to run unpaid ads or learning how to sell it always feels like this big amorphous thing but once you take your first phone sale once you run your first ad once you hire your first person all of a sudden you're like oh okay I kind of wrapped my arms around it and now I can see all the holes that are there and so in my experience the faster I can get to me just wrapping my
(1:18:15) arms around me actually taking the first action you'll learn a hundred times more from your first hundred phone sales than you will from 10,000 hours of reading books about it and so my goal with a lot of the content that I have here is if I can just shrink the time between you thinking about doing it and doing it the faster you're going to get to your goal because learning is same condition new Behavior if you have not changed your conditions and your behavior Remains the Same after this video you have learned nothing and you can measure how intelligent someone is by their rate of
(1:18:46) learning which means by the rate at which they change their behavior with given a the same stimulus so if I say hey pick up the phone and answer it someone picks up the phone they say blah blah blah I say great I want you to read the script now pick up the phone now they pick up the phone they read the script same condition new Behavior they've learned and so right now in your life there are conditions that probably remain unchanged and so if your behavior does not change you learned nothing and you can measure every video every piece of content every book that you or every
(1:19:18) sales exchange every meeting you have as to will this change my behavior if it didn't it was a waste of time and if you're a younger guy and you're just getting started like you don't have a business I don't make as much content anymore for people who are getting started but if that is you I just made a video called uh brutally honest advice to my younger self uh check it out I think you'll enjoy it and it might help you get started and change your behavior

(00:00) warren buffett once told the story of his closest friend from columbia business school he said the guy was incredibly smart incredibly hard working really strong ethics great character and they kind of were in a similar spot as they graduated but the outcome of their lives was dramatically different based on a single decision the friend of his went to the steel business and he said worked you know very hard and earned a modestly you know modestly good living um while warren went and started his first private partnership and then what would eventually become berkshire hathaway
(00:36) and he said this final quote which has always struck me or struck me then and stuck with me since which is what i learned was it's not as important how hard you row but what boat you are in and so in the video that i'm about to show you this was a presentation that i was given for a keynote and they asked me to talk about what they called level seven entrepreneurship so once you kind of they have like levels one through six that they were talking about level seven is kind of rising above the businesses and using your businesses as or seeing your
(01:05) businesses almost as products that increase your you know personal net worth etc i took that to mean how do we assess and appraise opportunity itself this is one of my one of my favorite presentations i've ever given um and i hope that you get value from it mosey nation for those guys who don't know me by the way my name is oxford mosey i own acquisition.
(01:25) com it's a portfolio of companies that does about 85 million a year make these videos just because i think a lot of people are broke and i know it should be one of them and hopefully some of the lessons that i've learned along the way uh can help you so uh buckle up and enjoy how's everybody going awesome sweet so i am a level seven entrepreneur category five hurricane level ten fire breather top secret security clearance holder uh it was kind of weird to hear the context for the talk today because i don't really feel like a level seven entrepreneur um just feel like somebody's taking a couple
(02:03) steps forward and one toe after the other so let's rock and roll everybody good with that sweet it's acquisition.com that's our fancy logo awesome you guys want to hear something totally insane uh oh i can see it here much better i was able to take home more in a year than the ceo of mcdonald's ikea ford motorola and yahoo combined as a kid in his 20s which has equated to over 1.
(02:47) 2 million per month in dividends for nearly half a decade and i haven't talked about it publicly that much mostly because didn't really care too we're at an interesting point and ryan asked me to to bring this up where we've exited two companies this year sold our house sold our car and i'm kind of in a season right now of consolidation and kind of distilling down what i like to call artifacts so just frameworks that crystallize the learnings so that i can set forth for my next chapter with kind of a backpack full of lessons and so i have way more frameworks than i
(03:21) will be able to share with you today that book is the first of 10 books that i'm writing on it that is really just expounding on one framework but i'm going to share with you four today that hopefully you get some good stuff out of all right and no one was more surprised than me uh to hear those numbers so what's interesting is that me expressing that fact creates envy in some people anger and others skepticism in most and confusion in old people and hopefully inspires a select few because you guys are who i'm making this for
(03:56) so these are just a few level seven observations i added in quickly this morning because ryan asked me to talk about a couple of these some things that i've learned one everyone wants you to do well just not better than them except that no one actually wants you to be rich except for you i really mean that because if you're not fighting for you no one else says money only solves money problems and then you are left with problems that money can't solve you don't arrive you just enter a new club as the smallest member the guy who
(04:31) literally lives in the unit directly above me in my building took home 1 billion this year in income not an exit income he owns outright 100 owner 3.8 billion a year in sales 26 net margins and last year took home 920 million year before that he took him 850 million cool guy so i'm just poor and one of the last observations i'll say is that this last year i'd say we fully exited the the org chart and we're making pretty much the same money that i just showed you and uh it was wildly uh boring and like almost depressing and so i i
(05:23) kind of have this thing that like let's make active income cool again because i think passive income is slightly overrated because we all have this desire we seek freedom but what i really think we want is options um and we want engaging activities because we like imagine because all of us buy back all of our time and imagine you buy all of it back and you're making all the money and you do nothing it's terrible um and so i'm just sharing this with you because that was my goal for such a long time that when i kind of got
(05:57) there it's it's not it's not fun like all i want to do now is start something else because i've got a lot of summers left right so might as well do something cool all right so who wants to hear about stuff that can shortcut your path to material success so you can ponder the purpose of achieving it to begin with and so i think that there's something to be said for intention behind how you create your business and people can feel why you're doing things total tangent i was talking to a buddy of mine who just sold his company for 200 million
(06:31) and he said you know what's interesting is that when you talk to most people he said 99 people are plugged into the matrix and what he meant by that is that they're operating from a place of lack and a place of desire to get other people to give them money right that's kind of where they operate from he said when you exit the matrix it's very rare but you'll see that when you make things just for the sake of making them like art then they have they take on a whole different form and this book was kind of
(07:01) the first of the many things that i hope to create from that same space and so anyways i hope you enjoy it if you do pick it up and hopefully i'll prove to you some enough enough value for 99 cents so how i turned 1036 dollars into 85 million a year in portfolio revenue in five years using four frameworks and that is december 20th 2016.
(07:26) so your life can change pretty quickly all right so that was me when i started i didn't have enough money for rent so i slept there scaled those locations from it always still hits me mostly because i'm just grateful you know for where we're at now anyways um i'm sorry scaled these locations from zero to six um and three years off cash flow which was pretty cool um then i did 18 months of doing gym turn around so it's kind of like gym rescue or like bar rescue but gyms but no gym owners want to get rescued so i called it jim launch brilliant marketing right there uh
(08:02) and uh this is actually the first ad i ever ran which is actually me just doing a walkthrough of this this gym in the hood hood um and i did 191 signups in 19 days just me selling one-on-one at 500 bucks each um i would show you but i don't think we have enough time um but that ad if you ever want to check it out it's on my youtube channel it's got like 400 000 views um it's 90 seconds so anyways from there we packaged the ip for a better gym model because i had six gyms and then i did all these turnarounds um we skilled that to 2.4
(08:33) million a month which is a b2b business then we started a supplement company scaled that to 1.7 million a month that's b to b to c and b to c uh for those who don't know that means business to business and business consumer sorry and business to business to consumer uh and then after that we founded a software company which killed a 1.
(08:51) 6 million a month which was b to b to c uh which we actually just sold two months ago and uh yeah that was cool and then we co-founded a national photography chain which now 14 months later is doing 1.1 million a month so and now we have acquisition.com so we take interest in seven eight and multi uh e-learning and local chains and we grow them to exit so that's what we do which is cool for me but what's in it for you all right so here's my goal for the presentation to help you get you from where you are using some of the lessons that i learned the hard way and a few stories to make them stick
(09:26) uh to a level seven zillion entrepreneur cool which is an entrepreneur who contemplates the meaning of life because they have no need for money great so if you have achieved if someone has achieved success and i'm going to use quotes here faster again quotes here than you then they simply have been better allocators of a single resource and it's probably not the resource you think all right so i want to base my presentation today on a single premise which is time allocation is the only thing that matters if you master time you will master material success i'm not saying you'll master happiness i'm just saying you'll master material success
(10:00) all right and so don't worry this is not a time management presentation this is a presentation on how to drag your time horizon by the balls into the present all right way faster than everyone you desperately want to beat i mean that right like you can drag your time horizon to the present if you learn how to think differently all right so from the outside what appears to be speed is not lots of activity that is a fallacy that most entrepreneurs believe all right it is making the right strategic decisions and making fewer mistakes
(10:31) so if you see where it says micro fast macro slow for the most part when i look at entrepreneurs and i see what they're doing that's what their life looks like they go really fast and then they change directions they go really fast and they change directions but i can tell you my neighbor who's right above me has been doing the same thing for 40 years and it's micro slow macro fast and the speed comes from not having to take detours if you consistently move forward over a long enough period of time you go really
(10:59) far and so here's a level 7 observation for you 90 of success can be boiled down to consistently doing the obvious thing for an uncommonly long period of time without convincing yourself you're smarter than you are so i like this quote from naval ravicon it's loose i just remember from a book or something um i only believe that one percent of decisions matter the rest of them are irrelevant the difficulty is understanding which of the one percent of the 99 of the ones that matter and so what i want to give you some of the frameworks that shape my one percent decision so you can use them too all right
(11:34) so first off this is the premise money is the denomination of time every transaction we make is for some percentage of our lives our wealth is a measure of how little of our lives we must trade for the things that we desire money is an iou from society for future goods and services which is translated as other people's time for value that we provide and so to somebody who has lots of money they need to trade very little time by percentage of their life to get the lamborghini for somebody who has no money they have
(12:05) to trade a very large amount of time to get the same lamborghini it's a it's just a store of time and so the key multiplier on time is leverage and the size of the opportunities that we pursue aka the strategic decisions are directly proportional the amount of leverage that we can employ rich dads and i think this is the biggest difference in economic equality tell their kids to pursue high leverage opportunities real estate funds acquisition business ownership that's what they encourage their kids to do because they've already jumped through the levels and they know what is there
(12:40) most people don't succeed because of ignorance not because of lack of desire poor dads tell their kids to pursue low leverage opportunities forcing those kids to have to learn the hard way like many of us did what leverage actually is many times never discovering what it is until it's too late example get a good job build a small business and i'll clarify what that means in a second etc and so this is a a good book you can probably get most of the takings um just total side note i think one of the most valuable things you can do is just read billionaire autobiographies because you get to see how they think so he said uh
(13:16) and this this this this hit me like a ton of bricks he said it's harder to build a small business than a big business because level 10 talent is only attracted to big opportunities it's harder because you got to do it on your own you got to do everything if you chase the big things it also makes it worth it because small goals and big goals are equally difficult you have to spend time to achieve either of them so you might as well make them big like really like that like does that make sense it's like that hits you
(13:49) because it hits me so with that being established these are the four frameworks that i use to apply leverage and have given me the quote faster than normal quote material success that many claim to desire number one and i apply these frameworks when we're looking at investing in portfolio companies when we look at ourselves and our own companies what we're going to do to scale them and so these are the four things i look at number one scale the entrepreneur number two scale the market number three skill the deliverable
(14:20) number four scale the business now from a equation standpoint because this is how all these things work together a level 10 entrepreneur on a level one opportunity will still do pretty well but not that great opportunity is a function of two of these things the market times the scalability of the deliverable if you've got a num nuts on a level 10 opportunity they'll still make money some of you guys know them some of you guys are them and then finally the business acumen is to understand how the actual enterprise itself has to scale all right so let's start with the first one
(15:02) you are not making as much as you want because you are not as good as you think you are fact if someone in your marketplace dare i say competitor is making more than you it is because they are better than you at the game do not throw stones at them throw stones at your ego instead admit deficiencies and learn their strengths it will be the only way to beat them if we can admit the deficiency then at least we can create space to learn so how do we get better looking the entrepreneur is the first and most important thing that we do when we're looking at trying to get into a business and so every business is
(15:38) bottlenecked by the entrepreneur in one of three ways and so if you're the entrepreneur this is you number one you'll either lack a skill number two you will lack a character trait number three you will lack a belief so imagine a ladder and you can think of this as you've got traits you've got beliefs and you've got skills if any side of that ladder is missing no matter how develop the other components you will be limited to the lowest rung it's just like this is this is the theory of constraints right just visualized so fun activity
(16:15) i will tell you the problem and you tell me whether it was a skill deficiency a trait deficiency or a belief deficiency a long time ago in a galaxy far away i had 10 businesses i also had no money i had six gyms i had a turn around business four gyms i had a chiropractor agency i had a dental agency yeah i think that's it it's a six plus yeah right nine or ten a lot plenty my lovely wife laila who is not my wife at the time said uh you need to pick something uh or you're gonna you know or i'm leaving and i was like oh man that is a high stake i
(16:58) should pick something and so uh i ended up picking something what do you think the issue was what was my deficiency as an entrepreneur was it a skill gonna get hands for skill hands for trait hands for belief interesting okay well this is my opinion the lesson is niche slapping fallacy which is the fallacy that if i pursue all of them one of them will work out which is a fallacy it is false when in reality all of them could have worked out but none of them will work out if you pursue them all and so many of you probably have your hand in two things you're like i'm not really sure which one it is [ __ ] pick
(17:44) pick because the people you're competing against who are beating you just have one thing and imagine right now for a moment that one of those businesses disappeared everything that you have on that business just vanishes how easy would it be to make the other one win so just do that so the lesson was the niche lapping fallacy what i lacked was focus and for me i think focus is a character trait so that was a trait deficiency but i wasn't done yet i still had more things that i was not successful because of so this is me talking about my grand
(18:20) plans too this is at my first location by the way this is how i was showing how i wanted to build america's next gym and so sorry it's really cute um and so anyways i went to this mastermind uh it was russell brunson's inner circle this is five or six years ago and i said here are my grand plans i've got six locations i've got my next four picked out and i told him about how our model worked and everything and he said i think it's a terrible idea and like my heart sank because i was like i looked up to this guy so much
(18:50) because i was like god i mean if i can just get one thing from this guy and he said alex you have a level 10 skill set in a level two opportunity you shouldn't be running gyms you should be teaching gyms what you do and that's where it's like the big frameworks that change your life and that's what i'm trying to do with this presentation for somebody in the room is that it's the big strategic decisions that make the big impacts in our lives it's not the incremental gains it's the rich dad who says why are you
(19:19) even bothering with this this is not big enough you're never going to achieve scale running a liquor store it's just not going to happen right but you need someone like that from the outside to get that perspective and so this was what i got from russell years ago and so can anyone identify the deficit that i was suffering at this point in my career was it a skill or a belief belief and so this was actually my trajectory of me as a multi-gym owner i had lots of skills i had decent character traits i think
(19:54) but i didn't know that it was possible i didn't know that that was something that you could do and so i switched from being a multi-gym owner to a licensor and so finally this is what a skill deficiency looks like and i'll give you one that i hear all the time in internet marketing i'm sure ryan has heard this as well no good sales people exist no one can sell like i can sell my sales team is so inconsistent some months they close a lot sometimes they close a little i want to kill them and sometimes i don't want to kill them sound familiar anyone
(20:27) this isn't a problem it is a skilled efficiency you lack the skill of recruiting higher interviewing training and managing a high performance sales team that's all it is and so it's not that this does not exist it's that i do not have the skills to conquer this problem and so here's a pro tip or a thought is binaries versus continuums so if you might check the box and say well i know how to manage a sales team the question is not whether or not you know how to manage the sales team but how well you can manage a sales team it's not a binary it is a continuum and
(21:02) as a fun thought all of these things exist on a continuum your skills exist on a continuum your traits exist on continuum it's not whether you're honest or not it's how honest are you so the best way to learn is to phrase your bottleneck or complaint into a solvable question my sales team is inconsistent how do i learn to create consistency in sales simple right and skill i'm not going to get into how to learn skills but this is the the quick quick bit comes from repetition and feedback aka volume the volume of work that you do which is why i think we need to make active income cool again all right so
(21:39) i uh just looked at my crm this is years ago and i was able to pull the stats from my personal closing because you have to say who closed something in a crm for gyms and over a three and a half year period i had closed 4 000 sales in the crm these are one-on-one sales and so i often get the question alex you seem so certain or you're so good at these things how do i shortcut that and the reality is that most people don't have that rocky cut scene of eating [ __ ] and they're not willing to go through it and maybe you are going through it right now and so my promise to you is that your
(22:20) work works on you more than you work on it you build your character through the work that we do we increase our capacity to do work itself and so if you can think about the work that you're doing is increasing that trait rather than the output of the work then i think it will help a lot of people get through some of the harder times it did for me and so some of the things some of the sayings that i have in my community are do the boring work and outwork yourself doubt because conviction doesn't come from positive
(22:51) affirmations in the mirror it comes from having done something so many [ __ ] times that you're bored of it because it's like well obviously this is how you sell obviously this is how you scale a sales team because you've done it so many times and i was on a podcast not that long ago for young male entrepreneurs and the the guy was like hey you know i really hear what you're coming from you know i know you did your all those years of eating [ __ ] that no one talked about um and so for all the audience that just wants to like shortcut all that
(23:19) what's your advice and i was like you'll never beat me because you're not willing to do it and so i think that the biggest deficiency that people have is their expectations and so because we have these very lofty expectations everyone's trying to become a millionaire in 90 days when if i were to get you to sign a contract this is i promise you'll be a millionaire in five years but you won't earn anything for five years until you become a millionaire would you be willing to sign it most people say they would but they don't live like they would and i promise you that if you live like
(23:49) you would you'll hit it but everyone just starts over every 90 days thinking that this is going to be the thing when you could have just had that slow gradient that will get you there eventually so i'd rather get rich for sure than get rich quick and so the best part about all this stuff is that skills traits and beliefs all compound and that is what yields crazy outside returns seemingly overnight and so this is actually one of my favorite parts of the presentation just side out um so let me give you an example of someone who's good at math let's say
(24:17) you're anybody here good at math born good at math cool so i wanted to make this into into individual slides so pretend each of these lines are not shown until i say them cool great all right so let's say you're good at math all right cool not very monetizable all right moving along let's say you're like you know what i'm going to start bookkeeping i want to learn how to you know keep books like okay cool now you have something you can at least monetize and then you say no i'm going to get an accounting degree i'm learning how to do accounting
(24:46) okay now this is something that's really becoming a career you can feed your family etc and then you say you know what i'm starting to get in a tax strategy then all of a sudden you learn how you can you can help businesses avoid tax drag as my lawyer says um and then you learn into you you learn about insurance because you're like oh this is cool too and it has really cool ramifications also for tax but also for some some investment stuff okay that's cool and then you learn how to negotiate deal structure ah now we're can you
(25:13) start seeing how the person changes as we're talking about adding these skills to the repertoire first you're talking about a bookkeeper then an accountant then maybe a controller now we're talking to cfo and then you have an amazing mastery of capital markets now you're a rainmaker and so the thing is is that for this little example it's one plus one plus one plus one plus one sub one uh equals a zillion right the point is that these skills stack on top of each other and create asymmetrical returns to all of
(25:46) these skills that came before it and as a fun example this was my actual skill stack so first i learned how to get in shape and work out then i learned about nutrition which was a whole nother thing then i learned how to sell so i started making a little bit of money then i learned how to oops market locally so i started getting leads and i already knew how to sell so then it was like boom it was like a huge magnifier on the other three skills i had before that then i learned how to operate so then i scaled to six locations and then i learned how to scale sales teams so i had six people selling at all those locations
(26:21) and then i learned how to market b2b nationally and because i already knew how to scale sales teams i'd been doing it for years i knew how to do high volume transactions i knew how to operate a big business because i had 40 employees when i was 25. so i had all these other things but as soon as i had that belief that i had a different vehicle that i could pursue it in we went from zero to 28 million a year in 20 months pretty cool and so as a different example here's jay-z's little skill stack he learned how to uh man see if i if i could have like
(27:02) revealed it later it would have been funnier but it's okay so he had rhythm right he had a natural skill or procrivility proclivity towards rhythm all right then he learned how to write lyrics and rhymes right then he learned how to sell got people his cds and get on stage right then he learned how to promote himself then he learned how to create a label and then he learned how to recruit other talent and then he got beyonce right and so the thing is is this making sense and so what might be valuable for you because i think i've just been through an introspective period is to think what is
(27:37) my skill stack and what are my deficiencies and which of these deficiencies are keeping me from what i want and why am i not working on them cool so does every human here see how you can become an entrepreneur through higher leverage through auditing and improving your skills traits and beliefs yes all right awesome check the box so framework number two scale the market so uh i went to this mastermind all the people in this little picture actually do 600 million dollars a year in revenue which is pretty cool and i had this really interesting experience because i was one of the smaller guys in the room in terms of
(28:18) revenue uh at the time i think we were doing 35 or 40 million somewhere in there um and i was like why are these guys making more money than me because i was like i was like i don't think these guys are smarter than me i was like why why are they making more than me and so i was left with one thing right and the answer was they picked better markets so when i looked at what all of these guys were doing almost all of them were mass market they were selling something that was expensive and they could target the world and i was like huh they have better markets than me and i was running
(28:49) up into this this cap of my market right around 30 or 40 million and so here's a quick little framework for you guys in terms of how to pick your market because many times i said that the equation here right entrepreneur level 10 times market level 10 times delivery vehicle which i'll get to in a second level 10 times business acumen is what makes builds fortunes all right so the quick answer was you have to select the avatar that you can provide the most value to the number one question i get which which avatar should i pursue the one you can help the most
(29:22) simple the medium answer is pick an avatar so that you can productize your service and provide that value with low operational drag and that's why you pick one so you can do the same thing over and over again and get better and better and better at it so you don't have to spend as much resources to do the same level of value which is create margins which is what you can take home and spend on lamborghinis cool so this is my live speech answer if you had one thing to get with your hot dog stand so i give everybody here a hot dog stand
(29:51) and you have one competitive advantage what would you want would you want the best location would you want the best ingredients would you want the best tasting hot dogs best marketing what would you want ah someone's read the book uh and uh this is actually a story of a marketing professor who says this at the beginning of every marketing thing uh of course they said what you want is a starving crowd because no matter how shitty your location is if when the football game lets out and everyone's drunk at two o'clock in the afternoon and you're the only hot dog stand there and you've got
(30:29) a starving crowd coming to you you're gonna sell out your hot dogs they could be dog [ __ ] you're gonna sell them right they probably won't even care right and so these are the four attributes that i look for in a market that i want to pursue one is pain right they must not want but desperately need what i have to sell them number two they must be able to afford what i want to sell them a friend of mine uh had a business where he could help people improve resumes to get more jobs problem they didn't got no money right can couldn't afford his services
(31:06) the third is tactical is you want him to be easy to target right it's amazing if you want to find you know vegan grandmas or whatever but if you can't tactically target them it's one of those things that i would just cross out and be like sounds hard there's going to be other hard things i'd rather not add one to my list and then finally growing a good friend of mine had a had an ad platform that he sold to newspapers and tries he might it was growing and then his growth slowed and then it started to shrink and he could not figure out what it was he was like i need new hooks and he knew offers and he
(31:38) couldn't figure out he's a smart dude and i was like hey lloyd i was like you think it might be because you're selling the newspapers shrinking 25 per year compounding right it's just the big obvious thing so if you're going to go into business you might as well do something with the tailwind if you got the choice might as well pick something that's growing right i know this stuff sounds simple but some of you guys are in shrinking markets so i'm like why rich dad poor dad right just make the smarter decision so i'm going to skip through this stuff
(32:09) i hit it most of it um and i'll just i'll say this one little story that i like a lot um warren buffett talked about one of his the smartest classmate and his closest friend from columbia and he said this guy was brilliant he was hardworking really high character dude he's like and i went to go build my partnership the berkshire hathaway well eventually would become um and he went into the steel business he said we did dramatically different even though we both had the same skills and level of skill
(32:40) and he said and that's what taught me that it was far more important what boot you are in rather than how hard you row and i think a lot of you guys are in row boats and you need a bigger opportunity vehicle and so the old vc saying is great entrepreneur poor market market wins poor entrepreneur great market market wins that's why when people are looking at investing they're like what markets do i want exposure to why don't i just ride the tailwind so now once you've selected a better market you're going to want to scale right right
(33:17) so um i'll skip the story but sure [ __ ] it short story uh i had an agency owner came up to me he's like alex i've scaled my agency everything's saturated i can't get any more clients should i enter another market guys doing 2 million bucks a year spending 50 000 a month on ads and i was like you're right chiropractors are completely tapped out the 10 billion a year that goes to chiropractors and total revenue your rinkading two million dollar marketing agency has completely saturated whatever shall i do great question
(33:53) friend these are the five ways you can scale your market so let's just use salon owners as an example let's say that's your your avatar of who you're going after whatever so there's your ideal market way number one you can go up market all right so that would be going to multi location owners chains franchises etc number two you go down market go to hair stylist people who will eventually become your avatar in time number three you can go to an adjacent market so something that's very similar in terms of the core desires of the customers that you're serving right so
(34:23) it might be lashes and nails you can go broader which just means going even wider right lashes nails skid cribs med spas you know salons massage etc right or you can go deeper in your existing market which if i did tell you that is usually my favorite which is buy competitors and go figure out new platforms add outbound to your system increase your ad budget it's just doing more of the thing that you're already doing which if you ever get anything common themes for me is do the boring work if something's working do more of it usually works better great so does everyone see how you can
(35:03) enter a better market and then scale it framework number two boom check it all right number three this framework that i'm about to share with you is the opportunity lens through which i look at all opportunities that i want to pursue all right it perfectly tracks my progression this is actually pretty cool so i got this i borrowed part of this from naval ravicon um who's really brilliant you can follow him on twitter um but there's four four c's to leverage all right i said the whole premise of this presentation is leverage so entrepreneur check that
(35:35) box mark it check that box now scaling the deliverable so i'm looking at a company i want to make the deliverable more scalable increase the profit margin here's how you think about it so the first level of leverage is labor so back in the day this is the only kind of leverage that's how the pyramids were built that's how ancient royalty had they just had bodies right the problem with bodies nowadays is that you need permission to do things right and so you have to ask people to do things or pay them to do things otherwise they won't do them it's such a bummer right we'd make so much more
(36:04) money if we didn't have to do that second our second level of leverage and this is a higher level of leverage is capital this is what the next generation of billionaires and fortunes were built off of buffett monger etc once again they used other people's money so permission is required unfortunately can't just take the money um but you can still make a lot of money just leveraging capital right and at this point in time it was leveraging capital times labor the third of this is code the difference here is that this is permissionless if you write software you
(36:38) don't need to ask permission to duplicate it it just will continue to deplete over and over again right at no cost so if you look at the mailchimp founders it was code that is what created their billions and then finally you've got content or media right that's how joe rogan can sell his podcast for 100 million dollars what's his product media it costs zero cost of replication all right i'm gonna i'm gonna bring this home in a second i promise you'll like where we're going all right and then you'll notice that above the top line
(37:09) zero permission is required for either of those things and that is where the new fortunes are being built and right now if you look at that pyramid and you're like i'm not on that pyramid you should get on that pyramid because that's where all the fortunes are and if you look at the very top here these are guys that use all four bezos zac dorsey they've got labor working for them they've got capital working for them they've got code working for them and they have content and media working for them all of them
(37:34) with permissionless leverage interesting cool we call that a leveraged four banker it was funnier on the plane when i added that slide so i was only able to see this trend after i had made these jumps so my goal is by showing you this trajectory you can do it proactively alright so each opportunity jump that i'm about to show you 10x to my income so at first i was an employee i was a management consultant i was someone else's labor i was making four figures a month then i became a trainer i was my own labor i'm my own master right so i
(38:09) became self-employed i jumped to five figures a month then i became a gym owner and then i got to finally use labor as leverage i got to use other people's time right and then i went to six figures a month then and this is a big pivot i went from leveraging labor to leveraging labor and media which is i started licensing right i started licensing something that has no cost to replicate all right and that's when we started making a million dollars a month i'm talking income not revenue here by the way next level is eight figures a month and this is where i think we're headed we'll
(38:46) do about 85-ish million this year we'll see how the quarter ends um and this is because now i added capital to this mix now i can buy things right so that gives me more leverage to expand what i'm already doing and so this is what i think will get me to eight figures a month i'll let you know when i get there um and then finally nine figures a month is doing the whole stack right do i know what i'm gonna do there not yet but i got summers okay so mind you this is a framework it's a tool all models have limits but it has served me well and thinking how to
(39:17) expand is this helping you sweet so you guys want a really cool bonus framework that i've been thinking about for a long time i have six minutes left so you won't get it okay pretend you never uh that all right okay so um cool you said yes to this fantastic okay so this is low leverage this actually took me like you know these little things take like five minutes each to the little lines and [ __ ] anyways uh so here's framework number three skilling and deliverable so this is the delivery cube so when i look at a
(39:54) business that i'm looking to buy into or improve etc these are six different types of questions that i ask which is number one can i do this thing in a one-on-one setting a small group setting or a one-to-many setting and can i change the price accordingly number two is this a do it yourself a done with you or a done-for-you solution can i move along that spectrum in either direction in a way that might optimize my outcome for better profits number three what level of support do i want to offer this is a little bit more service space but hopefully it'll help
(40:25) some of you do i want to do tech support do i want to do chat support do i want to do email support do i do phone support do you want to do zoom call support what type of support do i want to provide do i want to probably different levels at different income levels or different payment levels something to consider consumption for if i'm licensing material do i want it to be written do i want it to be live like this do i want it to be audio only do i want it to be video how am i going to package the information
(40:53) number five speed and convenience if someone has help from me is it 24 7 is it nine to five do they have a response time of under a minute do they have a response time of two days right these are all variables that you can use to increase or decrease the value or margin that you are using to deliver and then finally this is probably my favorite of the six boxes if you can have a favorite on a framework about delivery one is i want you to imagine the value that you provide right now and the price you charge for it okay
(41:30) now i want you to 10x that price now i want you to think about what you would deliver if that were actually your price how much more would you do interesting thought process blue sky do it on your own time but it's a good thought experiment you should do with your team number two think again about your your your current product if you had to deliver more value than you currently are but for one-tenth the price what else would you need to build that would cost nothing to replicate to provide the value
(42:09) and number three if i if i could have a favorite question of my last framework of number box six this would be it if right now the gods of marketing ryan dice gives the god voice and says you can no longer get new customers from marketing and the only thing you have are your existing customers and the only way to get a new customer is for those customers to bring them to you how different would your client experience look food to think on the thing is that people think that word of mouth is dead that book right now if you just do the math is selling like 250 000 a month of books
(42:51) off of word of mouth and no funnels people can spread stuff faster than ever before we're just not taking advantage of it because we're too greedy and too short-term thinking like if people aren't referring your stuff fix the stuff why bother promoting it people don't want to talk about it i don't know time check for myself apparently i'm on time um everything is for sale and this is a this is another quick framework i'll give you for scaling delivery i have a ton of these these are just two that i wanted to bring up so these are the only things you can ever sell because i've been trying to think through what are the base chunks based units of [ __ ] you
(43:26) sell all right you got products you got services you got access you have media you have risk and you have money only things you can sell and i challenge you to think about something else and if you do figure one out that doesn't include these as base chunks i'll add it all right because i've been thinking a lot about this and what's even cooler about this is that each of these components have physical and digital pieces so a physical product would be a bag of you know dog bones right a digital product is what a lot of you guys sell like a course right
(43:56) a physical service would be like a massage a digital service might be marketing physical access would be access to this event or to a real estate building that you rent every day so that you can have shelter uh digital access might be if there was a virtual recording of this live digital access you have physical media like a billboard digital media you guys should hopefully know what that is you're here you've got physical risk like your building is being insured and you've got digital risk like a cyber attack and then you've got physical money and everybody knows about cryptocurrency
(44:33) this is kind of cool the different things you can sell so here's the challenge is can you think through how you can add one of these other components to your existing offer stack without providing a lot of operational drag but while also providing value all right and so i got a couple i presented this to a couple a smaller group and they were like what about experiences it was like experiences are products plus service plus access a business is all of those things chunked together titles like if i wanted to make you a
(45:02) knight right what do you get you get access if i wanted to give you ip that is access to products so when you're thinking through this like those are the base chunks that build everything and so i think sometimes when we can just boil it down to one of the base units it can be useful in thinking what else can i sell or what can i transform my existing things into that are more valuable and so here's an easy thought this is one of the more genius things that we did is that if you're an anybody here an ad agency
(45:32) couple people well i'll tell you what we did is that we uh we had the agency side and they were like huh what if we just find the winners and then license the winners every single month to everybody else who wants to run their own ads all margin great idea made us an extra million a month in profit just try it good recommend [Music] number two add an experience to continuity right or add physical products to digital experiences right these are all different ways you can mix and match these things time check return fantastic does everyone see i can add leverage to your
(46:12) deliverable from those two frameworks i shared yes say yes awesome all right check the box number four scale the business so we covered a lot today and we feel like this a little bit all right fantastic so i'll wrap this up by showing you what we can focus on at each revenue level in that we what we focus on at each revenue level for our portfolio businesses when we come in to scale them all right so these are my last five years of revenue um from 2017 until now all right if you notice that's what being stuck looks like i didn't know what to do and so um anybody want to know what
(46:47) happened there yes cool i read this book which i recommend it's a good book but there was one chapter in it that completely uh made everything click for me and so i applied that book um because up at that point i intimately understood what it took to get to you know 35 40-ish million but i didn't know how to get past it now i do and that's what i'm gonna share with you all right so who here is zero to a million can we leave egos at the door okay cool one product one avatar one channel if you have multiple businesses and you're under seven figures a year stop more businesses clearly aren't
(47:25) making more money one product one avatar one channel but i thought i should have multiple acquisition channels you don't even [ __ ] make money yet so no one product one avatar one channel the problem that you're trying to solve here is that you have no [ __ ] clue what you're doing all right the objective is consistently sell something to people actually want that's the objective that is why we talked about picking the right market first 1 to 10 million the objective is to increase the lifetime gross profit per customer i don't like saying lifetime value because no one knows what it means and it's uh
(48:00) revenue for the most part i like to think about what is my gross margin on the things that i am selling right the problem is that most times when you're at that million-ish you're not making enough money take home and so the problem is that you're not making enough profit per customer to scale which is what is required to go from one to 1 million to 10 million and so the objective is to add higher leverage deliverables so that you can make more money hence why we went over the deliverables make sense
(48:23) awesome 10 to 50 million what happens here is that your consistency of delivery starts to drop and so what you need to do is you actually have to start professionalizing the business this is where you actually pay taxes and you know don't go to jail and pay payroll and all that kind of stuff right and the problem is that you've inconsistent delivery you have poor tracking your crm issues are [ __ ] and your finances are a mess all right the solution is you have to hire a high level experience you've already done this before all right so
(48:49) that is where framework number four is this is scaling the business this is actual business acumen all right and then finally framework x uh and framework one is alive this entire time because you have to become the entrepreneur that is required at each level sometimes your best is not good enough because what is required is more than your current best and so i think rather than thinking like i'm trying my best it's like well it's clearly not working so why don't we just try fixing the problem and ignoring your feelings
(49:18) so framework x attract talent all right and this was the piece that i was missing is that what happens is you have to grow revenue streams innovation dies at this level of business because one entrepreneur can only do so much right and so you need other stallions to come in who can drive revenue all right and so at this point the business actually becomes a conglomeration of many businesses so think about it having 10 ceos that all run their own p ls that are actually growing their own mini businesses within the larger context of
(49:46) yours if you think about amazon amazon isn't one business it's a zillion businesses globe together so as you scale it becomes more globbing things together becomes more acquisition etc as a result of this all right so here's the solution is you have to get new talent incentivized to drive growth so i'm going to skip this story you guys want to hear a cool mental model alex sharpens right here so there's six external this is the function is how i define them let me a five and just yeah so one is lead gen two lead nurture three sales four customer
(50:20) success five ascension six resell all right these are the things that all of you probably know how to do hopefully right this is how you scale these are the six internal business functions that mirror the external everybody knows their cpcs their cpms what percentage click-through rate their speed to response hopefully what percentage close rate you guys have but i'll bet you if i ask you how many applications do you get a month what percentage of those applications do you get to book a call what percentage of interviews are you are you transitioning into a full-time role what does your onboarding look like
(50:55) for a new employee what does that training look like how do we ascend those people what is their career path is it clearly defined for them with role a title and pay and then finally what's our retention on this and i'll tell you the quick story for why this is important so i had a team of right now we have a big cold call team we have about 26 guys and the lowest wrong on that is cold calling so they call people who don't know and so for those who are like our sales team sucks like try calling people who don't even know who you are and then get them
(51:26) to buy a 40 000 thing so our sales team is pretty good so we had this goal for two quarters my sales director said we're gonna we're gonna add another 10 bdrs and i said great goal two quarters later we haven't added 10 bdrs so third quarter in a row i was like what's your goal he's like i'm going to add 10 bdrs and i was like i feel like we've done this before so why haven't you added the 10 bdrs and uh because this is where we're like okay this many calls equals this much sales blah blah blah blah right
(51:57) everyone's done this what do you think the bottleneck was and i was like wait a second how many people are you interviewing a week five from hr and i was like well five's not going to get us there because that was just replacing the churn of the front line position and just like you have churning customers you have turned in employees especially at the front line and so when we discovered that the actual limiting factor was hr not running enough ads to get enough interviews and changing the actual process we had 10 hired in two weeks and it took us three quarters to get there
(52:30) and so two weeks later now we have double the applications that are coming in for our business and i'll bet you that all of you have one of these things you're one amazing hire away from all the growth you ever wanted you just got to identify that that's actually probably most of your bottleneck especially as you scale cool so does everyone have a clear idea what they need to focus on to scale their business at their current level yes check box number four awesome so did everyone get something they can take away hopefully and drag their future by the balls towards the present

Transcript:
(00:00) this is brutally honest advice for men to win in their 20s I made my first million at 26 I crossed 100 million net worth at age 31 and this is my road map for things that I learned along the way I'd like to normalize a 6 day week 12-h hour per day work week for men between 16 and 28 and despite all the selfworth voodoo that social media and Society will tell you you are valued based on your utility and when you're young you have none but you have a lot of energy and so trade that energy for experience points and become useful the first rule
(00:35) of Entrepreneurship according to Alex is use what you've got and the reason I like that is because many people always don't start things because they don't have the capital they don't have the connections they don't have the whatever insert insecurity or projection of blame and power they want to put on but the first rule is you use what you have and so it's about resourcefulness not resources and so if you have energy you use the resource you have you use what you've got to trade to develop experience to develop proof that you can
(01:07) get good at a skill and you only get good at a skill by not being good at a skill and repeating it and then failing at each time and then making incremental improvements which take many many repetitions until you actually get good and this may be a little controversial but I'm not here to be nice to you I'm trying to be kind which might mean that it hurts a little bit so let's make this practical if you have less than $100,000 in savings and you would like to to have $100,000 or more in savings these are the things that I would recommend doing and that means that you have to check out your ego it's your ego is gone for
(01:37) this all right you don't care what other people think because they're not going to be there in 10 years all right because you have a whole new group of friends that are way [ __ ] better and cooler so one stop eating out discount groceries only that's if you're super poor if here's my caveat if you know how to make money you already have a base level of skills then eating Chipotle and whatever whatever you can door Dash it in so that you can keep working the moment I realize I can make $500 every 30 minutes by selling I was like oh I'm
(02:04) never buying I'm never cooking food or grocery shopping ever again anything that was less than $500 an hour was was now immediately outsourced all right but this advice is for people who are super broke okay so if you don't have the skill set yet at all and you're struggling to just get things going then you need to be completely on the defensive so that you can have enough money so that you can start taking bets cuz the only way that you're going to get ahead is that you have to make bets you got to make bets on education you got to make bets on opportunities you
(02:33) got to make bets on inventory you got to make make bets on software you want to start a Shopify score you want to start a school Community you want to start something it's still going to cost some money right you might have to buy a camera you have to buy some software that helps you edit videos like there's some expenses all right and so having a big stockpile allows you to be patient the the more money you have the longer you out you can think because you don't have to worry about tomorrow you know that next month and the month after and
(02:57) the month after taking care of because even if you made no money you've got enough that's how you can start thinking longterm people are like think think longterm think long term but like unless if you have payroll and you've got or you've got rent or you've got you've got groceries to pay you can't think long-term because you're in survival mode and so I'm trying to get Survival to be as low as humanly possible for you so that you could get into Thrive mode but it's all relative if you make 40 Grand a month and spend 40 Grand a month
(03:20) you're going to be in the same survival mode but if you make 40 Grand a month and spend four you're going to have you're going to have every month you make 10 months worth of income and so in two months you've got you've got 20 months saved up you're good and then you can get super aggressive that other 36 and start really betting to to double down all right so here's the very broke five six things that you can do to immediately spend way less one stop eating out discount groceries only two stop buying new clothes go to Goodwill only three only attend free friend events all right so think of what I just
(03:53) said think about all the events that friends will tell you to come to weddings Bachelor parties uh birthdays um just nights out because it's thirsty Thursday whatever only attend free friend events and if they don't support your goals they're not your friends think about that if I said hey I've got this goal and I said hey there's this human being and he wants to get you to not have the goal would you describe them as a friend or an enemy think about it some of you some of the people in your life that you call friends are actually your
(04:23) enemies you just don't know it now four take the rest of the time that you have to a apply to jobs that make more than your current job B pick up side hustle work C learn skills that you can trade for a higher hourly rate than you currently do when I say trade I mean you make more per hour than what your current current skills pay you all right and then five find the hardest worker in the room when you enter that new job or that new place and then double their level of input so if they knock on 100 Doors you knock on 200 they make a 100 dials you make 200 dials right when I had Jacob my young
(04:59) neighbor I gave him this exact advice and he was expected to on his team do $100 a day he did between 300 and 400 and so guess what he got better faster and then once you follow all of those steps this is what you need to do next wait 36 months and this is what I mean by patient with your outputs impatient with your inputs and the crazy thing is that you can change your life in one decision I can get drunk Drive in a car and change my life forever right I can happen like that but it can happen just like that the other way it's just that
(05:32) the outcome's delayed that's the only difference you can change your life today In This Moment by making these decisions and the and your Life Path will have veered you will have changed Direction your tree of of life will move it's just that it takes time for that new direction to bear fruit whereas you can poison the fruit in a second you can kill a tree real fast you just can't grow one real fast but it doesn't mean that if a seed's planted and you're watering it it's not growing it just takes a second to get above the surface I think you can solve a lot of male Problems by getting in shape and making
(06:02) money you'll still have problems they'll just be smaller and you'll have more resources to handle them so let's talk about the making money part first fundamentally in order to make money you have to provide value to some someone either an employer or customers but either way you have utility which you exchange for money and so by making that a goal then it means that you're going to increase your own usefulness and so somebody who is more useful all of a sudden develops other ancillary skills around that utility that they can use in other parts of their lives if you're
(06:35) good at sales guess what you can do when you're talking to girls you can use the same conversational skill set if you're trying to negotiate uh a purchase for a car or a house or whatever like those skills generalize they transfer across domains and so a lot of people think it's like well when would I ever be a salesperson or when would I ever be outbound what like it doesn't matter it's not about that thing the thing is it's like real life skills actually do generalize like this isn't elementary school or or middle school when you're
(07:04) learning calculus or algebra or whatever and thinking like what am I going to use this in real life one it is real life right now two these skills do get used across domains of all of my friends who are s Millionaires and billionaires to a person they started in what I would consider a high volume sales environment so that's either door knocking cold calling or some sort of in-person business where they had many many many conversations with strangers on a daily basis and I think there's and I'm talking not like a a month or six months
(07:40) I'm talking like three five years where no one knew their name they were just some faceless representative that stood there at the door saw people sold memberships sold Insurance sold solar sold whatever and the thing is is like skill development happens through volume and feedback loop so it's the number of repetitions you have times the amount of improvement between repetitions brute forcing the amount of volume definitely will help if you can give yourself feedback I've seen people say hey I've actually made a 100 pieces of content now this is like 1% of people because most people do nothing but of the 1% of
(08:17) people who say okay I post it every day for a year the thing is is they didn't do the most important part which is you don't just like make a video and post it and just every day like hey make a video post it make a video post it you have to look at what you did and what you could do better fundamentally that is the the Cornerstone of feedback and so you look at the top 10 videos you made over the last month and you say okay how do I do more of that and how do I do less of the bottom 10% and you just pick one thing
(08:41) that you did well there and you try and do it in every video going forward and that develops a checklist of things to do so that you develop a skill and So speaking from my own experience the first sales conversation I ever had first off I had zero sales training no one was like hey this is the script this is how you go over they're like hey here's a new lady go sign her up and so I was like okay and I didn't even know this was a sale I didn't know the I didn't know the term sales I just he said go sign her up and I said okay and
(09:10) so I walked over and and she was like Hey you know I want to know more about the gym and I said well do you want to know and she was like well I mean like how much is it and I was like oh it's uh whatever 150 bucks a month and she was like okay and I was like you want to sign up and she said I left my credit card at home and I was like okay and she was like I'll be back with the credit card and I was like cool and so I walked out and uh it was like 2 minutes right and I walked out and the owner Sam was there with a few of other other gym owners he had
(09:42) brought a few gym owners in so it was like three or four gym owners there and uh he was like damn he was like that was fast and I was like yeah he's like you closed her and I was like yeah and and he was like with a credit card and I was like oh no she's she's going to go get it and she'll be back and they just looked at each other and then looked back at me and then just started laughing at me uncontrollably like couldn't breathe at how dumb what I had just said was and the thing is is I had no experience and I and I tell that story because so many people assume that like I walked out of the womb closing
(10:15) deals you know what I mean like hey nurse what are you doing later you know what I mean like but it wasn't like that right like I didn't know I I didn't I even know the term and so you know over time I just started developing like okay well what do you do and I watched other people say I was like okay they start with asking them why someone's there ask them about their goals ask them things that they've done in the past that didn't work I like okay that that that seems to work okay and then when they asked them to buy then if they don't want to say yes they ask them more questions rather than just
(10:45) saying okay so I started to develop at least an understanding of the framework of how sales occurred but I still wasn't good right and so then I went through like that Rocky cut scene period where this is where I'm very grateful for this is that uh Facebook ads is when I started running them in 2013 where super cheap and so it actually gave me so many repetitions because not only was I taking 15 to 20 consults a day in person I was also working leads and so I'm talking to strangers over the phone to set the appointments and so all I got was just names on a list and I would
(11:15) call them set the appointment like who's this again you know all of that um and then and by the way if you are local um you just say the name pause with a question mark at the beginning you're like John and then they'll be like yeah you're like this is Alex I'd pause and they'd be like they're like who the [ __ ] is Alex I'd be like from Facebook you signed up for our blah blah blah blah blah our thing yeah I'm just calling to make sure that uh you're not a crazy person from the internet and neither am
(11:43) I I was like we're actually on the corner of X and Y I was like right next to the 7-Eleven they're like yeah I'm like okay cool well I just wanted to see what time you want to come come by I was like we have the sweetest facility in the world not really but it's uh at least pretty decent for this area but we have five out of five coolness and they would just laugh they be like I can make it at six and I'm like six works I was like do you want a picture of me or just of the address and they're like just the
(12:05) address I'm like all right sounds good I'll text it to you and I'll see you later today right so that kind like notice the like half Giggles between each word like it's it's showing that you're positive tone person high energy and someone's like man this guy seems cool or this gal seems cool right and so they're more likely to show up they're more likely now if I maintain that tone if they give me an objection I can pivot really easily if I'm like neutral or like hi I saw that you signed up on the internet for our thing uh would you like to come in they're like uh well tell me
(12:34) more about it like well it's just you have no you have no room for messing up and so I always tried to have more Rapport and bring a lot of energy and the thing is is like if you've seen any of my content I'm not naturally like a high energy person um I will continue to work which is different than being like up here and so I developed a lot of things to try and keep myself energized and so I had a small trampoline that I would bounce on uh before and between every sales appointment it sounds ridiculous but if you I'm telling it's
(13:07) it's like a hundred bucks if you buy one of those little trampolines and you bounce either between sales calls or between people like I'd have people coming in as I was still bouncing and I'd be like I know this is ridiculous I was like but try and be in a bad mood on a trampoline you can't do it you can't do it you can't do it and I challenge you too you could be in a bad mood if you try jumping around like you feel like such a child it's ridiculous but what would happen is like I would really I would would also get a little bit exercise my blood would keep moving but it's also just like mentally um
(13:34) literally bouncing gave me a lot of energy for these appointments and so I say this because I developed all of these things over time and so if you're starting out you're not going to be good that's why you're new you have no experience but there's a difference between there's a story that um shoot I can't remember where it is but there was a foreign kid who had never seen a banana before and so the adult gave the kid a banana and so the banana so the kid took the banana and then bit right into it with the skin and everything and another child was like you're such an idiot and then the adult
(14:12) yelled at that child and said no he just doesn't know any better and there's a very big difference between being dumb and being inexperienced right now you just don't have reps and so you're going to make a lot of mistakes like biting into the banana like at for just walking letting someone walk away assuming it's a Clos when they say that they're just gonna come back and call you with their credit card right by the way that never happens um very rarely but instead uh you want to just peel that banana you want to bite into the banana bite into the orange all of those mistakes as
(14:43) quickly as possible and not judge yourself for making the mistake and see the mistake as part of the process of being like that didn't work that didn't work and if I develop enough of these doesn't works then you just kind of walk the the mindfield and you get to where you're trying to go and people are like wow you're so good at this and you're like oh no no I actually just know all the things not to say in a sale and then they end up buying I just avoid all that and then they buy and to be clear I
(15:08) think I have a similar piece of advice but for very different reasons of telling young men in general or men to work harder and it's not because I think it's some sort of you know beating your chest I'm an alpha whatever thing it's just that for me the point of my life is to become the best version of me and in order to do that I need to learn because there's huge subcrib between where I am and where I want to go and the discrepancy is going to get filled with skills which means that I need to do repetitions to acquire failures that I
(15:39) can learn from to get better from and if I can do more of that in a shorter period of time I will learn more skills and by definition I will shrink the distance between myself and my ideal self and so that is pretty much the only thought process I have around this and I also believe that you need to be patient with outputs and impatient with inputs so let me unpack that patience in general is figuring out what to do in the meantime so when someone says Hey be patient what they just mean is figure out something else to do in the meantime and so if I'm telling you to be patient
(16:17) with outputs it means that you basically just have to figure out something else to do in the meantime while you wait for outputs to occur because you can't output you can't money doesn't appear you have to do something and then money happens right but the doing something part is the thing that you can control the money happening is the part that you don't control that comes afterwards it's an outcome right and so when I say patient with outputs that's the first part the second part is impatient with inputs and so if being patient is figuring out what to do in the meantime
(16:46) impatience is doing the thing in the meantime right and so it's the opposite of that it's the thing you do in the meantime and so if you want to be impatient with the input the input is the thing that's the action you do and so so by delineating that if you hear yourself thinking man why hasn't this happened yet you're talking about outputs and that means great if I think that thought I need to do more of this input right and so use your input your action your doing this the thing you use your hands for as your coping mechanism
(17:20) for your impatience without outputs I want to say that one more time whenever you have that feeling that things should be happening faster use action as your coping mechanism I used to write this down a lot uh and say it which was action alleviates anxiety and so when I would have this anxiety about the future of like why haven't I made it yet why are these other people doing better than me like is is this not going to work what if I'm on the wrong path action alleviates anxiety the only thing I can control with that I was is that I would work is that I would get better and the
(17:54) key point there was that it wasn't just working for work's sake it was working with the intention to improve and so you want to do repetitions because by doing things more times you get better at them typically just by accident but if you were deliberate about the point of doing this when I started working at a gym going from a white collar job it wasn't because I wanted to become a trainer for the rest of my life it was because I wanted to learn the skills and then I knew that once I learned those skills if I owned a gym then I would know how to do the training
(18:24) part as well and that would be good for me and so then when I was a gym owner and when I started and started working at a gym I wanted to own a big chain of gyms that was my that was my whole goal to start with I wasn't getting into this for one like I never had the goal of only owning just one gym and so even when I started that gym the whole point and I worked all the time because I thought of all the things that I didn't know how to do yet and so it wasn't about great I've made it I own a gym it
(18:47) was like I'm so deprived of where I want to be I have I have to fill this Gap as fast as I possibly can and so that's why I spent so much time on this and got feedback from as many human beings as I possibly could who were ahead of me so I want to say this clearly once I start up my gym one I paid for a mastermind for gym owners before owning a gym and I did that because I figured well why would I start a gym until I learn all the stuff that you guys did wrong I was like I'll just learn from all y'all's mistakes it sounds like a great deal for me it
(19:18) almost felt unfair I was like yeah okay he said don't start at one of those locations he said have good storefront he said make sure that you have you know good parking I was oo these are all good you know good things she like don't go too big I was like okay that's good and they're like make sure your rent's under this per foot I was like all right make sure I got that right and so I took all these notes in that I would have just Mis made huge mistakes on the on the upfront now once I did start my gym what a lot of people don't know is that every
(19:41) weekend I would either be on phone calls or I'd be driving out to other gym owners and I would and thankfully because I was so young when I started my business they were just like they felt bad for me and so they would just sit there and I'd be like hey why do you do that hey why do you do that hey why do you do that and it was like you know they'd be like God you're such a pain in the ass but I just wanted to learn right but I was always like willing to help them with anything they had you know what I mean I was like let me show you
(20:05) the stuff that's working well for me and I would always just share it um and the thing is is I would go there and they would say they did something and I'd be like huh that's weird that's different than the other guy and I I like that way better it didn't mean I had to take everything as as fact but I got a lot of ideas from that and then I would use them and if they didn't work I would just toss them out and if they did I kept it and that's how I quickly iterated the gym model to become much better than a lot of people's models despite me being younger because I was
(20:30) able to leverage everyone else's experience as fast as I could and jam it into my own and so I think like the people who move faster than life learn faster and the only way you learn is by changing your behavior with the same conditions which means that if a person walks in I say this is my six-point script a person who's identical walks in right afterwards if I've learned something that script changes means same condition new behavior and so if you keep doing the exact same thing every single day then you may not be learning and it's a key point it's good to work
(21:02) hard but it's good to work hard and smart which means that the work you do gets better because you tweak things and so if you're not documenting the process that you have and I'm not saying you making content about it but literally looking back at game footage looking at the calls you did looking at the content you did I do this today people ask me like what are the masterminds you're into what are the courses you learn from I have now broken apart the learning process that I have that works best for me because I see the biggest gains in Improvement haven't come from advice for
(21:32) me for the most part they came from looking at data which was let me look at the last 2,000 ads I made let me look at the top 50 let me look at what these ones have in common let me look at what they don't look like compared to the bottom 50 okay these ones have these characteristics these don't I'll do more of this and less of that and then I do another 100 ads and I look at the top 10 again I say what do these ones have that these ones don't and I do that for sales calls I do that for Content I do that
(21:55) for meetings I do that for for businesses in general when you start zooming out and so that process of do a lot of volume then look at the outcomes that were good look at the activities that led to those outcomes that are positive do more of those activities look at the bottom percentages look at the things that led to not having that happen and do less of those and if you're younger and this is specific for everyone who's listening to this video if you're probably sub30 sub 28 maybe right if you're in your 20s or less you
(22:27) can probably get away with this which is that people ahead of you are more willing believe it or not to feel like they have status so you can give them status by saying be a mentor and the thing is a lot of young guys have a lot of ego right because you're trying to prove yourself trying to be a man whatever the thing is is that if you humble yourself it's not like there's some [ __ ] massive scoreboard where it's like who humbled themselves to whom across the whole us it doesn't it's not not exists it's just just within one Dynamic right and so if you go and say
(22:58) hey I don't know anything I'm happy to learn if you do that then a lot of people are like oh well he humbled himself well yeah I'm happy to teach you and the thing is they'll give you advice that's worth thousands of dollars years of your life for free if you just say you're better than I am at this but the thing is is that the end of the day none of it matters but scoreboard would be the thing that matters in business right and so the only thing that precedes the scoreboard is your learning I've spent ego points I've spent dollars I've spent
(23:30) time I've spent Social Capital I spent every resource that I had to get more learning faster because fundamentally the only thing and I think this is probably one of the biggest gifts my father gave me is believing that I am the asset I am investing in and the cool thing is is that you are the permanent hold right you can't sell you like you're you until you die and so this is the one asset you've got because you compound skills compound when you get really good at sales and really good at Finance guess what you can raise a billion dollars because you know how the finance World works and you know how the
(24:04) sales World works right if you know how to if you know how to code and market then guess what you can build software and sell it to gazillions of people because you have the product and the AC acquisition like skills stack disproportionately if you only know one you might not be able to make a tenth as much as if you know two now obviously those are big bucketed terms that have many many many skills underneath of them but fundamentally when you think about it that way you become a weapon so let's tackle the second part I said you you can solve a lot of male Problems by getting in shape and making money and so
(24:33) let's talk about the getting in shape side so you can avoid tons of problems in life by doing one thing going to bed on time and so instead of setting alarms to wake up set alarms to go to sleep on time it's hard to wake up late when you go to bed at 9: right and so the thing is is that that one simple Behavior actually can eliminate a lot of the things that derail men especially young men and so Charlie Monger talks about a lot which is like all I'd want to do is find out where I'm going to die and
(25:02) never go there the whole point is he thought so much more about avoiding stupidity than trying to be intelligent it's kind of like the stupidities are very easy to identify the intelligence is hard but if you avoid all stupidity you just become intelligent by default and so if you define intelligence the way I do which is rate of learning so how quickly you pick things up that is intelligence if you can avoid all of these things that make you look like an idiot right then you become more intelligent and so let's let's talk about this from the from the the getting
(25:34) in shape perspective show me a situation where you have two groups of men one group of men that is really out of shape and fat and another group of men that's really in shape that are going to outperform one another and this is generalized you have to take random sampling of the population bunch of in shaped guys a bunch of overweight guys who's going to do better at any task over and over again if we pick 10 tasks that are completely different the in shaped guys are going to do better than the out of shape guys period they're going to have more energy they're going
(26:01) to be more focused if it's anything inter related like inter relations based like those guys are going to close higher percentages if you're better looking you will close more if you're better looking you get paid more if you're better looking you get more promoted if you're better looking you do better in content period fight me and so the thing is is like if you have this one thing that affects every way that people see you and the only thing you have to do is control what you put into your mouth then don't you think it's worth developing that most basic skill
(26:32) of discipline at this point in your life because the thing is is that you want to get in shape young because if you're not in shape guess whose fault that is so get in shape now thing is is it costs time not money and right now you've got time and not money and time only becomes more expensive as you age so buy it now while time cost you the least and you have have the fewest responsibilities it'll help you no matter what life path you choose the thing that no one recognizes is that drinking cost you two days the day you drink and the day you recover and
(27:09) sometimes the weeks afterwards for the stupid thing you did while you were drunk that everyone else saw it reminds me of this quote from Muhammad Ali and I asked my team to pull it up because I think it's so good also because he was the greatest of all time and just a cool dude what's the the central part of your training is it running is it sparring or central part is dodging the nightclubs and the parties and the girls you want the truth and being in the bed by yourself 9:00 at night and if you can get by that you'll make it that's the truth now I tell you the
(27:44) truth you talk all that running and hitting the bags and jogging and vitamin you want dodging ladies is the main thing especially when you're pretty like me and I'll speak to myself personally when I had my intense periods of work I would take off for a long long time so the longest then I took off was two years while I was scaling gym launch from you know the 20 months we went from zero to 4 and a half million a month 4.
(28:10) 4 to be technical I didn't drink that whole period And once things settled out I was like all right I'm willing to drink again and right now acquisition. comom is scaling like crazy and so Lea and I both said let's just stop drinking for the foreseeable and same thing now so that was when I was in my 20s this is now when I'm in my 30s and I'll probably continue this until I feel like I'm at a place where things feel chill again and then like maybe I'll I'll partake again but the thing is is like if you're hungry argue me the opposite which is me
(28:38) drinking more will make it more likely for me to hit my goals I think you'd have a tough time making that argument and so right now everything's compounding is Amplified right the stuff you do now amplifies throughout your career and your life and so I would want to Stack as many advantages as I can to my favorite which is like I'm going to go to sleep on time I'm going to not drink right I'm going to get in shape right I'm going to do as many repetitions as I can I'm going to humble myself with people who are more experienced than I am even if I think I'm smarter than them they still know
(29:11) more and there's a big difference and this is what I think is really tough for younger guys is that your brain at 25 to you know like 25ish 25 to 30 is like Peak processing power but I'm way [ __ ] smarter now than I was then because I've still learned more and that's the thing is is that you may be smarter than someone in sheer processing power but they still might know more than you and so you can't live their life and especially if somebody is further ahead then they it still means that they have knowledge that you don't
(29:44) and so listen and humbling yourself to somebody even if you think you are smarter will teach you more because again argue the opposite I will learn nothing from no one how does that help you it helps you your ego feel good but at some point your ego is going to have to rectify its Good Feeling with reality which is that you're broke as [ __ ] and no one cares and so I would rather humble myself rather than have the world humble me this is a Bible quote that I just really like a lot it's Matthew 23:12 he said those who are
(30:14) humble will be exalted and whoever exalts himself will be humbled I actually told that to one of our our team the other day because I felt like his ego was getting a little bit bigger than it probably should have been and I said listen man I was like if you want to get humbled keep doing what you're doing I was like but if you want people to talk you up I was like humble yourself let your work work for you and then everyone else will exalt you and so I think most men want to be respected they don't have respect and so they compensate by exalting themselves
(30:42) because it makes them feel better in the short term but you look like an idiot in the long term and think about it like this like for some reason I don't know why we're wired this way but we say nice things about ourselves and we feel good but everyone else feels bad right if everyone else says nice things about you it doesn't make them feel bad to say it but it makes you feel good think about those people in your life who always like talk themselves up it's like what do you see you're like this guy's so insecure it's obvious and you look that
(31:07) way you don't feel that way but you look that way and some of the things that you develop as you get older is the separation between how I look and how I feel which is like oh even though this feels good I look dumb doing this your feelings can lie to you in terms of how well this behavior is serving you with your goals in the long term and while we're talking about your friends exalting you and your friends saying you're cool how much do their opinions of you really matter because now this is going to take a completely different direction than you expected which is you being humble is a description that other
(31:38) people would give to you but it relies on you caring a lot of what they think which is a double-edged SW and the younger you are actually at all points it hurts you it's kind of like the stock market one person two person one day or two days in the stock market it's just about sentiment but how big the stock goes over a decade is about how good the intrinsic stock is and so if a few people say you're an [ __ ] no big deal if everyone says you're an [ __ ] probably a problem right and so it's understanding the Nuance between that
(32:07) but your friend group has a disproportionate sway over your behavior and so your reference group is one of the number one correlations with how big your life gets or rather the goals you achieve now they've done the studies in terms of Finance because it's easy to quantify but your reference you're have the five people you compare yourself to not necessarily spend the most time with but compare yourself to are the ones that determine your future and so sometimes you have to like your goals more than you like your friends and every person who wants to do something
(32:42) in their life or has done something with their lives is going through the exact same chapter that you're going through right now and it's the lonely chapter it's the chapter where you don't fit in with your old friends but you don't have the achievements yet to fit in with a new group of friends and you're doing all the stuff right the fruit tutorials you're watching these videos and you're reading everything you can get your hands on and you're trying to set up whatever your podcast is or your content
(33:05) thing right and you're going through it and you're thinking to yourself like is this even worth it because you're not seeing any signs of success but the sign of success is the hate that you get along the way it is the leading indicator and what you can't do is bend the knee to their hate and try and fit back in and conform because it's comfortable and it's warm it's like the scene in The Matrix when Trinity opens the door the very beginning in the first Matrix when Neo is about to take the red pill and he wants to get out of the car and Trinity says you've been down that road Neo you know that road and you know
(33:37) exactly where it ends and I know that's not where you want to be and then he closes the door and he gets back in and he goes they they go to go take the red pill so right now this moment that you're going through is Trinity opening the door and saying you could go back you could go party you could go to the nightclubs you could say that this was just a hobby you could downplay what you're doing like I'm just trying out oh yeah I'm not I'm not really that into it it's just like just some thing I found
(34:01) right but then as you're saying you feel like a fake cuz you're lying to yourself you're lying to them about what you re what your real intentions are and in that moment when you're trying to think about having that conversation you remember exactly why you left why it is that road and you know exactly where it ends and that's not where you want to be and the thing is is that your goals will stick with you longer than these relationships your goals will serve you more than these relationships and this
(34:30) is what this is the stuff that no one will tell you I can tell you personally I don't talk to I talk to one friend that I have from middle school and high school all right I talk to one person two people from college and it's not like we talk all the time I talk to him every six months or so and so I say this because although these relationships feel like they're incredibly important in your life right now they will disappear the majority of these of these friendships are based on convenience you're only friends with them because they lived in your dorm they lived in
(35:01) your neighborhood they went in to English class with you but as soon as your conditions change you change where you're at all many of them will fade away because you'll develop new skills you'll develop new context you'll meet new people who are upskilled from that and then you'll compare them to compare to these people and you'll be like man these are better friends these are people who are more aligned with my goals they're trying to grow when I want to work all day Saturday they're like cool I'll work with you rather than being like dude we're going on a pontoon boat where you going to be and you have
(35:31) to accept that as the price and the thing is it's like it's only if you want that like if you if you want to live a life that is the same as everyone else's then you can do what everyone else does the only issue is when you want to do what everyone else does but get what none of them have if you want to be exceptional by definition you will be the exception you will not be normal you will be unlike the others and so it makes sense that you would be in the outgroup and it hurts as a human being because you want to be in the ingroup
(36:03) it's part of our DNA shame is a real thing and we don't want to feel that because in in the real in the in the N natural world if you're outside of the group you have a much lower likelihood of living and procreating so it's strong in our DNA to be in group but the thing is is that you're actually not in group or out of group you're transitioning you're between groups and so in that lonely chapter that's where you can do a disproportionate amount of work because you have no distractions so you listen to the podcast you read the tweets you watch the videos you consume the content
(36:35) because you know deep down I can do more than this and you begin to see the person that you could be and realize how far you need to go to get there but despite how far away it seems your goals the best version of you you look back down the Dead End Road and you know that's not where you want to be and so you keep going and realize that there's no turning back once you see the Promised Land once you see what you could become you can't go back and if you're not sure who your real friends are one ask is it more likely or less
(37:04) likely that I hit my goals with this person in my life just think about it like if this person is in my life is it more likely my goals then remove them because it's better to have friends who force you to grow than ones who accept you as you are because the biggest risk to your future isn't your future competition or your Rivals it's the distraction that you insist on keeping in your life rather than doing the things you know you should be doing but aren't think about it like this imagine a competitor that you'd never want to go against focused persistent always learning always improving Relentless
(37:35) says no to everything but that which makes them stronger you know what he looks like you know how he acts you know who he Associates with great that's future you now become him you have to kill your current self for your new self to have room to grow and so it's this constant appraisal of your skills and activities and saying which of these makes me stronger which of these makes it more likely for me to hit my goal and I just want to give you that frame because that like that single frame of is this person being in my life make it
(38:07) more likely or less likely that I hit my goal is this activity or this behavior that I do make it more or less likely I hit my goal and I consistantly just ask that question over and over and over again and that is because for me I do love my goals more than I love my friend because my goals will be with me long after they are and so if you think about your relationship with your goals and you put it on the same pedestal or higher than your relationship with your friends you're going to lose one of the relationships and the question is which one is the one that's going to serve you
(38:37) more in the long term that's a decision for you but for me I can tell you personally achieving my goals has served me more than any one person has and because achieving your goals is a generalized thing it can open all doors to new relationships and so you do have to burn sometimes what you have in order to have what you want if you want to impress poor people out spend them if you want to impress rich people outwork them and I can tell you this being in the position that I'm at because I have tons of young men who work for me and I
(39:07) mean they hear all the content that I make and they know that and so if you lease a Ferrari for $5,000 a month or whatever I know you're not rich and every rich person isn't impressed by that because we know what it costs you only impress poor people and if you do it really early in your career every rich person's like man you should be reinvesting that to get way Fu bigger now if you're like in a ficado and you want to have lots of cars and that's like again that's different it depends on the reason you're doing it it's like you shouldn't be cooking your own food unless you love cooking but if you don't
(39:37) love cooking then you should Outsource that [ __ ] as fast as possible so that you can get your time back it's understanding the context of this which of course this will be taken out of context but hopefully you watching or listening to this can at least get it Lea and I both collectively started buying nicer things so living in nicer places having nicer cars I bought my home which was a nice house in Austin I think it cost me 1.
(40:02) 7 million I bought it in cash and I bought it off one month paycheck and so I want to put that in context to like was it a ball in house totally it was sick I was super happy to be there but where I lived before that cost me 1,200 bucks a month and so you're like wait one point set right we spend money but by percentage the amount of money we spend is inconsequential if you want to buy the toys and you want to buy that stuff I'd say sure understand one whatever you spend you're taking away from the future now there is always a point you have to balance between consumption and investment if you never spend anything you live you live your
(40:31) entire life and you end up with a big pile of money and you didn't enjoy any moment of that I don't think that's the way to do it but I do think there's a ratio there and I think that ratio depends on you as an individual I tend to always over index on investment because I just I want to become a really like great version of me and I think that's going to cost money and it's going to cost time and I like to be ready for those opportunities because the opportunities get bigger and have more zeros next to them and there's no masterminds you get to at a certain
(40:56) level you just do a deal with someone and for me to Pony up for the deal might be like hey you got to write a check for 10 million I'm like all right I got to have that ready for just like on the sidelines waiting for opportunities right and so the idea is being on the defensive so that you can be on the offensive it's living far below your lifestyle so that you can more heavily invest in the growth of the business and so your lifestyle is your competitor's opportunity there's you and other version of you there's Bizarro you right and Bizarro you wants to live this great lifestyle and has the Ferrari and the
(41:27) nicer place and whatever but when an opportunity comes along Bizarro doesn't have any savings because he's trying to to show face right but the thing is is that every's trying to show face for hates him anyways because it looks like he's bragging but also they know how much he makes relatively and they're like God he's got to be spending his whole check paycheck he looks irresponsible there's zero advantage to being accurately judged if you are strong you want to appear weak you want to have more money than people expect
(41:54) you to have and so for me when we did buy the Bentley which I bought because I got I'll be honest I got pressured into it they're like dude come on you make all this money like buy something nice for yourself and I was like I guess people buy nice cars so I bought a car I bought a Bentley and um I returned it six months later uh and I lost 20 grand on it and I was like this was just a complete waste of everything like I just don't care at all about this because you only need three things to win you can write this down the balls to start the brains to learn and the heart to never
(42:23) quit and the good news is you already have all three you're just not using them because fundamentally if you found somebody and they started and they contined to get better and they never stopped they would win just think about it from fundamental Basics like if I said okay think of a person who only did one thing and all they dedicated their entire life to is doing that one thing and getting better and better at that thing and they did it for 50 years do you think that person would not be incredibly successful of course they
(42:47) would be then why aren't you doing it the problem is it's never been easier to start a business it's also never been easier to do nothing at all and this is what I mean by your distractions are the things that are getting in your way preventing you from doing the things you already know you should be doing but aren't right now if I were to say hey go get in shape what do you need to do what you want to say is I'm going to go do some research to find the best program and to find the best diet but if I just said no no no you can't look make a
(43:12) guess what would you say probably like well I need probably like go to the gym probably do some weights probably do some cardio move a little bit or to say do you want to stay at the same weight do you want to stay at the same cardio Pace or do you want to move those up over time you probably say I want to move those up over time like okay and then foodwise like do you want to probably eat more protein and Eli [ __ ] probably like yeah like well why don't we just start there most of the things you need to do you already know what to do and you delay doing them by under the guise of having a better plan but the
(43:38) reality is that your plan is always going to change as soon as you get new information and so the point is to start period and learn and it's giving yourself permission to have the humility to start a role that you know is not going to be your endgame because you just see it as one tile on the painting that's going to become the version of you that you want it's like I got to start at this corner I'm going to paint this corner up because I know that this Cornerstone of experience in door Todo or cold calling or media buying whatever is going to be something that I can
(44:09) build my whole career off of there are maybe trillions of dollars but at least hundreds of billions of dollars that are being made and dedicated every day to getting you to do nothing it's not a fair fight I want to be clear it's not a fair fight and they're winning and so I love this from from Andy forel he said personal Excellence is the ultimate rebellion and so I think like you want to be a [ __ ] Rebel be excellent and do it for you like you want to stick it to the man now just be great fundamentally the point of entertainment is to get someone to pay attention to it
(44:40) that's all entertainment does is pay attention to me right and so that means that you're not paying attention to the thing that matters more to you in the long term and so every dollar every minute of attention you pay to entertainment whether that's poring alcohol going out the clubs uh all of social media in general motivation porn if you will all of that is you not doing what you need to do to get to where you want to go you just have to be able to do things without seeing an immediate reward like if there's one meta skill
(45:11) that that overshadows all of this it's your ability to delay gratification is to delay a moment of reward that's it like that's all you have to do and in the beginning you just have to be able to do it long enough that you get one reward and that reward is typically outsized in its strength and then that will reinforce you sticking with it because the people who do work really really hard it's not like they're made of different Flesh and Blood than you it just means that they had a short period at some point where they said I'm going
(45:33) to shut everything else off and I'm going to go all in on this and then when they do get that first feedback loop like holy [ __ ] I made my first sale holy [ __ ] I I got my first lead from from ads holy [ __ ] I got my first you know 100 followers whatever it doesn't matter like you have some feedback loop for whatever it is that you're trying to go after that then encourages you to do more and you're like oh this could work and then as soon as that turns on you can get obsessed with it if I had to sign a contract right now to be that you
(45:58) guaranteed that you'd be a millionaire in 10 years but you couldn't make any real money between now and then would you sign it every person I've asked says yes and so maybe if you are listening to this and you're not your head like okay I'm 30 I'm a millionaire yeah that sounds like a great deal by the way that's like 0.
(46:16) whatever 1% like no one is but if that's you a lot of stuff takes much longer and the problem is that when you're 20 you've only been an adult for like 3 seconds and so the thing is that 3 seconds feels a very long time but I have this belief that older people are more patient not because they're actually more patient it's just because your perception of time speeds up I can be more patient than a 5-year-old because for me one year is not 20% of my life so my perception of time shrinks I might have the same patience as a 5-year-old it's just that more time passes and so if you are younger then you have to just
(46:50) understand that your perception of time will speed up and so you will be able to exhibit patience you'll keep being able to do something in the meantime because the meantime will pass faster and so you have to over index on it when you're starting I mean I've got guys on my team who are like hey what's my next career move and they're like 30 days into their job and I'm like give it a second like you still suck like you went from suck to proficient like you're not great yet calm down the real world's very different from school which you've already if you're watching my stuff you
(47:20) already kind of have an idea about that but I want to give you the more the behavioral definition around it is that with school you have very clear directions and a clear outcome with a clear timeline and you get a grade immediately so that's kind of like the roar or feedback loop right and sometimes it's Pop Quiz same day next day you get the the feedback loop or even you get you finish the quiz you go outside and you're like hey would you answer for six you're like a [ __ ] I got it wrong or whatever right but the thing is that the world is completely opposite of that and so the re the thing is is
(47:43) that beginners are paralyzed to make a decision because they assume the real world works like school and only has one right answer but reality is is that there are many right answers with only one wrong answer which is doing nothing and that's the answer that most people pick so I was talking to Neil Patel who's a friend of mine and he just made this uh this big tweet about this but he and I had a conversation about it earlier he has two friends one who's a public uh CEO found a company took it public he's got another friend who found a company took a public took it back
(48:11) private and then now only does Private deals the guy who does public and made all his money public is like you got to go public and the other guy who took his company public and it was a big mess and then took your private again is actually richer than the guy who made his company public both those guys are billionaires and both gave advice and they had differ advice and so I don't see it as one is right or wrong it's that there are many right paths but only one thing will prevent you from achieving all of it which is the only thing I'm trying to comper in this video is getting you to not do the one wrong path which is fear
(48:43) fear of not making it work fear of of other people's disapproval who don't matter anyways that you aren't cool anymore or because you don't show up to social events or because you don't blow money on stuff that doesn't matter anymore or you're not wearing the brands that they think are cool is all of that worth you for the rest of your life having the crushing feeling of mediocrity knowing you could do more and I say and I can describe this because I've lived it it's why I say it I'm not saying that that stuff's not going to
(49:13) happen it absolutely will happen it might even be worse than you imagine but you will not die and if you use the frame does me losing all of these relationships and having more time increase the likelihood that I get to my goal or decrease the likelihood they get to my goal all of a sudden when you use the goal frame of the best version of you all of a sudden it starts to it starts to make things a lot clearer it's like no me going to this bachelor art party does not increase the likelihood that to hit my goals and I'm not saying that you have to to make that sacrifice every time but
(49:48) the thing is is you're making a sacrifice either way you're either sacrificing your goals or you're sacrificing that relationship and so some of you guys are like oh Alex that's sounds unbalanced I'm going to get a couple you know comments from the [ __ ] online therapists of like I think emotional well-being and mental holness is super important well first off the pendulum swimming back no one gives a [ __ ] about the soft stuff anymore thank [ __ ] God but at some point everyone who wants to achieve great things realizes that balance is a myth and once they realize that they
(50:18) become someone who achieves great things at some point every person who wants to achieve great things realizes that balance is a myth and once they realize that they become someone who achieves great things and so there's this whole misnomer this whole idea think about what mediocrity is it's about being in the middle it's the medium it's being right in the middle right balance but anybody who is imbalanced is another way of saying more focused on the one thing will be better at that thing than you and the question is just whether or not that thing that they choose to be better at will give them
(50:55) more leverage over all that other stuff later and so if you work very hard and you create something that's very valuable for society I promise you you will be able to find a hotter wife I promise you you will have the money that you want I promise you you can buy the time that you want to have you'll have all of that at your disposal but if you choose the balanced life there's nothing wrong with that I just see that there is balance over a lifetime rather than Balan at every moment of life and so you might
(51:24) have seasons like I took basically a year off during the last year gym launch I just didn't really do a lot so I had more time than anybody and money right but I had Seasons before that where I didn't take any time off and so I think if you expand your time rizon for what balance really means that this is a softer way of explaining it uh then I think that that will you know make you sleep well at night but real talk I work all the time because I like to do it and I think that once you get a fast feedback loop with the work that you like that also propels your goals then you're not going to to do anything else
(51:56) and that's it's not not like I or some of the people that all right it's not like the people that you look up to have some sort of Herculean work ethic or discipline that you don't they like things that happen to also bring them status and that means that they went through a small period where they started doing that thing when they weren't good at it and it didn't bring them status but they were able to make it through that bridge until eventually did start working and did bring them status and then they just kept going so
(52:20) you just need enough Gusto to start and just get through that period to just get through your friends saying you suck for a little bit and everything you start will not be fun cuz you'll suck but getting good is fun getting better is fun and so I get excited a lot of times when I see how bad I am at something that's new because I have enough generalized reinforcement for learning how to get better at things that you learn the skill of getting better like that's a meta skill you learn how to learn and so just see it as an opportunity to learn how to do anything better so if you have a first thing then
(52:50) that's the first thing that you get better at and then you'll learn the skill of getting better and you can apply it all over the place some of you guys are listening to this and you're like okay you know this is great I'm feeling awesome the thing is is that people maybe it's you are waiting for this perfect moment but it doesn't come right it happens the moment you decide that you're fed up with waiting and decide to take action and it only becomes the perfect moment when you look back on it because today it just looks like now I had a conversation with a young man yesterday who said listen I
(53:22) have demons and I was like bro you don't have [ __ ] demons I was like shut up and he was like I like the thing is this and I I was so visceral with my reaction because I used to say that kind of stuff because I thought it made me hard I thought it made me complex I thought it made me mysterious but it's you don't have demons you're not self-sabotaging you don't have mom or dad issues what you have is a lack of skills in how to behave in a certain condition So when you say you have demons what it really means if I say okay what do you mean by
(53:55) that Define them that how do what is Define having demons right what I don't most people say that they don't mean they actually think they have spiritual Demons Inside of them I'm not even going to touch that what they really mean is that under these conditions I behave a way that is not ideal and so what that means is you have a skill efficiency no [ __ ] you're inexperienced of course you have a skilled deficiency you don't have demons you don't know how to be consistent you're not you don't have I I just can't stay with anybody for a long time no it either means you have really
(54:25) high standards which is fine and youd haven't met that person yet or you just don't know how to behave consistently it's like when I have a sales guy who's like hey you know I'm 30 days into this world and I'm getting I'm getting kind of board taking sales calls I'm like oh your ability to not be able to continue after something gets boring and learn to love the incremental improvements the hundred or thousand repetitions is the skill discrepancy that you need to overcome the best sales people bad sales people try and have a couple good days good salese get on hot
(55:01) streaks great salese never get cold and so that takes discipline to understand how to consistently get yourself hot how to consistently treat every sale the same way you do when you're on fire because there is no being on fire it means you simply behave differently it's not like you have magic you you pause differently you take longer spaces you ask the question your tonality shifts and those are skills because you can learn them and so this whole thing of like this is this young man I'm traumatized first off you don't even a [ __ ] definition of trauma all right
(55:36) trauma is a permanent change in behavior from an aversive stimulus meaning something bad happens and forever it changes how you act now let's if we understand that as the definition of trauma is trauma bad well if I touch a stove and then I never touch a stove again when it's hot is that trauma bad it permanently changed my behavior from an aversive stimulus is that trauma bad well it prevented me from getting burning the house down from you know permanently damaging my hand in the future no I would say it was good and so this whole appraisal of your past being
(56:09) tough or you don't understand bro no and no one cares either they don't understand nor do they care and so all anyone is going to care about is how you act how you behave what you do based on a series of conditions and so you just need to expose yourself to the conditions so that you can get the repetition so that you can learn how to overcome it the thing that determines whether it's good or bad is whether it creates a behavior that's condusive to your goals and so that means that fundamentally you can have a stimulus like touching the stove that creates a behavior that is conducive to the goal
(56:40) in that way trauma was good so by the way parents when you punish a child the hope is that you traumatize them is that you permanently change their behavior from an aversive stimulus it's just that people don't Define words and they just shout them all over the place say say it's stored in your body it's energy it's like no one even knows what the [ __ ] that means means show me on someone's body where it's stored give me an x-ray show me where the no come on like you're saying you're you you're storing your emotional Trauma from your father and your liver like I can just say words and make
(57:11) things up and get people notd if I say them with conviction it doesn't make it's true and so you may have been fooled because sometimes it's more convenient to say you can cast your power onto this thing that happened that was outside of your control as the reason why you can't be successful because it's easier to say that than to say that I chose not to do anything about it anyways and again listen you can do whatever you want you can just keep wallowing in that you can keep saying that that's the reason and wherever you point is where your power is right but
(57:40) the only time that you have more power is if you say it's on you period because all of those things may have happened and they may have all been terrible and what are you going to do about it right because the only like no one cares like the world doesn't care you care which is fine but like no one else does and the sooner you realize that the sooner you can start doing something about it and so also think about this it's the equal opposite if trauma can create good things then it also means that good things can create
(58:12) bad behaviors and so if you win the lottery and then you have all these behaviors that happen afterwards that are negative then was it good for you like we talk about these rich and privileged kids because it creates behaviors that people that actually make it less likely they achieve things like later and so just think about what occurred and what behaviors you take as a result and separate good or bad from it and just think does it make it more likely that I hit my goals it makes life a lot easier and then it stops you from speaking in
(58:43) Voodoo and speaking and appealing to mysticism and Magic like there's this this Force around of demons it's like dude no like you had a girl who cheated on you okay now what does that change about your behavior I have trust issues no it just means that under these conditions you are slower to give someone access to your bank account or slower to move in with someone comma who cares and is that a bad thing and so I'll walk you through a three-step framework that has been unbelievably valuable to me and this is from Dr cashy logic evidence
(59:20) utility logic is what does that mean so you have demons okay what does that mean Define it in terms of behavior what does that mean okay got it now how do you know that evidence so you say I have demons we unpack that and it means that uh for you you self-sabotage which again Define that okay it means that I show up late to meetings after I get into a job after two months of being on time okay so after 2 months of be on time you start being late to stuff that we translated from I have demons to I self-sabotage to that is the behavior
(59:59) that occurs got it now I would say how do you know that now a lot of times people like well it's happened but when you actually look at it you're like it happened three times over in you know in my my last job okay is it really a a problem as you define it or it happened in those three occurrences okay got it so now you know now most times people like I don't have any data and you're like okay so then this is basically made up and when I say made up I'm not saying it's like you are a High I'm just saying
(1:00:27) that humans work in narratives and a lot of times we add narratives stories to things that don't actually mean anything but it's convenient and it's fun and we like talking about it but it doesn't mean it's true and so then you move to the third one which is and so what utility who cares why does this matter and so then you say okay well this matters because it decreases the likel that I will be able to retain future employment fine then what do we do about it and so you can walk through things that you have struggled with in the past with simply saying let me
(1:00:58) Define this in terms of behavior how what evidence do I have that this is actually true and that I've defined it based on these things and who cares I have demons in the kitchen all right just as a completely ridiculous example okay well in my past I I've had bad things happen bro like what like what occurred I touched the stove and it burns me okay great now we have something evidence-wise how many times it happen one time okay and it never happened again in the future okay what did that result in I don't go into kitchens anymore okay now this is good
(1:01:33) or bad when you say who cares it's in relation to what my goals does you not going into the kitchen prevent you from achieving your goals well if you want to be a chef yes if you want to be an entrepreneur no if you want to be a kitchen entrepreneur probably right and so the question is just who cares why does it matter and so so much of our time and effort goes into explaining things things to people that don't matter at all that you could literally just move on from and just literally forget about you could get over that quote trauma by changing the behavior that it changed aversively so in this
(1:02:08) context or in this condition I behave this way and it's not conducive to my goals great that's good that you've identified it cool so what do we need to do so that when you're in the condition how can we increase the likely that you do act the way that you want to and then you start stacking the deck to start Shifting the pendulum in your favor and you start attacking each of these little problems from skill that you have whether it's Behavior with people or it's skills at work or with a relationship and you just do it one by one by one and if you do it over a very
(1:02:33) long period of time you get better I promise you and I'm saying this to somebody who I struggled with my demons you don't understand bro like I have stuff like okay but it doesn't help you and it also doesn't make you look harder it just makes you less capable losers talk about what happened to them winners talk about what they made happen despite it hardship is a reality for losers to Winners hardship is just your origin story and like I promise you if you can use this Frame like I was texting LEL the other day like the bigger the monster the more epic the hero it's the story that you're
(1:03:12) going to someday tell when you're 85 you're not going to want more boring stories right the idea is that if you're going through hard [ __ ] now that's the story that you're going to tell and if you believe yourself to be the hero that you want to someday become then the harder it is you're like bring it this is my my story this is the Spider-Man getting bid this is him getting beat up by the bullies this is the origin story no one cares about a hero who never had it hard I bought a lottery ticket years
(1:03:36) and years and years ago when I was in college because it was like a a billion or something like that back back then that was one a billion dollars meant something um but I was in college and the and my girlfriend at the time I was talking to her and the drawing was that night we bought him for fun we bought one tick I wasn't expecting to win but it was just a it basically I was buying her for the conversation and I thought about it as like the drawing got closer and I realized I had this big pain of anxiety cuz I was like What if I win and I had this moment of Terror because I realized
(1:04:07) that if I won that I would never be able to achieve anything that anyone thought was my own and that thought terrified me and thankfully I didn't win the billion dollars um and I got to make the life that I have and so I think that I think epic tetus says this but it's something to the degree of what a shame it would be for someone to never encounter hardship because they would never be able to see who they are and so I think that if you have gone through hardship or you are going through hardship this is the opportunity to prove to yourself not anyone else
(1:04:41) that you are who you say you are and you are made of what you say you are made of and you can choose to allow that hardship to make you harder to make you more resilient to make you more persistent to make you more Relentless to make think you more driven towards whatever you want to do or whoever you want to be or you can allow it to be an ankle weight you can allow it to be your trauma right that is your demon that you're fighting every day but the thing is is like everyone has demons everyone has hard [ __ ] and I
(1:05:15) want to tell you this frame that'll hopefully change someone's perspective which is that your hard stuff may have been harder than other people's hard stuff but if I take a human being who is never encountered anything and then I poke them with a needle that will be a 10 out of 10 hardship for them and so I believe personally that humans experience pain the same way it's why when a man feels disrespected it hurts just as much as someone else going through another crazy hardship and you know what even if that guy's white a 10
(1:05:48) out of 10 Pain still feels like a 10 out of 10 pain now could that pain be less on the absolute scale of worst scenario yeah it could be but also who cares and so my point here is that every single human being on Earth has gone through their version of 10 out of 10 pain which normalizes pain across the Spectrum which then leaves you with the only natural thing you have left which is what do I do now and if you wanted to design the perfect version of You The Savage competitor the Gladiator at the end of the life that has the scars and the scraggly beard but has been through [ __ ] and has done things and has and has
(1:06:24) realized their potential What would you do to maximize the likelihood that you become that Savage hero would you give them the padded lifestyle would you give them the immediate win would you give them the Easy Life probably not you would probably put you through what you're going through right now to become that person and so why would you resent the chapter you're in because it's a requirement for becoming who you say you want to be let's say you've gotten over your little demon thing and when I say gotten over you just stop giving it
(1:06:56) Power by saying it now is the reason that you can't be successful awesome so what do you do now right so you got to start figuring things out and that figured out muscle is probably the most powerful muscle you can build it's just saying oh I don't know how to do this I will figure it out why because I figured out things in the past and I can do it again and if that person can do it and they're no smarter than I am they have two hands in a brain I can do it too so the next time that you say you can't figure something out just set a timer for 20 hours and actually try for 20
(1:07:20) hours before you quit what you'll often realize is it's not hard you just haven't even tried yet if you you can shrink the time between saying you want to learn something and beginning to try the thing and extend the time before you say hey this is hard then you will be able to accomplish way more than you think you can learn most things in 20 hours the problem is that most people delay the first 20 hours by years and if you really measured Yourself by the amount of action you take not your desire not your deservingness or even your effort you might actually be
(1:07:49) embarrass because what you're looking at is reality it's about what you do not what you say you're going to do how much you want the outcome from what you're doing how much you think you deserve the thing that's going to happen after you do it or how hard you try because one no one cares two reality doesn't care either because the only thing that matters that you can control is input and you would be absolutely astonished at what you can accomplish when you give yourself no choice every third time I do a Q&A I get asked the question what
(1:08:16) keeps you going when things were tough like what did you think about and I could come up with something that was really compelling but the honest truth is I just never considered quitting it was just not it was just not on my choice of options at the table because for me the idea of going back to Baltimore as a failure was so much worse than anything else that I could encounter that it just it just wasn't even a consideration and so the only natural option I had was to persist was to endure was to continue and so I think if you use that frame as there have been
(1:08:50) people who have gone through significantly worse than what I'm going through right now and for those of you who claim the demon card of like I've been through [ __ ] then prove it was it worse than this great then you can prove that it was so hard by being hard now across time frames in history across countries across cultures across age groups across race gender everyone respects the man who works because as men we are always judged by what we can do and if you are doing things then people know that you are contributing
(1:09:22) that is how you prove utility work ethic is the currency of respect if you want to earn respect you earn it through work and sometimes that's working on yourself that's sometimes working on a skill working on a product but it is all through work through effort I will tell you something that shifted my life which is that entrepreneurship is not a game of best man wins it's a game of Last Man Standing and there's a lot of games that are like this and fundamentally that's an infinite game frame versus a finite
(1:09:48) game frame and I will read you the quote that Lila had framed and put in my office ask the girl shoot the shot launch the business run the ad quit the job take the risk because when you're 85 years old and on your deathbed you're not going to wish you had fewer crazy stories

Transcript:
(00:00) what I want to do is show you how to win and impress the only person that really matters which is future you not the person next to you not the person in front of you not the person on stage not your mom future you the point of this presentation is to give you a different way to think about this process so you can make it easier to win and the nice thing is is that the process I'm going to show you is how you can win at anything and it works for winning at Health relationships advertising sales real estate business
(00:30) investing in anything else where you have to do things to get stuff cool awesome all right so with that being said let's begin how to win so I'm going to cover five things what to do how to do it why to do it who you need to become to do it then finally when to start so let's start with number one said simply what do you need to do to win AKA impress the future version of you and the reason I Define winning this way is that for those of you guys who are at the top and you guys know who you are you can't compare
(01:10) yourself to everyone that you're already better than and I say that from a success like objective measurement perspective not as a human being everyone's a wonderful snowflake but you can't compare yourself to people that you're beating because you'll just get complacent you know that for those you guys who are the winners here for those you guys not at the top or who are on the climb you can only control what you can control and you only know what that is and so there might be advantages or disadvantages that you might have been
(01:41) born with it also doesn't matter no one cares the only people who like excuses are the ones giving them right and so let's start with an activity to prove to you that you already know what not to do so this is a process I call verion and I use this a hilarious amount probably too much and so this uh I think at least I will attribute this to Albert Einstein Charlie merer talks about it a lot um invert always invert when you have a tough problem and so I use this and we use this as a as a very strong tool because it's easier for our brains to find problems and solutions so we had to
(02:18) think earlier just now like let's think of things for gratitude did anyone for a split second be like [ __ ] right anyone anyone else do that cuz I heard it backstage and I was like right you're about to be on stage that you could be grateful for that right I was just thinking about that but like but if I said hey can you think of a problem I could be like I can give you 20 right now right right off the top of my head is like my my knee kind of hurts a little bit right like I can start giving you problems really easily but that's
(02:42) because we're programmed to survive not Thrive right our brains are programmed to find threats to make sure we live to see another day not so that we enjoy to day and so we actually have much stronger problem finding skills than solution finding and so what I want to do is use our anxiety-driven threat finding brain for something good and so here's the activity I want you to imagine the least successful version of you loser what does that person do or not do to guarantee that you won't win how do they guarantee that you lose all right so shout some of these out just like what does that person do to
(03:26) lose Netflix okay I heard that one drugs drugs okay we're going way deeper and darker than I was thinking he's like a heroin addiction I'm like okay yes understood I thought you guys were going to say something like [Laughter] [Applause] this being impatient show up late be unprepared not confident hair heroin we can throw that up there being transactional rather than relational with your clients and customers uh don't follow up someone's like hey I've been thinking about selling my house and you're like awesome and then you just never call them I've got a friend who uh might be
(04:18) interested in your services and you're like that's a damn shame don't advertise don't ask for referrals right these are probably some things that would guarantee that you won't be successful right and there's probably more we could add this list and so I would encourage you though if you really think about this to really put these things down because this is genuinely the process that I think about when I want to grow a business when I want to get into a new Endeavor I think how could I guarantee that I would lose like what would I in the fewest moves I could possibly make what are the fewest
(04:47) things I could do to absolutely guarantee that I lose and actually the smaller the list you can make the more potent those things are like if there's just one thing that you can do to guarantee that you lose that usually becomes the north star of how you win so how do we use these things that our brains came up with to win right we invert it we flip it and so this is what that would look like so from patient goes to sorry impatient goes to patient showing late is to always being on time being unprepared to being always prepared or overprepared not confident
(05:19) to confident transactional to relational doesn't follow up to always follows up to doesn't advertise to advertises constantly to not asking for referrals to always doing so quick story on this uh one of our companies had one sales guy who was outperforming the previous top salesperson by 2X and so I wanted to know what this guy was doing so I hopped on the phone which he was like right and so I was like what are you doing man and uh he's like after I sell someone I just asked if they want to bring somebody else and I was like yeah and then I
(05:51) looked at the sales director I was is that not in the [ __ ] script already he's like no no it is and I was like why are we not enforcing it he was like we we are now and so simple [ __ ] right and so a lot of you guys already know how to win because you know how to lose so flip it so after all that I guess everybody here does know what to do to win right but maybe you just don't know how to do it so let's talk about that so most times we don't know we don't do things because we haven't broen them down to the most basic form all right
(06:33) the more skilled you are the more General a command can be and you can follow it so someone can go shiron can be like hey you want to jv on this company with me and he'd be like can you grow it and I would say sure very general Command right can you grow this business sure if you go to a toddler and say grow this business they're going to be like what does that mean but the thing is is that we're not so dissimilar for from Toddlers it's just that our egos grew up but not our abilities and so you might say to the CEO go
(07:06) advertise the less skilled you are the more broken down the command must be in order to follow it so if I were to tell the toddler genuinely how to grow the business it might start with hit the button then wait until the light comes on then click the blue circle then type in facebook.
(07:31) com hit enter you guys catching this so what's the difference the level of detail in the instructions and this is why two people can go through the same training or event and get wildly different results results come down to the number of skills the person has and the number of skills required to understand and execute this is how Learning Happens so skills for winter coming into this event today might be they already know how to email Market they already have Charisma uh they know how to speak they they know how to follow up they have these skills the other person here
(08:03) might have no skills and they could attend this event and then nothing would happen was it the event or was it the person it's just that there are requisites just like in college you've got requisites to do something you have to have former skills to advance to the next level and unfortunately and this really applies to those of you who have teams and if you are a teammate you can think about this in Reverse if you have one broken Link in the chain of commands or instruction that someone does not understand they get stuck and then they
(08:34) do not complete the task and you're like why are you so incompetent and it might just be because they don't understand one step and so for example let's say that you need you hear go advertise right skilled guy says on it the less skilled person says but how now compare that to turn on your computer do you think everybody in your team can do that right so that means that everybody here here can be successful if you literally just break it down to a level that you cannot fail that you understand every step does that make sense that I can
(09:12) do so you need to break things down to their most basic level so that everyone can learn them and when you do that you make it easier for more skilled people and you make it possible for Less skilled people and so for example I said earlier on purpose be more charismatic right can we agree that if someone's more charismatic they might do better in this field in general yeah cool what does that mean it means smile when people walk in change emphasis and tality when you're talking remember people's names ask
(09:50) people about themselves nod multiple times and then respond when people are talking keep eye contact address everyone in the room when you enter and exit we might then say that person's charismatic but if someone says to you be charismatic you might be like okay but if someone said do these six things do you think you could do that yes you have to break it down and so the this is the essence of good teaching and training and learning how to learn will make you better at teaching yourself and then by extension your team so here's the writer Downer if you
(10:29) can learn it it is a skill and if it's a skill you can teach it which is why I wholeheartedly reject the concept of people being born a certain way they might have physical attributes that Orient the environment to reinforce certain behaviors but if they became that way they were taught to be that way either formally or informally but they learned that because it was reinforced at some part in their lives which means right now if you're like I'm not naturally charismatic neither are children they learn and if
(11:04) you can Pock your ego you can too which means that these traits everyone says the best are born with are simply buckets of smaller skills that we group together into a single larger term to save time when we're communicating we we don't say hey Johnny's such a good realtor because he smiles when everyone walks in the door he remembers everyone's name he changes his tonality when when he speaks he's you know he he always addresses everyone ins inside and out when he enters and exits we don't say that we just say he's charismatic but that shorthand in
(11:39) language is a source of confusion and remember at the beginning I said this is going to be Mr Miyagi thing don't worry it'll come back and the thing is is we know how to teach toddlers but it's also how adults learn our egos are just too sensitive to allow it and so what I want you to do is operationalize the list of actions that we figured out together earlier right we had this big list of all the ways that you know you can lose we flip those into how we can win and then we take those words like be patient be charismatic always be on time we say how do I operationalize that what do I actually
(12:10) do turn on the button turn the computer on hit enter how do we do that and so if you're like what does operationalize mean explain using actions or behaviors you can see with your eyes someone being charismatic I can't see with my eyes did they smile when they walked in the door I can observe that did they call someone by their name I can observe that did they whatever the other things on my list were right no it's not feelings thoughts intentions Impressions manifestations affirmations or psychology none of those
(12:40) things belong in instructions why because you have no idea what anyone else is thinking all we know is that as a group when people follow this process more people buy and here's the cool part that's all we need to know we don't need to test the science of the psychology we just know that when we greet people we look them in the eyes we shake them we remember their hand and then we and then we follow up on this Cadence it works that's it it's all we needed to know and then do it and so we know that if we do
(13:15) these things you get this outcome and that makes learning and teaching a lot simpler we deal with only what we can measure and observe and I promise you if you can look at the world this way one 90% of the content you in your newsfeed you will just be able to ignore his noise cuz people are like it's the manifestation of the internal Trauma from child just just smile and shake their [ __ ] hand like just stop stop stop so let me give you another example and this is one that I actually struggled with so I I spent a lot of my time trying to operationalize words because it just helps me understand the world better because I don't feel like I
(13:54) understand much at all and that's and I just share that stuff in my content because I share the stuff as I figure it out or at least as I figure it out for me and so I have always been somebody who identified as being an impatient person and I figured if I was going to be an investor patience would probably be a very important character trait to have and I was like what how do I do that if someone's like be patient you're like now what right so what does that mean so patience means figuring out what
(14:24) to do in the meantime that's it AKA doing anything besides doing the thing you're avoiding including doing nothing at all this is why some of these dictionary definitions are very difficult to actually do anything with it's not the capacity to accept or tolerate delay trouble suffering without getting angry or upset just figure out what to do in the meantime that's being patient so quick question who here has Investments this isn't like a big Flex question okay cool now right now provided you literally aren't on Robin Hood selling your [ __ ]
(14:59) you are being patient by just being here like right now your Investments are moving in One Direction or another and you're being patient because you figured out something to do in the meantime huh not so hard in other words right yeah I wrote this there we go which brings me to my next howo binaries and continuums real quick if you it's not that you are patient or not and the reason I'm emphasizing this is because sometimes it can feel unrealistic to trying to team these traits it's like well it's so hard for me to be charismatic or you know not
(15:34) softspoken or patient right but it's not about being it or not being it the question is how patient are you which means that it's not a binary it's a Continuum it's can I move myself slowly in this direction by taking actions all right which makes every skill you work on improvable and so every do everything that we do to impress our future selves is another proof point that we Act more times than not in this way until eventually we begin to describe ourselves as patient or detail oriented or charismatic and this allows us to see progress with these quote traits which
(16:12) are really just buckets of larger skills that we do shorthand with so we can communicate and so now that we covered that I can finally Define three terms that I think will matter for everyone in this room and cement the how learning intelligence and confidence so let's start with learning learning simply means same condition new Behavior so the same thing happens and then you respond differently that's learning so if I show you a red card and then I slap you like wow that sucked and I put it back in my pocket and then I bring out my red card again and then I slap
(16:57) you then I bring out my my red card again you duck you learned the phone rings hello no script phone rings hi phone rings read the script you learned same condition new Behavior learning so please remember this because I'm going to hit on this multiple times throughout learning means same condition to behavior if you're presented with the same situation and you do not change how you behave you have not learned so that's learning intelligence how fast you change what you do in the same situation intelligence is rate of learning speed
(17:53) of learning so Dumber phone rings no script phone rings no script phone rings no script never changes Dumber liing how complex this is smarter phone rings no script phone rings read script changes faster smarter everyone wants to think they're smart but many of you will leave this event go back to the same environment and not change your behavior so if that's you which one of these two are you below Dumber everyone's like or [Music] smarter so you may not have ever thought that you were smart but if you change
(19:00) your behavior you can beat even the quote smartest person which is why you need to be Delta you need to be a triangle change instead of an L7 weeny a square right that's why triangles win because we change so that's intelligence which is simply rate of learning how quickly you change your behavior under the same conditions so how can we tie that to confidence cuz I think could we agree that a realtor who's more confident would probably do better in this field than one who isn't okay awesome the percentage likelihood
(19:32) that's something happens in statistics you have a confidence metric how confident we are are we that something's going to happen and confidence is domain specific so you can be a confident realtor and a not so confident parent kind of interesting so how do you increase your confidence percentage with proof well how do you create proof you do it a lot of times and how can you make sure you have a high percentage likelihood that the script comes out the way you want it with a client you do it in the exact situation a lot of times because
(20:05) confidence is domain specific there's some people who practice their speech in the mirror but when they get on stage they freeze they're like but I practiced this thing you didn't practice in front of a crowd it becomes domain specific you sound so certain here's how you do that do it enough times that you get bored of it so like you can complete the sentences you can do it while you're driving you can do it in any situation you want because guess what that's when you'll be performing the script so here's a writer Downer
(20:35) confidence comes from the past not the present if your plan requires luck it's a bad plan if you need to get lucky in order to win in this game you will not win so you can prepare and you do that in the past before you need the skill you dig the well before you're thirsty so now that we covered the what you guys all know the big list of things that you should be doing and you can break it down into an operationalized little basic nugget of I can actually do this with the how let's talk about why you should but
(21:12) aren't so I'm going to talk about two things within my little y category external conditions and internal conditions so I'll start here that's supposed to be like the economy I I don't know if that the little visual looks economic but I liked it okay so here's why you might not be doing it I call this the five stages of opportunity hopping so you go from Step One uninformed optimism you're like man in this low interest rate environment my cousin's making a killing in real estate must be amazing I could do that
(21:45) too then you hop in you go to step two which is informed pessimism huh this is not as easy as I originally thought people aren't just coming to give me their homes to sell well G goly and then you keep going you keep going and you reach this third point where you're like the valley of Despair what is life is this really what I want to do am I passionate about real estate you know I really do love being a family person you know I just and then you start justifying reasons not to do something right and this is what most
(22:20) people do is they get to the valley of Despair and then they jump because in the beginning there you saw your cousin who doing well at real and you're like I'm going to jump in but you were doing something before that that you were just in the valy to spare of that thing and so all you do is or not you but all many people do is that they just uninformed optimism informed pessimism value of Despair uninformed optimism informed pessimism value of Despair uninformed optimism if it sounds repetitive some of you have lived this thing 10 [ __ ]
(22:57) times and so many of you guys are here right now it's a tougher climate than it was 24 months ago but here's what it looks like when it's right you go to stage four which is informed optimism which is you know what there is a process that when I got into this I didn't understand but now I do understand it and I've broken it down into into actions that I can do and perform on a regular basis and I have a feedback cycle so that I can learn how to get better and I will measure myself on the progress that I do to the things that I've committed
(23:31) to I know how to win and then you do that stuff and you get to step five which is you win and then you question why life is meaningless to begin with but you know whatever we'll get to that later so so we get more for what we put in when we stick with things you get compounding returns when you stick with things longer and so wealth is made during the hard times because because the largest percentage of the market transfers to the few left standing that guy work out the more you do anything the better
(24:11) you get at it and the more environments you do it in the better you get at it in more environments especially considering a macre environment right now right so the question is who would you trust more to sell your house the agent who's been through three recessions and never left the profession rhym didn't mean to do that but sounds that's cool or the agent who juggles three opportunities and hops in and out when it's convenient oh some of you were like that's me right and you wonder why you don't win and so your clients feel that way
(24:44) too and so even if the people who see you right now aren't in the market they're always deciding who they're going to go with when they do and so people including future you will be watching what you do and how you you act and so you need to do three times the work for the same outcome today but 10 times the eyes are on you and so if you close deals when times are hard they'll know you can close their deal when times are easy so tldr down times is when Champions are made it's when skills are sharpened if you can win now when the economy turn turns around you will crush
(25:23) I love this quote a smooth sea never made a skilled sailor who here to be [ __ ] great then we should [ __ ] wish for storms because if you want to be a skilled sailor then you need you cannot be great unless you have something to test yourself against you can't claim that you were loyal until someone if you're married if until somebody comes up to you and you say I'm good you can just claim loyalty all day but until you test it you don't have the skill because you have no proof today these times are
(25:56) are opportunities to give our ourselves proof of who we really are and I think that is one of the most motivating things of hard times is that these are the stories that you will someday tell about yourself so here's the writer down what makes you extraordinary isn't what you do it's how long you're willing to do it for there's nothing extraordinary about saying someone's name and shaking their hand I mean it's great but is it extraordinary I don't know but if you do it every single time for the rest of your life is that extraordinary
(26:26) something as simple as that that yes it is so it's not what you do it's how long you're willing to do it for and so I said I was going to talk about two things external conditions did that now I'm going to talk about this internal conditions for why you're not doing something that you should be doing so where does motivation come from I don't know right childhood trauma I didn't get hugged enough whatever right motivation comes from deprivation let going to get dark for a second it'll be fun this person for example is very motivated to
(27:06) breathe you going to agree on that okay next Point unmotivated to have sex they might be who knows some of you guys are wild all right I don't want to breathe all right calm down okay so don't worry I'm moving on I know that yeah yeah I'm moving on I'm moving on so let me explain so when are you more motivated to eat drink water sleep when you're hungry thirsty and tired that's when you're the most motivated have you ever finished a big meal and been like man I could go for another Pizza probably not have you drank a big gallon of water and been like I don't want any more fluids of course not because you're not
(27:53) deprived and so when you're full you don't want it anymore after you finish Thanksgiving to dessert you're stuffed are you still hungry no have you drink a bunch of water do you want more no so what does this have to do with motivation to win and make money I told you I'll wrap it I I'll move it right because by this logic wouldn't all poor people be motivated since they're deprived of money right that would make sense but we know that's not the case because the people who make the most money are the ones who keep wanting to make more
(28:23) huh so here's why you know when you're tired hungry hry or thirsty you perceive a gap and your motivation is proportional to your deprivation how much you don't have right very hung like this guy is much hungrier than the person who's just like maybe I'll have dinner on the way home and so here's why money motivation is more complicated than hunger or thirst or being sleepy with money deprivation is not physiological it's psychological you only feel poor if you perceive a large gap between Where You Are and where you really want to be so let
(29:01) me show you this visually so let's say you're at $5,000 a month in income and your desire is to get to $10,000 a month fair enough cool now let's say this guy is doing a million a month in income but he wants to get to 10 million a month in income relative to their goal one guy is closer he's only half of his goal the other guy's one tenth of his goal who's more deprived huh hang around five people with 10 times the net worth that you have and you'll feel poorer than you ever did when you were poor around poorer people than
(29:43) you that'll be a horos family uh tongue twister for my children um AKA changing your minimum standard which I stole from Shon the number one predictor of wealth is an IQ gender race and this one startled me it's the ZIP code you're born in kind of [ __ ] with you a little bit you're like huh it's not about race it's not about gender it's not even about IQ it's just where you're born which means it's the things that we compare ourselves to because your environment sets your standards if you change the environment you change your
(30:21) behavior this is why networks like this are so valuable like you can basically get someone to do anything if you Orient the en arm in the right way I can get everyone here to take off their clothes if I make this 150° in this room I could you could if you change the environment you can change Behavior if I told you to to like hey everybody get naked be like I'm good Alex fair enough crank this thing to 150 people start stripping I didn't need to say anything the environment changed your behavior more than I ever could this is why the places like this and networks like this are so
(31:01) valuable and so if you want to feel more motivated change who you compare yourself to our environment stretches the Gap and you experience the deprivation rich people are more deprived of money than poor people because they compare themselves to richer people than poor people do and so consider this extreme example you've got the guy with a bag on his back nothing else he needs I have everything I need two I need everything who's more deprived so you might be like huh this seems kind of dark is there a clean way to make this comparison without focusing on other people because that's what I
(31:43) would be asking yes compare yourself to the person you generally want to become that's how you can create the Gap so here's the writer Downer if you want to change what you do change who you compare yourself to so we covered external conditions that might be stopping you from the doing the what opportunity hopping and sticking it out right and now we cover the internal conditions that might have preventing been preventing you who you compare yourself to and your internal levels of motivation and deprivation so now that we covered the what and we covered the how we covered
(32:18) the why internal and external now let's talk about who you have to become to do that so how do we become someone with certain traits well contrary to popular opinion and the Instagram people I don't think it has to be do with becoming at all so when we describe who someone is what do we do we describe how they behave and what they do being and identities become descriptions of what we do and so little Aristotle little ancient Greek we are what we repeatedly do and that's why I think this whole thing that has been very popularized by
(32:57) the the the the fluff people hopefully no one else said this earlier on this stage that would suck um B do have is BS so let me explain we describe someone identity we say hey he's honest he's hardworking he's a real estate agent that's how we describe them so let's translate those he's honest he States the facts he's hardworking you complete tasks as fast or faster than expectations you agree to there a real estate agent someone who represents buyers and or sellers in real estate transactions all right that's the identity but everything that we use to
(33:34) describe the identity are things the person does note that being has 100% to do with doing so if you want to be a certain type of person then you need to do what that certain type of person does and when you do those certain things then you get the results of those actions which means you can summarize the entire thing of B do have to just do cuz by doing you be and by doing you get just do this makes the person that you want to become the actions you take that we later describe as identity 100% under your control which I think is very
(34:16) inspiring which is why one of my favorite sayings of all time is here's a writer Downer the work works on you more than you work on it and so I'll tell you a little story so I was at Sephora with my wife uh it's a makeup store um it's where they sell paint for ladies anyways so we're there and I'm standing against the wall like this and Lila's doing whatever and I see these two little girls super excited and the lady in the smok comes up to them and she's like okay this is eyeliner and this is lipstick I learned those terms um and you need to start budging for this now
(34:57) cuz they they're probably like this height is agewise and they were so excited and they're like because now that you're grown up and your guys are women like you have to start budgeting for this every month because you need to start spending it and I thought it was such a cute little story and the girls were so excited but she basically said that with a new identity comes new priorities you're going to shift how you allocate resources based on the person you want to become these girls want to become women and so she said great you
(35:21) need to change how behave and so for many of you being number one in winning simply comes down to doing what the number one person does or would do or the number one version of yourself and then if you do those things people will eventually describe you that way when the evidence catches up so we talked about now we've talked about who you have to become which is just a reminder of just doing what future version of you does for a long enough period that you would describe yourself that way all right so finally
(35:55) let's talk about the when you should start so when do you start this stuff because you might be like you know what Alex this all sounds great the little hand thing with the fingers cool but I'm busy now it's not a good time maybe in the future so let's put it up there I think there's three things about time that I find interesting so you can have a reason not to do something because season-wise economically or timing in the season of your life isn't good we can think about hour by hour you're like literally I don't have the time in the day to get this stuff done that would
(36:25) make me number one or you can use something that I like to call the when then fallacy so let's break it down so if you're busy that's actually the best time to change your behavior why because you guys want this to last right if you're going to change your behavior you want your behavior change to last correct then if you only wait until you're not busy then you assume that you will be not busy again in the future because if it's contingent on you being not busy then the moment you get busy again you'll stop so start when you're the busiest so
(37:03) that when you get busy again you already know how to do it and that you can stick with it does that make sense cool did anyone get one of their reasons crushed great so if you're waiting till you're less busy to start a new habit or program it assumes that you get busy again you'll stop if you want enduring change the best time to start is when you're busy learn how to make it work in the worst condition and it'll stick in the best now is the best time let's go hour by hour so I used to say the same thing to my wife of like I
(37:36) just don't have time to do all these things and you know what she did she grabbed my phone she looked at my time usage and she was like huh here's four hours every day you spend on not work I guess I found you some time anyone want to look at their phone right now probably not the other way to think about this is like do you think that there's someone on Earth who had less make it happen yes of course if they can you can too right everyone is the same 24 hours it's about how you allocate them and the nice thing is is that if you're doing a lot of
(38:18) stuff right now and you're not getting to where you want to go you're doing the wrong stuff and so the first thing when you when you course correct is actually elimination not addition cuz most of stuff you're doing right now is not working so then change what you do and you'll have way more time smart busy broke can't be all three you got to pick two you can be smart and busy but you won't be broke you can be busy and broke but you're not smart you can be smart and broke but you're not busy super real talk if you're working
(38:50) all the time and you're not making progress you're doing the wrong stuff right people who achieve goals faster don't actually move faster they achieve more with every step this is the basis of Leverage they get more for what they put in if you're not moving as fast as you want you're doing the wrong stuff okay so consider the alternative because some of you are still like holding on to this and you're like but I really don't have time it's like okay you're right and you'll never achieve the success you
(39:13) want and it's not your fault that feel better right didn't think so so let's assume that you've got the time and you're spending it the wrong way so that's number two let's go to the one then FY always a fun one so this one kept me stuck for years basically you think when I have more time I'll do it it's like saying I'll save money when I have more money or like I'll get healthy before I go to the hospital or I'll I'll get a I'll go to the gym once I have a six-pack you invert the sequence you're getting this you're getting the order wrong right you do the stuff now to get
(39:54) the thing later you do and then you get you don't get in order to do so that's number three so when do you start answer the moment you want to be the future version of yourself AKA when so when do you want to become the future you or when do you become the future you when you do what they do because if identity is based in action then the moment you start doing the things that future you does you are that person it just takes time for the proof to show up but you are that person already and that is enough for
(40:32) you so we talked about what how when who and when you should start so you're like now what well [ __ ] I don't know so the name of the presentation was how to win remember the whole intelligence and learning thing the longer it takes you to start doing the things you know what to do and how to do the less intelligent you are and whenever you get Stu stuck break things down that you need to do into continually smaller chunks until you understand how to do them so whenever you get stuck just think oh there are terms or words here that I don't understand I just need to break it down more don't let your ego get involved if
(41:11) you're like someone says you need to advertise more you got to be like okay what does that mean and you break it down okay it just means post this many okay I get that okay it means you have to do 100 DMS okay I got that so the reminder is you guys know how to win better than I could ever tell you so take the inverted list from earlier write out the things that would guarantee that you lose flip them to what you would do to win and then break down those terms into the action steps of what it takes to be that trait or have that skill traits are just
(41:42) skills and then practice it until it becomes second nature and then Chunk Up So in the beginning you just have to talk about doing 100 DMS once you know how to do that you know how to do cold calls and Outreach and door knocking and and ads and all this stuff then you can just say advertise you can chunk it up because you have more skills and then you measure your success by whether you completed the actions that would make it unreasonable that you will not fail and then you succeed by default so what would I have to do to make it unreasonable that I don't become
(42:12) number one list those do those and you will get there but you measure yourself on whether you did the thing that's it yes or no very simple and so all the greatest games in life that I found marriage health business you never actually win you don't win at marriage the point is to stay married you don't win at Health the point is to stay healthy you don't win at business the point is to stay in business and so it shifts the game from winning to outlasting and that means winning comes down to making a decision that you can 100% control which I think is
(42:48) cool and so I'll tell you a little story back in the day I pledged the fraternity and two weeks in my whole pledge class revolted we were like this sucks this is what we signed up for this is not fun in parties and girls it's like yeah no [ __ ] but it wasn't what our expectations were so they sat us down they gave us a pep talk and we got over it and then when I was on the other side I actually found out that every single pledge class every single year would Revolt between day 10 and day 16 every year and so I ended up becoming
(43:24) president of that fraternity and it was my turn to give that talk and so I go into this this freshman dorm room there's 20 of these guys they're outnumbering me right they're like we don't like you anymore like and so I said I get it guys I said who here thought that this would be easy no one raised it like who here thought it would be hard they raised their hands I was like this right now I was like this is what heart feels like you just didn't know what heart felt like this is what it feels like make
(43:55) sense we just just reset reality this is what hard feels like you said you expect it to be hard this is hard they all came back and so right now you may be at that point in your career and the Heart can be different for different people it might be stuck at a certain level of income it might be just getting started it might be being number two and wanting to be number one everyone's hard's different but this is what it feels like there's a level of uncertainty of not knowing whether your actions are going to yield the results that you want but doing them anyways not
(44:24) knowing if you're going to get credit from the market or on your on your on your check at the end of the month and whether this is really the thing that you want to do for the rest of your life everyone thinks these questions but the people who win just continue to do the actions regardless which is why I say focus on the activities not on the not on the inside your ears you can feel terrible and still win so that's what hard feels like so this is one of my favorite Chinese Proverbs everything must be hard before it can be
(44:53) easy what makes things hard is in complexity it's consistent consy as boring as it gets sometimes you just have to keep doing it before you get anything back hard times or opportunities to give yourself proof that even this couldn't stop you you're going to lose sleep you'll doubt whether it'll work you'll stress to make ends meet you won't finish your to-do list you'll wonder if you made the right call and you'll have no way to know for years but this is what hard feels like and this is what you signed up for and that's what makes it worth it and that is
(45:23) okay so in closing said a little Mr Miyagi everyone here knows what to do to win do all those things that you wrote down make them positive cool figure out those ways to lose and do the opposite you know how to do it remember you take those things chunk them down break it down so small that anyone could do it even a child you know why you should be doing it you have these opportunities that keep presenting themselves you keep looking at shiny objects but we get more for what we put in when we stick with things wealth is made during the hard
(46:00) times the few people left standing get the most of it you create Motivation by changing your environment and who you compare yourself to so you know why you should be doing it because you get outsized returns for sticking to things and you already know how to become the person you can win how do we do that by doing do who means do it's the easiest thing who do I want to become what does that person do I'll do that and you know when you should start which is if it's not not you're really busy right now in this season
(46:37) it's the best time to start if you don't have time you're spending it on the wrong stuff and if you think you need to get in order to do you have it backwards so when do you start the moment you want to be the first future version of you so here's my final reminder if you take one thing from this presentation if you do not change you did not learn and everyone here has things that they've written down from many of the talks of things that you want to do or want to think about or whatever I would encourage you to make that a list of things that you will do and then when
(47:13) you go back to the same condition your same home your same house your same Market your same whatever you change your behavior and then that will show that you learned and you took one step to becoming the person that you ultimately want to be thank you

Transcript:
(00:00) I fing guarantee you that you will be making more than people who have fouryear degrees you'll probably start making money by the end of the first year I was at Brooks house and she had 7 20 to 23 year olds at her house no cap one morning one of the guys was up early and he was like Hey right now I've got ,000 extra dollars like where do you think I should invest it you know I've got my 401k and I've got you know whatever stuff and it was cute it was so interesting to me because like he was looking for an investment vehicle that
(00:27) was going to yield him a return I want to be very clear about this if you invest in the S&P 500 you know real estate things like that and you start really early and you do it for a long period of time you abely will make money it is a very safe way to live life but the moment you start investing in kind of the asset side of stuff which is like the S&P stocks in general and you're not day trading or doing any of that stuff cuz that's that's stupid the moment you do that is actually the moment in my belief that you're actually
(00:55) ceasing to want to make more income hear me out if you're 18 years old and you Gra graduate high school tomorrow you are now eligible on the marketplace cuz you have no skills besides your high school diploma you did no job [ __ ] off the whole time don't watch YouTube to learn stuff which is not you but just imagine in 2 days you could go and become certified as a flomist and go from making 750 or whatever the minimum wage is to what FLOTUS make at $25 an hour you would triple your earning capacity after 2 days and spending $500
(01:25) if you can triple your income for the rest of your life the $500 certification in 2 days you you think it's worth the investment probably and so the problem is that people think about the biggest investment as the stuff that they take their money and they put it into and I'm going to be over I'm going to be trit right now your ability to earn money to provide value to the marketplace and solve problems for other people is how you will be able to make money there's the value of the problem that you solve and what you charge for it the bigger
(01:53) that number is the more you can charge that gap between their old problem and that solution that value is the percentage that you can take and put in your pocket as something that you have not created in this and it could be a service it could be products it could be whatever your earning capacity is going to be the thing that generates you wealth do you want to be smart with your money and save it absolutely cuz that gives you way more that you can play with but when you're 20 even when you're 30 and in my belief whatever age you are
(02:18) I believe that you should take all of the excess money live as cheap as you can take 100% of that excess money and invest it in education that increases your earning capacity because what happens is when you take that money like that full bottomy course right and you take $25 an hour time 2,000 hour a year you're now at a $50,000 a year income cool if I can live on 20 cuz I'm 20 years old and I can live with buddies and we can eat ramen soup and whatever and I got 30 left over after taxes 25 whatever 25 Grand can buy you a lot of
(02:46) Education I would rather you or I would rather me or somebody who's 20 or somebody who's 30 take $2,000 a month cuz that's what 25 Grand is and invest it in courses coaching mentorships workshops and seminars every month I'm putting that 2K now you could put 2K into one opportunity cuz you're like dude I think real estate's cool cool we're not doing real estate as my passive income we're doing real estate is I'm going to get into the real estate game and I'm going to make it my active income and by the way everybody who
(03:12) builds their wealth in real estate are actively spending their time in real estate don't believe what they're saying they're like dude I did this deal and I made x amount of money it's like what was the process of finding deals how many deals did you look at how many conversations did you have how many buildings did you walk how many different General Contractors oh wait there isn't there's other stuff that has to happen right back to the point let's say that you take that $2,000 a month and you do that for four years and I'm
(03:31) not saying do the four-year degree I think that is a play if you want to I don't necessarily agree with it anymore in the marketplace that currently exists four years later I [ __ ] guarantee you that you will be making more than people who have fouryear degrees you'll probably start making money by the end of the first year the amount of like copyrighting courses and books and programs mentorships and even one-on-one coaching like I think one-on-one coaching is a phenomenal way to learn a new skill if you're like hey I need to
(03:55) know how to buy media I need to know how to run an ad go pay someone who runs ads teaches people how to run ads when you make that payment you're seeing it as one class in your entrepreneurial degree rather than this one $112,000 investment has to make me Rich you can make that shift as like this is my course like when you get your degree in college you're not like oh I'm going to take one class in Spanish graduate and get whatever job I want no one thinks that way but for some reason to think about that when it comes to entrepreneurial
(04:23) stuff you're not paying someone to think that they're going to be your savior they're not going to save you from your life do everything for you no one person person is going to teach you everything I'll do my best on this channel to teach you stuff I know but you have something to learn from everyone you know like that wasn't the value that I thought I was just like you can still learn from that you want to go to the person who's providing the most value for free it's the easiest way for you to decrease your
(04:45) risk of purchase if you follow someone's Instagram you follow their YouTube you see the stuff they put out and you're like dude this is really good like this is a lot of new information that I didn't know and it's like very tactical and I understand like a you already know that you like the person B you already know that you're getting value from the person from the content they have and so the likelihood that the thing that they have that's paid is going to be worse than that is low you know hopefully follow lots of people in a particular
(05:06) space see the one that you jve with the most you like their teaching style you don't need to follow this stuff for forever to like belabor the decision give yourself seven days because you know what's really even cooler than buying one person's buy them all and then you'll know what everyone knows and then guess what happens you become just as good or better now you're making $80,000 a year well now we've got $4,000 a month that we can spend on coaching and mentorships and learnings and courses and whatnot I always saying to
(05:30) myself like I'm going to be the number one student here I'll just do whatever they say I'll see what happens and I'll do whatever they say I'll see what happens you want to replicate before you iterate before you say I'm going to put my Alex sauce on before you do that just make sure that you can duplicate what they're doing because then you earn the right to make the iterations even if it's not perfectly your style copy it first before you make the iterations if you see it as a bridge that has many bricks on it you have to lay all the
(05:51) bricks and here's the bad part let's say you've got 30 bricks on this bridge to make your first dollar the first dollar has to walk across the bridge when you're 28 bricks in you might not have made the first dollar yet but but you're 90% of the way there and the speed with which people are able to Traverse or cross that bridge is how well they identify which brick is missing and where they put their attention that's where a lot of people get disheartened is that they will start building new Bridges and get two three bricks and
(06:13) then they'll start building a new bridge two three bricks and they have lots of half-built bridges and they never make it all the way across let's say you're a videographer or you like video stuff skills stack exponentially you got a video skill now you got an editing skill now you understand social media messaging copyrighting and branding ooh management and operations and Leadership see how that person starts to expand you can imagine how their pay is going to dramatically increase because now you're a CMO broadening your Horizon and going
(06:40) deep in these other silos then all of a sudden you're an entrepreneur one is you have to make that decision that you're not going to spend all your money on stupid stuff the second is that you are going to spend your money not on the S&P but on the snme what is that you're going to spend it on you because that thing is going to compound a hell of a lot faster than 10% a year you can double triple 10x your earning capacity the people who are the richest people in the world they make a thousand times more Jeff Bezos made $40
(07:05) million an hour last year it's a lot

(00:00) if you're broke and you don't want to be anymore I'm going to reach you some stats I'm going to blow your mind and then I'm going to give you six steps so you don't have to be anymore the average American has a literal negative net worth means that babies are richer than people who are not babies because babies haven't gone into debt number two the average US minimum wage employee will make over a million dollars in their entire lifetime in earnings and if you were the median of US income you would earn $3 million over the course of your
(00:27) life so the reason staying poor is the decision is because you know as long as you continue to work you are going to make 1 million millions of dollars and most of the time it's going in places that don't make sense so challenge number one is the buy nothing challenge it's very simple you just buy nothing so disconnect your credit card from Amazon leave your wallet at home when you go to work have no way to pay for stuff if your gas if your insurance rent car payment if buy food at discount grocery stores you pack your lunch that's all if
(00:56) you buy nothing it is as austere or hard core as my recommendations may appear I do not ask people to do things that I haven't done and so like when I was taking $2,000 a month me personally I was in a house with six roommates and I split my bedroom with one roommate and so like yeah two beds two dudes looking at each other like every night when I was making a million dollars a month I was living on less than 15 and so the key takeaway that shifted how I thought about making money and more importantly keeping money is that well wealth is
(01:30) actually a ratio between what you earn and what you need and the number one rule of money is spend less than you make and so I always like being super super conservative with my expenses relative to what I make because I don't like spending money that I feel like I do those of you who the the three YouTube uh odd commenters uh who think that this is a prop set you get just look out the window it's all AI the first thing you have to do to become wealthy is that you have to decide to become wealthy and you have to decide that it's under your
(02:05) control you have to switch from victim to Victor so as much as you may have had a disadvantage or maybe you found a Deb or you made poor decision you have to be the person who's most powerful in your life around money now the third thing and this is the one that really kills me is that in the US 35% of every paycheck goes towards paying one thing you know it is Banks lenders for debt 35% that's because people don't think about their mortgage as debt they don't think about their car payment as debt they don't think about their credit cards as
(02:36) debt there's a reason that banks are 100 plus years old because they don't go out of business they make so much money on money money is their product and you keep buying their money from them at a bad price man at a compounding price that goes up every single year and those people don't do the math on compounding but like right now so many people are trying to get 10% 9% returns in stock market with their credit cards 24% against them and so the easiest thing you can do right at the beginning will pay off the things that are guaranteed
(03:09) 24% negative returns they're guaranteed it's amazing they're guaranteed returns against you being wealthy compound interest is the Eighth Wonder in Charlie M and you want to face off head-to-head against the Eighth Wonder World against your gos bad idea so the thing is that if you're earning enough money and then you have the right habits being broke is a temporary status so step one save for an emergency fund and so these steps are similar to D Ram's baby steps because I think he's permanent 100 times over and
(03:42) it's worth modeling success so number one sa for your work fund which is basically between $1,000 and $55,000 so reason that so many people don't hit their savings goals is because something happens right and so it's like have a wor for when your AC breaks or when your carburetor needs to be replaced the thing is is that things that are unexpected you can expect them to happen you just don't know which one it's going to be because if you look at a year it's like about once a month they'll have something unexpected her and you know
(04:09) it's going to cost you and so it's just preparing for the expense not which expense it is but what about like dead should i p it on first no learn to save money first and just watch the amount go up get to that L but I say this because I'm not trying to make your life difficult they trying to tell you what I did to get here and for those of you who find that useful you can model whatever you want that habit has stuck with me so even when I was making a million dollars a month early Ro in my career our rent was 1,200 bucks a month so then we ball
(04:41) out and get appetizers and we get the Bang Bang Shrimp at bone bone so you know sh out to V I took like $100 felt like a like a rich guy so I say this cuz some people just immediately change how they live when they make more money even the fact I was able to start in 23 was because I saved every dollar I made so I could have 50,000 something it wasn't like I was I was making crazy money I think I I think I made 55,000 or 60,000 I think my first year out of college and then I made I want to say 70 or 80 something like that the
(05:18) next year and I save 50 after taxes so I'm going to show you something really quick if you have a $200 pair of Jordans that you really want to buy now you might want to buy them today and let's say you're 25 years old you're like I I deserve these I work really hard for them okay fine but that $200 invested just in the S&P 500 we're not even getting to s& 500 I'll talk about that later between now and the time you retire do you want to know what that actually is yeah $200 per shoes and we're going to give it 40
(05:54) years we're going to make our return 9% additional cation zero instead of buying that $200 pair of shoes when you were 65 it could be over $6,000 if you just invested in the S&P so if you wouldn't buy those shoes for $6,000 then maybe don't buy them today for $200 when you buy Jordans it's not there's no upside that money is gone it's just $6,000 that could have been something that's just going to be zero and that's a big loss when you do it over and over and over again right like 6,000 $7,000 does take a lot of those to
(06:31) add up to a million 130 of those purchases is a million you probably do that in a couple years and so that's personal risk now business risk if you take good business risk there's upside the thing is is that sometimes you can't take this business risk because your personal risk is too high and so for me my whole life I've tried to jam this risk as low as I possible good so that I can go on the offensive on the business side I saved as much as I could when I had my job so start a gy that was a big Ritz but I had I lived almost nothing in
(07:04) Baltimore so that I could take that swing and if I hadn't had the basics there I would not have been able to take that shot and I sold those businesses that lost everything two more times if I had had to go into debt just to live then I would have never been able to take their second and third shots and so the whole point is is like you will increase your shots on gooll by living risk-free or low risk in your personal life you'll be able to fail more like I failed more times than it I'm telling you I had nine failed businesses I seven
(07:34) failed Partnerships like I have many failures but the only reason I can get back up is because I don't have this big thing that I have to take care of it's like I know that I can live on peanut butter sandwiches and and egg whites mixing uh protein protein powder from the gas station with water I I can do that I because I have I've already done and I flipped them right now like I've had these like I like them they're fine they're perable so I live with almost nothing and it doesn't bother me cuz I know how I was pretty content when I was Bor I'm
(08:04) pretty content now right I like the game more now so I'm bringing all these points up because saving money won't make you money but it will allow you to think further out and make bigger bets which absolutely will make you more money if I had not done that I wouldn't have a gym if I hadn't been the gym I wouldn't have done the gym turnour if I done the gym turn around I wouldn't have done gym launch didn't do gym launch I would have been able to do Prestige Labs Prestige Labs I would able to sell do Allen from there wouldn't be able to do
(08:31) acis.com so like it sounds small but it's a tiny Domino that you could control all right step two which is you can begin paying off debt there's two ways of thinking about paying off debt there's The Logical way and the psychological way I would recommend the psychological way so let's say that you've got three different uh you know cards than you owe you've got one that's 20% one that's 15% almost 10% okay logic would state that you should go after the 20% but psychology would state that you should go after the one that you can pay
(08:59) off fastest so my recommendation despite the fact that the math would say oh I should pay off the the bigger the one that cost you the most first you're going to pay them all off eventually and you've been dealing with all three of them for like years now so chill maybe just follow the process which is get a win faster that's the whole pointy and so pay them off in reverse order of speed and paying them off so it's like boom I knock going out might knock went out like you want to have those little like jackpots but
(09:26) organize them so you have more of them sooner in your process now if the one that you have the highest in on is also the fastest off that definitely that's a double wi like you can have like three quick wins and you're just waiting like n months to do that because you have to pay this big net off it's like just get the win and to be clear when I'm talking about paying off debt I'm talking primarily on Consumer Debt and credit cards and things like that the de that we're not going to deal with it is going to be like House St like you're more
(09:49) dtic if you have a car I would recommend getting rid of that uh and trading it down easiest way to pay off your car is pay off a chaper car and trade in the one that you have just just you're you're living beyond your means it's just that you thought your means were higher than they are but that's okay that's why you're watching this I would give you one mental image that should hopefully drag through why this is so important so you got to save about 10 bucks a day for you to get a million dollars in 40 years so the ma is $250 a
(10:22) month that you would put away and the compounds at 9% then you can be a million in 40 years that feels so so easy to do the only thing easier is not doing and if you were to just put $500 a month away at $500 a month you'd be at 2.1 million in 40 years now to be clear most people can live on about 4ish per and that's with never touching the principle at some point you can start unwinding it and spending the money right but at 4% which is very safe amount that you can that you can spend off that you can live 80 grand a year
(10:56) this is the gameification that I would want you to think about which is that for every $250 that you save every month it's a million doll in just basically just use that as your map and you're like wait so if I save 1,000 they're like right that's 4 million you're like if I save 2,000 like that's 8 million right and so the thing is is that's where you're going to get into this game we're going to be like Fiji Water you're like screw Fiji Water right like I I'll use the spigot in the back now if you're watching this you're like well then
(11:24) didn't you spend all this money on this yeah there's levels right but we got to get from level one first which is we got to spend less than we make we got to we got to save what we're keeping okay step three is you're actually going to kind of like double down on step one which is this is that you expand your emergency savings $1 to $5,000 is not real emergency savings that's like just to prove to yourself that you've learn how to save money the real emergency savings is really having like 3 to 6 months of living expenses saved up so you can just
(11:50) like leave it in an interest uh bearing account which there's plenty of places that'll give you 5 or 6% at least today I'm making you this video on the money you put in there the magic of of this is that when you put that cash there your level of anxiety around everything else in life will go down and this will then snowball in being able to actually take your eyes from paycheck to paycheck and look up then this is where saving money makes you money is that it allows you to see the opportunities around you because you
(12:19) actually can go on the offense now be clear we're not going to invest this money this money is just your brick of safety that you always have because you don't know what's going to happen next so that seems the way to step forward which is eliminate risky spending so if you have a car lease turn it in all right and then buy a $5,000 cler all right so 5 Grand 10 grand in cash again we're we're at step four now all right so you've already you've already saved some money you've learned how to save you paid off some debt now trade that
(12:44) thing in had own every car we had in cash and all we had bought and used I think my first few cars all had uh over 100,000 W that was just how I thought everyone bought cars negotiate look for a car that's 100,000 years old look at Carfax to have something that has low insurance and low uh repairs and a lot of that stuff you can look at average cost for repair by different Vehicles next thing is if you have multiple cars downgrade to one I mean l I've lived with one car for years I just have a great story about I
(13:12) haven't told the story forever so the first time I drove up to a gym launch event so we had I think like 30 or 40 by of the time we had an event for all the gym owners to come out to this was an Alber C New Mexico that's where Le and I CH at the time and as I pulled up I pulled up at lela's car now his was how C there was no other car and it had a crack in the windshield and a dead in the door see me and one of the ladies who's in the group was like H I thought you were supposed to be rich I was like oh you should see my backing here I know
(13:42) what game I'm playing the game you're judging me on is a stupid game you know if you have kids maybe there's considerations there but even then like is there a way that you can just use foresight and say how will we share one car because there are many families that do have kids and just share one car and so if they can do it so can do and what you're doing is you're paying for convenience but that convenience is costing remember $500 a month what's that that's $2 million that's for that convenience is it is it is it $2 million
(14:09) worth it probably not and so what I want to push on is like what's your what's your Vice some people like they love going down to e people love shoes that's guys anrs right uh some people love clothes some people love vacation so some people just like live in a neighborh that shouldn't be it you've got to look at how that translates into time it translates into future money so there's the two big measuring sticks I want you to use is if you can translate all the stuff you have so like that car is a $600 a month lease that you have
(14:37) right that means that let's say that you make $100 a day right say 12250 hour okay let's say and that's let's say that's post tax so you're at 15 or something like that okay that means that if you work 4 weeks a month 22 days of work days in a month you're working six of your 22 days for the car that you drive to work with Okay like people aren't translating the money into the time and let's say that you spend you know $1,200 a month on on your lease and maybe you know wherever you live right okay well now you got 12 days so we got 6 and 12 we're
(15:18) at 18 of our 22 days you sh you don't have W left right it's like how much of each of these days am I am I using up to just do my fixed cost and these are the ones that you can completely Jam down only thing that people hate is your ego and when I said earlier that I'm not going to ask you to do something I haven't done I was a white color consultant who saved $50,000 and I had a condom and I then got rid of that and then basically moved into my far drove across the country didn't have a place to live uh had a guy like
(15:54) basically allow me to rent my bedroom for $400 a month and then I like I my my gym R which is $5,000 but I was like Jesus I'm not I'm not try get anymore r on so I lived in my gym I I lived on zero I was hopeless I lived inside my gym like it was fine it was just not legal I had a client say like oh my God you should be taking better care of this car it was like dirty and I had like washed it or whatever that tiny action was representative of hundreds and thousands of smaller actions I hope you get to where I'm at right now and so I'm
(16:23) very grateful for that man at that time who was going to take that sacrifice for me to do what what I can do now so a great question that I have for you is what are you willing to give up to be a milia rather than what are you willing to do because a lot of times in the beginning it's about it's about elimination not addition the people that you're going to get out of your life it's the expenses that you're going to get out of your life it's the postur it's going to be the the showing off if you aren't willing to sacrifice anything
(16:53) to become a millionaire you never will become uh the dormant of my building started fall some steps and he went from having a $600 month lease to buying a car in cash that he now own that's a big downgrade for what he had but he's paying off his debt and now he's like just seeing every month my debt go down he's like it's so like reinforcing I was like in my company when I found out that some of the highest earners were living paycheck to paycheck I like talk to more of them about this I really wanted to figure out what it was and so what was
(17:25) interesting about it was that the people who were the wealthiest the ones who had the most saved up the most invested were not offering the highest earners again it's this this misconception that people think make a lot of money have a lot of money and often times that's not the case at all and I don't know about you I would rather be underestimated for how much money I got and so the real question is do you want to look rich or do you want to be rich and I think a lot of you guys if you're being honest with yourselves
(17:50) want to look rich you want people to give your dabs on being rich you don't actually want to have the security me I'm actually very risky person I hate I hate the feeling of needing money I hate the feeling of needing money more than you do that's why I did everything in my life so that I wouldn't have to feel that way real F your tolerance for poverty is higher you've accustomed to that feeling you're willing to deal with that stress I'm be clear you got a family things like that yeah it's just a spouse conversation is the neighbor we need to
(18:24) be we farle like you have to be real about this and you're not going to keep up with the Jones today but you will pass the Jones eventually if you want to look rich long term the best way to do that is to actually be rich because you will be stressfree or less stressed about money and I think that does have material change and how your life feels so I'll just read you a quote from Charlie W he said the first 100 Grand is a but you got to do it I don't care what you have to do if it means walking everywhere not eating anything
(18:55) that wasn't purchased like a coupon find a way to get your hands on a underr after today e off the gas a little bit you mind you he said this years ago so it's probably close to150 maybe $200,000 today and so I say this because you want to make it fun and so I gave you my little story about the doorm earlier put it on an excelion if I save this much every month if I save this much every month and see how quickly you can knock it down right so the next one is uh is around mortgages if you're renting you want to downgrade to something that's
(19:26) cheaper as cheap as you possibly can if you have a mortgage that you can afford uh harder to get out of that and so you can refinance if they're if the rates are lower if they're not lower then you want to try and get a 15-year fixed and that way you can just try and pay it down as fast as possible the idea is that you just want to pay the house off and now we don't have to worry about it unless the government comes after for problem with taxes well I can tell you that living in a cash B for house uh is very chill but you're learing okay my
(19:54) car is paid forign cash my house is paid forign cash what happens is that your earning capacity start snowballing because if you don't have this car payment and you don't have a mortgage all of a sudden you're like whoa I'm only working 2 days a month for my normal expenses in the other 20 I have now for going all in on investments in either myself or assets that about overti so step five is invest 15% of pre-tax income pre-tax income into stuff that's going to go up over time now the way that I like to think
(20:25) about this is automate Investments frictional lie spending so basically you make it hard to spend easy to save easy to invest and so I like to take the things that have to get have to get saved have to get invested off the top before I begin everything else right now I still would have another bucket there that would be education that I would invest in if you're like man let's talk about the S&P 500 I don't know if I have the the money for that right and to be to do educational stuff it's like well spend less and if like I can't spend
(20:57) less you can always spend less right um but you can still split it and say okay I'll put 15% pre tax into investing I'll put another 15% pre- tax into my education cuz that going to increase your capacity cuz listen as soon as you can replace what it cost you in education for that investment everything else is gravy it's like house money and so like the whole goal of the first educational investment is to cover itself once that happens like it's all doubling down after that and that's my recommendation is like the day that you
(21:27) stop investing with in your education getting more skills is that that you decide that you don't want to make any more money than you probably are by the way this isn't investment advice you can do whatever the hell you want this is just be telling you what I told my team so next one is a little money habit still underneath step five is you want to check your accounts daily so this is something that I recommend for everybody who's basically before your savings schol um I stop looking at my accounts every day once we cross like 20 million
(21:54) that was when I literally stopped checking every day cuz the volatility sto making sense it make sense anymore but you want want to have a pulse for your money and so you want to know you want to you want to know what's coming in what's going out like you want to you want to feel that and when you're looking at expension like that's a lot for me cuz you know how much that hits your account and like that that was a good inflow you're willing to to to to spend more in some areas that you're like I'm getting returns there but like
(22:16) you can't know that unless you be account every day you have that flow so if you want to know something wild so if you were 20 years old right now and you do the thing that I'm about to tell you it's going to sound insane but you would have $50 million saved up at the end so here's how it works you take on an extra job you work an extra shift you make an extra $2,500 a month that means you drive Uber you you say you go to your boss and say I have more time can I do someone else's job or can I look at other jobs and take
(22:49) portions of that for more pay and a lot of times if you just offer to work more businesses will pay you more because they have more work to do and so you can make an extra ,000 $2,000 $3,000 a month but if you made an extra $2,500 a month and you put that every single month towards just investing into the S&P 5 again not s just S&P all the other stuff we said stays we're just doing this on top and we're not touching it so then you would have 55 years of compounding at 99.
(23:23) 7% and let's say you're starting amount with zero and you're going to put $2,500 a month away you did that for 55 years you'd have $52 million at the end like you'd be ultra high net worth and so I I say this because wealth is a decision it's something that you can control and it starts with spending less than what you make it's about increasing your earning capacity segmenting and paying off the things that are that are that are dumb to be paying for locking in the negative compounding against you and blocking those so that you you can start the
(23:59) positive compounding developing the simple habit of saving something then paying off smaller ones then saving up bigger ones then getting a little bit more on the offensive restructuring house debt so that you can pay it off faster once you're there then start snowballing then you go more aggressively into you work the extra shifts you invest the 15 pre-tax maybe invest another 15 pre-tax into yourself if I to pick between the two Bar None not even close I'd invest in me because your ability to earn more using money is
(24:27) going to always be higher than the S&P 500 even know so let's say that you put $10,000 into the S&P 500 and it grows 10% you have 1,000 bucks great let's say instead you take the $10,000 and I said that working that extra shift well maybe instead of uh uh shoveling snow you buy a snowblower and now the snowblower takes you from doing three driveways a day to doing 20 when you knock doors and say Hey you know snow blow your your driveway for you with 7ex your earning capacity will that make you more than an extra ,000 this year yes buy a lot buy a
(25:00) long shot and so the key is not thinking about uh what you can do passively with the money although I I like having this understanding of it especially in the beginning it's about increasing your active income so here's the craziest thing that $52 million that you would have that's being made by someone no matter what think about this for a second if you didn't change your habits you'd more or less make the same amount of money but that 35% % of the American paycheck is going to someone and not someone is taking that money and putting into
(25:33) something that Couts and they're doing it for the entirety of your life and so the question just comes down to who do you want that $50 million to belong to do you want it to belong to the banks and their shareholders or do you want it to belong to you but either way that money is being made it's just whether it's going to be you who pass it at the end so the last step just to be clear is that you pay off your mortgage then all of your basic living expenses are are covered your fixed costs are done and now all of that unlocks even more
(26:01) investment into your long-term Legacy now this works really well when paired with the the uh the 30 by2 all right so 30X 12 working challenge is basically you work 30 days straight no weekends 12 hours a day and you don't take days off now what happens is now everyone like that's not sustainable that's why I said 30 days not the rest of your life the point is is that you'll realize at the end of days that you can work harder than you thought you could you can go a week or two without taking a day off and you're not going to die cuz Believe It
(26:35) or Not thousands of years we didn't have weekends weekends are A New Concept that's happened as soon as factories were invented and I think it was a way to get even more something out of people I can't even remember what it was the point is is that if you stop spending all your money and then you take all the time when you normally would spend money and then make money you get a double you reduce the negative and add to the positive and see how much damage you can can do in 30 days and then then you could say is it worth it for me to get
(27:04) what I want
14 Life Lessons I Wish I Knew Earlier - YouTube

Transcript:
(00:00) 13 lessons I learned after graduating college from The Real World that I wish I had learned earlier the first is that you make better decisions and you learn more by assuming that you're dumber than everyone else the reason this was something that took me a long time to learn is that when I was in college it was all about showing how smart you were it was about talking more in the group meetings about raising your hand more in the classroom I took that and started translating in the real world and I realized that I didn't learn very much
(00:25) because I was the one talking all the time and it only took a few times of me getting introduced to somebody someone would introduce us and I would basically spend the whole time blabbering on about how great I was and how much I knew only to find out later that this person was way above me in business and whatever things that I was pursuing at the time and then I felt tons of Shame and embarrassment about how stupid I was for doing that I had to shift the way that I talked to new people and the way that I entered rooms and I'll be real I still
(00:50) talked probably too much but at least being aware of that lesson as early as it could I wish I had learned it earlier fundamentally you can't learn if you're talking and so if you're trying to learn then not talk talking is the first requisite for doing that and if you want to make better decisions than you need to learn this was a big Epiphany I had I got introduced once to somebody I was walking peripherally after I had left and somebody else went up to them and was like do you know who that guy is and in that moment I realized that my
(01:16) positioning was now Sky High because I didn't have to be the one to say it the idea that I realized was how can I get other people to edify me because what I had to allow people to do was to make the same mistake that I used to make which is that someone young someone inexperienced someone less aware whatever would come up and then start posturing themselves and blathering on about everything that they're doing and me I might be way ahead of them but I would listen and see if there's anything interesting and so on that conversation
(01:42) I learned more than they did I learned what type of person they are I learned where they're at with their career if they had anything interesting that would be worth following up with they learned nothing they felt good about themselves and then later would feel bad about themselves when that other person went over and told them and so I was like of these two scenarios which would I rather do would I rather have someone have a conversation with me and then not know who I was but be able to learn because that's the that's the worst case
(02:06) scenario or would I rather blather on learn nothing either I am above them and then they're like well [ __ ] that guy he brags or I'm below them and I'm the [ __ ] so I stopped doing that so that was lesson number one lesson number two was that the hardest respect to earned is one zone what I realized and this was something that was really hard for me is that I had a pretty bad reputation in the very beginning of my college career in all of my high school career and it was because I drank too much I was irresponsible I slept around a lot and I
(02:30) wasn't representing the tempers that I wanted to be and so I felt ashamed of the behaviors that I did but I didn't change them and so it was only through a conversation I had with my father where I said how do I change my reputation how do I get these people to stop saying this stuff and I thought there was some like PR marketing angle that I could take that I could control the narrative and he said why don't you stop being a piece of [ __ ] and he said that in his own you know in his own words and I was like that can't be it I'll figure out a
(02:53) way when parents talk to kids they're listening but they're not listening that really stuck with me and I started thinking about it and so I said like well if I wanted to be somebody who's respectable what would I do and so then I try to start acting in that way to be someone who's respect my own I would earn and so when I started doing that nothing changed externally people still treated me like I was a piece of [ __ ] and they were probably right but my behavior began to change and then slowly so did my reputation but it started with
(03:16) me trying to respect myself first and then others began to respect me as a result if you want to control what people think control what they say this is the third lesson I learned and this is more of a business marketing lesson but if you want to talk about products and services you have to equip people with the words to describe what you have because otherwise you're asking them to solve the problem of how to describe your business and if right now you can't even figure out how you're going to describe your business and you own the
(03:40) darn thing how do you expect them to do it in half second when they're telling their friend and so this is really about equipping people with simple language so they can communicate what you do so for example at acquisition.com the mission when I started the business was to document and share the best practice of building world-class companies most people don't know what that means and so I have now and we probably will shift the language to make real business education available to everyone they functionally mean the same thing but
(04:00) giving people the words to describe it in a way that they understand allows me to give them more so they can explain to somebody else you get more out of reading one book that's great five times than out of reading five mediocre books I don't read many books and what I mean by that is I buy lots of books I skim most of them and quickly realize that it's not worth reading and so then I toss them aside because just because someone wrote a book doesn't mean you need to finish it has nothing to do with you it means that they didn't organize
(04:25) it well I have found that books that are older in general tend to be better because the reason the person wrote it was a different intention they wrote it because they wanted to transmit knowledge to the Next Generation whereas the people who write books now are either writing for money writing for notoriety or writing them to sell other [ __ ] if you find books where the author is actually writing because they want you to convey knowledge to the Next Generation those tend to be better books in my experience because the intent is
(04:43) to actually teach not to persuade slight difference when you do find those gems I have realized that if I read something once end to end I still don't know it yet I will read a book two times three times four times five times until I can teach the book when I feel like it is worth learning and then once I have like squeeze the book for everything that it has to the point where I can convey the message to somebody else like I can teach the concepts of the book which is something that I've done many times or I'll actually make a presentation on the
(05:09) book so that I can wrap my own Frameworks around how I can remember it that's where a lot of these Frameworks come from is because it's me trying to make sense of the world in a way that I can remember if your behavior doesn't change as a result of reading a book and it means you've learned nothing which means it was a waste of time and many people who read books are just wasting their time because their behavior doesn't change and so I consolidate once I find something that's good I plug everything I possibly can into it and
(05:28) suck the juice out of it so that I can change my behavior as a result which comes from the Frameworks and how I think about it how deeply do you understand the knowledge of the book there's a handful of books that if you just did them for the rest of your life you'd win because if you just did how to make friends and influence people and you put it into your DNA you would be successful number five is that most Champions do not have something that you do not they lack something that you have it's a different thought process because
(05:49) if all of us have the exact same hours per day it means that they're allocating their time differently many times they eliminate things that you are still doing they have sacrificed more they have given up things that you have continued to have on your tree 3 as branches that are distracting from growing up Champions when I look at the people who are further ahead of me they're even more ruthless with their time they even have lower tolerance for friends family people around them that are not at the bar that they hold
(06:11) themselves to for me going through college or you know when I was younger I always thought it was about adding to your plate saying yes to everything saying yes to opportunity say yes say yes yes when all I did was I just completely got distracted and spread super thin what most Champions have is singular focus and they are willing to say no to everything else and that took me too long to learn six is that Goodwill compounds faster than money like if you actually think about what Goodwill is it's that you have positive
(06:36) sentiment and you have a degree of influence over a person's Behavior that's what good will is if one person has Goodwill with you and then shares your stuff with somebody else and you create Goodwill in that next person you can double your Goodwill or 10x your Goodwill in a matter of 12 weeks 10xing your money in a matter 12 weeks is very very unlikely Goodwill because it's based on audiences and humans can compound significantly faster than money can and when I realized that that Goodwill could be translated into money
(07:01) if I so desired at a future date then I realized and rather than focusing on the money that I'm trying to make today water and I focus on the compounding vehicle that compounds at a much faster rate than money does that compounds tax-free by the way building the audience is tax free and then when you choose to have the conversion event you can do that at your own choosing but if you focus on the audience you focus on the Goodwill that will grow significantly faster than any kind of monetary move but you can still
(07:22) translate that later into money when you want seven is that you're going to die two weeks after you die most people have forgotten about you and six months after you died no one will talk about you and if they're not caring enough then then it certainly doesn't matter what they think about your life now because if that's the most significant event that's going to happen in your life which is that you stop living how much credibility or weight should we give to other people's opinions on what we should do with our lives in my opinion
(07:46) very little unless the person has a vested interest in seeing you succeed comma and the context to provide the advice most of the times it's just worth ignoring because they're trying to live their own life and they're projecting their own beliefs and experiences on you and you've spent all this time trying to improve your own view of reality the the beliefs that you've shed and shifted that they have not and so what they believe to be true is what they're casting on to you and if you don't like the life they have then I don't think
(08:07) it's worth listening to eight extraordinary accomplishments come from doing ordinary things for Extraordinary periods of time this is just me speaking about me but when I was younger my action showed that I was more impatient I always was willing to sacrifice what I had today to get the quick Buck I you know I was always I was Shifty like that because I just thought that that was how it worked I thought there was some Shortcut I didn't know about and I would see the guys on stages being like this is what we do we do the basics and we do
(08:32) a lot of it I was like they're just trying to hold the secrets back and I'm here to tell you that that is not true like I wish I could go and shake my college self and be like if you do one thing for a very long period of time you will get very good at it and it will Compound on to itself and maybe I would listen to me if I mean if future self showed up in my living room now I would totally listen to him but you know what I mean and so I can't do that so the next best thing I can do is try and Shake You by the collar the thing that
(08:55) makes the action extraordinary is the commitment to it not the nature of the action itself working out and doing reps is not extraordinary if you saw one set of a workout from me at the gym you wouldn't think oh this guy is amazing look at them quads it's the fact that you do it for 23 years is what compounds on itself if you listen to one guy make one phone call you listen to one major league baseball player one at bat nothing about that is extraordinary it's the dedication to doing it over and over and over and over
(09:23) again despite feeling like there's better opportunities despite people approaching you with new and exciting things but saying that you're committed to the original Vision you had and that reality has not changed in such a way that your native beliefs are no longer true you said I believe that X Y and Z is true and as long as that remains to be true then I will continue on this path for an extraordinary period of time and that not the action itself but your commitment to the action is what makes someone extraordinary nine if it's worth
(09:45) doing it's worth doing well this is a really great saying I shortcuted so much stuff when I was younger I just wanted to like get it done get it done get it done rather than doing it well there's kind of two ways you can take the saying which is why I like it so much is that if it's worth doing it's worth doing well because many times I was doing things that were not worth doing I didn't have the time to do things well because I was doing so many things that were not worth doing the first criteria is what problem are we solving what am I
(10:11) hoping to accomplish is this worth doing at all because if it is worth doing then I have to understand that to do it comma right to do it well it's going to take this much time now given that is it still worth doing and if it passes that test of a being worth doing in the Long Haul and because it is worth doing worth doing well then it gives us this lens through which to see the activities we do so that we can prioritize the things that will make us the most money are going to get us closer to the goals we have and so younger me had more energy
(10:38) than me does now I make way more money than younger me did is because I do fewer things and I do different things than I did then and now if I write a book I'll take a year on writing the book because if it's worth doing it's worth doing well because I understand that taking one year today will mean that that book might sit and sell and distribute itself to millions of people over the next 50 years or 100 years or after I'm dead compared to me just putting words on a page that are pretty good and then shipping it and I think
(11:05) the vast majority of people don't get the difference between good and great the Ocean between good work and great great work is vast it's five times ten times the work to go from something good to something great which is why you have to be really selective about the few things you choose to do that are worth doing and in being worth doing worth doing well 10.
(11:23) be willing to negotiate everything except for your values and so there were so many things when I was coming up that like in college even right after college is jobs like I always just took things at face value so prices terms relationships everything I took it face value so whatever someone presented I said yes or no to I have now realized that virtually everything is negotiable people present with basically their best bad guess and they're hoping that someone takes them by the hand and says you know that makes no sense what if we did it this way what problem are
(11:52) you solving what problem am I solving and then ask the right questions to get someone else's true desires and wants and then knowing what your own true desires and wants and what you're willing to give up allows you to make better deals and so I used to think of negotiating as a zero-sum game and it's not at all you can find a way where both parties get better than they were before which is the entire point that is how negotiating works if you're doing it well and so I didn't understand that I thought everything was an armrest so I
(12:16) thought everything was like this for that Tit for Tat like no give and I also thought really short about it I was like I was trying to get one over I was ruthless with vendors I swung in the other direction so first I didn't negotiate anything and then I found out you could negotiate and then tried to get everyone to give me their last penny but then I realized that this long term doesn't create good relationships and they will not be loyal to you at all which long term has a more negative impact than giving them the extra 10 and
(12:39) having an amicable relationship you want to negotiate everything except for your values I negotiated everything in that second example including my values because I was doing business in a way that was contrary to the values that I wanted to espouse wanted to embody because the deals we do with acquisition.
(12:54) com for example like I could probably ask for significantly more than I do and I've had many times for people like I want to give you this I'm like I don't want that because I don't think you know what that means this is what I think is fair today and in 10 years and so it's balancing both your need today your need in 10 years and their need today and there needed 10 years and you have those four points and you try and find the closest point given your reality and you can explain that this is how you're thinking through it with them and I think they will appreciate all
(13:20) four data points on the map to come to the best solution for today and tomorrow 11. [Music] humility this is a big one because I want to be a different voice on this because I have heard all over the Internet recently people saying humility is stupid if you looked up what the word means you wouldn't want to be it because if you look it up on Google it says thinking less of oneself this is why looking and defining terms is important because if you look at Merriam-Webster for example it's lack of Pride or arrogance I don't think people would say
(13:47) you wouldn't want that I was like no I think I think people are okay not being popular arrogant I think that's okay but even more so and the definition that I have taken on is actually the exact opposite of that which is it is not decreasing your regard for self but increasing your regard for others that's from Clayton Christensen who's a Harvard Professor go to the human I thought that posturing when I was younger was the thing that would get people to like me but what I realized later was that you gain status by giving more to the group
(14:12) than you get this is especially true for guys it's probably true for girls but I can't speak to that if you want to gain status the way you do it is by sacrificing more for the group that everyone else does if you want to gain status in a company you give more to the company than anyone else does more than company gives you back because what do they do they reward that behavior the group rewards the person who gives to the group it's how it works the people who take from the group they only go in to get status from the group end up
(14:38) getting banished by the group and batted down because everyone wants to keep that person down because they don't serve anyone else and so it was only by realizing that I had to give my life in order to get it I had to give status I had to serve because when you serve someone you're giving them status you're increasing your guard for others when I gave status I got it back when I gave respect first I would get respect back and it was understanding that group dynamic which is what made me president of the fraternity that I was in all of
(15:02) these things started compounding when I realized that truth and if you do that I promise you you will have all the status you want 12. the happy man has a thousand Wishes the sad man has won this is a little bit more of a heartfelt one for me because when I was younger I was definitely angrier probably darker in general and a lot of that came because I had expectations that were fictitious real or otherwise from other people in my mind that existed who were constantly judging the behaviors and actions I was doing every day and were telling me that
(15:30) I was not enough in some ways that created and reinforced behaviors that I still continue to this day in terms of the actions I take but the way that I feel and think about them has shifted when you are sad you want to not be sad that's the main focus you want to feel better and many times people will take the short-term way of getting out of that which is alcohol drugs Etc because in the moment they can feel better everyone just wants to feel better and so when I think about things that I used to think people were wronging me right
(15:57) you know get all angry and I'd spin myself out I use a different frame now which is they just wanted to feel better do you think it had nothing to do with me and they just wanted to feel better about themselves and that's given me a lot of Peace about many of the things that used to anger me being able to quiet the hundreds of non-existent voices in my head that were constantly judging the activities that I was doing and labeling them good or bad or good enough or not good enough Etc took up a tremendous amount of my attention and
(16:20) because of that all of my focus was on feeling better and so I couldn't actually have any energy left over to do stuff because all I was focused on was feeling better and all I was spending all my day was in my head trying to not feel like [ __ ] and doing both short and long-term things to do that and so it was only when I came up with a mantra which I have said before but [ __ ] happiness which sounds ironic because I said the person who's happy is a thousand wishes but in choosing not to admit the deficiency between my current
(16:45) state and the future state of what I desire to be I was able to accept where I was and then the deficiency of not being good enough not being happy enough disintegrated in my mind and then I was able to focus on just doing things and then when I started doing things I started making progress when I started making progress I started looking back and feeling proud of how far I had come because it wasn't about the many voices outside it was about the only one that mattered and so that shift is what I think genuinely from Spirit social
(17:10) standpoint is the thing that was able to give me the strength to do some of the things we have done but I wouldn't have been able to ever start on this path because I was paralyzed about what I thought other people were going to think about me only to realize that they weren't thinking about me at all 13. failure leads to learning learning leads to success success leads to complacency complacency leads to failure and so a lot of times I remember thinking that like there was a destination but I think the actual entrepreneurial cycle it's
(17:35) not a destination it's not linear it's cyclical and so that's why I talk about entrepreneurship in terms of Seasons because there are Cycles where you learn a lot right I used to say this a lot where I'd say either the business is growing or I am either I have learned lessons and I am applying those lessons to the business and the business is growing or the business is not growing and has problems and now I am the one receiving the lessons from the business and until I learned the lesson that I'm supposed to learn the business will
(17:57) cease to grow until I have learned this lesson until I beat this boss at this level and the difference between video games in real life is that sometimes in order to beat that boss you're not doing it in 10 minutes it might take you 10 years recognizing that you are not above the cycle but that that cycle is inevitable because you have failure learning success complacency the goal is if you can identify that how quickly can you get back to learning success learning success and try and skip the complacency step altogether it still
(18:20) happens to a degree when I can start feeling the feelings and it's rearing its head I'm aware of it and it allows me to speed through it faster into the same degree I stop labeling things as good or bad because if I'm failing it means I'm about to go through learning and I see learning is good and on the flip side if I'm succeeding I succeeding is good and so either way they lead to my success and framing it that way took a lot of the judgment and the label and the depression around not achievement away from me and also when things are
(18:44) good it allowed me to not be so high on my Supply because I knew that whenever things were good everything is good is followed by something that is not as good and so you always have regression to the mean right you have regression to the mean and so things are amazing then it means they can only go down from here if things are terrible it means it can only go up 14 is that I would pay any amount of money to make obvious truths real for me there is a reality that no one can see right now true reality and no one can see it because we are shape
(19:10) by the many things that we've been told throughout our lives and many of those things were not true much of the path of Entrepreneurship in my opinion is shedding these false truths so that you can see the world more clearly if you see these business people are super far ahead and all of a sudden it's like they can lose it and then they can get it all back in and things seem so seamless for them it's because they have a more accurate view of reality than you do and so imagine trying to hit a target with a blindfold on you're just gonna keep
(19:33) missing and keep missing and keep missing now imagine there's a guy next to you who's got a blindfold on too but it's clear and he's just nailing it and you're like what the hell I'm doing the same thing with my wrist I'm doing you know I've got I've got all this technique down it's simply because he sees the Target and he sees all the environment around it more clearly than you do and for me the whole concept of ignorance tax and ignorance debt has been one that I have taken with me for life and I actually heard this a speaker
(19:56) said this on stage and he was actually using it as a close for the audience he said how much is not making a million dollars a year costing you he's like well if you make fifty thousand dollars a year right now he said it cost you nine hundred and fifty thousand dollars a year to not not know how to make a million dollars and I thought about that and I was like [ __ ] we were paying a Debt Service to a false reality in order to get the real one and so for me I will pay any amount of money to speed that process up to see the world more clearly
(20:24) in a way that is true and if the views that I have do not serve me and someone else is further ahead of me in the game than they are better at the game of business than me in some way and in that way I can learn of them doesn't matter what they're doing some people are like oh this guy's unethical this guy's you can learn from everyone if they're making more money than you you can learn from them and so taking that and taking my ego head off right taking my ego hat off and saying like I'm the student here this guy's better in some way what does
(20:50) he believe to be true about the world I don't or what do I believe to be true that isn't and simply trying to observe to see those realities is something that I will always pay for if you're a company and you're doing 10 million dollars or more acquisition.com would like to help you get 200 million if that's you go to acquisition.

Transcript:
(00:00) in this video i'm going to talk to you about the 28 ways to stay poor and the reason i'm framing it that way is because charlie munger my personal hero had a seminal talk that he gave multiple times on how to live a miserable life and the reason he gives it that way is that he believes in a process called inversion thinking which is where you solve problems in reverse so for example if you want to have a good marriage rather than asking the question how do i have a good marriage you ask the question how would i destroy my marriage
(00:27) and then you list out all the ways to destroy your marriage and then you do the exact opposite of that and what's interesting is that our brains are much better at finding problems than they are finding solutions and so we do is we harness this innate ability that we have to find the problems and then after finding every possible problem we can imagine every threat imaginable which evolutionary we're designed to look for then flip that in reverse to find our solutions all right and this is a process of thinking that i've applied to
(00:51) business i've applied it to merit i've applied to a lot of different aspects in my life and i would and i would encourage you to do it as well but in this video i'll talk about the 28 ways to stay poor hey and stay tuned to the end of the video because at the very end i'm going to give you the reverse of these the 28 rules of how not to be poor i'll take all of these things and i'll reverse them for you in one hard-hitting blip that you will not want to miss all right if you don't know who i am my name is oxford
(01:12) moses i own acquisition.com it's a portfolio of companies that deserve a 100 million a year i make these videos because i have a lot of fun doing it and i hope you enjoy them as much as i enjoy making them for you all right so the first one this is one of the best ways to stay poor and as a result by the way side note this entire uh little mini thread here got over 5000 uh shares on my twitter uh and so that is why i decided to make this video because it seemed like a lot of you guys like that okay so the first and best way to stay
(01:37) poor is to start tomorrow so whatever it is that you want to do whether it's losing weight saving money starting that business whatever it is to start tomorrow all right so that's the best thing you can do to stay poor is just start tomorrow okay the next one is to read lots of books and then do nothing all right because it's one of the you know lots of people talk about reading books and i see people all the time that i've seen for years in the exact same position posting every oh yeah i'm reading 52 books this year that's my
(02:01) commitment instead of reading 52 books maybe just read one book and actually do something about it crazy i know number three take advice from poor people on how to be rich all right so think about that for a second a lot of us surround ourselves or at least i did when i was starting out surround ourselves with people who are very poor and we listen to their advice on how to be rich and they have no idea what they are doing and we also listen to their judgment on why our idea is stupid even though they are poor so what would they know so
(02:30) number three take advice from poor people on how to be rich number four this is a big one pick a spouse who will make you feel guilty for working all right so you have your dreams you have these things you want to pursue but this person is saying you shouldn't do that you need to be doing x y z blah blah blah and then you feel like you need to compromise your dreams for that person the problem is that you put your power of your destiny in their hands and you're asking for permission instead of support right because the other day if
(02:55) you don't accomplish your dreams and you did it because of them who do you think you're going to resent so you owe to yourself and you go to your marriage to hey pick people who are not who are going to support you in your dreams even if they don't necessarily agree right but more easily not put your power in somebody else right number five fail once quit forever all right so as soon as you do actually start to decide doing something you fail immediately and say oh i guess this isn't for me i guess success isn't for me i guess business
(03:21) isn't for me i guess sales isn't for me i guess whatever the thing is isn't for me because you failed once but it's because we have we have an incorrect view of failure because failure is a necessary part and the thing is you learn from failure and so it's either you win or you learn but that is the fifth thing you want to do if you want to stay poor forever number six is think that the world is fair so a lot of us are get you know especially me earlier on like i would complain i'd be like that's not fair this is fair it shouldn't be this way
(03:46) blah blah blah blah and the thing is is that all that complaining that i did did nothing at all whatsoever did nothing and so the thing is there's no activity that comes from blaming your circumstances which just so happens to be the seventh one of how to stay poor is blame your circumstances and complain all right complaining about things that you cannot control and the thing is is like these sound so obvious but think about these in reverse again so if the if the contrary of thinking the world is fair is assume the world is fair it's
(04:16) unfair excuse me assume the world is unfair and then act accordingly instead of blaming your circumstances you think your circumstances for who you are and what they gave you you are who you are because of the [ __ ] that you have gone through right there's a there's a saying your mess is your message and i think it's a very it's a very beautiful saying because how sad would it be to wish to have a life of ease and comfort because strong character is built through hard times and so if we want to have strong
(04:42) character we basically must have a hard life for periods of time or for seasons and so we can't lament the thing that creates the outcome you can't lament the heat and and that the beating of the hammer to to strengthen the steel right they go one in this they go hand in hand and so we just have to accept them for what they are and and as for complaining i think you can just accept and move on so number nine i covered three there number nine expect the government to save you all right that's a great way to stay
(05:09) poor expect the government to save you or even say expect other people to save you the reality is no one's going to save you except for you and a lot of times many people have spent their entire lives waiting around for someone to save them and still stay poor number 10 value the opinion of others over your own it's an excellent way to stay poor you think everyone else's opinions matter more than yours and i'll give you a secret that it took me you know making a lot of money to then realize which is you are successful the moment you say
(05:37) you are crazy right like you are successful the moment that you decide you are successful there are people who are billionaires who don't feel like they are successful and there are people who have almost no money and absolutely think that they're an amazing success and the thing is is that they are both right it's our choice and i can promise you that if you try and give yourself a number you will just move the goal post i promise you that from the depth of my soul you will move the number and make something else the new goal and once
(06:01) that once i am rich then whatever but it's a when then fallacy it doesn't it's not true so you can accept and you can become successful today because if you look at yourself compared to people in a much worse off scenario they would love to have your life and so you just need to decide for yourself if you are successful the thing is that success is a process rather than an outcome and so you can be successful in that you are living your values of pursuit that can mean success if you choose to define that way so number 11 way to stay poor
(06:30) avoid discomfort all right a lot of us you know we have new things you have to take risks you have to learn things and it's uncomfortable because you will suck right of course you will suck it's normal to suck but people avoid discomfort because they don't want to go through that and it's so silly the discomfort that they're feeling is the judgment they impose upon themselves about not being good at something they've never done before how insane is that very and that's why humans are also kind of insane when you think about the
(06:53) things that we do the things that we think and so great way to stay poor is to avoid discomfort of all kinds you also guarantee the number one discomfort which is that you don't accomplish what you want in your life 12 how to stay poor tolerate mediocrity from yourself and others alright so as you start to grow if you're growing you know a small business or even in the workplace if you tolerate mediocrity from others you will get more mediocrity and people over time will just degrade and get worse and worse over time rather than the reverse
(07:21) of that of thinking like i will only tolerate excellence and anything below that is intolerable if you think about the best leaders and the best ceos the most successful people of all time they have this innate trait right for lack of voter trump they're ball busters right they hold a standard that and here's the catch that they themselves stay above which means you must raise your own standards so that you can model what it looks like for other people around you to hold themselves right the best like most people don't need to be led most
(07:47) people need a model and they can see that right and you're you're leading by example and so best thing to do to stay poor tolerate mediocrity from yourself and others 13. how to stay poor make promises break promises so you make promises to yourself and make promises to other people and you both you destroy your reputation with other people and that's a terrible thing and it takes a long time to fix that but the one that's the hardest one to fix is the reputation you have with yourself you make promises to yourself and you
(08:11) break promises to yourself because the thing is you're the only one who's holding you accountable and i think a different version of happiness in my opinion is respect for oneself and i think your own respect is the hardest to earn because you know how hard you could have pushed you know if you could have gone for an extra mile you could have showed up to the gym more times you could have eaten better you could have made more cold calls you could have done more reach outs you could have made more content you could have actually done a l
(08:36) left a nice note for somebody on your team when you when you were too tired to do so you could have over delivered on the product you could have made a better version of that video and you decided to put it up anyways even though you knew it wasn't as good as it could have been and so you make promises to yourself and then you break promises yourself and you lose respect in the process so it's an excellent way to stay poor number 14 wait for perfect conditions all right this is a great one great way to stay
(08:57) poor is uh it's one of my favorites you gotta wait for everything to be perfectly aligned for you to be successful and here's the secret there are never gonna be perfect conditions and here's what's even crazier if you need perfect conditions to be successful the moment the conditions change you will stop being successful so you might as well start when the conditions are their absolute worst because it means that they will only get better from there and if you can prove success when things get bad when they get bad again
(09:21) which is guaranteed you will still remain successful because you have learned how to do it in this time in this circumstance make sense great reason do not wait for perfect conditions 15. prioritize looking rich over being rich this is a classic one of poor folks in general i get the the loving amount of troll comments that i get from the fact that i'm in my mama's basement and wearing a wife beater and wearing a nose strip right must mean that i am poor of course right because you confuse looking rich with being rich right just silly
(09:50) you can just google my name and just put private equity and uh jim launch an american pacific group and you can see what we sold to our businesses for so the point is you have to prioritize being rich which means spending less for a long period of time because you were not valuing the opinion of other people over your own which because you respect your own approval more than that of other people you have to be willing to die to the opinion of others rather than dying to the opinion of yourself and i mean that
(10:15) it's real [ __ ] stop trying to look rich be willing to look poor all right i know that's contrary to like dress the part and all that stuff but like the thing is is like you've got to be real to you or you'll be real to no one that's a promise number 16 avoid working on what matters most all right this is a great way to stay poor is that you work all day long you're busy you're full of activity you're doing stuff and nothing important moves forward because the nature of speed is not about activity the people who are the richest in the
(10:44) world aren't doing the most stuff they're doing the right stuff right they're making sure better stated making sure the right stuff gets done in general whether or not it's them or someone else and so it's looking at the many things that you can or could do and picking the very few that are the ones that move the needle the most and typically they are the ones that you do not want to do and you are procrastinating on and you can probably eliminate all the stuff that you that give you the mental masturbation of
(11:08) getting stuff done without actually moving the ball forward towards your goals so it's a great way to stay poor it's just keep doing stuff that does not matter 17. say you're going to do something and then don't do it this is just like making and breaking promises to others himself but this one is actually just like that so take that 18.
(11:28) this is a really good one great way to stay poor is do what everyone else is doing right because if you're doing what everyone else is doing most people are not in the one percent if you want to be in the one percent you can't do what 99 of people are doing which is hard for people which is why you can't value their opinions because again talking to poor people about how to get rich is a great way to stay poor right they have no idea and so you can't look for their approval on what you are doing or model what everyone else is doing because everyone else is poor why model them
(11:56) right think about it number 19 do your best not what it takes because the reality is a lot of times your best may suck and what is required is what is required and that may be beyond you which means you must become better so that your best is beyond what is required because the number of people who say well i tried my best universe doesn't give a [ __ ] the marketplace doesn't give a [ __ ] your boss doesn't give a [ __ ] what they care about is what is required and so what you have to do is figure out what is required and then
(12:20) if you are incapable of doing it be better and do it for long enough that would be unreasonable for you not to be good and then your best will surpass what is required and you will become better in the process but if you don't do that it's an excellent way to stay poor is just keep doing your best and giving yourself paddling back and say i tried 20.
(12:39) talk more do less post about your goals post about your affirmations spend all day doing routines and stuff of getting prepared to work and actually do very little all right it's a great way this is one of the favorite ones especially in the internet community people love talking about how much they're working rather than actually getting [ __ ] done so i would advise you to rather than spend all this time preparing to work and creating superstitions and routines around the things that you think you should do in order to maybe potentially get something
(13:05) done start with doing because sometimes the doing just needs done all right 21 start something new today start something new tomorrow repeat great way to stay poor do stuff try something try something else try something else try something else always leave half-built bridges right you never complete anything you start just keep starting new things because it's exciting and it's new and you have what is called uninformed optimism because as soon as you jump into the new thing you realize that it will take work and the
(13:34) things that were awesome about it also have downsides which is the work that is required to be good and as soon as you realize that is work you go through the change cycle you go uninformed optimism to informed pessimism and then you go through the value of despair and this is where everyone then jumps to the next opportunity and they just do this forever and they just never achieve what they want so it's an excellent way to stay busy and poor all right just keep trying new stuff and never see anything through okay number 22 believe what
(14:02) other people think about you more than what you think about you all right it's a great way to stay poor i think it's just it's it's easily stated there so i'm not going to belabor the point but that's what you need to do to stay poor just keep believing what everyone else thinks about you and not what you think about you excellent way to do it number 23 way to stay poor make a mistake then wait repeat the mistake do it again and again and again and you've probably seen people who stay stuck in their life like
(14:26) this like they keep dating the same person they keep making the same business mistake they keep getting the same bad partnerships whatever right or they keep trying to do something that stopped working and they keep doing it over and over again because they think that for some reason that's going to work somehow or they just don't have the wherewithal to realize they keep making the same mistake and so if you keep doing the same stuff you're going to keep getting the same outcomes right like we kind of know this but the thing
(14:47) is is that people still do it it's like well whatever you're doing right now has gotten you to being poor so don't do that right and when i say poor poor can be whatever you want to be you could be a billionaire and be poor it might be whatever whatever that amount is it's not as much as you want it to be right which of course gets into the deep things of like maybe you should decide not to want it to begin with and then whatever we won't get into that number 24 be replaceable all right this is a great way to stay poor because if and i
(15:13) heard this from navarro i kind of like it a lot which is if you can if you can get a degree to do the job you're never going to be unwealthy doing it because everyone can do it right and so you have to be able to learn things that other people can't do right and that therein makes you irreplaceable or less replaceable right at the very least less replaceable you want to be replaceable by a marketplace of people lined up behind you ready to take your job and do it for less all right because they're also poor and they are willing to do it
(15:37) for life which is a terrible way to do business it's also an excellent way to stay poor though do what everyone else is doing do it for less unless you have an operational strategy which is you know like walmart and whatever and that's probably not you right now so number 25 way to stay poor find something that works dear god find something that works and then stop doing it think about it how many of you have needed to make money last minute you had to pay payroll you had to pay taxes you had to some bill unexpected you know surgery iphone
(16:04) whatever right some bill comes up and you need to pay for it and you find a way to make the money because if you're watching this video you're still alive right so you found a way to you found a way to pay for it what did you do there when you needed to make money you heard something messed up you were willing to make money and you had the ability to make money when it was for someone else and not for yourself think about that you had the ability you knew what to do and you just chose not to do it you stopped doing it as soon as you paid
(16:31) someone else's bills because you were willing to pay other people's bills tonight your own interesting which leads me to one of the most retweets i had recently which is most people know what to do to achieve their goals most people do know what to do people like i don't know how to lose weight i'm like yeah you do stop eating [ __ ] and move you know how to you know how to do that you want to make money start making calls start reaching out to people start promoting the thing that you are trying to sell not i mean not complicated i got this
(16:54) thing do you want to try it no cool talk to somebody else got this thing you want to try it no cool call somebody else right it's not it's not complex it's not complicated but people just don't do it it's because they're not willing to do it right and so excellent thing to do find something that works so a lot of you do know something that works and then stop doing it number 26 we're rounding off we got two more hire dumb people excellent way to stay poor and have a bad business all right really really highly recommend it it's
(17:20) also really good for if you have a job too if you have the ability to hire people hire dumb people it's just it's just a great way to make your life miserable there's very few ways that are better than this one like if you just want to be surrounded by dumb people just hire people i mean just hire people don't want you you know i mean and um you'll you'll feel good but you'll be poor and so don't do that number 27 this is a huge one that i see all the time for staying poor and it's a really good strategy it might be one of
(17:44) the top ones on this list assume you are always right how many people here right you're watching this know someone who always just think they're right and they're not successful they get advice from somebody who might be successful more successful than them and they're like no that's not going to work for x y and z because they assume they're always right they assume they know everything well if you know everything then why aren't you achieving what you want hmm and i will tell you this from the people that i've met who have been far ahead of
(18:09) me they have a voracious desire to learn and a voracious interest in learning from anyone and every single possible source they can and those people have the humility to say that everyone knows something that they don't know and so in that way they can learn of them which is i think an emerson quote if you cannot learn then what's the point so you you give yourself zero advantages like there's no way that you can learn from other people if you think you're always right and i know this sounds [ __ ] obvious but a
(18:35) lot of you guys do this why like you'd rather be right than be rich and it's silly but it's an excellent way to stay poor so that's why it's number 27. and then the last one and this is the simplest of the economics around it i'm just gonna drive this baby home is make money period spend more than you make and the beautiful part about this is that it doesn't matter how much you make if you spend more than it you can be poor which is why this is such a great one it's a great way to stay porous doesn't matter how much you
(19:00) increase your income just spend more than you made right go into debt and adjust your lifestyle to your new income at all times or rather above your income so that you can always stay poor no matter how much money you make it's just an awesome way to stay poor and so i highly recommend doing that all right um just and honestly the more you can do it the the more you can outspend your income the poorer you will be and so again highly recommend it and it sounds silly but you know a few people like right now i think it's like the bottom
(19:28) 50 of america like doesn't have any savings and what's crazy is that like you can you can control like these these things are controllable like you can always downgrade your lifestyle but the thing is you care more about the opinions of others than you do about your own right you care more about looking rich than being rich right all these things and that's why all of these things go together and so to wrap this up the reason that inversion thinking is so powerful is that we can use our brains to find threats more easily than
(19:51) we can find solutions and so if we think about your business career or you think about your marriage or you think about your body or you think about whatever it is your money goals think about the ways to destroy it i just gave you 28 different ways that you can be poor when you reverse them and you make those the rules for living that you have then what happens is you succeed by accident because you avoid the pitfalls because the thing is if you don't make many mistakes you succeed without trying because all you're doing is just
(20:17) focusing on just not making these stupid mistakes that most people do right if we if we were to reverse these and this is what i'm going to hit this with hard enjoy we're hitting it right now start today read books do the stuff that's in the books take advice from rich people on how to be rich pick a spouse who makes you feel awesome about working fail once try again think the world is unfair and act accordingly never blame your circumstances thank your circumstances for making you who you are instead of complaining do something
(20:46) expect no one to save you except for yourself value your opinion over those of other people seek out discomfort tolerate nothing but excellence make promises keep promises wait for the worst conditions wait for imperfect conditions and act anyways on what you want right avoid working on the stuff that doesn't matter work on the things that matter most ignore the rest say you're going to do something and then do it do what no one else is doing do your best and make it above what it takes to be successful talk less do more
(21:22) start something new today and keep at it until you are good do it so long that it would be unreasonable for you to be bad don't believe what other people think about you more than what you think about yourself be irreplaceable find something that works and don't stop doing it keep doing it until you're bored out of your mind because you're so good at doing that thing that worked hire smart people assume that you were always wrong and be willing to learn and make money and spend less than you make and that is the
(21:52) 28 rules of poverty flipped on its head and you can make your own conclusions about where that'll take you i love you mostly nation keep being awesome i'll see you guys next video bye

(00:00) people are making podcasts and thinking in 90 days they're somehow going to blow up in the beginning 150 episodes is just me talking about how to run a gym better I got a DM the other day somebody who was like yeah it's easy for you to build this brand because you already have this big audience I was like dude just start he was discouraged by the fact that he had no following he had no audience Etc 99% of people who are watching this do more cool and then you'll have cool to talk about rather than regur shating other people's stuff but for
(00:27) everyone who sees the overnight success right what I want you to do is go to my podcast and look at the timestamp on my first episode it's 2017 5 and 1 half 6 years ago it just now hit the top 10 and in that six-year period I did not miss every week 1 to three podcasts for six years and so people are making podcasts and thinking in 90 days they're somehow going to blow up when the reality is that you're finding your voice for the first year you're figuring out what way you communicate you're learning how to
(00:58) teach how to entertain how to present you're Lear Lear how to speak and you're also learning about the stuff that you're learning meantime right like in that period of time I might not have had as much stuff that was as cool in the beginning that applied to as many people cuz the first 150 episodes is just me talking about how to run a gym better right around 150 I started talking about Marketing in general because that's what I was into at the time and then I start talking about sales and I start talking about business in general and m&a and
(01:20) things as they've evolved over time and so the subject matter as well as my skill in delivering it both improved over that period of time and now the podcast is top 10 on entrepreneurship and very high ranked in business next to names that I I looked up to my whole career I'm like holy cow I'm like we're wait we just went above this guy that I've been looking up to my whole life it doesn't take 90 days it takes years if you think in days the time's going to pass no matter what but if you can think in decades when you make your goals when
(01:48) that decade does pass it'll show that you were thinking that way right not the outcome of the goal make the action the goal if the action is did I make the post did I make the reach outs every day then you're a success you check both boxes I want to tell you a quick story so there was a guy who started at the first gym with me same day all right and we've been friends since then and I started my gym and then he started his gym and he started chain of gym so we went in parallel all right and he ended up selling those gyms and he wanted to
(02:15) go online he was like dude I need to build like a brand and I was like dude you just need to start posting you know short form stuff making stuff that's valuable he posted every day for 6 months and then one video took off and then the next video took off and the next video took off and then all all of a sudden now he's making $100,000 a month from the content that he was making he'd already been doing business for 9 years and then all of a sudden it took off and he and he messaged me he was like I'm super grateful that that
(02:45) you told me to do that and so he did the post and he did the reach outs and what ended up happening is that earlier on he would he would have videos that would start taking off he would start doing reach outs you start making sales and then you'd make some money and then you would slow down and then all of a sudden you get in scarcity mode once he was like oh shoot there's no money coming in there's no money coming in and then you start making content start doing rots again and you make money again and he was like dude how do I break the cycle
(03:07) and what we did was we shifted what he was focusing on because he was focusing on the sales he was making he was focusing on the money he was making rather than focusing on the process you are not successful in my eyes because whenever you see some outcome you stop the activities which means you don't have the trait of consistency I was like the reason you aren't where you want to be is because you can't do things repeatedly and so most people can't do one thing over and over again you need to be able to do the doing without
(03:31) seeing the result of your doing and you have to keep doing it and if you can keep doing things independent and this is both ways if it goes really well you keep doing the thing that got you there and if it's not going well comma yet you keep doing the thing so that you get good enough that one day it will and that's the shift that most people don't make and I think that's why most people just stick war and the reality is that if you can commit to the actions and the behaviors and the traits that you will grow through doing then at the end of
(03:58) this process a decade later you will be the type of person who can do something for a long period of time and wait and I promise you that if you have that trait money will never be a constraint in your life and this is from Atomic habits every winner and every loser have the same goals so when you measure Yourself by having this external thing and people are like set goals everyone wants to be rich everyone wants to have a six-pack your goals don't make you unique it's the activities that you do that make you
(04:24) unique the goal of the winner is to commit to the activities the goal of the loser is to commit to the goal 52% of 18-year-olds High School seniors think they're going to be millionaires by 25 the world is going to be shook many of you will fail and that's because most of you have the same goal 50% of you think you're going to be a Millionaire right that's just math but only a small percentage will because if you want to be a millionaire you're not going to focus on making the million dollars you're going to focus on the stuff that
(04:46) makes a million dollars and so when you can divorce the activities from the outcome then you can focus on the doing which whether your income does this over that period of time your self-esteem Remains the Same because you're committ to what you can control if you can make that shift it will change your life so I started making podcast 6 years ago I committed to that process when I signed on with a a YouTube vendor a few years ago on the first call I said I'd like to have this channel be something in 5 to 10 years I was like We'll look at it
(05:20) then and see if it was worth continuing to do I was like but I'm in for a decade and he stopped me afterwards he was like I've literally never had a client say that to me ever he's like they're all like how can I get leads in the first 90 days from YouTube and like blah blah blah I was like if we're making progress I'm good I will commit to that I think that if you can think that way you will get what you want and then people will ask you a decade from now man how did you have this overnight success and blah blah blah blah blah and
(05:46) aren't you like don't the followers and the fans like how does it not get to your head and you're like cuz it was never the goal and so I feel just as good at year one as I do at year eight because the activities that I committed to were remain the same if you can think that way and you can shift your perspective persective it will it'll decrease your emotional ups and downs and I think we all need ways to decrease our emotional ups and downs in the game of business because like we need to have second lives and third lives and fourth
(06:09) lives and the way to do that is to not put your life your game playing life in something that you can't control but putting all your game playing life in the things you can right now we just crossed our 400th episode 400 episodes like if I did one a week that's 52 four eight one a week for a year that would be eight years of doing that if I had 400 episodes I'm at like year six if you make 400 long form pieces of content I guarantee you that your following would be bigger than it is today well how long is that going to take as long as it
(06:42) takes because the goal was never the outcome the goal was to do it thing

Transcript:
(00:00) here's my advice to make 2025 the best year of your life there's four steps eliminate distractions get started get better never stop number one elimination of the things that are distracting you when I was young my father gave me this advice rich people buy time poor people buy stuff ambitious people buy skills lazy people by Distraction I can give you the first and easiest 2025 prediction look at what you spend money on look at your calendar and wherever you invest is what you will get more of so many people are surprised when they
(00:33) look at their bank account next year and it's lower than they want it to be they look at their accomplishments from that year and it's not the things they set out to do but when you look at their calendar and their credit card expenses it's very obvious why those things didn't happen because we vote with our dollars about the things that we care about we vote about the type of person that we want to become and as the first thing that you can do today for next year is actually comment below this video and I rarely ask for this the thing that you're actually going to do today not what you're going to begin
(01:02) doing next year or what your resolution is going to be but if it's important enough to do for future you it's certainly important enough to do for current you because current you by the way is the only you that's ever going to enjoy life I'll give you this story so I remember when I was a few years back I was walking with ilila and we went to Sephora which is like a makeup store so we walked inside you know I'm sitting you know standing there awkwardly cuz I'm like I don't know what I'm supposed to do here there's this lady with the smok who like helps out and she had these two girls who were young they must
(01:29) have been Maybe well about this this old I'm guessing between 9 and 40 who knows she's leaning over and she has these two paintbrushes in her hands and she says okay girls now that you guys are women you need to start budgeting for this stuff because you're going to be spending money on this every single month to do your makeup and so the girls grabbed them they were super excited and they went to go check out and I saw that exchange as actually a really beautiful lesson when it comes to Identity our
(01:55) priorities we dictate by what we spend not by what we say these girls because they wanted to step into this new identity had to match it with new priorities so they had money or they had saved up their shekels or whatever they do for chores or babysitting or whatever by doing that they had to start prioritizing some of that money towards their new identity from girls to women but the thing is is that many people who want to start next year think okay well I'm just going to see if this happens but it doesn't work that way you have to
(02:23) basically make the decision that this is the type of person that I want to become and then these are the actions that that type of person would take and then we align our calendars and our budgets in accordance with that so that the Investments we make yield the results that we want but the thing is is that people want to say hey wouldn't it be great if I owned Apple but they never buy the stock if you want to be that version of you you need to start buying stock in that today both by paying in time and paying in money to vote with your dollars about what you truly care about and the reason that I'm hitting this so hard is that it's never been
(02:55) easier than it is today to be successful it's also never been easier to be distracted Ed so along the theme of investing in the things that matter most the first thing we do is we eliminate all the stuff that sucks I Define commitment is the elimination of Alternatives if you get married you eliminate all people of whatever sex you're married to that are not that person actually you eliminate everyone who's not that person independent of sex right that is a commitment right if you enter into a uh partnership and you say I'm not going to do any business besides this business as part of the terms then
(03:26) you've eliminated all Alternatives and so if you want someone to commit ask them to elate everything else that's not the main thing these are all the things a laundry list of things that are probably not your main thing that very likely are getting in the way and these are the most common things that I see in my DMs that I see in my comments from people who are not getting where they want to go as fast as it'd like to get there first big category is bad friends so if you want better friends get used to seeing them less better friends are
(03:54) busy friends so I remember when I started working more and some of the friends that I had were a little bit more ambitious I started realizing that the people that I liked the most I actually didn't spend as much time with and the people that were always available were the ones that I didn't want to become more like here's five questions you should consider when thinking about whether to keep a friend in your life or cut them question number one is if someone told you that you're a lot like your friend would you take that as a compliment second are you truly
(04:26) fulfilled by the friendship or is it just someone to keep you from being lonely third are you able to be unapologetically yourself or do you feel the need to act differently to please that friend or to be around that friend fourth do you like who this friend is right now today or do you like the idea of the friend and who they could be someday and then finally five would you want your future or imagined child to be friends with someone like this person and I think it's a really wonderful litmus test because it forces you to
(05:00) take a look outside of yourself in order to have perspective from a third-party angle on the true quality of that person but the reality is that rare people are by definition rare it's normal to have fewer of them and so if you only have a few friends or one good friend then that's normal if you want rare and exceptional friends if you have many friends it's far more likely that the bar for your friendship is too low and to give you a filter that I actually used for the most important friend in my life Leila I like to think does this person have the same scale of goals that
(05:36) I have so does it mean that they have to have the same goals as you but it has to be the same level of goals as you because at least you're going in the same direction so that's number one number two is do they have the same level of dedication and commitment to those goals because I don't know about you but I had plenty of friends who were like I want to be an NFL player I want to be a a really rich Tech entrepreneur I want to be a a touring musician right and they had these goals but I'm like dudee I see you just playing fortnite
(06:03) four hours a day and you you practice guitar once a week like what do you really want that or do you just like saying it because it makes you feel good and so I wanted people who walked the walk and I wanted people who would keep up with my pace and if you are someone who's ambitious and this is me just talking specifically to you because there's only a few people who are watching this who really are and you'll know that if it's you you have to get used to being alone because there are seasons where you'll basically transition from one group of friends into to another and it's not even a group of you'll usually transition from
(06:32) a group of friends into no friends and then you'll find one or two people who are at a new level and then sometimes those people introduce you to some of their friends and if you keep walking and you keep outpacing then that group will then start retiring past you and then maybe one person stays with you maybe no one does and you'll have another lonely period I'm saying this because I used to think that there was something wrong with me when in reality I just didn't understand what the nature of being exceptional meant and so I'm saying this purely from a definitional
(07:03) perspective to be exceptional means that you are the exception it means that you are not normal and so it's normal for normal people to find you abnormal if you do things that are not normal don't let people who have mediocre goals deter you from taking actions that make you great because it makes you different realizing that I thought most people actually made no sense they say they had these goals but they took no action and they called me work obsessed and they would tell me I should take time off and
(07:33) they're like hey you're not you're not you're not as cool anymore you're not you're not hanging out with the boys like why aren't you participating in the fantasy league why aren't you watching football on Sunday with us and for me I actually used to love watching football uh with my friends it was actually one of my biggest things that I look forward to but the thing is is that like I needed that Sunday because I had to prep workouts I had to prep the music list for the next day I had to run billing I had to do all this other work and the
(07:54) thing is is that like I looked at that football game and I was like my goals are more important to me than this and so I think that a lot of people don't actually look at themselves in the mirror and say like one year from today will I will I remember this football game or I remember the fact that I'm not where I said I wanted to be and to me that was significantly more painful now this is an uncomfortable fact for a lot of people your ability to delay gratification is actually a function of intelligence and so your ability to learn at a longer and longer delay is
(08:26) something that comes I mean we're talking from primates all the way up and so basically if you want to teach a monkey how to do something you have to say hey do this thing and immediately give them a reward and the longer that period goes on the less trainable they are the sign of intelligence is that you can actually expand the reinforcement window and they can still abstract it back to the original action if you want to practice intelligence then being able to actively delay your need for a result or reward from the work you do will make
(08:59) you a more intelligent person because your rate of learning will actually increase despite the fact that your reward rate will decrease in the short term and so to give you full transparency on what 2025 might look like if you accomplish your goals at the end you might have a different friend group or no friends at all for a season because you don't become like the people you admire you become like the people you want to impress Harvard made this you know Wonderful study years ago about the best predictor of someone's long-term material success was what they
(09:33) called their reference group now this has been misquoted in places by The Five People You spend the most time with but it's actually The Five People You compare yourself to and that's a very big difference now I want to take it a step further because I think to myself what are the things that affect our behavior and so it's really about the people that you want to impress not necessarily even who you compare yourself to because it's the people whose voices you hear when you're about to make a big life decision and so when you make a big life decision you don't
(10:04) listen to the people closest to you you should listen to the people closest to your goals and some of them may not be in your neighborhood or your city or your state or your high school or your college they might just be people you follow on the internet and you have to abstract what would that person think about this decision not my mom not my homie not my uncle or that person at church and so I think this is a great transition of thinking through instead of necessarily even having mentors having Heroes and transposing what you
(10:34) think their decision-making calculus would be onto your life and so it's interesting is that I will have conversations with entrepreneurs and they'll say hey here's my current condition this is my desired State this is what I perceive my obstacle to be and I say okay well what do you think and they're like well I think you're going to say I should do X Y and Z and I'm like you're right why aren't you they're like well and the thing is is that basically what they answer with after that well is in essence other people's
(11:02) opinion who aren't at the place they want to be here's the the uncomfortable truth which is that Winners focus on winning losers focus on winners and you never receive hate from above always below because winners have their eyes on the goal not on other people and so you have to decide whether you want to be a loser or a winner and I'm just being real with you what this looks like in reality and maybe for you in 2025 will be like this first you look like an idiot to everyone else while you try to figure it out then everyone else looks
(11:33) like an idiot for ever doubting you seasons and so everyone takes a different amount of years to stop giving a [ __ ] about what everyone else thinks and if you're going to get there eventually you might as well start today and enjoy the benefits longer so if I'm 855 years old I think about what that man cares about and that man cares about very very little all you have to do is talk to an elderly person or a grandparent and be like what do you think about this a lot of like ah who cares like it doesn't matter life is
(12:02) literally Too Short they literally don't have time for it and so I think to myself if that's the ultimate version of me if I'm going to get there eventually and that's what the wisest people think after having the most life experience then why would I not try to cheat code that into today and then not have to go looking back from 85 and think man I wish I knew then what I know now look forward to 85-year-old self and say I am going to choose to learn the lesson I know I'm going to learn and act as if I knew it today because the difference between them and you is that what they
(12:36) consider work you consider life and so you have to accept that you have a fundamental different understanding of how life works and I believe that is a more accurate view of reality the reason that the rich can get richer is because they see the world differently than the poor and so it makes sense that if your poor friends don't see what you see that they see through the lens of poverty and all my goal in life is to be able to see reality more accurately and so in the beginning you have to develop this armor this thick skin around people saying
(13:08) those little snide comments of like you work too hard you're too obsessed you have a toxic work capacity and why are you working weekends why are you working late nights you're you're not like this is not worth it they're not paying you enough for the work that you do all of these different things because eventually that armor on the outside actually just becomes one with you and you don't even hear hear it anymore because I can promise you that those people who were in my life decades ago they're just not even I don't hear those those claims anymore for two reasons one
(13:40) because my reality changed so drastically that they couldn't say anything and secondarily they're just not in my world anymore I was only able to get here because what they deemed acceptable I deemed intolerable how far you go in life I truly believe this is based and predicated only on one thing which is your actual standard and so I believe that the person who runs any company or runs any division should be the person who has the highest standards and if there's ever a day that someone has a higher standard for acquisition. comom than me they should run this instead of me because they would be the
(14:16) one who's best serving the company and so the person who should have the highest standard for you is you and so it makes sense that they have a lower bar but why would I listen to their bar on my life I think that that standard is the one thing that rich kids get from Rich parents more than anything else it's because they have an expectation of Life they don't accept opportunities that are below that standard and so they actually get their huge leg up on the pick on the vehicles that they choose to pursue and so one of the tougher Parts if you're not from an area where people
(14:52) make a lot of money or not from you don't know anybody who's a you know super successful entrepreneur is that you basically have to borrow someone else's measuring St and you have to say is this the standard that Elon would pursue is this the standard basos would pursue is this the standard jobs would pursue if it isn't then why are you doing it if you want to be like them then act like them if you want to be like your friends then you can act like your friends but don't be surprised that you have what they have or lack what they lack if we're thinking
(15:21) about elimination we're eliminating bad friends and tangentially their opinions about you that are affecting your behavior so the next thing or what things are playing interference on your time and your attention all right so I would say opinions of other people are affecting your behavior and your decisions I think that your environment affects your efficiency of behavior so think about how much more you get per hour of output if you can't sit still ignore notifications and focus on one task for eight hours straight never expect to build anything great and as
(15:52) uncomfortable as that is it's also the truth like I I don't know a single incredibly successful entrepreneur that can't sit down and have hyperfocused periods of time sometimes weekends weeks at a time where they don't talk to anyone and they just hammer away and it's whether they're coding for software or they're making some insane marketing campaign and all the email follow-ups and all the text follow-ups and and the affiliate uh you know promotions and incentives or someone who's creating a product that they're designing and they're in the shop and they keep tweaking at it or there's somebody who's who's hyperscaling a company and saying
(16:24) I'm going to sit in 20 interviews a day for for 7 days straight so I can hire 20 people this this week because I need to get going right like if you can't sit still and ignore notifications and focus for a day nothing great will get accomplished because it's not about what you want it's about what's required and it's and whether that's your best or not is irrelevant it's just there's a price tag and you got to be willing to pay for it or you don't get the thing and a lot of times it's not what you want and I I I I spend a lot of time trying to dispel
(16:55) the concept of like Follow Your Passion because I think it leads more people astray then it helps because it's very easy for someone who's successful who's already delegated tons of things to only then focus on their area of genius and then say here for my seat do what I do but there's a very big difference between doing what someone does and doing what they did to get there and I think this is what's lost in a lot of the content that I see in the entrepreneurial space and to be clear whenever I'm trying to get to the next level I often have to take on things that I don't know how to do and I have to learn how to do them
(17:26) which means I have to suck for a period of time and sucking sucks but the thing is is you have to be able to embrace that period of time and say like this is the cost of greatness and so I'll give you something very tactical so I have timers in a lot of my offices and my team has adopted this too which is I like to time block which is essentially saying how long do I think this is going to take and you can do this on a week scale you can do it on a daily level it depends on the level of project you're tackling but for me even on the most
(17:51) micro level I say okay how long should this take I'll then crank this thing Boop I think this should take 20 minutes and then I hit start and I let the timer go and if for whatever reason something distracts me I pause it so that I know that I didn't actually work that period of time and so what happens is it will give you a very real look at how long you're actually working versus how long you think you're working and you tell other people working and you Instagram how long you're working and as I've become more efficient at work meaning my output per unit of time has gone up I've
(18:23) realized that there's just been a significant decrease in the distractions that I allow to interrupt me again if you want to stay focused staying focused is not like zeroing in and saying I'm going to do it just like I'm going to I'm going to I'm going to just zoom in on this thing it's more that Focus occurs when you remove everything else what's left is focus and so Jerry Seinfeld has this uh this famous process that he talks about with writing and I think writers are also wonderful people for talking to for deep work because it's the nature of the work they do one of the things that he did and he has done for years for his standup so he can
(18:58) script it out is that he locks himself in a room that has no windows and has nothing but a yellow notepad and a pen and he tells himself that he has to go in that room and he doesn't have to write but he can't do anything else and so what ends up happening is that writing occurs as a default and so Focus kind of works the same way you eliminate everything else by to create Focus you don't try and push harder while also having these disruptions so there's three easy ways that I make my phone less distracting the first first is I switch it to
(19:30) grayscale and so grayscale decreases consumption across all people by 30% is and that's research back it's pretty cool the second thing is turning off all notifications across all apps on your phone because you never want your app to be dictating when it's convenient for the app to disrupt you like how ridiculous is that but we let apps have that permission most phones and people want to push notifications to you I want to pull them when it's convenient for me the third thing is other people and so I
(20:02) have a mode on my phone where no one can get through and when I do that then I can reach out to them when it's convenient for me because if it's actually an emergency call 911 and if it's not a true emergency then it can wait and my team wanted to remind me that I don't email I heard in uh I think it was like 2016 that Bill Clinton didn't use email and I was like if he's the president he doesn't use email I cannot use email and so uh my team doesn't contact via email and so if you can eliminate entire channels that's also an easier way to concentrate uh
(20:36) fewer flows of communication and here's the thing it's always harder takes longer and costs more than you think it will that is a reflection of poor expectations not that the reality is bad and so it makes sense that it would be harder take longer and cost more because if it didn't then everyone would have it and everyone had it then it wouldn't be worthwhile and so literally the difficulty of the task that you embark on is proportional to the reward that you ultimately get because you are the asset that you build more than the achievement and so if it's
(21:10) hard that's amazing because it will make you that much harder once you conquer it and it will also make it harder for anybody else who wants to follow in your footsteps and so the higher up the mountain you climb the thinner the air gets and the rarer the climber or Explorer must be in order to get there and so I don't know about you but I would so much rather climb a mountain that so few people have been able to climb so that I can see a view that other people haven't seen and So speaking of expectations let me talk
(21:36) about the worst expectation of all which is entitlement which is the expectation of life or other people to give you something without earning it and I think that this is is a is a virus in today's culture right now and so there's the famous quote Hard Times create strong men strong men create good times good times create weak men and weak men create hard times it makes sense that right now we have a lot of weak men because it's been pretty good times the good news about that is that it's so easy to beat them you just have to show up be on time prepare the night before
(22:12) remember people's names actually follow up when you say you were going to and try like you mean it rather than trying like you want to get credit for trying and I see this is this this thing that's that that's pervasive right now is that people will comment or they'll DM me and they're like hey I'm trying really hard as though I'm supposed to give them credit for trying the world doesn't work that way it gives you credit for achieving and the reason that you want credit for trying is because you want it to Cost Less take shorter time period
(22:45) and be easier and so if you restate your complaint about the difficulty as oh I have false expectations about the ease or the price tag of this goal then all of a sudden you realize that the only real problem was that you expected it to cost less it's like going to the store and being like oh I've got these Jordans that I really want to buy I got $50 I'm so excited to buy them you go to the store and and see that they're $300 at that point you can just say Jordans aren't for me or you can say oh I will have to keep working and keep saving so
(23:16) that I can afford this and so it's a lot about affording the goals that you want to achieve and a lot of things that we have to spend in order to get them is the time and the rejection of not achieving what we want on the time line we originally thought like what makes success hard is that the expectation that Society puts because we only see the Highlight re you actually only see people after they finish the race people think success is like watching a marathon not running a marathon when you watch a marathon you look at the beginning and you look at the end it
(23:47) only takes you a couple of seconds to see both of those but running a marathon is four or five six straight hours of breathing heavy wondering when it's going to end counting starting to play games in your mind of like okay I'm I'm 2/3 of the way there I'm two two more quarters of that I'm only 1/ fth of the of 1/8 of the way there and you keep doing this to play tricks on your mind to keep going but the thing is is that in a mile marker race it's very clear to know how you're going to get to the finish line and how long it's going to take the only difference with success is that you just have to keep running and
(24:19) you don't know where the finish line is and people will only cheer you on at that finish line that they don't know where it is either which means you have to get used to running alone and so the difficulty is you have to start running and you have to keep running but you just don't know whether you're running for a mile or 300 and so this is where the pacing is important so a lot of people will run really hard they'll they'll think because they only saw the beginning of the marathon on TV and the finish of the marathon on TV that they can just Sprint because both of those
(24:49) clips only lasted a couple of seconds so they start their marathon of success of whatever it is they're going after by sprinting as hard as they can and then they realize that there's no one around and there's just a bunch of open road ahead of them and they're like how long is this going to take and that's when reality sets in and so I make these videos to say that a lot of times it's going to take longer so one of the big nasty things that you have to eliminate on this path is the identity that you
(25:19) have about yourself the isms that you claim and so for example like Oh I'm a I'm a neat freak I'm a I'm not good at math I'm not techie and so you make these statements and they don't serve you fundamentally you should have one razor that rules all decisions and I this is this is pretty cruel but it's also the reality of the world which is does this thing person belief make it more or less likely that I hit my goals and so if you run every single thing you do the actions you take the people you hang out with you having your phone in
(25:55) the room you saying I'm not techie does this increase or decrease the likelihood that you hit your goals and I'm not saying this to preach cuz I had one that I dealt with for a long time so I always considered myself to be bad at math I remember I was decent at math and then in nth grade I had a really bad teacher and it basically put me back a year basically after algebra I didn't really learn anything because the year after that I didn't have the the foundations from the year before the difficulty was I kept saying after that point I'm just
(26:24) not good at math but when I was in my 20s I made the decision that that didn't serve me anymore and so I was like okay well what would I have to do to feel like I was good at math and I was like well people would like can do math in their head I think that's a pretty cool thing and so I didn't use a calculator for anything for years and then I learned I mean I made a lot of mistakes in the beginning but then I got better and better at doing math in my head and I would check it obviously after I was done but I always let my head try and do it first and so nowadays if you were to
(26:57) ask people man is Alex good at math they're like dude he just rattles off numbers like crazy but the thing is is that until I was in my 20s I thought I was bad at math and so it's like we are so much more pliable than we think we are and we had something that set us on a trajectory a little bit earlier in life that just gave us maybe a little bit of disadvantage fine because you just have to get over it everyone's childhood was difficult and if you want to win the award for hardest childhood congrats you win you feel better right no one cares about what happened to you then only what you can make happen now
(27:30) identity is a lie we only describe people about who they are by what they do doing is being and so if you want to be somehow different you have to do different things and then only afterwards will people describe you based on the actions you take think about back in the day the actual names people had was he's John the carpenter he's John the stonesmith he's John the Mason right people literally had their names based on what they did that hasn't changed the first thing you do when you meet somebody is you find out what do
(28:04) what do you do and that gives you indications and if you want to describe who someone is what do you say you describe what they do and so this means that our identity is 100% under our control because we control what we do and then only after the fact will other people describe you in that way so we covered environmental things like with the phone and having a timer we covered interpersonal things in terms of our identity and voting with the our dollars and time about the things that we care about we eliminated the bad people and their opinions about us that affect our
(28:33) behavior and so we've eliminated all these things so now we've made room to get started and the good news is you only need three things to win the balls to start the brains to learn and the heart to never give up and the best thing is you already have all three and for the girls you have goads so it's fine it still counts and so my ask of you is to make the commitment now this is again the elimination of alternatives to make the commitment to never stop and so it doesn't mean that I'm asking you to commit to be successful I'm asking you to commit to keep running to keep
(29:07) walking the marathon even if you have to pant and you have to slow down you just can't stop and so the best way to hit next year's goals is to not wait until next year to work on them it's to start now because I'll tell you this if you feel like you need a special occasion to begin making your life better then it assumes that a special occasion must always be there for you to want to improve yourself it shows that you don't think today is worth improving and so that means that you typically will always cast forward when you think
(29:40) things are worth improving and so the easiest way to vote with your action is to make today the only day that is good because it's the only day you have control over my hot take which shouldn't be is you don't have to wait until January 1st to better yourself and I'm purposely posting this before the year ends because I think it's stupid to wait like why would you wait on getting better why would you like if you had a lottery ticket why would you wait to cash it in you would cash it in as fast as humanly possible and that lottery ticket is the life that you want on the
(30:10) other side of this why would you wait here's a harsh truth you're young you've got time false all that lie does is extend how long it takes people to realize tomorrow isn't guaranteed nothing is going to be easy get over it it takes time to get good and the sooner you start the sooner you act and the sooner you act the sooner you get and don't stop until you do and as harsh as that sounds I do have good news it only takes 20 hours of focused effort to get decent at anything the problem is people wait years before they start their first hour so many of you could probably start achieving next year goals before the end
(30:53) of this year 20 hours is not that long if you're like man I really want to learn ads I really want to learn how to make content I really want to learn how to edit videos I really want to learn how to sell you can do that now and you can have that skill like we can onboard a new sales guy in in a few days there's this massive delay that people think because of the unknown they don't know what is going to happen and so they therefore assume that it's bad and so the reality is that most people don't like surprises even if they're good ones have you ever heard people like oh I don't like surprise parties it's a
(31:24) [ __ ] party why would you hate a surprise party that's in your favor you hate it because you don't like the unknown and so it's a really good thing to test for yourself which is why would I hate a good surprise you hate it because there's a possibility that the surprise is negative but on a long time Horizon you know 85 year-old you isn't even going to remember it to begin with this is a this is going to be a weird one for you but just stay with me if you've ever been so drunk that you're throwing up and you
(31:55) think to yourself man I'm probably not going to remember this the good news is is that once you do succeed that terrible period of vomiting or whatever the difficulty is that you're going through it'll actually compress in your mind and so as difficult as it may seem in the moment it actually doesn't stay with you all you'll have left is the thing you accomplished you won't remember the work that it took to get there there'll be a significant discount on the punishment you endured I tend to have a bad habit of really not looking
(32:24) back very much and so I occasionally will go through my photos and I am reminded about all of the mistakes and the detours that I took along the way to where I wanted to go and I'll tell you the story that my father told me when I was uh very impatient he said listen you think that this is taking too long for you to be successful he said do you know how long it took me to become a doctor and I was like no he's like well so my father's a run in and he left the country to get educated and there was a program for anybody who's running that the government would pay for your
(33:01) schooling as long as you came back with the education now the revolution occurred during the time he was away so he actually never got to go back he went to uh France Paris to try and enter medical school only problem he didn't speak French and so he's trying to do Premed in another language as somebody who doesn't even share the same alphabet and so he failed that year he then took a the second year he tried again because you're allowed in in in France it's a different system you can just basically try as many times you want he started
(33:31) again and the second year he failed again and then he talked to his brother and he's like I don't know if being a doctor is for me like I just fa like imagine this like failing two full years in a row and his brother said hey why don't you to go to Belgium you know change the environment you know different different School different people go there so he went to Belgium and then in his third try he made it past his first year now mind you at this point he had two years of learning French and so he was able to finally
(33:59) actually understand what the professor was saying so was it that he wasn't smart enough to understand how to become a doctor or was it that he just had other skills that he lacked along the way and so a lot of people right now are judging the fact that they didn't succeed because they somehow think it's some innate trait I'm not smart enough I'm not good enough but sometimes you just lack some prerequisite skills right like if you're like trying to learn calculus and you've never done arithmetic before it's going to be really hard right dare I say imposs possible and so if you jump straight
(34:29) into calculus you're not going to win so sometimes you have to take two steps back in order to build the foundation to get forward now I'm going to keep the story going so he then graduates in uh you know seven years because how long it takes the actual medical school system is different in in in in uh in Europe they actually do college and the the next degree all is one thing so seven years later he graduates okay then he's this Iranian dude can't go back to his own country meets a girl in Belgium she says I'm from the US
(34:58) and so he comes back to the US with the lady who would eventually become my mother and when he's in the US he then his doctor his his MD doesn't apply here so he then has to basically do it again in the United States and in order to do this you have to get a residency now getting a residency as someone who's a foreigner back then was pretty tough and so it took him two years where he had to basically work minimum wage jobs he was like uh you like run slides like Radiology slides back and forth as like
(35:31) a runner a courier when he was a full surgeon but he couldn't do it here in the US and so imagine how masculina it is right where your wife comes back she's able she was a US citizen and had all this other stuff right and she could she got her interpret immediately because uh she was us and she was a girl whatever and my father didn't and so he then had to do two more years where he didn't have progress so he he told me this whole story and then eventually obviously he got the he got the residency and then he he was able to get in the path but if you look at that he basically had four or five years of his
(36:03) life where there was basically no net gain in progress towards his goals and so he's telling me this story when he's 50 and he's like look at my life now he's like no one knows he's like no one asks me how long it took they just know what I have now and what I can do now and so you have this idea that it's that it should take a certain period of time it it should only last this long it should be this level of difficulty but the thing is is that that level of perseverance when he decided to go out on his own and start his own practice
(36:35) rather than and and left the practice that he was working in he then didn't know anyone and he still had a heavy accent was a new guy in a new area and it took him time to build up and what did he do my dad learned how to be a general contractor he built his own Surgical Center because he couldn't afford having these Outsource third parties that charge $250,000 to build a surgery center he buildt his his for a fraction of that and so as my dad going to Home Depot measuring and figuring these things out as a full plastic surgeon it's not about the resources you have it's about how resourceful you're
(37:04) willing to be right now getting started is 100% under your control and I love taking this Frame which is that every self-made billionaire is self-made now if you're like wait there are billionaires who aren't self-made right that's why I didn't say all billionaires every self-made billionaire is self-made and every self-made millionaire is self-made and here's the one people hate every self-made person in poverty is self-made now that may make you feel uncomfortable and you know what you may be right you probably did have more
(37:38) disadvantages you probably did have things that worked against you and now what you're right so that's it then for you the rest of your life will never go the way you want to go the harsh truth here is if you want to feel better blame others if you want to get better blame yourself and so my father told me that story multiple times in my life as I'm sure your fathers have told you stories multiple times in your life or you had a parent or an uncle or a brother and they told you those big meaningful stories and so I'll tell you another time he told me it so after I lost everything
(38:14) for the second time think about like I tell the story but it's very easy to gloss over but think about this I had left my job went to a new area didn't know anyone started a gym didn't have enough money to have an apartment slept at my gym just Grassroots got it going made the gym Successful by working there every hour of the day was finally successful enough to be able to open a second location a third a fourth a fifth a sixth finally feel like I I taste success like I'm actually doing something I'm actually pretty good here like that bet that I made actually paid off and then I lose it all and so I I I
(38:50) sell all those locations I put the money in a new thing and then it's gone and so I could look back and say wow I just spent all those years and I actually have nothing to show for it the only thing I would have had to show was the money that I made but my father retold me that story and he said it was never about the amount of failures failures he had it was about the education that he had and so one of the other repeated father isms that he gave me was that education is the only thing that no one can take from you the skills you have the skills you acquire along the way are
(39:24) the only thing that are truly yours there's nothing else in this world world that actually belongs to you your your clothes can get stolen the belongings you have and he said this from a place of reality which is my family came from a country that took all of our assets They seized everything They seized land They seized homes They seized wealth they just said oh yeah all that that's ours now good luck this may not be as real for people in the United States but having people who everyone in my family
(39:55) had everything taken from them that is very evident in how they talk to me and how I've always seen the world as these things are ephemeral these material Goods the studio the setup the lights the whatever the platforms like gone but the thing is is that my father came here with a ,000 because of the Revolution and had nothing and built the life he has and you can lose it all and gain it back and so we've seen so many entrepreneurs who've actually lived through this cycle it's actually a common thing in entrepreneurship and it's because you have to understand and respect risk the
(40:30) beauty of it is that after you fail the likelihood that you're successful goes up not down this is the part that people Miss they fail and think it somehow decreases the likelihood of success but it actually increases it and so it's like you want to just get the failures out of the way why would you not want something that increases the likelihood to your goal and the reason that it increases that likelihood is that failure is a requisite probability for taking action and so anyone who has failed has taken more action than someone who's done nothing which means it increases the likelihood that they are successful and
(41:02) so when you fail you get feedback and when you get feedback you get better and when you get better it increases the likelihood you win losers stay losers by never being willing to lose everyone loses before they win and so there's this great Moment In The Matrix which is the the famous jump where Neo is trying to jump across the buildings and everyone's gathered around because they think he's the one he obviously takes the jump and he falls and they're like H what does it mean what does it mean and Cypher who ended up eventually being the Judas of this says everybody falls the first time and
(41:39) so even the one or the person who was going to become the one was somebody who had to fail first and I love that because everyone Falls the first time your first business is very unlikely to be your last business the first product you have will be a product that you'll be embarrassed of years from now but what's important is having the product getting the product building the product launching the product shooting the shot and so if you're never willing to lose you're never going to win so in 2025 if you start a podcast or you start making content or you start doing cold outbound
(42:09) or you you you you take a new job whatever it is just remember that your second try after you fail which you inevitably will takes twice the emotional effort but half the actual effort so you'll fail and you'll emotionally feel bad but guess what you did you actually gripped your hands on the unknown and you go from unknown optimism to known pessimism so it's like okay now I know what it takes I now have realistic expectations what is required in order to be successful and although it may be bigger than I originally
(42:43) thought I now can quantify what is required to win and so here's the thing the best entrepreneurs in the world have the biggest failure resumés and so I don't even want you to win I want you to build your failure resume and so if you're like must be easy for you to say I lost money on my first two real estate deals I ever did almost lost all the money I put in I've lost money on crypto when I put it in years ago I lost money on uh bad hires I've lost millions in bad hires actual hard costs not soft costs I've had six failed businesses
(43:14) I've had nine failed Partnerships and so I bring these things up because like you're not going to hit it out of the park on the first shot but the crazy thing about how success works is that you only need to win once that's the crazy part is you only have to win once once I'll read you this quote from Jeff Bezos which is what I started my first book $100 million offers with we all know that if you swing for the fences you're going to strike out a lot but you're also going to hit some home runs the difference between baseball and business however is that baseball has a
(43:43) truncated outcome distribution when you swing no matter how well you connect with the ball the most runs you can hit is four in business every once in a while when you step up to the plate you can score 1,000 runs this longtail distribution of returns is why it's important to be bold Big Winners pay for so many experiments and when he says big Winners pay they pay in failures they pay in the scars that they have to incur and endure along to hitting it out of the park and hitting it out so big that they never have to swing again and so I want to make this as real as I possibly
(44:18) can I just found an old note from myself to myself that's 12 years old and so I talked about my $10,000 per month income goal and reading it got me actually pretty choked up this is all to say that no matter where you're at in your journey you've just got to believe with all your [ __ ] heart that you're going to make it because no one else is going to believe for you because you can never expect someone to invest in you more than you invest in yourself and the crazy thing is some people say they'd kill for a shot or theyd die for a chance when in reality they won't even
(44:50) wake up 60 minutes earlier for it so we've eliminated the distractions all of the things associated with not doing this stuff and now now hopefully I've removed some of the mental BS around getting started and so now once you start you got to get better connections money looks intelligence those are all great but you can beat someone with all of those things if they have only one trait an insatable desire to improve no matter where they start it's hard to beat someone who improves every second of every day without giving up and this
(45:23) is why earlier I said ambitious people buy skills and they pay for those skills with time and money and in order to have the time and money to invest in those skills they have to take them from somewhere else because the thing is is that your resources are zero sum and this is something that a lot of people aren't comfortable with whatever you choose to spend your time on you take from something else whatever you choose to spend their money on you take from something else and so most people don't have a resources issue they have a priorities problem you are choosing to say that other things are more important
(45:55) and hey I want to be real if that stuff is is more important to you than amazing you want it life congratulations but if you don't have what you want and you're spending money to proliferate a life that is not the one you want to lead then you need to shift the list to invest the time and money and pull from those things that you don't want to put more in the ones you do and do you want to starve out failure so think about this one of the easiest ways to to have more money is to work more hours you're like how is that possible well when you
(46:26) work more hours it actually kills two birds one is that you actually make more money when you work more hours but on top of that you don't spend money because you have less time to spend it and so every hour of work is a net positive in two directions so it saves you money you're not spending and makes you money and so you want to find those little twists that you can make in your Investments of time and money that are outsized it's not just that you gain you also stop the loss I've always been willing to bet bid big on me and so a
(46:59) lot of you guys are trying to like bet big on Dogecoin or some meme thing or like some get rich quick and I promise you the guys who have all the money know how to do it better than you and if you have your last thousand or 5,000 or $10,000 that you're like what do I do with it bet on you cuz you'll never sell you you're a long-term hold right and so if you get better you guarantee the win and every investment you make compounds you guarantee compounding because every skill stacks on top of other skills Steve jobs talked about how when he went
(47:29) to college and learned calligraphy was the reason that fonts showed up in the Mac later and so he talks about you can only connect the dots looking back you want to double down on investing more into you getting skills and I'll tell you something that you probably don't know so I spent $110,000 and I only had 50 saved up after years of being a consultant so I had $50,000 saved up as 23 years old as my life savings I spent $10,000 to get a gym coach I joined a mastermind for gym owners fun fact though I didn't have a gym but I figured
(48:03) if I go to a mastermind of gym owners I'm going to learn so many of the things that they made mistakes on when they started their gym they're they're going to have opinions on how I should lay out the square footage what what locations I should pick what model I should use and so rather than say oh I'm just going to find out all these failures on my my own and and take five times as long I was like I'd rather pay $10,000 to pull 5 years forward into the present and so I was able to get that first location up
(48:28) and profitable and outsourced by month 9 now some of the guys in The Mastermind were at year five and still hadn't done that I pay down my ignorance tax as much as I possibly can because the cost of you not being able to achieve your dreams the price is ignorance and the debt that you pay is the distance between where you are and how much you'd be making if you knew how to do it I I've told the story before but I think it's so it's it's something that's so ingrained how I think in terms of how I price what I'm willing to pay in time or money and before I tell that story I move geographically whenever I see an
(49:06) opportunity to get around someone who's better than me and so when I wanted to learn Fitness stuff I moved to an area where I knew there was other Fitness entrepreneurs that I was like well maybe I'll be able to hang out with them a little bit and I'll learn a little bit there and I went to a city I didn't know anything about I knew no one and when I wanted to when I wanted to uh get in the gym space I said well California is like the capital of Fitness SoCal so I'm going to move out to Southern California because the best guys will be there and if I can win there I'll be able to win
(49:30) anywhere and so I moved out to California without knowing anyone whenever I've had these big transitions in my life is not only being willing to bet with my money and bet with my time but I also bet with my geographic location I'm willing to risk losing the relationships that I had to gain relationships that I need and so 2025 for you might mean that you have to leave where you're at and that could mean across town but it could also mean across the country or even across into a different country it mean that you're
(49:57) going to spend take all this money that you used to spend here and spend it an entirely different way you probably are going to have less stuff and that's okay because that stuff only deteriorates it only gets worse but you will only get better don't invest in Dogecoin don't even invest in the S&P 500 invest instead in the 500 invest in you because you will always beat a 10% return in the stock market and if you think that Dogecoin is going to out compete your personal growth you're never going to win anyone can get rich fast as long as you're willing to make no money for a
(50:32) long period of time while you work to get good enough to get rich fast and so I told you I'll tell you that story The Story Goes Like This a guy is actually using this as a sales close to an audience he wrote a million dollars on a whiteboard in front of an audience and so then he called out to a lady in the front row and he said how much do you make ma'am and she said $50,000 and he said okay well right now you pay reality $950,000 every single year for not knowing how to make a million dollars and when I saw that I realized that the value of the
(51:09) skill of making a million dollars is the difference between what I'm making and what I could be making and people wildly undervalue how much more they could be making once they have a skill and so if you're the type of person who can actually follow instructions show up on time smile be able to fail and keep going virtually all education will net you a positive yield because let me ask you a question would you pay $950,000 to make a million dollar and be able to make a million dollar every year well that would be an insane deal you pay it once
(51:44) and you get the skill forever so every year after that you make a million dollars a year well of course you should now once you make the million do a year are you willing to give a 100% of what you make to make $10 million a year of course you should and that's why education is by far the highest return you can learn how to make a million dollar a year for probably close to $200,000 year and you're like well well where where do I spend that you'll spend that on conferences you'll spend it on seminars and it'll likely be in 2000 to
(52:13) to 5,000 sometimes $30,000 chunks but for some reason you're willing to spend this on some academic who hasn't been in reality for 20 years cuz they're on tenure and thinks that the world uh is just going to hand you stuff because that's their reality because they're government funded or you can pay money to people who live in real private businesses who do this stuff for a living and here's the thing I have never paid for education and not gotten more than what I paid for now I don't want to conflate that with the fact that I've paid for things that I didn't think was worth
(52:50) that money to other people but I always ask myself okay number one how can I become the best student who's ever gone through this how do I become this person's number one success story and I've told every program every partner every vendor that I've ever worked with I will be your biggest success story and so the reality is once I am their biggest success story is that because of them or because of me and I think that's a choice that you get to make am I going to be the number one success story or do I want to be right and prove that
(53:19) they're not good well congratulations maybe they're not that good well what does that leave you with no skills and less money if you choose to succeed anyways and say what can I learn from this person because I've learned just as much from bad people as I have from good because a lot of times getting good is actually the removal of bad and so if you find out other ways that people do a terrible job it's also a wonderful way of figuring out how to not do a terrible job and so if I want to create a product that's exceptional and I say let's say I want to put a phone a camera the
(53:50) internet email all in one place if you remove all of the stuff that sucks from all of those things what you're left with as an iPhone most times you can always get more than what you pay for when you invest in you so let's get really tactical if you really want to double down on you which will bu far I mean think about this 10% Improvement is the S&P 500 so you're saying that you could take okay let's be real Let's do let's do real math so let's say that you've got $10,000 saved up okay let's say that's what your savings is which by the way makes you like a top 40% American FYI so let's say
(54:29) you've got $10,000 saved up you could put in the S&P 500 and have that $110,000 be$ 10,900 one year later or you can spend that on something that can triple your earning capacity and next year instead of making let's say $50,000 a year you make $100,000 a year well which of these increases the $50,000 plus increase is more than the net of the 900 because you lost the 10 you spent the whole thing here you invested it here you spent it but did you spend it or did you invest it an asset you could control and so I don't know about you but I'd rather have the extra 50 and put
(55:12) the 10 in and then what do I do next year I'm going to take this 50 and I'm going to ask myself is there anything I could put this $50,000 into so I could put in the S&P 500 and I could go and add myself an extra uh $5,000 $55,000 whatever let's say I get 10% that year okay so I get 55,000 this year or I could put that 50k into 10 5 10K things or 2 25k things and all of a sudden take my earning power from 100K to 250k wow what a deal but I'm going to lose the whole 50 again and so the thing is is that on my way up I basically took my savings and I spent it almost every
(55:52) year on education because why on Earth would I want the future to take longer to get to me when you buy skills it's the closest approximation to buying time and so there's this big thing like you can't buy time false you can buy the future at a discount and you buy the future at a discount by buying the skills required in order to get there faster and so if it could take you five years if you did it on your own or it could take you one year if you paid four different people to help you out with each step of the process why would you not want to pay all of the money you have to get to there and then have four
(56:26) years of gain with that new Baseline you now are living four years 5 years into the future it's like you skipping from being 20 to 25 and you getting the earning power at 25 plus but now you're just 21 and then when you're at that point you pull the next 5 years for it and when you're 22 it's like living like you're 30 right like now at that point though you might spend all your savings yet again and this process has been one that I have consistently done for the entirety of my career and it just gets to a point where you can't even spend
(56:53) the money and so my very controversial advice is spend all your money on education for as long as you possibly can until you can't even spend the money because you're making too much of it and so how do you become an expert you do more repetitions than anyone else in a narrow field which also means you fail more times than anyone else in a narrow field and so if you want to beat someone just try 10 times harder than them and you only really need to try two or three times harder but you probably don't realize how much harder they're trying than you are so try 10 times harder just
(57:26) a make make sure you win people reject this idea that someone can work 10 times or 100 times harder but I Define work as output and so for you to say that someone can't produce 10 times more than you is just factually false there's tons of people who produce 10 times more there's tons of people who produce a 100 times more than you I'll give you the easiest example in the world a lot of departments run on weekly cadences they say do this thing by end of week often times you can ask that person how many
(57:54) hours will this really take you and then that person will say something like I don't know 3 or four hours you say okay well why don't you just get it done by noon and then at noon you say okay what's the next thing going to take and they'd say uh probably another three or four hours you say cool get it done by the end of the day now from those two cycles that would have normally taken two weeks or 14 days but instead it got done in one and so just right there you got something done you got 14 times more done than the competitor who's doing
(58:22) things on a weekly basis and so this is how you drag the future to the present is that you're not focusing on hard you're working you're focusing how much you're getting done you'd be amazed at how much better you get after you've done it 100 times if you want to win do it again I want to be clear you don't just post 100 videos in a row and see what happens you post one see what worked and then try and do more of that thing and so the idea isn't just raw effort it's raw effort with an improvement Loop and so I remember one
(58:53) of my favorite words that I have to teach sales guys cuz the repetitive task to teach someone how to sell is great do it again great again great job again and so it's that repetition that breeds the Nuance of skill and you want it to be so drilled into you that you no longer have to consciously think about how to do the thing because you can then do it as a natural skill so you can move on to putting your attention to the next skill so it's not just about learning how to do it once it's about learning how to do it so many times that you don't have to think about doing it at all it's
(59:26) especially if you're starting out your goal should not be passive income mainly because you don't have enough money for the passive income to mean anything instead you should learn how to make money while you're awake before trying to learn how to make it while you sleep you crawl then you walk then you run once you have more money than you can possibly reinvest in education and acquiring more skills then you can take the leftover and put that into your passive income poll and so very very tactically this is what I walk you through you should have an education
(59:55) investment budget and so just like you spend x per month so let's say you we pull all of your expenses down and you're making an extra ,000 a month okay now if you're not eating out you're not buying new clothes you're not going out with the boys you're not spending money in stupid ways that if that's what you're doing then you're going to have $1,000 left if you have that then you can take that money and every month you can put it towards a bank account that you can either choose to immediately spend or save up for something that is more expensive and I can tell you that a lot of what I learned when I when I
(1:00:25) bought program programs and seminars and conferences and things like that wasn't even from the content itself but it was connections that I was able to make at those types of events that I was then able to Leverage The One skill I had which I was good at sales and then start giving that away to every person I met so that I could collect those IUS and then learn skills for free and so it's like I really just needed a ticket to get in the room and then I could trade with everybody else with the skills I had to then get to learn theirs and so as wild as this sounds at the end of
(1:00:56) 2025 you could be dead broke but rich in skills and so let's say at the end of next year you actually have no more money but you now have the ability to make more money and so just like my father had to start over from nothing after losing everything he didn't lose everything he still had the most valuable thing he had which is that he was a surgeon and so he knew a skill and he could make it work here like he'd make it work there and that is something that no divorce can take from you no government can confiscate and it's something that's with you till the day
(1:01:25) you die and so that's how you get better you keep going you keep improving the feedback loops you invest appropriately and you keep going all in on you we've eliminated everything that's bad we've started something that's good we've gotten even better at being good and now finally we've got to stick to it when it gets tough because it will here's something that's taken me way too long to learn staying focused is like beating addiction it's not a one-time Victory you have to fight it all day every day then wake up and do it again tomorrow
(1:01:54) because the thing that's going to distract is going to change every day the thing that's going to trigger your addiction to distraction is going to keep morphing and changing its form so that it can steal or Rob you of your future and so you have to be adaptable in knowing that you have to fight it every day and so it's not good enough to just say I was focused for this week you've got to wake up on the eighth day and the ninth day and do it again and so you remember that guy who uh got rich Drop Shipping and day trading and uh buying crypto and wholesaling all at the
(1:02:24) same time yeah me neither Focus to win in business you need to be able to say no without remorse and hear no without a loss of enthusiasm which means that you have to keep feeling rejection keep failing and keep going while being willing to reject basically everyone else and that seems so counter because you're right there and you're like man I don't want to reject this person because I know what it feels like to be rejected you need to be able to maintain this discrepancy so that you can create the
(1:02:57) space to do the work that needs doing so there have been a couple of lessons that I have learned over and over again in my career I've had to relearn so it's a lot like a like a fine wi it's like it it gets better with age and there's more Nuance to the flavor so I think focus is not a are you focused or not it's how focused are you and you can measure someone's focus by again the quality and quantity of things that they say no to which means that as you get better more opportunities will emerge which is interesting because people who start out
(1:03:28) can't see opportunity anywhere and it's because they have so few skills and so there's very few opportunities for them when you have a lot of skills there are so many opportunities that are in front of you that you feel like you're missing out but the real opportunity is actually in solving the problems in front of you I was able to in my opinion become another order of magnitude greater in terms of Entrepreneurship which I would just me measure by wealth once I was able to learn to say no and accept that
(1:03:59) I would not be able to pursue the many things that I know I could crush because once you realize how much actual work it takes to make something good you realize how few things you're actually going to be able to do in your entire life and so this is why picking becomes so important right now the things that you're going to have to say no to are really the distractions and kind of in some ways easy say not to Fantasy Football say not to drinking beers with the boys going out with the club whatever but in a year
(1:04:27) from now once you have more skills there will be more opportunities you're going to have multiple $10,000 month income opportunities that you're going to have to say no to to stick with the one that you have and then once that things becomes a $100,000 a month thing that you're doing you're going to have to start saying no to multiple $100,000 a month opportunities and here's the thing with opportunities that come up they only show you the upside and not the downside you have to know where the skeletons are buried you have to know
(1:04:50) where the bodies are if you don't know and I've gone through this this this visual because I think about it every single time I have to walk through not doing something you are here you see this new opportunity here then you understand the downsides here then you live the downsides then you experience the upside then you achieve your goal and so this is the starting point this is called uninformed optimism this is now informed pessimism this is the value of Despair and this is where most people quit but what they do is they don't even quit because they don't want to say they quit what they do is they start another
(1:05:29) one of these things and they say oh this is now my uninformed optimism and then oh now I understand this more but the thing is is that they never actually get through to this upside and so they just keep jumping from thing to thing to thing over and over again and so the reason it takes so long is because you're in a rush big things don't happen on small timelines because you have to start from zero over and over again and if you actually stick with it it's actually the shortest way to get to where you want to go go it just takes longer than you think must be easy for you to say is probably something that
(1:06:00) you might think by watching this or listening to this and I like to tell the story because in July of 2017 is when I started my podcast and it was 90 days after I lost everything the last time and from that point until now it's taken that period of time to get to over a million downloads a month and for the first three years and I was making multiple we're talking 3 400 episodes for the first few years I never really cracked 3,000 downloads a month and so I could say man why is this taking so long but the real real is that it took me that long to get good it also being
(1:06:41) extra real took me that long to have proof on the outside that what I was saying was true on the inside and right now no one who listens to my podcast cares that it took me seven years to get here they just care that it's good today and so people quit here when things get hard because the thought of something being hard forever is unbearable they think that this line is just going to keep going this way forever but it's not because once you fully understand all the bodies where the skeletons are hidden then you can actually start solving them one by one the thing is is
(1:07:13) that that distraction only is distracting because you don't know what sucks about it you might think you know what sucks about it but you don't know what sucks about it and so the big difference is you have something called declarative versus procedural knowledge and so there's two types of learning and this is actually formal this is uh this is from Academia so you have declarative knowledge which is knowing about something so if you go memorize a fact or you you you learn how private Equity works right this is knowing about the
(1:07:44) other type of knowledge is procedural which is knowing how to and so a lot of people mistake declarative knowledge for procedural and so they mistakenly think that if they watch 10 videos on doing a private Equity deal that it means they understand how to do a private Equity deal or they watch 10 videos on cold outbound and they think it means they understand how to do cold outbound or 10 videos on sales and so forth but you're never really going to learn how to do it until you do it and so you're going to learn more from your first hundred cold calls your 100 cold knock on doors then
(1:08:21) you will from a hundred books or videos that you watch but I have good news nothing hard lasts forever there's only three things that can happen you either quit it gets easier or you get better so no matter what it always ends you only lose when you quit before you see it all the way through and I think that's incredibly encouraging so no matter how hard whatever it is that you're doing is which by the way just means that your expectation doesn't match reality but no matter how hard it is you either quit it
(1:08:53) gets easier because something changes externally or you get harder something changes internally but no matter what it will end think about it like you're you're mining for gold right you're you're chiseling away underground and you've got this pile of gold you don't know how far away it is but it's underground and you're digging towards it this difficulty of swinging the the the pickaxe can end when one you walk out of the mind and say there's you know what marketing doesn't work sure the second is that all of a sudden you hit a soft patch and then you're like oh my God I'm digging so much faster now this is great and then you get to the gold
(1:09:26) or you just start swinging the axe harder because you get more muscled you get more efficient with your movements and you just keep chiseling away even if it goes from dirt to rock you just keep chisling away at a slower Pace but you eventually break through and get there but in all three of those scenarios hard doesn't last forever and so I'll give you a little rule of thumb that I've seen on how do how do I do more of what's working right how do I keep going when it's easy do more when it's hard do different and so I told this story years
(1:09:55) going I'll tell you guys again so when gym launch just barely started to work all right so I'm like 3 months into gym launch working guess what guess what brilliant Alex thought he should do so I went to this Meetup of 10 entrepreneurs all the entrepreneurs were eight figure entrepreneurs so 10 million plus per year I was not making that I we were pacing probably $3 $400,000 a month at the time it was just me ilila and I think we had an assistant over kitchen sink right so it was I was making the most money I'd ever made in my life and probably to this day because it was the most material change in my life by
(1:10:25) percentage when you go from no money to hundreds of thousands a month within 90 days me looking at bankruptcy attorneys 6 months earlier to that it's I can't I can't explain how crazy reality shifted but I had this guy who came up to me after I gave my little presentation of like hey this is what's working and so of course what I want to do now is start a supplement company he came up to me and he said if what you're saying is true if the economics of the business that you've outlined really do work as well as you say they do when it gets
(1:10:55) easy is when you go hard it's when you double down on what's working and he said that to me and I remember he said because what's going to happen is that if it really works this well someone bigger and batter is going to take all your stuff and immediately try and do it with their distribution Their audience and their leverage and so if there's ever been a time to focus on the thing that's in front of you it's right now and I remember Leila and I felt this huge weight of pressure that started us at that point because literally I think
(1:11:24) I was I was really content for like six weeks and I was really thrilled we had just gotten married we're six weeks into being you know married we're making really good money uh she's 23 or 24 I'm 26 or 27 so like we're young I was like holy cow this is amazing our rent for contacts was $1,200 a month I was taking home 400 right like and so I've always lived far below my means at this point though we went back home with the devil inside of us in terms of the fear of us losing everything that we had and so we
(1:11:54) basically worked around Around the Clock like someone was trying to put us out of business and the thing is is that people did eventually but by the time they did we had gone so far ahead that they were way behind us because we were working against a hypothetical enemy who was trying to destroy us not the ones that were actually mediocre and distracted when it's easy do more once it starts working put the blinders on and hit the gas and I would challenge you with this tactical setup right now if you've never
(1:12:23) worked for 30 days straight I would encourage you to try it in China there's something called the 996 which is basically the standard for Chinese Tech work hours which is you work 9:00 a.m. to 9:00 p.m. 6 days a week that's the bar and so I like to state that because we think we work so hard that's just the average and so I would encourage you remember Hard Times Hard Men right good times well we need to act as though it's hard times because if you don't you're surely going to become soft my challenge
(1:12:55) for you is work 30 days straight work 10 work 12 hours a day 30 days straight what you will realize at the end of this is one how much work you can actually do two that you're not going to die you're not made of glass and third you'll know that you have that gear if the time calls for it now I will be very real with you I work more now than I have ever worked in my life save maybe when I opened my very first gym so I work in absolute hours more than I ever have and I produced significantly more than I did then and this year I think I've taken something
(1:13:33) like 10 or 11 days off in 2024 I would measure a day off as any day where I worked probably fewer than 4 hours I put this as context and I had a I had a security guard who was here at acquisition. earlier this year and he was talking to uh some of the younger guys on the team and he said you should never let Alex work more hours than you because he's already ahead of you and so if you want to catch up with him certainly don't let him outw work you some of the hoodoo mental health whatever people are going to disagree with me also don't give a [ __ ] and so
(1:14:16) the thing is is you can just go and make those mental health people happy or you can get what the [ __ ] you came here to get you can do what you came to do and I have found that in my life I've gotten significantly more purpose and more drive from a Long Day's hard work from earning my shower at the end of the day than anything that I've ever had from a pleasure seeking perspective as much as it's great to go to the pool for a day and hang out with some people or maybe just watch movies as great as that may be there's nothing that I get more filum
(1:14:52) out of than knowing that at the end of a day that I work 16 straight hours that I have some product that I pulled out of my brain and into the world that this thing got life now looking back on the best days of my life it was those types of days and so when I realized that I stopped trying to satisfy what everyone else told me my life was supposed to be like they're like you should take vacations I took my first vacation this year and it was supposed to be a two-day vacation and Lila and I left after one
(1:15:23) because what happened was I got there at this beautiful Resort $5 or $10,000 a night very expensive and I I say that just to say that it was ritzy right it was luxurious I get there I sit out on the back of this beautiful patio for this really expensive room and I look out on this you know Mountain View and I think to myself this is beautiful and I don't care I wish I felt something and all I wanted was to get back in the game and so I realized that even that little mini vacation was something that I had done because I thought was an expectation it was unspoken or spoken
(1:15:58) from someone else in my life and so I have this quote that I live by which is if you don't know why you believe what you believe it's not your belief it's someone else's at that time it's like I had this belief that I should take a vacation but why now if I can't explain it which I really can't then I shouldn't do it and now I want to be very clear this doesn't mean that there's no time for rest but I like to think about the hypothetical extremes I like to think about the 996 that that is just the standard in China and I like to think
(1:16:28) about people in the Middle Ages and the Dark Ages they worked above their shop and they didn't have like the 7-Day or 5day work week is something that was invented in the last 100 years this is not pointing to your human capacity this is pointing to a societal constraint I think that a truly liberated individual operates purely from first principles of what do I want what does it take to get it and then what are the things that hold me back and those those things that hold you back are going to be physical constraints you can't operate without sleep not for an extended period of time
(1:17:01) so I'm not saying don't sleep sleep as much as you can I'm not saying that you can work physical labor all hours of the day without rest you need rest and sometimes you need mental rest which is different than physical rest and that's okay so if you need and I'm going to put need in quotes here if your way of unplugging is watching Netflix cool if your way of unplugging is gardening cool if your way of unplugging is working out cool do what works for you but but fundamentally the goal is to increase total net output over the longest period of time and so it's not about okay I'm
(1:17:32) going to work 24 hour straight well you're actually going to take from tomorrow so your net output over two days is going to be much worse and so it's really balancing that and I learned that much later in life I was able to get significantly more out of myself working s days a week and working 10 hours 12 hours on those days rather than working call it 18 every day that was for me a little bit bit too much now I have had Seasons where I call three shifts so basically I work 6:00 to noon noon to 600 and then I work 6 to
(1:18:04) basically sleep time when I get back home I only usually have to go into that gear probably once a year for maybe 6 weeks to 8 weeks is when I have to go into the third shift but most of the times I can pretty much sustain 12 hours of work a day kind of indefinitely I bring this up to kind of set the bar for at least where I'm at so maybe you have some sort of benchmark but if you're wanting to get ahead I can promise you working less is probably not the way to do it especially when you don't have as many skills because the
(1:18:34) fewer skills that you have the more labor or volume you have to compensate with in order to make up for the ineffectiveness per unit of time you work and so in the beginning is when you actually have to work the most but in the end is when you want to work the most because of how much more you're getting for it so my team wanted me to make this point because they've obviously seen me work and they're like I don't think this is coming through in this video which is that I have an obsession with speed this seems kind of
(1:18:59) weird in justos with patience but this is the very classic micro speed macro patience you know whatever whatever whatever ISM you prefer the idea is though that you want to pull reality forward and so I always like to break things down whether it's me or my team into how many hours and minutes something's going to take and then I like to stack those things back and forth and rather than using arbitrary deadlines of okay let's get this done by next week you use actual deadlines based on how long long it should take and then when you find out how long something takes you then ask the next question which is how can I make this take less
(1:19:31) time how can I automate this thing how can I automate portions of this work how can I how can I give away chunks of this how can I deem some of this unnecessary and so that continuous cutting and pulling forward of tasks is how you can move so much faster through life and towards your goals and so I have this weird mental belief that there's like this this big path in front of me that I have all these skills that have to achieve to hit these Milestones that is laid out on this time span and so I reject the timeline but I accept the skills and so the idea is like okay it's like I'm a Pac-Man of like eating those
(1:20:06) little dots and each of those dots is a skill it's like I want to pull it towards me as fast as I can so I can so I can ingest the skills and basically power up myself faster because I know that these skills are requisites I can't move on to calculus without knowing arithmetic I can't move on the calculus without knowing algebra there's no way around it but I can choose to learn algebra faster and so then it's like okay what is required to learn algebra oh and if I do more problems faster then the standard person then I'll get there faster and so if the class says okay I need you to do these 10 problem sets and
(1:20:38) they're due next week well then how long does it take for me to do those problems maybe 30 minutes then why can't I do my second lesson 30 minutes later and then do another 10 problems and do my third lesson 30 minutes after that and do another 10 problems well if that's the case then I can do an entire Year's worth of work in a week and this is how in my opinion pulling forward is one of those things that I've seen so many of the most successful entrepreneurs do is they simply question timelines aggressively and ruthlessly eliminate any waste or gap between the
(1:21:12) actions required to win and everything else honestly I think the things that I'm working on right now for my skills are I'm learning how to reinforce cultural norms across a company that continues to scale which I Define as the rules that govern reinforcement in an organization that is the culture and those are both spoken and unspoken rules and when I say rules I mean when someone does this they get a pat on the butt when someone does this they get uh chastised or they get a ding right and the thing is is that people like to say they have a good culture here but the culture is is is hundred
(1:21:55) thousand unspoken rules and that's why it takes people time to learn and figure out what the culture is when they go somewhere new you can give someone a list of a 100 rules and if you were very granular you could figure it out the problem is that the culture changes based on the people who Chang the reinforcers and so that means that the culture in a team could be different than the culture in the company because the person who's closest to them uh manages it differently and so that changes the behavior and so that's why a sales team can have a different culture than a marketing team a different culture than a finance team different
(1:22:24) culture than than an HR team and so I'd say right now a big focus of me of mine is trying to standardize the rules that govern reinforcement across an organization that scales and making sure that everyone is aligned with that style of work the second thing that I'm working on right now is basically the highest level of recruiting and recruiting and talent is actually kind of like Focus where it's one of those skills that I don't think you ever Master you just keep learning how many more levels to are to it it's like right when you finish you realize that you're at a sub Peak and there's actually
(1:22:57) another Peak Beyond it the Mist lifts and then you see the next steps and so like Focus I thought oh I was focused at $100,000 a month because I could turn these opportunities down and then you got some even sexier opportunities you got to learn how to say no to those so the same thing happens with Talent is that you're willing to tolerate a certain amount of mediocrity at one level that is no longer tolerable at a level above that and the types of people that you bring in you have a higher standard a higher bar for those people
(1:23:20) and attracting them in the process associated with getting them to buy into your culture your vision and getting them to take their skills and apply them to your opportunity is a skill set that I am working on now because fundamentally I have a belief which is the best talent is always yet to come and that's predicated on the idea that if I get better my opportunity will get better and that will attract more people and better people and I bring this up because I basically want to translate one thing which is that the reinvestment
(1:23:46) in learning skills never ends and so Charlie Munger said this you just have to be a lifelong student you have to be willing and want to learn so actually had um an example of this so recently there was somebody on uh teams I did a bunch of one-on ones uh over the last week because I was looking at one of the Departments and uh one of the one of the guys said hey I have this particular skill I was hoping that we could eventually have a a role that only does this thing and I said you know it's interesting that you that you ask or you make that request because if I were you
(1:24:16) I would not think that way at all I would think how could I learn 10 more skills rather than how can the organization meet my demands it should be how can I let my skills meet the demands of the existing business it's asking reality to meet you where you're at rather than meeting reality where it is and I think that too many people do this why can't the world insert be more convenient for me well the world is uncaring and doesn't care about you at all and underline underpinning that statement is the entitlement is the
(1:24:45) expectation that it somehow should and I think that is a poverty lens and so the wealthy accept the world for what it is and then choose to maximize and adapt everyone else else tries to stop their feet and throw tantrums and say how it's not fair and they're right and so what there's a Haitian proverb that has nothing to do with cats and dogs that I think is relevant right now which is behind mountains are more Mountains goals aren't Finish Lines they're mile markers and I think that's a great mental frame which is that you think
(1:25:18) that your goal is to get to $10,000 a month or $100,000 a month or a million a month or 10 million a month whatever your goal is and I can promise you having hit those you just move it again you just the Mist lifts when you get there and you realize there's another mountain top but where people lose their way is when they start listening to people at the bottom of the mountain who see them at the subhead and say you weren't happy last time when you got to the last Peak why are you going to be happy the next time but that's under their assumption in their poverty lens
(1:25:45) that you did it to get to the Mountaintop you did it for the climb and they'll never understand that and don't expect them to I remember I was trying to understand this person who had made this really irrational decision and I kept thinking like how how does this decision make sense and I was I was talking to my father actually and he said you're trying to apply logic to someone who's illogical and that itself is illogical and I remember thinking about that is that like there are these people in our lives that say these things that you're like I don't understand why they'd say that and then you try and make sense of it but the effort of
(1:26:21) trying to make sense of somebody who doesn't make sense is nonsensical and so if it doesn't make sense to you ignore it because they're going to disappear anyways one of the things that has been true in my life is that the lazy don't know how to start the losers don't know how to finish and the Legends don't know how to stop and if I look at that the lazy the loser the Legends I know which one I would rather be and I also say that as somebody who doesn't believe in Legacy or anything after we die so this is tactical find what works do more of
(1:26:53) what works find the thing that's preventing you from doing more of what works solve that thing and get back to doing more of what works then repeat and so the reality is that in health marriage business or any game worth playing you don't win by winning you win by Staying Alive long enough that you Outlast everyone else so I will give you the advice that I gave a sub group in school that we picked 100 people who had applied out of 500 plus to basically do a 90-day Sprint to help them start a school community so we wanted to do a more in-depth kind of training things like that for this special group so that
(1:27:27) we could see if this new implementation yielded better results and so the guy who we had running the group asked me he's said can you give any kind of like words of wisdom to these guys before we kick it off and so this is what I told them number one follow instructions number two When You Reach something that you don't understand how to do Google first number three when you figure it out post it others also may have struggled four actually follow the rule of 100 daily which is that you reach out to 100 people you make a post that you
(1:27:58) spent 100 minutes on spend $100 plus on ads and you spend at least 100 minutes a day making and improving ads and researching ads as long as you do those things consistently and you get better you will see results and the amount of you that I see who tag me in like day four day 20 day 30 the guys who are at day 60 of rule of 100 are like I have more business than I can possibly handle the problem is no one sticks with anything and this is why I want you to stick with it rule number five five you will be excited for a week then excitement will end and that is where
(1:28:29) the work begins six your work works on you more than you work on it you are the product that's getting built more than anything that you're actually putting into your business remember that seven everything is unscalable in the beginning that's the point it's how you learn every piece of it and once you learn every piece of it people will call you an expert eight the pain of repetition is what forces you to see seek Improvement when you figure out ways to get more for what you do you've gained skill people want to avoid the
(1:29:01) pain one of my favorite bodybuilding coaches Milo sarv talks about this in the context of how to grow a muscle he says find the pain and then he'll just shout he be like suffer suffer he's like stay there find the pain because the thing is is that that pain is what forces you to change and so if you encounter the pain and then say Oh it's not working that's the pain that you need to lean into because when it's not working is what will force you to do an improvement and that's how you get good at making better content get good at making better ads get good at having more effective reach outs on different
(1:29:39) channels whatever it's that pain that forces you to improve nine if you complain you are dead to me and I said this because I believe it like there is nothing weaker and more helpless and that has lower agency than someone who simply complains about what has occurred it's something that happened in the past or is in front of them in the present and regardless complaining literally does nothing it's a net zero it's a net loss you both lose the energy that you could have spent improving and you also lose respect from every single person that you complain to and they will
(1:30:18) associate the complaints with you they won't remember what you complain about only that you complain 10 literally thousands of people have already succeeded you are not special repeat the same activities and you will be able to repeat the same outcomes before you make a conclusion that something doesn't work I want you to State the objective truth of what you're claiming you're like Facebook ads don't work sure so the 400 billion a year in advertising that gets spent on Facebook just somehow doesn't work people aren't doing it because it's not working cold outbound doesn't work
(1:30:53) yeah so the gazillion companies that do 10,000 emails 10,000 calls a day they just it just it doesn't work what you have to reframe it as is I don't know how to make it work I am not good enough to know how to make it work because you're not making as much money as you want because you're not as good as you think you are 11 write down every reason that you're going to stick with it put it in front of you and revisit it when you need a reminder of why to stick with it 12 business is shockingly simple but surprisingly hard hard the hard comes in
(1:31:26) the form of consistency the moment you don't want to do it or just skip today is the day you realize what hard actually feels like learn to endure overcome 13 just win because at the end of the day all of this hardship will be forgotten it will fade into your memory and so know that as you're going through it you're actually just going to disproportionately in your memory remember the good stuff and not the bad stuff I only have a few glimpses in my memory of the time when I was sleeping on the floor and I and I you know had my gym and I was getting started I remember being so tired that like a good night's
(1:32:00) sleep couldn't fix it I remember that but it's almost like I remember the words that I told myself more than I even remember the experiences because it was so long ago things will get better and you will remember the betterness more than you remember the suffering because the betterness will carry over in today which will always be fresher for you than how long ago the suffering may have been if you want to just win I made an entire presentation on winning it's actually my favorite piece of content that I've made in YouTube format I'd recommend watching it

(00:00) one in every 250 businesses does over 10 million dollars a year in sales and that means that 99 of entrepreneurs never hit it every business that I've started since I was 25 has crossed 10 million B2B services with Jim launch b2c consumer products with Prestige Labs or supplement company Allen our B2B software and acquisition.
(00:19) com which is an investment firm for all of the money that we made during those businesses to invest in other ones I feel really confident that I can talk to the points of helping you go from zero to a million a million to 10 million and Beyond and so this is just a visual put this in context ninety percent of businesses never hit a million dollars a year in sales 90 doesn't look that way on Instagram but this is the this is the vast majority of businesses right now nine percent of businesses cross this million dollar threshold right and then only point four
(00:50) percent which is one in 250 do 10 million plus it's so rare and so the nice thing is that success does leave Clues I want to kind of separate this into two major categories one is the entrepreneur and the other is the opportunity vehicle they're pursuing you'll notice I said leverage rather than opportunity vehicle but fundamentally leverages the difference between what you put in and what you get out and so you want to have the best entrepreneur getting the most out of what they put in and so if you have those two things together then you create a 10 million dollar plus business
(01:21) and if you've consumed any of my other content I used to talk about how entrepreneurs does three main things you've got skills you've got character traits you've got beliefs I've thought about this more and I've actually simplified it to one degree which is I think you just have skills and beliefs character traits if you think about this you're like I want to become patient patient is just a general term for lots of little skills and so if you want to become more patient you want to do things that patient people do and that means that if I can train someone to become more patient then patience is
(01:52) a skill and so as a total side quest on this what's interesting about this is that you've probably heard people say soft skills and like hard skills in my opinion hard skills are just skills that are easy to measure soft skills are just hard to measure but they're both 100 skills that you can train and improve and so if we say man I wish that guy had better people skills what we mean is a hundred micro skills that are like I wish you would smile when someone walked in the room can I train someone to do that absolutely if I said hey I wish you would greet someone by their first name
(02:23) immediately every time they walk in the door right boom that's trainable I wish someone wouldn't interrupt it's like okay well we can just give someone a cookie every time they don't interrupt someone and let someone finish their statement and then we train them and so all of these soft skills are just soft because they're hard to measure doesn't mean that they're not skills or they're not important and oftentimes most of us know that like within an organization like the way that you gain influences these soft skills that are hard to measure but incredibly important so
(02:52) if we're talking about how do we make the highest leverage entrepreneur we want somebody who has lots and lots of skills and really it's about beliefs that don't limit them if someone had no limits in terms of what they believed they could achieve then the only thing that would limit them was their skills but most of the times the beliefs that we have are things that just decrease our potential and it's not really our fault because most the people that were around us we grew up just by statistics were poorer than you might want to be
(03:19) and so they told you how they see the world if there's ever something that's going to be on my Tombstone it's this quote which is we question all of our beliefs except for those that we truly believe and those who never think to question and so like the things that you actually believe they're so invisible to you because that's just your lens The Roots you see the world whereas when you're like I want to debate this point it's like you don't really believe that you just have an opinion on it or you have
(03:42) some assumptions that you're willing to back right but the true beliefs of like well no one would be willing to pay for something like that or like that doesn't exist I didn't know that was possible you don't even question those things because they weren't even in your mind to begin with it's the unknown unknowns that are the things that limit us the question is how do we up level someone's beliefs so let me give you a a quick example here so there was an entrepreneur that I know who had a fitness app he was a super high level CrossFit games competitor and he started
(04:11) this app and he didn't want to tell anybody about it because he never plays top three he plays fourth place in multiple competitions which is insane um but he had a belief that if he wasn't the winner he didn't deserve to have an app like think about how crazy it is but he he didn't question that that was just what he believed reality to be like well of course of course I wouldn't want it and so he built this app for himself and just the members of his gym but the app was so good that people started sharing
(04:37) it and finally a client of his was a marketer and said you need to start marketing this you need to start posting about it and he wouldn't post and finally she convinced him to just make one post and he like doubled his Revenue he'd gone from like 20 000 a month to a hundred thousand dollars a month with his app simply because he changed his beliefs and so like fundamentally he had all the skills like he was already a really good CrossFit games competitor he already had the product that was really good and he already had the skills to be able to Market it he was just choosing
(05:06) not to unchaining an entrepreneur is figuring out the reasons they give for why they can't do something those are known limits right well I can't do it because of X that's the things that you know because you can even explain it I can't do it because I'm not number one I can't do it because I'm not in good enough shape I can't do it because the app doesn't load well enough I can't do it because it's only on one platform I can't do it because insert whatever right now the dangerous ones are the unknown unknowns all right
(05:34) that's an N my whole goal when I started my chain of gyms was that I wanted to be America's next gym so I bought the trademark United Fitness I was really proud of it I had six locations I joined this group of Internet entrepreneurs now mind you this reason I think this is funny is because I was sold by the sales guy that there was other gym owners in the room and they were all like doing well and doing stuff uh on the internet too got in the room not only were there no gym owners there weren't even any brick and mortar business owners in the room and so I was like wow this is a
(06:05) shock and so everybody's going up there explaining their like ads and their funnels and their upsell prices and all this stuff and I get up there and I'm like I own six gyms and I was like but these are the ads I run to get members into my gyms the thing is I gave this whole breakdown of everything I did and how open every location at full capacity on the first day without taking cash out of pocket all the stuff and I remember the uh the guy who's running the the whole the whole group and I really looked up to this guy at
(06:29) that time because he was the first person who's like way more successful than me that I actually had access to and so I think at that point he was doing a million dollars a month and I remember thinking like whoa like and so I go through this whole presentation I'm talking as fast as I can explaining all the stuff that I do and uh he stops and he's like Alex um I don't think you should be in the gym business and I remember hearing that it was like time slowed down because I felt like you like punched me in the gut because this was like my whole plan my whole dream this is what I was going towards
(06:58) um but I like paused and just like hurt him out he said you have a level 10 skill set and a level two opportunity I don't think you should be running gyms I think you should be teaching people how to do what you just walked through and I had to believe and I still do that if someone's further along in the game of business you always have things that you can learn from them and if I paid to be in this room if I don't take the advice it's the closest thing to me burning all the money that I paid to be
(07:22) here and so when he told me that to me that was an unknown unknown I didn't know that there was another opportunity vehicle outside of me just owning gyms like I didn't know it was possible so I hadn't thought like I didn't know how franchises worked I didn't know how licensing worked I didn't know how how any of I didn't know how to B2B National any of that stuff worked now there were some skills that I would have to learn in order to enable it but I couldn't even start on that skill path or see the deficiency of skills that I had because I didn't even think I could pursue it and so these are
(07:52) the ones that in my opinion are the most powerful to overcome it's the things that you didn't know were possible I'll give you a different example in Chain of fairies which is one of our portfolio company's amazing business super successful single location and the founder had an agency when he approached me saying like hey I want to do what you did with Jim launchpot with photography studios and so we talked and we talked and we talked and his model was so good I was like I don't know man I think like one of the things that I didn't have
(08:16) with Jim launches they're like I couldn't control delivery with photography you can control delivery and so that means that we could actually centralize a lot of stuff I was like what if we just owned all of them with like a hybrid model we actually took the agency from what it was doing which for most people watching this would be a very good business for you to zero to start this next thing we had such good rapport that he's like if you really think so and we walk through the math and he's like I mean this makes sense but like I'm going to kill something that makes a lot of money I was like yeah but I think it's going to
(08:45) be for something that's going to make way more and then for the next six months we worked and tweaked the original model to get this new model off the ground and 30 months later that business is two and a half million a month with 30 plus locations because I said let's just Own It All he didn't think that that was a model that was really available and then as soon as we made that switch everything took off even in my own personal story when I switched from having my gyms to doing a done for you fly around the country model that took
(09:15) the same skills that I had as an entrepreneur and put them in a better vehicle and then even from doing the gym turnaround business for two years I accidentally fell into the licensing model because I didn't want to fly out somebody asked me if I could show them all the stuff that I did so they could do it for themselves and then at that point he bought it and it was all margin and I was like holy cow this is insane that's when everything took off like a rocket and so I had my brick and mortar gyms and then I scaled to a done-for-you turn around business and then I scaled to licensing and each of those were
(09:44) higher leverage opportunities and it was because I didn't know it was possible and so once I learned that it was possible that unlocked all of the potential value that my skills could have because fundamentally in every one of those examples I knew how to do the same stuff I knew how to Market and sell for a local gym I knew how to build them more profitably create the workouts the meal plans all that kind of stuff that got people results that's what I knew how to do but at each level when I went from gyms to turnarounds
(10:13) The Leverage increased from each of these things and so the same skill set put into a new bucket or a new vehicle unlocked huge value and that's why a lot of entrepreneurs don't get past a million or even get to 10 million that they're in the wrong vehicle so I talk about leverage a lot and it's actually one of the Core Concepts in our logo so we have a supply demand curve and then we have the fulcrum which is the acquisition.
(10:38) com logo and it's because it's cord everything we do if you think about Leverage you've ever heard Archimedes you said give me a long enough lever and I can move the world this is our lever and we'll put our little our little hand here that's my arm if we grab the lever here we have the most leverage on something that is here if we grab the lever here we still have the most leverage on something here but we have less leverage overall compared to how much we have on this side and the main difference here is how much force goes up the other side all right and so Leverage is the difference between what you put in and what you get out
(11:16) that's it so let me give you an example in the real world if you are really skilled at cold calling skill itself is leverage because if somebody who doesn't have the skill makes 100 phone calls that's their input and somebody who does have the skill puts a hundred calls down and the guy who has doesn't have the skill gets zero appointment set and the guy who's amazing at it gets 10 appointments set he has well let's just say the first guy had one for sake of math he has 10 times The Leverage on that skill compared to
(11:45) the Newbie getting and acquiring skills gives you more leverage because it gets you more for what you put in and so if you're more skilled entrepreneur being a skilled entrepreneur is a is a big bucket for hundreds of smaller skills underneath of it because it means that you know how to prioritize what to do next and so one of my favorite quotes about leverage comes from Warren Buffett Uncle Warren he and one of his closest friends graduated Columbia business school at the same time same year and he said that guy was smarter and harder
(12:09) working than him now they then went their separate ways Warren ended up getting into investing with Ben Graham and his friend goes into the steel business because that was back in the day when like American Steel was like a thing which it really no longer is what he learned from that experience is that you fast forward 30 40 50 years and he said his friend you know did okay and he said mind you this is a guy who was smarter and harder working than him he said he did okay he did pretty well but not close to what Warren did and he said his biggest lesson from that was it's not about how hard you row it's about
(12:38) What boat you're in and I love that because it really encompasses the concept of Leverage which is Warren got more out for what he put in than his buddy in the steel business because the steel business had a lot of headwinds a lot of things going against them they had globalizations that started started happening you had other imported steel that was cheaper from China blah blah and so those forces he had to grow harder Against the Wind than Warren did while riding one of the best growth curves of the US economy overall and so
(13:10) he got higher returns and so over my career I make more now than I did before because I've moved further back along this lever so I have more leverage now on what I put in than what I did before when I was selling one-on-one in person and I was doing 20 consoles a day I was working more hours probably than I do now but I get so much more for what I put in so I'm going to show you two triangles that show increasing amounts of Leverage all right now one of these I have stolen ruthlessly from Naval ravacon all right and so he talks about the four types of Leverage I've renamed them so they're C's and it's mostly just
(13:45) so I remember them more easily but but you've got collaboration which just means other people working for you all right then you've got Capital which means other people worked for you and gave you the fruit of their work so that you can invest it on their behalf so for example if I get people to give me a billion dollars which I could do just raise the money and then I invest that money and I say I get 20 of the gain I didn't have to work all the time to make a billion dollars but I still get 20 of
(14:08) it right that's the idea of using leverage of other people's money so Capital so you've got collaboration Capital you've got code and content if I'm a genius coder and I could build one piece of software I can build it once and people a million people can use that same piece of software with content Joe Rogan can make one podcast episode and millions of people can listen to it and so he gets more for what he puts in right so if you think about each of these things it's like you have the influence on someone else I trade me selling for 40 hours a week to me
(14:39) managing a Salesman for two hours who then sells for two for 40 hours a week or higher leverage I spend a week or two weeks recruiting the best sales recruiter and then I do that one time in my life for two weeks and then that sales recruiter Works 40 hours a week to get new sales people in every single week on my behalf and then those sales people on my behalf then sell every single day and so I did two weeks of work for a hundred sales people over the lifetime of that one hire more leverage I get more for what I put in compare that to me taking 20 consults a day
(15:11) higher leverage skill but same concept done at scale Capital we went over code content those are the four types of Leverage now this is where this gets interesting because like once I learned this I was able to put words to what I kind of knew intrinsically and I can now explain it so if you look at my career trajectory see if I can draw a triangle here all right and one of the key points here is that you can actually just max out one of these things so you don't need to have all four now if you have all four
(15:40) cool but if you think about what leverages in general it's just you get more for what you put in and so if you get a thousand X on any of these it's still a thousand X so somebody can just be an amazing private Equity guy or amazing at raising money and become a billionaire they don't need to do any of these other things right so it could be amazing at galvanizing people and creating movements and they wouldn't need any of these other things if someone's amazing at writing software they don't need anyone else's capital and the software does the collaboration
(16:05) on their behalf right and so all of these things like even though they're structured like this you don't have to have all of them if you do have all of them well you look at Facebook that is code about content you raise other people's money and you have people working for it but let me show you how this changed for me so in the beginning it was dark I was an employee right and I made four figures a month then I became self-employed I gained a little bit of Leverage just over my own time so I went from having someone else control my time to me controlling my time which was leverage all right I got
(16:37) more for what I put in and I went to five figures a month all right then I went to employing other people right which is then I would say the first level is me now having the first level of Leverage so into six figures a month all right and this is right as I I would say first when I started my my gyms and I had multiple gyms and then when I transitioned that to turnarounds I still stayed at six figures a month but fundamentally because I actually didn't change leverage I changed how I was structuring it but fundamentally
(17:01) like it was people doing the same work so this was both me being a gym owner with six locations and me doing the turnaround business with other people you're like how do you go from six figures a month to seven figures a month then you started licensing now what is that I made content fundamentally and then I made it once and then many people could have access to it and so when I did that I went to seven figures a month now the question is how do I get from Seven figures a month today figures a month because that's what we have at acquisition.com what did I add into it
(17:37) capital so now we buy into companies that have other people working for them I use content to attract those businesses now I don't have any code right now I have one software investment maybe two I think that are major Investments but the rest of my stuff really if we're talking about it is that I made content I had capital from the things that I'd done before and we had the ability to get other people to help us get our get to our goals and so this is acquisition.
(18:04) com and that's eight figures a month now what do I need to do to get to nine figures a month I may just need to add time to the existing thing that I'm doing key point is that Leverage is about getting more for what you put in people who move faster in life don't actually move faster they get more for their inputs they get more for every step right I'm not like frenetically moving to move faster you just get more out of every move and so that means that if you're getting more out of every move it's a function of time and so if I had for example maybe some
(18:34) code that was implemented within everything that I do at acquisition.com I might be able to get to nine figures a month faster than I currently am but I feel confident with these three that we'll get to nine figures a month eventually and so you might say Alex that might be a limiting belief it might be but that's that's kind of how I'm choosing to play it and so and let me let me like reverse the clock here if I had just kept my gyms from the time I started my gyms until now I might have a hundred locations
(19:04) and I might also already be doing nine figure not nine figure I'd probably be doing eight figures a month from the gyms and so you're like well wait a second so was it the best move I can't go back and replay time I don't know but that's where to me this is why the game gets interesting is that every time you switch vehicles you start at zero again so the pace that the leverage affords you for each step you take has to be disproportionate because you're four of a business you'll typically grow more than year one of a new business and so that's we're doing the same thing for
(19:36) a longer and longer period of time you still get more leverage the guy who owns Panda Express opens 600 new locations this year because he he has done this because now he has enough Capital he has enough collaboration that he's Max no he doesn't do any content and he doesn't have any code right but he has these two at such a high degree that when he adds 600 locations and each location does three million dollars a year right or it might even be I don't know it's a lot and just to give you context Panda Express in 2021 to 3.7 billion in Top
(20:09) Line Sales and he owns 100 of it no outside investors with his wife Peggy and they took home 27 net margins on brick and mortar food all right so let's do the math that's 935 million in income like that was his distributions from owning this thing now if you're like wait but did he pay taxes on it sure didn't why because he owns all the land in the dirt for most of the locations that he had that are freestanding so you'd appreciated all of that against his income so you took all of that tax-free so point being he did this and
(20:42) you're like well how did he do it he's been making chicken and orange chicken and kung pao chicken for 45 years so even though he might not have been in the highest leverage vehicle he was able to stick with that vehicle for 45 years and being able to stick with something for 45 years makes it really hard to suck and when you do that you start unlocking multipliers on The Leverage you have rather than thinking I need more leverage in terms of more types of Leverage maybe you just need more of the one that you've been using since you started with remember I gave the little
(21:15) phone call example of like two people doing the same thing one person has more leverage well each of these things are big buckets with many smaller skills underneath of it so collaboration is I have to know how to recruit talent I have to know how to recognize talent I have to know how to onboard I have to know how to train I have to know how to manage I have to know how to grow talent and I have to know how to run meetings and I have to know how to have one-on-ones and I have to like you know what I'm saying here like all of those micro skills chunk up to collaboration
(21:44) for Capital it's like you have to be good at math being bad at math is probably not like it'd be tough to raise Capital if you really can't do math right it's like okay well that's a skill you need to know well what else do you need to know it's like well you need to be able to reach out to people and get rejected why because when you try and raise Capital you get rejected a lot more times than you get checks right from there it's like you also probably have to have an understanding of legal because you have to learn how to set up a fun structure you also have to know
(22:08) how to negotiate because every single person writes your check is going to want different terms you then have to structure it in a way and negotiate so that you can get mutually beneficial terms for both parties so these are all other skills that go into raising Capital right making content it's like you have to understand the different platforms you have to understand how to sell stories you have to understand how to have I mean and even understanding here it's just like you might even have to just do the work to have credibility to make the content about whatever
(22:31) you're making it on and you know what I'm gonna side quest this real quick a lot of people make content right now and they're trying to hit it big but what they do is like in my opinion you've got entertainers and you've got educators the thing is is that a lot of people who haven't done [ __ ] are trying to educate on things they haven't done and so they have no credibility and so the thing is is that like the reason Mr Beast was able to get so big is that when he was 15 years old he wasn't teaching people about business
(22:56) he was being funny and being cool people are like oh I want to be like him and so then they say oh I'm going to educate people on house flipping but they're 22 years old and they haven't flipped that many houses and so they have no credibility in their content and so in my opinion when you're doing this content thing if you're gonna do it then make sure that you have the backing of experience and proof because then I promise you like when you get [ __ ] on from the public because you will because they don't know who you are and most people are lying you'll be able to
(23:24) know that what you're saying is true because you lived it and so then you won't second guess yourself the people who like tank and self-employed because they're like they can't handle the hate is because on some level they believe it so if you want to be an educator then I think that the middle ground the pre-education stage is the documentation stage where you just say this is what I'm doing now check it out like right now I can't educate really on nine figure not really excuse me I can't educate on nine figures a month haven't been there I know what eight figures a
(23:50) month is don't know how to get to nine figures a month I have my theory which is that I just have to add time to this equation the math spells that out but I just gotta wait once I get there then I can talk about how to build a billion dollar portfolio and you can imagine how my content might change right and so if you're making six figures a year and trying to talk about how to make seven you've never made seven then you're full of [ __ ] and you right Felicia get the hate that you do right and so these are skills that you have to learn how to acquire to make content and
(24:20) to make code you have to learn how to go code and this is how little I know about coding this is it so I would even give you examples of micro skills but like you have to learn HTML and JavaScript and Ruby and python that's about it that's all I know and data architecture and uh yep that's it that's all I got and so you have to learn these these these smaller skills to then say I'm very excellent at code so that I can then have more leverage on the things that I do and then you can walk yourself up this income ladder with more leverage
(24:54) right and again Leverage is about speed any of these vehicles that I had done if I had done it for 45 years like Mr panda you could get there because my n on input is so high if I spend 45 years doing something I might not have the strongest arm but I've done it 45 times more so I still get more out than the guy that's over here that does it two times this is where strategy comes into play is making sure that you're picking the right vehicle Chris for example made less money in the first nine months scaling Enchanted ferries than he did before but at month 10 he matched it at
(25:35) month 24. it was it was like so small in comparison that didn't even matter but I can tell you this really easy to say this really hard to do that for nine months eat [ __ ] and feel like you're losing and always knowing that you could always go back and that's the hard part go back to what you were doing before that was comfortable and made you X versus staying the path and I can tell you it was I mean it's hard for me I mean my team does that like going from making what I was making a gym launch to doing acquisition.com the first year I was
(26:06) like this sucks like I'm used to being able to run any personal expense for this business and not even blink I'm like I actually have to look at cash flow right and so like these are things that you have to like take in but I do believe genuinely year 10 of acquisition.
(26:23) com I think is bigger than your 15 of gym launch to make the Apples to Apples comparison because the thing is is that you actually never get an Apples to Apples comparison because you can't go back in time and so you have to look at what your ten of one business is compared to your three of another and so if you're at your sixth year maybe you should just keep writing it out because whatever you started with is the thing that you have the longest lever on number of times that you got reps in and people want to change Industries and I'll give you a little tidbit from y combinator one is they don't take solo Founders as a side note
(26:47) now mind you they're only interested in billion dollar companies so if that's not you then you could totally be a single founder but it's just harder to be successful with one person skills versus three the second interesting thing that they have they have many things they select for but one of them is industry experience and so if someone says Hey I want to get into this industry if you don't have any experience in that industry and then second to that is personal experience like you suffered from whatever problem you're trying to solve then they're not interested and so you might have six years of
(27:17) experience in the mortgage business I wouldn't recommend getting into weight loss I would say maybe you take a half pivot so you're in the same industry because it's so hard to make up those six years this hopefully gives you more nuanced view to making the right picks to making the most money by the way if you guys like the Whiteboard and me drawing on uh with markers this is a throwback to what I used to do I finally got another board because uh I love these things uh but if you like this style like let me know I love this style but I just try and do the things that that the data suggests that you like the
(27:49) most I'll do what you guys want so that I can hopefully transfer the skills that I have to you faster I said earlier that the unknown unknowns are the most expensive thing in business right because you don't know what you don't know and so I want to give you a quantifiable example I remember the first time I heard this it changed my life and so it was actually a whiteboard just like this so you get to like I'm getting Goosebumps you'll you'll have the same experience I did so a guy was on stage and gave this whole presentation about about learning skills
(28:13) and about how you have to invest in yourself to get better right and he called somebody in the audience and he said ma'am and as he's saying this he's doing what I'm doing he says ma'am how much money do you make right now per year she stood up and she said fifty thousand dollars a year he was like okay so what would be the the main reason that you wouldn't want to invest today right so he was closing this is actually a close but as a side note I think the reason I like sales so much is because many of the obstacle overcomes that you learn to overcome are actually self [ __ ] and so in a way like learning
(28:43) how to sell other people for me was learning how to sell myself because I had so much head trash of like why I couldn't do things or why it shouldn't start now or why I had to think about or why I needed permission from someone else or why the universe was stacked against me to be successful like these are all things that I had to learn the arguments against to convince myself to do stuff and so he asked the lady he says okay so what would make you not want to invest in this and she says well I don't have the money and he said well it's probably you probably don't
(29:13) have the money because you've been paying a really expensive bill every single year and she's like what do you mean he's like well right now you've been paying 950 000 a year not knowing how to make a million dollars he said this is the cost of your ignorance this is the debt that you carry for the rest of your life until you learn how to make a million dollars and so the reason I'm so heavy on learning skills and becoming educated is that right now I'm paying down ignorance debt I'm tamed down 950 million dollars a year not knowing
(29:54) how to make a billion it's dead I'm paying right like we all paying her instead and so the idea is how quickly can I pay this down so that I can have more cash flow to continue to pay this down faster now strategy like I said earlier is about how you allocate limited resources against unlimited options that's the fancy word of just saying prioritizing all right and so right now you have limited resources you have time and you have money now you might have more time than money but either way you have some limit on what
(30:23) you have and so for you to move faster you have to identify prioritize the thing that you're going to allocate your time and money towards right and you want the thing that gets you the most for it remember the input output that we had over really The Leverage so you want the thing that gives you the most leverage now one of the one of the the tough Parts about reality is that the things that you have access to when you have fewer resources are less than the things you have access to when you have more resources like Mr Panda can go buy
(30:49) a building for a billion dollars and flip it for two billion dollars in a year or two and make a billion dollars because he has more resources than you do and you can't do that right not right now but you do have things that could get you there which is why Charlie Munger talks about how do whatever you can do big borrow steel eat ramen walk with your lunch pail both directions do whatever you have to do to make your first hundred thousand it's because he understands and mind you him saying a hundred thousand is probably like a million dollars today because he
(31:17) knows that once you get that you can actually get a little bit more leverage in terms you get way more for what you put in because you can't only put your time in because it's so limited in terms of how much you can do all right so this is why I talk about having investing in the SME 500 more than the S P 500 so if you don't know this is standard and Poor 500 companies uh on the stock exchange it's probably like the gold standard index that we track how the US economy is doing it's really just the stock market in general is doing all right and so if
(31:46) you dollar cost average in the S P 500 you'd get nine to ten percent a year for for life at least that's what it's done historically all right so the question is rather than investing in this we just have to say can we do anything that gets us more than ten percent back great now we can quantify this and so if I have let's say a thousand dollars right and here's the magic of this is that when you invest a thousand dollars into the s p you have no you have nothing else that you add to that thousand like you can't juice the Thousand you bind the same valuation that every other investor
(32:21) Buys in at and so I'll tell you one of the magic so I'm going to open open up the curtain here for a second one of the magic what we do at acquisition.com is that we pair Capital with know-how and so we can buy a company at a decent valuation and have a big margin of safety because of our skill set so we know that we can triple or 10x the business when we invest in it so we don't have to pick amazingly like Warren Buffett the better picker always will be than I am right at picking businesses but Warren Buffett doesn't work in the business right so that's the advance
(32:50) that's my advantage over Warren Buffett right now mind you he has way more advantages over me I made 90 billion on his Apple trade but but this is the game that I'm supposed to play right now because here's the leverage that I have on him I have 60 more years of life than he does right he's 93 I'm 33.
(33:13) so I have a lot more of these left on my on my move set okay now we have our thousand dollars we get 10 meaning at the end of the year we're at 1100 roughly okay or let's say you buy a sales training course they teach you how to sell and you get implementation from that where they review some of your calls so that you can improve and all of a sudden you take your income from forty thousand a year to 220 000 a year okay what does that mean that means that that thousand think about this return all right in scenario one you have eleven hundred dollars in scenario two and here's the crazy part you have an
(33:48) extra 180 000 all right so compare this to that but here's the crazy part this is every year because once you have the skill you only get better from there and so one of the things my dad used to tell me that um when I was growing up was that he was always really big on education because he came here a thousand dollars didn't speak the language and he learned English like that was a skill he didn't have like we take so many skills for granted like the man didn't he couldn't even speak the language of the country right in a thousand bucks and he was able to take his medical school education and apply
(34:22) it here in the U.S because he fled during the revolution in Iran and he said the one thing that no government can take from you and no wife can steal from you in a divorce and you can't get sued out of is your education they can't take it from you and he had relatives who actually really well off who actually owned the lottery in Iran so he was a private company so they made a lot of money but they were like second third generation and they hadn't learned the skills and so when they fled during the revolution they could only take what they could carry because all of their assets got
(34:56) seized by the government and they never were able to go back to what they had because they didn't have the skills because the government could take their assets but they didn't have the education right and the guys who were who were businessmen from Iran straight to La became businessmen in in LA and crushed it there too because they understood the game right and so this is why like if you think about it from actually an investment perspective like education can't go down it can't be taxed it can't be taken from you and only gets better over time right and it
(35:27) compounds unto itself because when you learn the next skill so let's say this is this is what the lift we got from from sales then you learn lead gen and then all of a sudden this because then you 5x the demand on your sales skills [Applause] and you just paid down your ignorance debt with two Investments and so like is that worth it more than putting the money in the s p in my opinion every [ __ ] time is going from 40 to 220 realistic if you're a killer and you're part of Mosey Nation absolute [ __ ] luly if you do
(36:02) it the way we tell you to do it which is you look at the top guy on whatever company whatever team and you do twice what they do because you know why because they're going to be better than you and so you've got to make up with you got to make it up in inputs it's like but Alex does that mean I'm going to have to work harder in longer hours you bet welcome to the world like because think about it if you work the same hours as that guy that guy always has the advantage because he's already better than you and so if he puts a month in
(36:28) and you put a month and he's gonna get further ahead than you because he already has skills through which to to judge his own performance and improve and so you have to put way more inputs in to get the same output than that guy and so that's why Kobe spent five Summers doing two days when everyone else was doing one a day because he knew he had to make up for the guys who were way better than him naturally and so like I would like to think everybody knows the nation as many black mambas from that perspective is that we're willing to put in twice the work three times to work four times the work despite the natural Talent deficiencies
(36:58) to make up for it because on a five year or a 10 year or 25 year timeline you become unbeatable do I think you can get to 220 hell yeah but if you were to just look at average which I don't want you to be but if you were to look at average you might make a hundred a year or 120 a year it would still triple what you were making before and if you don't adjust your living from what you're making at 40 Mr Smart Cookie then now you have even at 120 if this was 120. you have 80k a year extra that you can then invest in more
(37:32) skills to pay down your ignorance debt a key Point here is I said that there was an advantage that I have for Warren Buffett which is I got money and time slash effort right if you go spend the money but you don't put this in then you lose your advantage and so it's not just about spending the money because here's an interesting fact to it for you when you sell someone you understand that the moment someone buys they actually feel like they've solved the problem emotionally and so you can sell that because you learn how to sell
(38:03) but the reality is that that just gives them the license to begin solving the problem of whatever it is especially if it's a skill or it's education based here's my ask for you guys one of the beliefs that I think has served me well is that whenever I joined a group or I joined a community or a free or paid or otherwise I always want to become number one and the way that I thought about that was and I always wanted to join groups of people who are all ahead of me like when I joined the internet group that I
(38:26) was talking about earlier everybody there was making more money than me how do I get status in this group and the way I did that was like be good you know I mean make more money and so what I did was I talked to every single person in the group and I had only my small skill set and I gave it to them for free and I want to [ __ ] hit on this because I get DMS every day about this guy this morning even said it he said Alex I want to make you a hundred videos for free if you're willing to employ me the amount of times that I get this request whether it's I want to make you this website in exchange for a job the
(39:02) point of mosination the point of everything they do acquisition.com that I hope to live by example is that you give first without asking you're doing it wrong right you think because like in the prayers like hey in the spirit of monster it's like you're not doing in the spirit motivation you're doing the spirit of John are you doing the spirit of you the way that you do it is that you give and then you give and then you give and then you give and you keep on giving until that person is like dude what can
(39:25) I do for you and then you make your ask like whenever I get frustrated and I think like why do I even bother doing this like I think about giving up I just think this is where most people stop and this is why they don't win it transitions into one of my my most used sayings to myself I don't say a lot out loud but to myself it's like I won't do my best I'll do what's required and so right now what is required for you to win or get a job or get the skill might be better than your best and so it just means that your best just needs to get
(39:55) better all right so you might be riled up and be like I'm gonna go do this and take over the world and make all the money so but you're like [ __ ] I got to pay bills so how do we take this and then put it into reality number one is like and this is how you transfer any skills in general by the way a little sneak peek from the book that's coming up all right coming soon is it you have the person who's teaching you documents the skill that's step one step two is that they do it in front of you so they demonstrate it and the third piece is duplicate you do it in front of them so
(40:29) document demonstrate duplicate now I can do this and I can do this but you have to do this I can't duplicate it for you you have to take the stuff and actually execute on it and so if you're like okay Alex what does that actually look like in my life I'm actually a big big proponent of having jobs and I think that's probably taboo nowadays but uh yeah why not get paid to learn [ __ ] and if you're like well the place that I work at doesn't teach me anything then you should absolutely go apply for other jobs like change your conditions all right so
(41:05) I'm all about get paid to learn and as an aside the reason that keeping your living expenses low is so important is because if let's say you make a hundred thousand dollars a year now you're like Alex I got a pretty good white collar job right now but I really want to get into this then it might mean that you have to go from a hundred thousand dollars a year to thirty thousand dollars a year to learn the skill because right now you go from earning to learning all right and like I want to I want to tell you like I walk this walk so I was a Management Consultant at a boutique strategy firm
(41:35) in DC like we did like I had a top secret clearance I was 20 like I did I did [ __ ] that people could brag about all right and then I went and became a personal trainer at a gym for 14 an hour think about that I went from a high-rise condo that I owned to renting someone's bedroom for 400 a month in their house all right and I went from having you know Hugo Boss suits to wearing beast mode engaged t-shirts all right and showing up at 4am like ready to teach Nancy how to lose the last five you know what I mean and so like I had to swallow my pride on this
(42:09) because I wanted to I wanted to get learned all right and so you have to be willing to relinquish getting paid for getting learned all right once you get yourself in an environment where you actually have a business that is investing in you and it doesn't mean that they actually have to write checks to be clear now if you have a company that's willing to do that awesome level one is you communicate to them this is the skill that I would like to learn upon working for you and so you're like these are the skills that I bring to the table this is what I would like to learn is this a place that I can do that any business owner loves clear
(42:46) communication it's like if you want to learn that and if they're a good business owner they'll be like let me help you support now if they're like my job isn't to teach you wrong place and I'll be real a lot of business owners are like that and so if you're like well how man it's not fair it's like well I mean getting paid to learn is a pretty good deal it's just that that's not always what happens and so I would say switch your conditions but let's say you finally get into a business that teaches you stuff and you feel like you're getting better you're moving faster I'd
(43:10) say once you feel like and this is a big caveat this is like [ __ ] caveat once you have nothing left to learn from the current position you communicate to them that you feel like you're learning is slowed down and then they may give you another opportunity to learn more and if they feel like they can't actually teach you internally they might say I'll pay ten thousand dollars a year for you to go through these programs or workshops or seminars or whatever so you can wear certifications so you can continue to level up your skill a good employer will
(43:39) do that and if you look at big Corporate America as much people should own them they usually have pretty strong corporate reinvestment programs like they why because they want their their human capital to appreciate and so if you can pay ten thousand dollars because they do the same SME 500 except the snu 500 right they invest in you ten thousand dollars and they get a three times more valuable person like one of the biggest Arbitrage opportunities I know this is me talking to business owners that's out there in the marketplace is that you can pay 25 more for an a player versus a b player and
(44:07) you get five times the output so like you think about value Arbitrage like instead of paying 100 a year if that's the market pay 125 and get five times the output why would you never make that trade once you've done this here are the three steps that you can transition from getting learned back to getting paid all right number one is that you live below your needs the less risk you take in your personal life the more risks you take in your business life let's say that I own a business that does 10 million dollars a
(44:32) year in profit okay if my living expenses are eight hundred thousand dollars a month then I'm not leaving much for the business to weather a storm and let's say that it's all fixed it's like mortgages and cars and jets and all the other stuff that I do well if there's a hiccup the business might go under but if I live on 400 000 a year then I have 9.
(44:56) 6 million every year that I can go on the offensive and I can take huge swings I can be like I want to buy this company even though it's risky but it might 10x right and that offense is what you have to do as an entrepreneur because you have to take calculated risk but you don't want to introduce multiple risks if you can control it and this is controllable risk okay so you live below your mean so you can stack cash okay level two is that you take this cash and I want to be clear I'm actually kind of against side hustles as a long-term thing I'm Pro them as a way to transition again this is how I play the
(45:26) game I'm a maximizer like I want to win big and so I think if you follow my stuff that you probably wouldn't win big too and so if you're doing a side hustle it's because you want it to eventually become your main hustle not because you're just looking for side income I'm just not that guy there's other guys who will talk about that it's just not me all right and so you stack the cash you can start your side hustle and you keep doing this until you have uh matched your income so you start your side hustle and you keep doing it until you match your current income and if you're like wait a second for me
(45:55) to match my current income I'm gonna have to work 40 hours a week in my job and then work another 40 hours a week at this thing yep and the thing is and this is just you know one man's caveat there's many different different takes on this if you're not making more money on 40 hours a week of the new thing you're still not doing it right remember I went from employed to self-employed you have a level of Leverage so those 40 hours you have more leverage than the 40 hours that you're working for someone
(46:18) else and if you're not making more there then you're like you still need to keep doing it until you've matched at least at least matched your income and then once you've matched the income I would say sustain it for six months two reasons one is because now you're going to be making double time you're gonna be making money on the job you're gonna be making up money on earnings you're going to be doubling your actual income which means you might be like three or four x in your savings and the second is so that you don't just quit on the one good month you had because you sent out three
(46:40) clients okay we want to make sure that it's not seasonal we want to make sure that we can like it's not just normal volatility because really small businesses super volatile right if you're selling two customers a month if all of a sudden you sell zero your income goes to zero right unless you retain the people et cetera et cetera and then cut bait cut the cord and go out on your own spread those wings get a beautiful butterfly and a lot of people look at this thing the side hustle and they're like but this isn't Facebook like this isn't sure it's not but I think a lot of
(47:10) people put undue pressure on themselves by expecting their next thing to be a trillion dollar company and the likely that it happens super super super super super super small but again it's like what are your goals if your goals are just like get out of poverty get above the middle class get above get into the upper class like a lot of businesses can get you there if you want to be a trillionaire there's only a few and also what we don't see is the zillions of not zuckerbergs who put everything into their social media thing and it didn't work I'm a big fan of service businesses
(47:39) because it costs you nothing to start it's just your time you have no overhead in the beginning those ones are harder to scale but you'll usually learn a lot of other skills during that part like I learned more from running a gym that allowed me to do gym launch like if I hadn't run the gyms I don't think I would have been able to do gym launch and so think of whatever this is is as the stepping stone and again we're still trying to get learned like that doesn't change we're just going to also get paid as we do it and that's one of the beautiful things about entrepreneurship
(48:04) is that like once you get past a certain level you get to get paid to learn more and I think that's like for me why I love the game so much is that you just keep getting better and get paid to get better don't judge yourself on the side hustle and especially don't listen to other people's judgment on your side hustle you many people like I was like Vanderbilt magna [ __ ] laude you know white collar consultant job like head up above Harvard you know GMAT score say like and you want to become a trainer like the amount of people that like I used to compete against Frenemies whatever you want to call it they were
(48:33) like oh great he's he's out of the race you know what I mean like he's he's doing stuff to make himself happy right you know I was younger and I probably had more [ __ ] up [ __ ] in my head than I do now but like I used to just think about them all the time when I'd be sleeping on the floor and I'd be selling I was like they're not willing to do this they're not willing to do this they're not willing to do this and then you come from behind right and you do Kobe and you work twice a day and while they're working their job and they have their 3 Series BMW and they're you know going out to dinner and they have the the football on the
(48:58) weekends in their fantasy league and you have none of that just know that you're doing your two days during the summer or your three days during the summer but because your rate of input is so much higher than theirs is you will catch up and you will surpass them and that's if you want to compare and the main reason I don't think you should judge yourself on whatever you do is because in my opinion like I'm married to the game right more than anything like I'm going to keep playing the game because I love the game and so if you want to play the game a long time
(49:27) then it's the game itself that you want to stick with rather than the vehicle you're in right most entrepreneurs start more than one business over their career you are above the business the problem is that people identify so closely like their identity is their business but you have to just think about it and this is me just trying to give you like a you know Big Brother what do you want to call it piece of advice but like the further you can separate your identity and your self-worth from the worth of the business the better off you'll be as an entrepreneur because you also start
(49:54) to see as an asset that can be sold can create value in the asset you can make hard decisions whereas if it's you you're like what will people think it's like I made a decision about a business that I own that's okay Simon to neck is a great piece on this but when I learned the difference between infinite and finite games it really changed my perspective the infinite frame will always beat the finite frame and there are finite games within every infinite game and so you have quarters you have years you have goals these are all fine games that we
(50:19) play in an infinite game and so when the US invaded Vietnam we lost why did we lose we lost a war of attrition which was that they were willing to play the game longer than we were all right and so the difference between a finite infinite game is that a finite game has known players agreed upon rules and an outcome and an end that's why it's finite an infant game has known and unknown players has no agreed-upon rules and the point of the game is to keep the game going and so the problem that most entrepreneurs have is they approach an infinite game with a finite frame they are the United States trying to invade
(50:56) Vietnam and you will lose every time because there will be players who are playing with an infinite frame and so let me give you two more examples of this if you want to get healthy right you don't win at Health there's no end goal to being held you're like okay I'm done working out I did it I've achieved it right of course not right same thing with marriage right like you're not the point isn't to uh get married the point is to stay married the point is to stay in the game to keep the game going most of the game's worth playing are infinite games not finite games which means the
(51:25) point is to just play and so business you don't win the point isn't to finish because even if you're trying to say Finish First it's like by what metric on what time period is there anyone who's been the richest man in the world for all time no of course not which means that anybody who would try to do that is is coming from a finite frame and so but there have been people who've won the game of business in my perspective because they played their whole lives if you want to be a stronger player and be somebody who can succeed as an entrepreneur then the day you start playing is the day you win and the
(52:02) day you stop playing is the day you lose and so the goal is to find games that you don't want to quit that's where learning what you are into from executing is the the mega win here so for me I found out that I actually liked business more than I liked Fitness which was crazy because I loved Fitness getting into fitness but like the day I started my gym was the day my love for business outpace my love for Fitness I was like this is amazing this is so cool and so you have to find whatever that thing is and I'll be clear like business
(52:33) sucks all the time but it's just that if you're willing to play and like there's plenty of times marriage sucks there's plenty of time you don't want to work out but it doesn't mean that I'm going to stop working out doesn't mean I'm going to stop being married doesn't mean I'm gonna stop being in business and so I think if you can unlock that frame that you want to play until the day you die even if the vehicle changes even the players that you're playing with on the court change then you'll be the guy who stays on the court the longest you might think oh I don't like video editing or oh I don't
(53:00) like you know dry cleaning or I don't like mowing lawns I don't like washing cars or whatever it is right but the higher up you get in business the more all businesses are the same right you're going to have marketing you're gonna have sales you're going to have product you're gonna have customer success or customer support you're gonna have it you're gonna have Finance you're gonna have legal like all these departments are gonna these functions will more or less exist in every business and so my advice is like a lot of people
(53:25) quit Industries when they really actually just quit a function of a job and so like they're like oh entertainment wasn't for me it's like do you know how many jobs there are in entertainment like you might love sales like sales in entertainment and you were in enter the actual like product side right or the production side or the support side and so again remember I said earlier that like if you stay in the same game longer you'll you'll be likely to get more reps in and you'll do better well then maybe stay in the same
(53:51) industry but switch roles now in a micro business like your side hustle you'll get to taste all the roles and you'll find out the things that you like more and that's where you can shift some of your attention there and then you backfill people who are because you have a little bit of context good enough to do what you do better you demonstrate sorry you document you demonstrate you duplicate they duplicate and then they run with it right and so today for example my what I do looks very different than what I did 10 years ago right like what I did 10 years ago was the highest value skill I had done which was just closing that's all I did
(54:22) I had consults all day because I got trainers to train for me I knew how to run the ads and that didn't take me that long took me two three hours a week to run the ads make make them and manage them the rest of my time was sitting in appointments and closing and I had somebody else make the phone calls and text for me so I would just sit there and close because that was the highest value thing I could do at the time but the thing is is that your Baseline skill will continue to level up if I lost everything then like if I lost everything I knew that I would sell cars during the day and I would strip at night right once I had that skill before
(54:50) I had the skill of sales I would drive Uber during the day and strip at night because I had the skill be in shape right and so your Baseline continues to grow like being the best car sales when you make 400 500 maybe even a million a year at some of the best dealerships like if you're an absolute Savage and I would consider myself an absolute Savage if I was going to do that right if I lost it all I'd be there 12 hours a day for sure and then once I learned how to Market marketing and sales together my new minimum was a million bucks a year because I knew that I could sit in front of any brick and mortar business and I
(55:17) could get him leads and I could close them once you have that you can make a million two million three like I can't go below that because I have skills that are above that right you keep learning these skills as you keep doing your business and you might you'll start ping-ponging in different directions until you hone in on the things that you're best at and so I think if you can find that game make it the metascale of continuing to learn then you won't stop and then at that point it means you win by default so we talked about a lot of stuff right but the question is like what's the next
(55:44) thing you're going to do and so I'm just going to give you advice that I followed which is like what was the first thing I did to get myself out of this million dollar or below million dollar category to the above million dollar category and then to eventually the point four percent 10 million category and it was actually just learning how to sell because if you can't sell anything you can't make money it's the first part of the equation number of sales times if you have no sales doesn't matter how good the lifetime values if no one buys it zero so I have what we call the best
(56:10) sales training on the Internet it's a long keynote that I did that people really dig and I think you'll hopefully like it and get as much from it as it took me years to consolidate it for you it's a good bargain on your time to get 10 years of sales training into an hour so enjoy

Transcript:
(00:00) you guys want to hear something absolutely insane I made more in a year than the CEOs of McDonald's Ford Motorola Yahoo and Ikea combined as a kid in my 20s believe me no one was more surprised than me and so I'm going to show you how to make money so fast it feels illegal the first way to make money so fast it feels illegal is to understand value creation I want to tell you a story I sent my father a picture of our largest annual event that we held in our company which licensed to gym owners um we had a room of 700 plus people and he said oh that's awesome
(00:38) that's so many people uh how much did they pay to be there and I said $42,000 a year and he said oh my God he said do they know that they're paying that much and I was like yeah they're aware it's not like I'm magically siphoning money from their accounts and um it was like okay uh now rather than respond and be like really you know mean about it I was like well let's walk through this I said if you were able to pay a dollar and get $5 back would you do it and he's like well it would depend I said it would depend on what he said well what's the what's the likelihood that the five to
(01:13) one actually happens I said that's just the average so some people are below average some people are about aage he like okay that feels like a fair bet well what would I need to do I was like great question you'd have to dedicate probably 10 plus hours a week to fully kind of implementing a new model within your business he was like okay how long would it take between when I started and when I got those types of results and I said about a year he was like okay well then yeah I think I would do it and so that thought process was kind of the first big unlock to making
(01:46) so much money that it should feel illegal which is that you can't sell out of your wallet you have to sell off of the value that you're creating for someone else we were able to charge significantly more and profit significantly more than everybody else in my space and so everyone else in my space was charging literally a tenth of what I was able to charge or I prefer to say command from the marketplace and the reason that was able to happen was because I Ed something called the value equation all right and so the value equation has four components and I'm not
(02:17) going to go super deep on it but I'll just walk you through it real quick so you've got the dream outcome which is what's the big thing that people want so in this instance it'd be they want to make more money in their gym they might want to lose weight they might want to have a fixed their relationship they might want to look cool in front of their friends whatever the next is the perceived likelihood of achievement or the equal opposite of that is risk How likely is it that when I buy this thing I get what I want which
(02:41) when he asked the question well How likely is it this is what he's teasing out the next question is time how long is it going to take between when I start and when I get and the longer that is the less valuable the thing is and then you have effort and sacrifice which is how hard am I going to have to try what am I going to have to start doing that I don't want to do or stop doing that I do want to do to be clear the reason that I I made this value equation is because for so long many people and you probably heard them in conent are like provide value create value but I was like what
(03:13) does this even mean how does one create value and so I set out to try and figure out what makes me want to buy stuff and so in a hypothetical example you'd want something that would be immediate it would be no effort it would be guaranteed and it would be exactly what they want the way they want it that would be the most valuable version of whatever you could sell and then you would say let's say that our average is $100,000 of value all right now in a B2B setting it might literally be that because it's a monetary outcome and if it's a B to C setting selling to Consumers then we have to abstract the
(03:44) value of what fitting back into your high school GS is worth to you or looking good on prom night or just feeling good every single day whatever but we have this Roi uh and then we have some sort of discount that we're going to apply to it which accommodates risk right one is it's in the future I would pay less for something that is uh that is guaranteed and immediate then not guaranteed and at a delay so let's say I sell tables right so this is a retail product and you get you would immediately think oh this is probably highly commoditized well I'm not so sure think about it on the lowest end you can
(04:18) buy a foldout plastic table from uh Lowe's or Home Depot for probably 50 or 100 bucks I haven't checked plastic table pricing recently on the flip side you can buy a $20,000 handcarved wood table both of them allow you to put stuff on top of it and eat right and so the idea is how can we position our thing separately from other people now if the dream outcome for that table is not okay I just need to have something that I could put stuff on top of the dream outcome might be when people walk into my home they feel immediately impressed so now we're
(04:52) actually relating this to status so this is a business because B2B is actually pretty easy it's just this is how much money it is and then the rest of your time is trying to make it easier for them less risky um and faster business consumer sometimes you need to spend a little bit more time on translating what this status increase might mean for them and how meaningful that is or the reverse how terrible and painful it's been to lack this status right and so if we have this big expensive nice table
(05:16) then we say okay here's the status now the risk of this not happening this is where we might show trends of this being a hot thing that many people understand the value of so the risk of them not getting the status is lowered the time is like hey I can have this at your house by the end of today that would be something like wow this could happen right in time for this dinner party I have or my boss is coming to my house and then effort and sacrifices don't worry we have a white glove service that we'll make sure that we can fit it into your doorways even though it's this massive thing and we will assemble it there for you you just need to say yes
(05:45) right now and it will be there by the end of the night and you can have dinner on it when you have your guest tomorrow right now we've tied them buying to all of the value components to getting them to then be willing to spend $20,000 because it's not about the wood it's not about the table it's about how much status is worth to them within this context and they get to keep it forever right and so this is how we have to unpack what we're selling so that many of you are selling tables and pricing like it's a plastic table but you're then trying to half do the work but then you can't make the margins work with the white glove because people say I only
(06:18) want to pay $100 like well I would deliver it and they're like oh I have to assemble this too and all of a sudden they're they're combating you when if you just had charged more and positioned it differently you could then give them all these other things that they want anyway and the reason this is so important is that price is the single largest lever on profit so let's say we've got a before all right which is that you sell your tables all right and you've got an after this obviously works for services or whatever else you sell all right and so let's say you charge
(06:42) $100 for your table and your cost uh for that table is uh is I'll be extreme here we'll say it's $50 okay now let's say that you have other costs like marketing and sales and other stuff like that that amounts to $30 all right so that means that your net profit is going to be 20 bucks when you sell a table gross profit is 50 net profits 20 okay now let's say that we reposition our table as this amazingly valuable thing that is now a $1,000 table okay now our cost on this the table itself might be 50 but let's say we include some of those perks let's say we've got the hand delivery uh and
(07:19) things like that okay well let's say that the delivery is going to be another $200 uh for one of your guys to go out there uh and and use the truck gas whatever so now we got $250 here okay okay got it and then the other costs maybe maybe your cost of uh sales goes up a little bit to sell this you got to get more leads okay so we'll call it 130 all right so now what are we actually making in net profit for this table so we got 3 380 okay I wish I had done easier math but I think it's 620 here all right so $620 in profit and so this
(07:51) is how you can get unreasonably wealthy in a very short period of time by simply repositioning what you sell based on the value provide someone else rather than the cost that it costs you and so to put this in context this is a 31x increase in profit and so I I'll tell you this quick story there was a guy that was in the same exact space as me that paid me for a Consulting day years ago and when I looked at his numbers what was fascinating was that he was actually selling the same amount of people per month as I was and so he was spending the same amount of marketing he was had
(08:22) the same number of sales guys and he was closing roughly the same amount as we were and so what what was interesting about this and this was a massive lesson that I learned is that CAC or the cost of getting a new customer in an industry as long as you're proficient at marketing more or less is actually not that different um that you'd be surprised I look at a zillion companies every year and between Industries like a local plumber and another local plumber it's not going to be that different and so the big difference though is that we were able to make somewhere in the neighborhood of about eight times uh
(08:52) more money per customer than this guy was but here's the crazy part we were making somewhere near of 50 times more profit and it's because of this so we had eight times more money but then it resulted in so remember this is just this is a 10x right so this is a 10x increase in price but it resulted in a 31x increase in profit and so this is why price is such a strong lever on how much you make now where it gets competitive is if somebody else can do something just like you and do it for less but there was a I think a Mackenzie
(09:22) survey where they looked at uh a number of companies and 85% of them competed on price and only 1% of them won on price so it's literally the worst possible strategy you can have because there's only one person who wins lowest price Dan Kennedy said this famously there's no reward you get for being the second cheapest competitor you just lose a lot of money right and so there is however a benefit to being the most expensive person and that's going to be a direct correlation to the amount of value that
(09:54) you can provide any individual person and so again it's about thinking how much is this worth and then can I deliver it to them and can I eliminate the risk make it faster and make it easier for them so that I can get less discount on the value that I think it can provide that person now the 2011 version of this is selling out of their future Wallet not today's wallet and then the ways that we pull apart that value so let's say it's a $100,000 of value there's going to be a discount that's going to be apply to that
(10:24) $100,000 based on How likely it is which is the risk it's going to be based on how long it's going to take which is the time it's going to be how how easy it is how much work they're going to have to put in and then fundamentally the dream outcome which if they want to make more money that one's clear now if you have a b Toc business a business consumer business then you have to translate what looking amazing On Prom Night means to someone financially or how much pain they've been in for not having the
(10:50) specific solution in their life and so if I buy stuff and it gets to me faster I'm willing to pay more for it if someone I buy stuff and they guarantee it or they make it risk-free or they show me tons of proof I'm more likely to pay for it and pay more for it if someone says oh you don't have to do anything versus you have a ton of work associated with it I'm more willing to pay for it and then the dream outcome is just making sure that I actually want this thing versus something else and so this actually operationalizes what we
(11:14) can do as business owners how do we make it faster how do we make it easier how do we make it risk-free and deliver it the way they want it so that was the first of the three kind of beliefs that I had to break in order to make crazy money in my 20s the second way to make money so fast it feels illegal is to sell in a fast cash conversion cycle if you don't know what that is I'll explain it right now this is what allowed me to have $1,000 in my bank account in December of 2016 I had a th000 bucks in my bank account after losing everything for the
(11:43) second time uh actually that was the first time I lost everything and then I lost everything again I think three months later so just figuratively imagine I didn't have a lot of money now 10 months later I was able to put in $10 million in sales and bake I think something probably close to Six Million in profit all right now here's the crazy part is that how can you get this to equate to $10 million in such a short period of time well the first thing is we got 100 to1 return on our advertising and so every
(12:15) dollar that I put in so I put I put $1,000 in ads I made $100,000 and then I put that $100,000 into ads and I made 10 million and that is fundamentally what happened and so the constraint of the business no longer was acquisition but the reason that was not the constraint meaning it wasn't the thing that blocked me from growing was that we had figured out something that I call client finan acquisition which is just a fancy way of saying using your customers money as a loan to get more customers so let me explain so if someone walks into your business right today and let's say it
(12:47) cost you $100 in marketing to get them to buy something from you all right just keep it really simple so it cost me $100 to get this guy now let's say that my thing costs $100 okay now you think oh I grw even but that thing just like the table is not going to be 100% margin not likely and so if it's like the table then I only make plus 50 on this but I minus 100 because I had to pay this 100 to get them in the door so I'm actually 50 right now for my first transaction now should I do this transaction um unless I
(13:18) have something else to sell not really because it means I'm spending 100 to make 50 bad deal now if this person's going to spend three or four more times over the next however many months then yeah it's a good idea but it's still going to take me time and I'm still going to to lose money up front now for me to do this whole thing I got to do it a different way and so this kind of enters the new way of doing things which is I would acquire the customer for $100 same guy right now he's smaller for whatever reason um and this time I say
(13:45) okay how can I get this guy to not only pay for himself that's point one that's breaking EV on getting customers but point two is I need to get him to be able to buy me my next customer and so if I know my next customer is also going to be $100 then it means I want him to pay himself back so I need 100 all right then I need my next customer so I need another 100 and then I need to make sure I get my my cost of my table back which is 50 all right so I need to make $250 uh on this transaction for me to
(14:15) then be able to use this dollars to then go get my next customer and then I repeat this process over and over and over again and then that result in this massive amount of money because if you had a machine that for every dollar you put into it you got a $100 back out what would your marketing budget be it would be everything you had and so here's the crazy part is that this these types of returns pretty much only exist in businesses like this type of Arbitrage which is why if you look at the wealthiest people in the world they own assets they own businesses that
(14:55) generate cash flow because the most significant Arbitrage that exists is what it cost to get somebody to buy something from you and if you have a well-designed business how much you can make from that person and so think about this as every business is a little mini investing machine and so you pay X to get customers uh you get y dollars back and then instead of waiting a year for 10% improvements on the S&P 500 you can wait one day and get a $100 back and so why would you invest in anything else well the richest people in the world don't they're highly concentrated in the
(15:27) businesses and industries that they understand well and so this concept of clent finest acquisition was the big unlock that I had and I have in four times in my life have I gone through what I would consider a wealth warp where I had a material change in my net worth in a very short period of time and most of the money that I've made has been in short periods of time and then followed by kind of like level sets for a while then I figure out something else and then I get a huge step up in income so if you're you're like man we've been stuck for a while you're usually just
(15:56) this far away from figure out what that constraint is now it could have been capital so for me I didn't have any money and so this solved my Capital constraint now what did did not solve it didn't solve my people constraint it didn't solve my you know hiring didn't solve didn't solve uh didn't solve you know keyman R I didn't solve any of those problems but it gave me enough cash to be able to solve those problems in the future so let me put this in perspective for you my weight loss business which was my my actual gyms
(16:21) which are called United Fitness all right United Fitness I was able to open up a new location every 6 months off of the cash flow no money out of pocket using this exact same process and so I would put $5,000 down I would sign a lease I would begin spending money on Advertising like $100 a day and for every $100 that I would spend I would get somewhere in the neighborhood of $2500 to $3,000 back immediately and so in the first week I would then order the equipment and the next week I would order the flooring and the next week I would set up the lobby and get the
(16:51) painting done and by the fourth week IID made around $100,000 which is roughly what it cost to open the business and give me six weeks of payroll so that by the end of the promotion that I was selling which was a six week challenge at the time I would have something they have 20 or $30,000 of recurring Revenue at that gym but it cost me almost no money out of pocket because I let my customers pay for my gym for me I would say I will spend $5 a lead close one out of five leads on a $500 thing and so I would pay 25 bucks to get a customer and make 500 back and then I would take the
(17:23) rest of that to go get another 25 spend another $25 to get another customer get another 500 and then that's how I was able to to finance the growth of the gyms and that's how at 23 years old and then 24 and then 25 it was six locations and again the constraint was no longer cash it was trainers it was managers it was salespeople that's what limited my growth this was the first time I discovered this concept and then I was like oh man I should do this again and so then I started gym launch 1.0 which is where I flew out from location to location and I would make $100,000 at
(17:54) the gym but then I didn't have to pay for the buildout and I didn't have to manage the gym afterward so I could just take $100,000 it was just me with a little fold out table probably $100 from lows um and then just a stack of contracts and I have videos of me going through just random places and selling all day every day for 21 days straight and then eventually I taught that system to other people but the average amount that I'd spend in advertising in those markets was somewhere there of like1 to
(18:19) $5,000 and I would make upwards of $100,000 in that first month and so this is what allowed me to go from again zero to doing 32 plus launches in like 18ish months now the third time that this wealth Alchemy occurred for me was when gym launch transitioned to licensing now in the licensing business this is when things got even Wilder because I had fewer operational constraints to scale and so here I had to keep scaling more and more sales guys because I had to fly them out which was actually a tough value proposition for them they
(18:48) apparently had wife and kids that wanted to see them go figure um and so when I switched to licensing which was just showing people how I was filling these gyms that's where we went from the0 to $10 million in sales in 10 months all right that's what's that's almost crazier in my opinion than the second the second full year of business we did we did around 16 million in iida all right that means profit all right and we did 26 million TopLine in revenue and again this is coming from somebody who had then lost it all because I have made some bad bets
(19:19) in my life and you're like okay well it must have only been a fluke that time well the next business I started was Prestige Labs which is our supplement company when from zero 1.7 million per month this was at the launch this was month one all right and then I had Allen which Allen went from zero to 1.
(19:41) 7 million per month weirdly that it was the same number um in six months so these types of numbers only can occur when you remove capital or money as a way of scaling as a thing that blocks you if you had unlimited money which if you set up the way that you acquire customers correctly you can if you think this video helped you make more money or would help someone else make more money it would mean the world to me if you shared it as a DM or send it to them as a text so they could watch it and get the benefits too and Associate those benefits with you so what you really want that math to work out to is that you want two times
(20:13) CAC plus cogs to equal 30-day cash collected all right uh which is basically gross profit so you're like okay that sounds like a really complex equation I'll say it in in plain English you want to make two times as much as it cost you to get a customer and deliver on that customer within 30 days based on the amount of cash that you generate from them in excess of the cogs right and so if we have let's say $100 remember to get the customer and then $50 of cogs right then we want to make sure that we can have $300 I actually
(20:52) did the math wrong before this is why equations are useful right we want to make sure we make $300 on that first customer so that in the the first 30 days and you're like why is he thinking about 30 days the reason I'm so obsessive about 30 days is because that is the amount of time that anybody can get interest rate free cash and so everybody has access to a credit card and it doesn't matter what your limit is even if it's a $500 limit that you start out with which is typically what they'll start most people on a $500 limit guess
(21:18) what you can do you pay it off tomorrow and so if you can get it within that period of time you'll only be limited by that card now if you can do it in seven days then you can repeat the cycle uh four times in a month if you can do it every day then you repeat it 30 times in a month right and so very quickly based on your speed of collecting the cash back which is called the cash conversion cycle you can accelerate your growth I honestly think the reason that most businesses don't do this is because they believe a narrative that because other people in the industry don't do it they
(21:45) can't and I think that that belief keeps many business owners poor the amount of businesses that I've we've gone into and been like uh okay well let's just get people to prepay 3 months at a time they're like no we it's industry standard to to do services and then collect a net net 60 and I'm like yeah well that's their standard we don't have to do that well why don't we just give them incentive to pay and they're like w well what if what I'm like what if what what if they say no well they say they're saying no today sometimes too might as well like collect more when we do it and then we say hey we we happen
(22:16) to build quarterly and with that convenience we also give you a 5% discount which of course we baked into the price anyways right or we add some sort of onboarding process that normally people might charge separately for or that we add in so that we can collect more cash up front and I'm willing to give a significant amount of things up front so that I don't have my cost of getting customers as anything that gets in the way of me growing a business I never want my ability to get customers or money to get them to be the thing that limits my growth and I think that's the reason that all these businesses that I just
(22:45) explained went from zero to million plus per month within a year and I'm saying within a year as a sof most of them within 6 months if you want to make more money ask to get paid sooner so think about this so if you if you are uh a minimum wage employee right then you do work and then you get paid afterwards at a delay right now if you're a contractor sometimes uh you can do work and get paid but usually you get paid and then you do work if you're a surgeon you get paid and then months pass and then you do the surgery if you're an insurance company you get paid and then you may
(23:20) not have to ever work at all and if you're the church you get paid off of someone's income their Topline a royalty that goes straight to the church now royalties happen the same way leans do so if you if someone owes you money you can take a lean off the top you skim off the top and so basically your position in What's called the capital stack is predicated on your leverage in the situation and so if it's up to you you might as well choose to get paid sooner now you might be looking at this and thinking yeah but how do I get all of that cash up front how do I get people
(23:54) to actually spend more money with me faster well it comes down to one you can either raise the price of your thing or two you get people to buy more stuff immediately and so one of the big misconception business owners have is that they're afraid of making offers and so I want to be very clear you don't want to try and force someone to do something people don't like to be sold but they do love buying right I mean think about how much money Amazon makes people love buying and so what we want to do is make offers when it's convenient for them to take them and so an offer only doesn't work if it's
(24:24) something that they don't want or you present it at the wrong time or you know advanced verion 3 they don't it's not being delivered in the way they want it to be delivered all right and I'll tell you a quick story about that so when I was in the in the weight loss business we discovered that there were some customers that would come in and they didn't want to buy gym services and I was like okay well that's lame but I then figured out hey why don't I in invite them to a nutrition seminar and so we invite them to nutrition seminar even though they said no to our services
(24:49) think how crazy this is they come in virgy we try to sell them they say no I say hey can I just help you with your food and they say sure then they go to the nutrition seminar and they buy more than the people who bought gym services on average and so I was like oh we just needed to make them a different offer to solve the same problem so they wanted to lose weight still they just didn't feel like sweating they wanted to take supplements and eat differently fine so learning to make multiple offers to a
(25:16) customer is not only beneficial for them because you help them solve the problem in more ways it's also beneficial for you because you get more cash up front and so thinking through how do I get someone to buy because there's something that people enter called a hyper buying cycle so if someone makes any kind of new decision especially if it's like okay I'm now somebody who's going to start taking care of their lawn hey I'm I just bought this new car hey I I'm going to run a marathon there's these little cycles that people enter there's these buying windows and what a traditional business owner would say
(25:44) let's say somebody who runs a marathon they they sign up for the marathon and then they go to The Running Store when they go to The Running Store they have to buy some shoes now the store owner says oh I don't want to offer them you know fancy socks or an i iPod wristband or new tank tops I don't want I don't want to seem like I'm being pushy but what are they going to do they're still going to go buy that stuff because they have to get the whole thing and so there's this natural problem solution cycle that continues over and over and
(26:09) over again within every customer's purchases provided the first problem is solved with the first purchase and then that then opens up the next problem so once you have your shoes what else do you need you're going to need socks once you have socks what else you're going to need you're going to need shorts once you have shorts what else you going need you need tank top that doesn't you know rub on your on your your underarms you're also going to need an iPod carrier all of these different things you're also going to want the number thing you might want a coach you might
(26:34) want an app you might want a hydration thing like there's there's supplements there's all these different things that stem from this and everyone's afraid to ask so just make the offer available and if they choose not no worries if you're like if you go buy something and then the thank you page says hey would you want this too if you're offended by that well the business doesn't really care I put it that way because other people won't be offended by it and will be happy that you made it available and more can convenient for them so
(26:59) ultimately you're providing more value and you're getting rewarded for it yeah and and at each one of these uh upsells that you might want to include you still think through each of the value equation components so you still think what's the dream outcome they ultimately want how do I make it risk-free for them how do I do it faster and how do I make it easier so number one we're charging as much as we possibly can because we're doing it based on value not based on cost the second thing we're doing is we're structuring our economics of the
(27:22) business how we upsell how we down sell so we can generate more cash in the first 30 days so that we can get enough to pay for this customer and the next customer and delivering for both of them in that same time period so that cash and getting customers is not limited the business and the third way to make money so fast it feels illegal is to understand wealth Alchemy and ignore taxes or kind of just play the game the right way so let me walk you through an example so let's say that you give away free trials of your thing okay cool makes sense we give away free trials and let's say a free trial of your thing
(27:53) cost $100 to get someone to start fine now let's also for simple math say the trial is $100 per month all right we'll keep this really simple all right that's the price that's our free trial after the conversion okay now let's say that we get uh one out of uh three people who start a free trial to become a customer okay that means that it's going to cost us $300 right this times three to get a customer okay now let's say that we know one out of three customers becomes a permanent customer meaning once they get
(28:30) on our subscription they never leave which would mean that our permanent CAC is somewhere close to $900 okay now if our price here is $100 a month then that means that the annual revenue Anor recurring revenue is $1,200 per year okay so we pay $900 to make $1,200 per year Well if you had a stock that you could buy for $900 and then it and then it sent you back $1,200 um within 12 months you probably be like that's a great investment now if it kept doing that you'd be like it's unbelievable investment well let me show
(29:04) you how much more wild this can really get now let's say that we have this let's just say this is a software company all right so if it's a software company let's say that it trades at 10 times Topline which is fairly typical for like a B2B SAS business as long as you have good retention metrics which is why this is so important permanent CAC permanent customer so if we know that then it means that we're actually making $122,000 in Enterprise Value which means how valuable the business is that can create this kind of
(29:31) money now here's where it gets even nastier is that this is tax-free and so you get paid this money but you also get this it's not either or it's an and so when I figured this out I was like oh this is how people just make stupid money really fast and so let's let's work this out okay I want to make $120 million let's say that was my goal okay so $120 million I would have to how many $112,000 customers in terms of Enterprise Value would I need well let's go look all right so I need 10,000 customers of this of this $900 times
(30:21) 10,000 to get my $120 million Enterprise Value here so let me ask you a question does 10,000 time 900 so you're telling me if I pay $9 million I can make this year an increase of a 120 million in asset value taxfree and and make $12 million in Revenue that I add for the 9 million and so walk through this in sequence with me you spend 9 million you get back $12 million in annual revenue and that $12 million of annual revenue is worth1 120 million that you paid zero taxes on that is the game this is the wealth Alchemy this is how it works this is how these software
(31:20) companies that IPO at three billion how in four years it goes from you know nothing right to a multi-billion dollar thing if you look at how much it cost them to get customers you're like like when I understood this I was like oh it's literally just a massive Arbitrage between the permanent cost of acquiring customers relative to the annual value relative to the Enterprise Value multiple and then those three things spit together is what creates this massive discrepancy between what you put in and what you get out which because of
(31:52) my fancy fancy t-shirt here I will show you is the definition of Leverage and so the reason that there are two symbols that are woven into the acquisition. comom logo which is supply and demand and a full Chrome for leverage is that you get more for what you put in and so if you have two businesses right so let's let's let's paint this out let's say we had a different business that we did the same thing but let's say that we actually these types of businesses whatever business it was traded on bottom line and so if the business uh
(32:21) was doing 12 million let's say that it's doing $3 million in profit whatever this new other business is okay it's doing $ million in profit and let's say that we get a uh 7x multiple on the on this uh on this eida which is fancy word for profit which means that we have $21 million now if I paid 9 million for 21 million would I be down for that probably I mean it's still a 2 point something X it's not bad but this is why picking a good opportunity vehicle because in both of these situations you still spent the $900 per customer you
(32:55) still make the $1,200 per year but the big difference was how much is that $1,200 per year worth yeah and so let's dive into this permanent customer concept for a second this concept took me so long to grasp as an entrepreneur what every business owner needs to focus on is how do I not lose customers and the reason for that is that let's compare two businesses all right so let's say you've got business a and business B okay so business a acquires 100 customers your one and loses 100 customers and the next
(33:31) year they double their acquisition they double their marketing and sales they acquire 200 customers and then year three they you know they lose all 200 and then they they they add another 50% acquisition they do 300 customers in year three okay so it's a 300 customer business now Company B sells 100 first year now second year they do aund they keep their first 100 but they don't increase their marketing and sales so now they have 100 from last year plus 100 to this year and then the third year they have 100 from two years ago 100 from one year ago and then 100 this year both of these businesses A and B have
(34:04) 300 customers but which company would you rather own this one absolutely no question so why is that you want time to be on your side not your enemy because time is going to pass no matter what and you want a business where no matter what happens it just keeps growing so you can sell the same amount of customers you could even not sell customers and still make money and so this is a far less risky business and as a result of that if you recall the value equation from earlier an investor is valuing a business fundamentally on the same things which is How likely is this to occur how much effort and sacrifice is
(34:39) this going to take what is the time delay between now and when this becomes this ultimate thing right and so the same process is still done obviously at a slightly more complex scale but when we're thinking about permanent customers this companies is turning customers into permanent customers company a is just a churn Factory they sell something want and people don't like it and they leave which means the only way to grow this business is market and sell more but that is only a oneway road at some point
(35:04) you sell through all the customers within a given base and so it would behoove us to spend more time just figuring out how to not lose people so that 10 years from now what like as we keep going because this this map would continue this guy is going to slow down right it being able to double Marketing sales every single year is tough but just keeping the customers you had for 10 years significantly easier but people don't focus on because it's not as sexy but this is where the real leverage occurs and this is where that wealth alchemy that I was referencing earlier this is how you get stupid RIT and so
(35:36) let me give you a real word example so Starbucks do you want to know what their LTV per customer is $114,000 that's how much they make per customer and that is why Starbucks makes so much money so you think about these like high ticket businesses and stuff that's all around B2B whatever they're making $14,000 per customer from like everyone and so what does it cost to get somebody to to buy a cup of coffee I promise you significantly less than $14,000 and this relates back to my very first point that I was telling you where I had another company that was in the
(36:08) same space as me the cost to get a customer for Starbucks to get somebody buy coffee is probably similar to a Dunkin Donut it's probably similar to another random you know coffee shop down the street the difference is that they had engineered their model such that people wanted to keep coming back that they became recurring or reoccurring customers so the difference there really quickly is recurring means it's a subscription like netflex reoccurring means that you buy on a regular basis so you might buy Coca-Cola for example or
(36:33) whatever one of their products that you like you're probably not on a subscription for it but you buy it when you're out at restaurants or you buy it when you ship it to your house whatever or you just buy Costco when you're there from a distribution center either way you are a reoccur customer for them and so figuring out what is my cost of a permanent customer and all you have to do is figure because a lot of businesses have this is you say okay let's say you're an agency a super high- turn business typically okay there are some
(36:58) customers that have been with you for a long time and we will I will consider somebody who's been with you two plus years as a permanent customer within the context of what we're talking about now you might figure out and this is why this is so important that there it's only one out of every 10 of your customers becomes a permanent customer well then you say okay well how much does it cost to get a customer multiply it by 10 this is actually the recurring base that we're trying to build everyone else is just sifting through the you
(37:22) know the weat from the the the shaft I think is what it's called Uh to get the just get the kernels right the main the main part and if you want to be smarter about it you can say huh well it takes us 10 customers to get these ones but what if these customers look and smell walk and talk a little bit differently than the other nine well I'll bet you if we changed our advertising and attracted only those types of customers we would be able to get a higher hit rate on that so even if our CAC for this specific Avatar doubles but we get it to one out of three it cost us $600 to get a
(37:53) customer rather than $1,000 and we're still winning overall and so so the big picture here is that number one we have to sell off a value we have to use the value equation to make things less risky faster and easier for the customers once we do that we are decoupled from a race to the bottom price War number two once we know what our premium prices we want to pull that cash forward and speed up the cash conversion cycle so that capital or money is not the limiter of the business and so we can get customers
(38:22) on demand and we can do so profitably we're literally getting paid to get new customers they pay us they finance our acquisition which why I call it customer Finance acquisition and then finally we understand the game of wealth Alchemy which is of the customers that we acquire what percentage of them become permanent customers and they become the reoccurring Revenue base within this business and then that reoccurring base is what we are going to be valued on and then what is that value multiple and so then we just look at the Arbitrage between what it costs us to get a permanent customer versus what our
(38:55) Enterprise Value multiple is going to be which is until the day you sell it growing taxfree and so I'll show you one last little hack here that I think is important so let's just say in this business it's in the original vehicle so you can just forget about this little side Stu so it's in the original vehicle and let's say that we've got $3 million in profit for this business it doesn't matter okay so you have three million bucks in profit in this business and let's say that you live in a high tax state and you get tax 50% for tax
(39:21) reasons so you're going to take home $1.5 million after taxes now you're butt hurt about this cuz you're like what the heck government you're taking half of what I made but if you added $12 million to the business and you spent this money to do that what did you really increase well you increased your personal net worth by $120 million and so if you had1 120 million plus the 3 million that you made in cash flow and you only had to pay 1.
(39:54) 5 million on 123 now you're paying I don't know 1 .5% in taxes when I realized this it fundamentally shifted how I played the game I I I I was really obsessed with tax strategy and trying to maximize all these loopholes when the biggest and most obvious one is just build something valuable and as long as you keep building it and you don't want to cash it out all of that growth is taxfree and compounds and the the the clue that I got on this was realizing I was like this is before Elon moved from California so I was like elon's in California I was like Zuckerberg is in California and I looked at the the
(40:33) Forbes list said all these people in the US were in California but I was like but California has the highest taxes how is this possible I was like oh they understand something about wealth creation that I don't understand what is that and that was when I dove deep and understood this level of wealth creation or what I like to call now wealth Alchemy if you like this video you'll love these

Transcript:
(00:00) bring on a pmic I got cash that's how I went bro walk me through how you ended up scaling that if you had advice that you could give 40-year-old Dave what would you tell him I am super thrilled to be here today because uh Dave's a legend and uh I'm going to I'm going to give a little bit of an intro from my perspective um of you this is a little scary um and I I actually wanted to take the first like few minutes to um actually just kind of like hype Dave and I think it's because like on in the marketplace of attention right now I actually still think you're underpriced um I still think that you
(00:42) are underappreciated for the amount of value that you provide to the audience at large and flattery will get you everywhere got me here um but one of the things I wanted to hit on was um like I see and I'm sure you do or your team does like there are a lot of people who take I you know I'll use the term fake gurus but a lot of people who haven't achieved you know a 100th of the level of success that you have that take a lot of shots and at you and you know a lot specifically R your views on debt but sometimes just in general and um you know we have a big belief at at
(01:15) acquisition. comom that the only people ever hate you um are never ahead of you uh and I feel like that's been extremely true and it's been tough for people to be ahead of you in general um but I just want to give context for my audience that number one uh you've been doing this for three decades yeah a little over yeah three decades uh and your overnight uh three decade success yeah for real just in time to get old and what I'm going to be directing the the conversation today around is actually around business stuff so Dave
(01:51) has a zillion things on Personal Finance I mean I think that was the you know the the wedge product that a lot of everything um but because our audience is predom business owners I want to focus on how the actual building of Ramsey Solutions and kind of some of the things that you that you learned along the way some of the big mistakes that you did some things that you'd go back in time and would have done differently um and even as you've kind of scaled the brand so that's kind of the direction okay that work sure okay so um can you
(02:20) give a little bit of background in terms of how uh Ramy Solutions the education business which was the first business correct they've all kind of evolved together okay um how did that come to be and then what was your thinking around the business model at that time and like what has it evolved into well um all of it started uh extremely primitive I mean like 1+ 1 equals two barely you know kind of thing and uh so like for instance we started a I I I went down there as a talk radio show or talk radio station in Nashville
(03:03) at the time that was in chapter 11 bankruptcy and there was a guy doing a bad financial show like a Saturday Night Live skit you know on there I went on as a guest on the bad financial show and I didn't have any books I just went on for fun I was actually promoting a real estate Club I was in and um he said hey I hear you're helping people with your for with foreclosures and helping them stop getting their car repoed or if they're having financial trouble over at your church are you doing that and I said I'm just kind of doing that for fun just to help folk as a Ministry at the church and he goes well if you got any
(03:35) questions about that call up and phone rang and he never got any phone calls he didn't know what to do didn't even know how to put the guy on the air and so um he said hey come back let's do that again cuz the phone never rings and so I went I did it like two times and then he quit and we went down and talked that guy that that was running that station into letting us work for free and so a couple guys me and a couple other guys went on the air uh answering questions uh uh in a really heavy hillbilly twang
(04:03) uh wwtn you're talking Nashville y'all call in I mean it was it was nasty buddy I'm telling you it was nasty and uh but with information was good and the phone rang yeah from the very first day at at about the same time I had finished writing uh on my laptop in my living room uh on the very first version of Windows this is 1992 uh my first book and uh I self-published it carry it home in the trunk of my car got a, copies and I went on the radio and said hey y'all get my book and um some people did and uh and the 18 months later Ed to get to your
(04:40) question yeah we moved the uh card table out of my living room and one old beat up desk from the days when I went bankrupt and open an office in an 800t month-to-month rent and me and another guy the other guy was going to do Financial coaching the way I teach to do that I was going to continue to do that and we launched a in April of 1994 a class on how to handle money it was actually how to avoid bankruptcy um and one of the lessons was on the different types of bankruptcy one of the lessons was on how to stop a foreclosure if it's an FHA if it's a VA or if it's fannye different processes to
(05:16) stop a foreclosure um and you know all these different things and the people that came weren't bankrupt they were just making a lot of money and spending it all oh okay so they were broke it was all the money comes in all the money goes out only the name are Chang to protect the innocent but they weren't behind on their house payment right they just were fighting with each other in their marriage and they didn't know how to do a budget and no one ever told them about insurance so I took the bankruptcy and the
(05:41) Foreclosure lesson out and replaced it with a uh uh retirement lesson and here's how Investments work lesson uh compound interest whoa and which is you know still for the general public causes their uh brains to just go melt down in in a wonderful way the first time you see compound interest right yeah and so yeah we that was called life after debt um in April and uh four people came the first night I sold three of them so for you digital people I had a 75% conversion rate cut up right but um I'm telling you it was primitive overhead projector bad suit you know that whole thing and then we changed it to called
(06:20) it Financial Peace University the five months later in September 6 months later and now Financial Peace University's had 10 million people go through it in 50 ,000 churches have taught it unbelievable so for context the services that you had was education with some level of service kind of like holding accountable or keeping them consistent on top of that which the reason that I I was really intent on talking to you was that in the space that we're in today and obviously the the marketplace has changed a lot you have an education business and I
(06:55) would say that the vast majority of quote education businesses are not perceived is legitimate mhm how do you think you've been able to Anchor in it like it's it's very clear that rain Solutions is a legitimate business obviously um but what do you why do you think that so many of them are not perceived that way um what's the Gap what are what are people missing there I I honestly don't know I I know that um in the financial World in general um and I think most of your listeners and you and I will agree to this that that there's a lot of us I grew up in that world and and I'm a nerd
(07:35) by nature and got a degree in finance for God's sakes and so I in other words I thought the way to fix everything was with the math MH and math treats the symptom right not the problem and what our brand differentiator and it may be the difference in what you're talking about as well is that we did come to understand that it's a behavior problem it's personal finances 80% Behavior 20% head knowledge I've said that like I don't know 8 million times in 30 years and um but it is and the problem with my
(08:05) money is the guy in my mirror if I can get him to behave he can be skinny and Rich and we've talked about this all these lines these riffs that we do and we do them over and over and over and over and over again and but it but but that's the differentiator that's the thing that said oh yeah because I mean knowing how to do a budget is different than actually doing one knowing how to live on less than you make or that you should is different than actually doing it knowing that e 73 Donuts will make me fat is different than not eating 73
(08:34) Donuts right personal testimony but the um but yeah that that stuff I think that's the difference and then what has happened is that if you go through and you do the stuff that we teach and we've got the systems in place to help you be held accountable to do it and encourage you when you're struggling and scared and hopeless um but if you're arrogant and prideful either way way we're going to be there in your grill uh saying we love you so much that you need to change if you do this stuff and you actually make the changes due to the accountability that that that because if
(09:12) you keep doing what you've been doing you're keep getting what you've been getting so you got to change the recipe so if you change the recipe you have success and lives transformed is legitimacy that gives you legitimacy and so in in other words I don't know if they set out to be illegitimate but they didn't maybe they didn't have the uh the this the life wasn't actually changed MH you know if I join a gym yeah and then I don't get anything out of that yeah I don't have any weight loss no increased muscle tone no um you know increased aerobic
(09:47) whatever whatever it is you're trying to accomplish if I don't get any of that even if it's my fault yeah it feels like the gym is illegitimate I don't think the gym is necessarily illegitimate but the results were illegitimate and so then you get labeled that way yeah and so I hear people say Dave Ramsey stuff doesn't work the haters right and uh it absolutely does not work unless you're working yeah like I guarantee that I can make you that personal guarantee shifting back to the business um explain to me how how the actual product Suite developed over time so in the beginning you had the education and
(10:24) then you had the services that that layered on top of that was that the main thing for like a decade or and and like walk me through how you ended up scaling that was that all through media um we had the okay the the radio show didn't make money for a decade MH um because they don't pay you to do radio uh even today I don't get paid by radio stations I have a a clock split with them and so um and we didn't have anything to sell when we split the clock and so we didn't make any money so whatever we put in radio was lost dollars um but it was the
(10:57) megaphone it was the uh the the the lead mechanism MH uh okay and so we we I started doing some speaking and then I thought hey we could do like a little public event in town because we were on only on the air in one but so we went on the radio and announced and I think we had um I don't know 100 people or something come out and um paid us like 40 bucks or something to sit for 3 hours or 5 hours or whatever it was and listen to me Yammer in my hillbilly twang about getting out of debt and so we had live
(11:26) events started to develop we had the little book so we had a little bit of a publishing thing going and we had the class itself uh which is a long form U It's a combination of 12ep in curriculum so to speak um a a and and so radio publishing Live Events those were the first and what becomes Financial Peace University we're the first ele oh and one-on-one coaching one-on-one counseling we called it in those days we now call it Financial coaching um so there's no confusion that we're not licensed therapists um some people can't
(12:02) seem to it's not clear but anyway coaching is hard to mess that up so um yeah so we do that and each of those things grew at different rates and so there were different times in the 30 years that um Financial Peace University was bringing in the Lion Share of the money and then publishing would come up and pass it m uh Live Events is pretty much always been a slightly profitable but really good second lead Source okay so if you come to a live event um because you heard us on the radio it's going down the funnel the marketing
(12:36) funnel so to speak and then they might buy Financial Peace University which is you know a nine week commitment and a high you know instead of a $20 event ticket it's $80 to go through it or whatever that so we were working that that and there were always books on the back table too so uh and so once those things worked and the book then we had a New York Times you know the book eventually evolved and was purchased by a publisher and became our first New York Times bestseller um once that happened and then we start doing a bunch
(13:04) of we start getting more and more radio stations and doing more and more media so instead of just doing the little local news Sky we actually with the book tour the first time got on the Today Show and uh and then that opened up something then that opened up something and then pretty much been doing New York media for 25 years um obviously all that's free but it's lead generation and so if I were to say this back to you the the radio station served as the big megaphone to gather attention and then point it in a direction and one of the places you'd point it in the earlier
(13:37) days was the live events which functioned a little bit as a conversion event for you guys for a business perspective and then those people would get funneled into whatever was appropriate for their budget uh you know either they'd buy some books or they'd buy the curriculum or they'd buy the curriculum and some one1 counsel um I'm already One One Financial coaching um and then that machine has been what you've continued to spin the wheel on and Gathering more and more and more media yeah we and we've got more and more product mix now I mean we've got uh you know we ended up uh I advertised for
(14:08) a stock brokerage firm um and then when I sent the leads the people would go over there the local broker that they went to would tell them to do stuff that I had just told them on the air not to do and so that didn't work and um people are pissed off and uh uh yeah and so we said well guys y'all can't do that with the leads we send you well you can't tell us what to do and I said I can tell you you can't advertise so we're not going to be on the air so we dropped those folk and um so the product Suite
(14:40) from there that was the core initial product mix and then what we did was uh we would hear about some need that was a a similar thing but a finger off of that so for instance a local coach at a Catholic High School was took my Financial Peace book and started teaching his seniors cuz they need to know about personal finance with and then called me up and goes hey I hope you don't mind I'm like well I don't mind and I'm kind of complicated but let's work together on this let me help so I went over and spoke to him a couple times there sweet kids and he's a great guy Greg Carson he's a friend of this
(15:14) day that was and we ended up out of that developing a high school curriculum that's now been taught in 48% of the high schools 6 and a half million kids have been through it and so um you know that was again another product line that Ed Solutions is another department if you will inside of RAM today and pretty substantial revenues for high school college and even Middle School uh curriculum and and then uh you know Corporate America says okay we'd like for our employees to get this stuff so we take a modified version of the
(15:43) Financial Peace University that doesn't have as much of the bible stuff in it um and we have to not violate um some HR rules and stuff so we had to change some of make it a little more of anill on different things and uh it's called smart dollar and gosh man Lots h I don't know 10,000 companies have now taught it including big ones like U-Haul and uh uh Costco all of their employees have gone through it so that's a whole another product line but it's you know there it so the the brand Suite or the product Suite continues to evolve uh as we look
(16:14) at different things where we can serve uh we took over all the publishing and so we do all our books now uh self-published have for about a decade how do you think about spinning out new products like what to do versus like because there's obviously focus in a business right you limited time resources like how do you say this is going to be something we're going to just partner with someone on or this is going be something we're going to bring in house and actually own entirely or just not do it all and ignore and just
(16:38) let somebody make some extra cash on it and we just don't worry about it yeah um well one thing we don't do is we don't um we have made a conscious philosophical decision to not sell Financial products so we don't sell insurance we don't sell Investments um we don't sell real estate we endorse people that do M but they don't work for us they're advertisers of sorts Endor our Ramsey trusted is what it falls under that brand so some of them are have ads on the podcast some of them we say go to the website and fill out a form you find the realtor we recommend in your area that's Ramsey trusted that
(17:15) kind of thing and so that way when I'm giving real estate advice someone doesn't say oh he's just trying to get us to do that now they still say yeah he's trying to just get us to be a real estate lead but that's different than he's trying to sell me a house or he's trying to sell me a mutual fund we don't endorse particular mutual funds uh and we don't um sell Investments like that so you can't say the reason Dave does insurance is because or says term by term insurance is because he owns a term insurance firm because I don't and you
(17:45) know one of the lies out there floating around is I own half of Churchill Mortgage which I don't own a dime of it' been nice if I had they done really well and I don't and I own half or some of Xander insurance or both advertisers have been with me 26 27 years years consecutively and um but I don't own any of those they're just they're they're they're friends of mine but I've been doing business with them for three decades and they do really well and they do a great job for a listener and so those are media Partnerships they're sponsors and that's how you sponsors that's all they are I mean they're just advertisers on the on the original talk
(18:16) radio show which is now like you guys I mean podcast and YouTubes and Tik toks and everything yeah what have been some of the major beliefs that you had to break along on the journey from and if so what's what's topl line revenue today across all of the portfolio I'm calling portfolio I'm using my own language but across Ramsey Solutions Ramsey Solutions uh revs will be a little over 300 million this year okay so for context in terms of size here for my audience 300 a lot uh so what what what were some of the
(18:51) because you know a lot of businesses grow at least in my observation of businesses is they're they're stepwise it's they'll they'll grow they'll grow and then they'll hit something and they St there until they figure out whatever that thing was and then they go super fast again and then they hit another wall and they keep going would have been some of the you know two or three major pivot Points in the business in terms of your lessons or beliefs that you had to reshape that allowed you to break through to new levels of
(19:14) growth you know I think because the product line was so uh diverse um the different ones of those were stepping at different times M and itus caused our actual Revenue growth to not stair step but to be fairly smooth interesting on a curve got it um but like you know if we went for instance to Financial Peace University it went through different seasons where it would go and then it would stop and it would just sit you know and we're kind of in one of those stop and sit modes now because we're making this transition uh from being primarily Church distributed
(19:49) okay uh because churches aren't teaching classes like that in this current environment as much as they used to and so we've got to have a more direct consumer uh digital uh distribution methodology and we're we're discovering that right now so it's plateaued right now got it Financial University is awesome it's excellent but it's but from a business Revenue perspective business model it's you know its big spike would have been the mid 2000s okay I mean it made woo it went crazy up and it was kind of like the 800lb gorilla Revenue wise inside the building and then it
(20:18) moved over to the other thing so uh what are your question is not the stairstep question your question was uh uh what are some Milestones along the way like lessons Bel shift that allowed you to be an entrepreneur that could get to I mean 10 I mean do you remember when you hit your first $10 million year your first 30 and your first 100 and your first you know any any big changes that happened in you as a person that that you can denote and say I learned this and this is why we were able to break through
(20:43) that yeah I I figured out um fairly early that um that organizations are not going to outgrow the character and uh intellectual capacity of their leadership um primarily me and so if I'm if I remain dumb in some of the areas I'm dumb in then we're we're not going to be at 600 million you know I've got a uh or somebody else will be doing it and if they remain dumb they can't you just can't do it I mean there's stuff you don't know and so I was a I grew up in a real estate household Mom and Daddy were in a residential real estate business and so I've been selling my whole life straight commission for me self-employment as a
(21:29) is my DNA I don't I don't know how to think about working for someone uh so and when you grow up in that world you know you learn to kill it and drag it home CU you ain't got anything to eat if you don't kill something and drag it home and so um very tactical MH and so I couldn't Spell strategic when we started and we got large enough that we started hiring these things called mbas and these people that actually had and uh now over the years I've got a ton of NBAs on the team and I love the NBA programs most of them that are out there they do really good job of teaching but
(22:01) one of the things I learned almost universally about NBA they are heavily steeped in strategic thought and so uh the NBA on our team and me about uh 20 years ago made a really good trade um they taught me how to think strategically because I didn't know how and I taught them how to work so it was a good trade and so would you say that basically them coming in and talking strategy was a like a big unlock in terms of grow critical thinking skills I the way you solve a business problem how do you you know I would just
(22:34) go in there and go okay the answer is activity just go run into the wall enough times and the wall will fall down meanwhile the NBA standing over the side going hey Dave over here there's a door if you just walk around I mean you don't have to run into the stupid wall this is dumb and so uh cuz they're looking down on the maze the Lamberth and can see the way through and I'm just going just get after it just get in there and hustle you know and you need to have both you got have the energy of the hustle and grind and the uh because wiin doubt
(23:04) activity is the answer but um unfocused unplanned activity is um not always fun it causes pain sometimes too so we're much better at uh what my friend Jim Collins calls calibrated cannonballs now than just firing cannonballs would you from a branding perspective because I think you've developed a really strong brand what are what are some of the deliberate decisions you've had to make to associate with versus not associating with in order to continue to strengthen the brand expand the media because I
(23:39) would imagine like in the flywheel that is Ramsey Solutions the media is a huge part of that and so like what has been one of the big things that kept that wheel spinning and expanding compared to the many other people who try to to top you I mean even the people try and get more audience more earballs yeah I uh I don't know we discovered I don't know how we figured it out it was accidental I guess it was people getting pissed at us in the early days we you know like we would endorse something on the radio just local T local radio station and you
(24:08) know go to such and such a car lot well somebody go over there and they go the guy tried to screw me Dave he' call me up on the air or call me up at my house you know find me in the mall and go you the guy you sent me to is a d gum crook Ramsey and so now I can't trust you yeah and um and I would lose the advertiser cuz I would have to cancel them cuz I was ashamed yeah of the and uh so somewhere along the doing stupid stuff like not vetting who we're going to associate our brand with uh instead of just buying just oh we were so happy we had an ad sold you know we
(24:40) made a little Revenue my God and then you figure out that doesn't play well because you're destroying your credibility with the market we figured out we were a trust brand and uh radio endorsement taught us to be trustworthy worthy of trust and uh so we're very careful uh as a matter of fact just a few minutes ago I came out of a meeting where I turned down two potential advertisers and the sales team said we think we need to turn these down but before we do it's a lot of money we need to uh ask you and I said yeah that
(25:09) that guy if we put that guy on he's going to it's going to cause our audience is not no that's not so would you send your sister there would you send your mom there would you send your friend that you play softball with uh you know would you send them over there and if they don't pass that acid test we don't put them on the air so if I won't really buy it or I don't really believe someone should buy it for their own good MH um I mean like 100% of the things we advertise I don't necessarily buy personally at my stage of life but I'm not the market for them either so um but
(25:43) but I do believe in them and I believe they're good for you and um sometimes we've messed that up we've endorsed things we shouldn't have endorsed in the early days even I mean it's it's uh uh in the last few years I've had a really disastrous one that was mess it's caused me all kinds of problems but um you know initially started out good and then turned bad and we didn't we didn't cut them off fast enough uh and that's our fault for not cutting them off but we weren't doing it for money we were we're trying to help people and so it's a
(26:13) trust brand and so no single relationship Advertiser endorsement is uh it could not possibly give you enough Revenue in our world to offset the damage it will do if they don't take care of the C customer yeah because people all we've got is trust and if they don't trust us for that they also aren't going to trust us when we tell them to get out of debt they're also not going to trust us when we tell them hey this is going to affect your marriage you know the the advice we give is no longer trustworthy if the endorsement is not trustworthy so the whole stinking
(26:43) thing ends up revolving around this word and uh so we spend a lot of time discussing and vetting and uh shees clothing the holy it's a mess but yeah it's it's okay it's worth the effort I agree I'm with you on that and I mean I think that you know at acquisition. comom we tried to do the the same kind of approach which is like how can we be as trustworthy asly possible because you know we we do Equity deals and so yeah we have a huge vetting process and you know 99.999% of the the audience I have will never do business with me um but I still
(27:17) need to treat you know everyone so that the reputation which compounds is based on trust so that we can do deals over the long term and just to be very uh transparent it um it's emotional for me and most people in this building when that doesn't go right yeah when we mess that up somehow because we our intent is to never mess that up and when it gets messed up it hurts our feelings more than it does anybody's mentor of mine gave me this quote you might like it he said uh never risk the empire for a pot of gold there it is that's a great one I love it so
(27:55) speaking of pots of gold so 300 million is where you're at right now what do you see as the as the next thing to get you know Ramsey solutions to 600 million like you were saying earlier like what's the what's the path forward there like what do you see as the Strategic opportunity what are you investing in right now um well we're seeing an explosion uh with our every dollar app for one thing it's um it uh with minimal effort honestly has caught fire so we're going to pour a little more gas on that while we're at it we're going to put some effort into it since it's working and uh
(28:30) we do think that Financial Peace univiversity is going to stair step again and we've got to finish we got to find that um methodology for delivering those age-old principles in a new ma in a new way we are a platform and delivery agnostic MH I don't care how we get it to you but we got to get it to you and it's not and efficiently with the least friction possible so people actually do the stuff and so that that's there um uh some things are going are logistically have uh in the last say 20 of the 30 years have be not they didn't shrink they grew but they don't have the
(29:08) logistical ability to grow uh revenue-wise as much an example that' Be Live Events there's only so much of that you can do and it doesn't it doesn't hockey stick right you you because you you have a bottleneck actual bodies on a stage yeah and bodies to set the stage up and that kind of stuff and number of cities you can actually draw a crowd in and that kind of thing so um the only way you could hockey stick that thing would be to run the prices where they were just not for the average guy and our whole thing we do is for the average
(29:38) guy so um so that's going to if the if it stays the same or grows at 5% and something else grw at 50% it's going to get to be a smaller and smaller piece of the pie right mathematically uh but not still not be something we're ashamed of we love Live Events and I'm we're one of the biggest event companies in America we do great Live Events but uh but it's going to end up that that one's not probably going to be the answer um unless now streaming could um it would have to monetize for the first time but they suck on monetization but uh uh but
(30:12) it's good at getting information out there uh so I uh um I we don't see hard cover books as being something that's going to hockey stick uh in the coming years but I do think they're going to continue to be a a valid part of the mix um so it's probably more uh digital application and delivery because it's the easiest to scale and lowest cost of goods and um and it uh more easily iterates than anything analog and uh the rate of change uh has exponentially increased in 30 years MH it used what what used to would take us five years to see unfold in the marketplace is unfolding in five
(30:52) or 10 weeks right now yeah and um how fast uh entire social media platform forms become irrelevant m is is kind of amazing and uh so you know betting the whole thing on one delivery mechanism uh woo dumb and so um uh in my mind anyway but yeah so so I think whatever it is is going to like an app like a budgeting app or a delivery digitally of FPU or delivery digitally of our entree leadership which is our small business uh teaching and coaching uh you know only have so many physical coaches for small business guys right and uh that's got a limiting factor do I want 3,000 of those people on a building
(31:37) no I really don't uh I'd lot rather figure out another way to help you folk out there and uh that that is um not as Manpower hungry so when you said the every dollar app just kind of like took off is that like a micro example of how product iteration works for you is like let's throw something together let's see how it works and then if it starts taking off disproportionately to like the effort you say okay now we're going to invest more resources in it yeah we put a huge amount of effort into building it and launching the initial yeah um it was a major initiative and a push and then it kind of you know it it
(32:11) it's had a good growth rate but it really wasn't but something shifted in the marketplace I mean literally last four or five months right uh and the way the consumer uh is viscerally responding to the word budget mhm uh differently than they were certainly uh 10 years ago but probably even 10 months ago and so when we develop things so we're going to you know we've always iterated it we've always updated it we've always made it better every time and all that kind of stuff but um there just seems to be uh
(32:41) some attention that we didn't cause so why not join the parade yeah right I think probably some of that's the the macroeconomic environment has changed a little bit in the last you know in that period of time people are probably feeling the need for a budget and it might be that I mean I think the product the original launch on it was uh it's probably coming up on 10 years you know so okay and the um you know the the number of people that are walking around adults that have have uh never lived in a world that wasn't a
(33:13) smartphone world is much larger than it was 10 years ago yeah and so the marketplace has shifted in that regard but the the the iPhone the uh um whatever whatever smartphone is native to a much larger percentage of the population than it was uh when it was launched so we may just be seeing that demographic shift and that um they aging into it yeah because they you know that age group I mean if you're 28 you you wouldn't ever think of doing a budget on paper right it would not occur to you that that could no more than you would handwrite a letter in cursive you know I
(33:50) mean it's just absurd so but you know when I started all this that wasn't neither one of those was that unusual right So speaking of of of the app in particular as as a an increasingly large part of the pi um how does it measure compared to the other pieces like just by percentage you've got the events you've got the education you've got Entre leadership uh you've got the app you've got the Live Events um like how how do how do how do those divide up in terms of uh like size for Ramsey Solutions the Ramsey trusted items which includes National advertisers and uh the
(34:26) whole uh smart Vestor Pro all the endorse all the people we endorse for um investing all the real estate agents all the there's about 8,000 9,000 different uh people that we endorse for in different areas tax all that tax and um real estate and investing uh through Ramsey trusted and then you've got a singular National Advertiser like a church on mortgage for mortgages all that falls under Ramsey trusted so that's a lot under there but uh the the uh the national uh associations plus the Strategic Alliance as we call them the the what used to be called the ELP
(35:01) program um probably amounts to 40% of the revenue really um and so not let not putting on back to our earlier conversation not putting on one that's bad yeah is a big deal there because you're going to mess up the whole thing you know you're going to mess up the Empire with that singular bad pot of gold and so we have to you know to be a real estate agent and Ramsey trusted you really are we're really going to do the stuff we tell you to do or we're really not going to let you in there I mean it's a big deal you know and so cuz we love you and we love
(35:34) our customers and we want everybody to have a Little Love Fest we don't need anybody pissed off so you're really going to do this stuff so that's uh uh probably uh I think it's probably sitting at about 40% of the revs right now but that's half the ad gun building too in terms of the 1100 people that work here uh entree leadership is probably uh 15% uh you know something like that uh Financial p University is probably 15% um you know uh every dollar is 10% maybe or less it's less than 10% um but they know they just kind of fall out
(36:12) like that publishing and Live Events together not that huge Revenue but again they're almost middle yeah they're almost lead Gathering things so um I'm trying to think what else falling in that p&l but just something like that those are the big ones that's rocks how do you think about reallocating or reinvesting Capital within the business versus taking it out of the business as an [Music] owner well we we uh don't randomly if we have something we can I can get more Roi here on something that we have a
(36:48) high belief in than I could anywhere else I mean certainly on mutual funds of real estate I mean I love mutual funds of real estate but I mean I can get a th% Roi on launching a and I can't even approach that on this other stuff so I would rather deploy the capital here uh but I don't need to deploy it stupidly so um when in doubt uh we take it home and uh when in doubt take it out yeah yeah that's it and and plug it into the you know plug it into the generosity and plug it into some more real estate or mutual funds so um I'm going to I'm going to
(37:23) Pivot a little bit on the on the investing side because I wanted to give you a something that you might not know but you did a um a podcast with graham Stefan and he was fun he's a great guy yeah Graham's Graham's a nice guy he's done he's done a great job too on his stuff man he's followed in your Footsteps in a lot of ways well he he's he's different but I mean he's doing he's good he's we like him yeah Gram's a good dude and he showed you his investment uh portfolio oh yeah that's like a thing he does when he has people on I'm like I don't know Graham I don't
(37:54) know if I'm qualified to help you with that yeah you said something to him that massively changed the direction of how we invested just so you know yeah so I I just wanted to share that with you so I think you had said Loosely well before I look at this if this were your brain or your knowledge or your experiences what percentage of this pie would you say is real estate versus stocks versus anything else and he said well because he had asked you do you think I'm over indexed on real estate but when you
(38:22) asked him the question he said well I mean I guess probably 85% of my knowledge is around real estate and I think his portfolio kind of reflected that you were like well then that's a perfect mix for you and for me as we were coming out of the of our liquidity event we' probably taken about 40 million home before that wow good for you that's awesome it's not 300 it 300's gross dude I know you know the difference in gr net and um but anyways and so I had during while I was growing the business I I basically just didn't really invest at all I mean I just put in indexes and
(38:55) was like I'll deal with it later um and then we had the liquidity event and I had I talked to probably every guy that I know was who was richer than me and was like what should I do with all this and the answers that I got were as different as there are people under the sun yep which left me more confused than anything and so the reason that that little piece of advice that you gave to Graham was so meaningful for me was that it was personalized because everybody told me what they did mhm and what had worked for them but you know one of the guys I asked was like oh take all that
(39:26) and buy one huge building and I was like I don't know anything about I was like I really I don't want to risk everything on one building he's like well I've been doing this 30 years like that's what you should do I like but I'm gonna mess this up that scares the crap out of me yeah yeah I have no tenants and termites and toilets and all that I have no idea any of that stuff works right and so when I thought back on when I looked at that pie and thought okay well what's my knowledge base it was like it's all business everything I've done has been business and all the money I've made has been business and so um I
(39:56) showed that clip to Lila my wife I was like I think I think this is what we should do I think we should just stick to business and just buy businesses and grow them I love it I love it that's what we did with acquisition. comom is that good for you that's a great wow but that little piece of device changed the direction of how I mean how we allocate all of our assets and what we do because it's funny because if I was going to write a $5 million check into a building I I I got like you know three or four
(40:24) deals that were around that size in terms of check size and um I'd get all the way to the end and I was like I don't know what I'm doing and I'm just trusting that this is a good deal like I had the Excel sheet and the you know projector returns and all this stuff and I was like I don't feel good about this because I don't know when on the flip side if I'm going to write a $5 million check into a business I feel fine about it because I'm like oh I know how like I know I don't know everything obviously
(40:48) mil things it's it's your it's your sandbox right and so um anyways that's beautiful I love that that's what what happened was we had a product that we called wealth coach for a little while and uh we ended up doing these very small but I don't know we charged more than we ever charge like a th000 bucks or something we always charge 20 bucks so to come to this little seminars and we would end up talking to these people that were millionaires or 5 million or 10 million and I kept asking them okay what do you put money into CU they're they've actually done it they had money
(41:20) like you've actually done it you had money and so it's not someone with a theory on Tik Tok you know and so um what I kept hearing from them was this array of all kinds of different things so I couldn't it wasn't the answer to the question wasn't a certain investment made them Rich what it was was they put money and stuff they knew yeah and I mean one guy was a car dealer and he had a massive CL classic car collection which for an ego-driven person is a horrible idea right but because because you can lose your butt in in any kind of collectible yeah but for somebody that
(41:54) is in the car business and his his grandfather had a dealership and he his father had a dealership and he had a he he knows that loves it he goes out in the garage and pets the cars I mean you know so guess what he's making that portfolio seriously gave him a great return now do I recommend to the general public go get a car no no put money in stuff you understand and you love and uh don't put money in stuff because it sounds fancy um or somebody you know it sounds sophisticated cuz there's something happens when you get money you think that everybody that has money is
(42:33) sophisticated about their investing and what I figured out is almost no one is yeah they're very primitive I mean a lot of people I talked to were farmers and you know what they about lots of land they got dirt man that's it just dirt and it don't even I mean they don't even necessarily plant it but they just buy dirt and one guy had 8,000 Acres of dirt you know I'm like God in Kansas you know I'm like golly I wouldn't need more good I don't know anything about that kind of dirt I like real estate but that would scare me to death but for him it was the most comfortable natural thing in the
(43:04) world to your point and so I just learned that put money in stuff you love and you understand don't put money in stuff because it sounds sophisticated because you're getting ready to lose your butt because you're trusting some guy who doesn't have any money who's trying to sell you something and um driving a well a bad car and um so yeah uh we w't name the bad car but anyway yeah I mean that that's that's where that came from was just anecdotally hanging out with those folks and researching it and it gave me peace because I was starting to make bank for the first time and I'm like I need to be
(43:36) like doing double back flip limited family Partnerships or some kind of crap I don't even know what they are but I probably ought to be doing one if I'm making this kind of money and and then I and you talk to a guy and he's like yeah you ought to do a double back flip with a Twist and I'm like n yeah but get right up to it and I'm going you know I don't half no I think I'd rather just bury it in the backyard than that because at least I know where it is you know it's funny though because even with the dirt example um there was a guy who uh
(44:01) his entire investment strategy explained an interview he's like you guys are going to be bored about what we're going to do for the next 55 minutes because I can explain it in five and we're like and you know I'm listenting I'm like okay here you know here's it he's like okay so what I do is I find a city and I find the main street because usually there's a a main street that goes through the middle of the stat the oldest street whatever it's like and I take a ruler and I go out 30 miles he's like and then I buy all that land he's like and then I wait 20 years
(44:28) [Laughter] I love this guy and what are what are the big any questions yeah he's like so what do you want to do with the rest of our time together they're like so how do you head he's like oh Buy in cash because you can't you know can't take loans on land and uh yeah that's that's what I do and we've been doing that for many many many minut I done with a guy the other night that had2 billion do net worth and he second gen but his dad was dirt doing dirt mhm not unlike what your friend was doing and um then he couldn't get the
(45:03) bank to do the deal he was borrowing money to do the dirt and so he bought the bank it was a little Hometown Bank and they screwed with him and so he bought it and he's like okay now they'll behave and um then he started making money on the bank and got in and got to figure out how Banking and and now they own like 15 or 20,000 Acres three wineries around the world and a whole bunch of banks bunch of Community Banks and they and they're billion multi-billionaires and so yeah but it started from that and they don't really do anything else it's the wineries are more of a fun project I
(45:40) don't I think they know what they're doing with those probably the way he was talking he knew wine and um the uh but the uh but he knows Banks he knows dirt and that's where all their money is yeah and they're they're not Diversified for having as much billions with an S you know I mean it's it's interesting those kind of people are enthralling to me and it's interesting because most of of the the billionaires that I have looked at they usually make their money in one or two vehicles that they know exceedingly well where they feel like they have an unfair advantage and like they they they
(46:11) get there not because there's a Marketplace Advantage but because they have an information Advantage they know it better exactly exactly and if you go through the Forbes 400 I think it's 67% last time I looked are first gen mhm they're all billionaires now you don't qualify if you don't have a b and um their first gen and I think I looked at them of the first gens uh it was 90s something perc were business-driven MH so it was Michael Dell you know Bill Gates um Hobby Lobby David Green um Chick-fil-A TR Kathy um you know and so they started a business
(46:50) and it led to either they took it public or they just monetized the crud out of it and it just has a value Marketplace valuation Oprah you know um but you know the the secret of Oprah's wealth is not her Celebrity Status it's the Empire she built under the Celebrity Status and so um you know you go down those things like that and you go okay you can get to one to5 million net worth with your 401k and your paid off home yeah uh but you you know mathematically impossible to get to a billion in your 401k it's not
(47:22) possible to do it so you got to do there's other strategies to be involved if you're going to do that so I wanted to take a quick second because uh it would it'd be hard for me to to to talk to Dave Ramsey without talking about debt and um a lot of people so in my audience um I'm kind of dead agnostic I don't talk much about it um but a lot of people don't know that I actually have no debt either and so everything I bought to this point in my life has been cash now I'm not against that I just kind of like talk about uh you know when
(47:50) I get right at the edge of something I just I end up not doing it um it's been that way with most kind of loone things in general and I read uh Financial or Total Money Makeover um years ago and you had this line in there about debt that was I'm going to try and say it back to As I understood it because there's there's obviously the B biblical component but for everyone who might not believe in that um I wanted to give at least my ra my rational understanding of how you see it which is that debt introduces risk MH and risk when it when
(48:24) compounded over a long enough time Horizon no matter how big a number you require any number multiplied by zero is still zero and so if you know that you're going to be playing this game for a very long time even a small amount of risk when you're going 200 mes an hour can flip the car MH that was my understanding of how you saw debt MH is that accurate that's that's how I I saw it or at least I interpreted your view on debt yeah that line is actually from Warren Buffett um he uh and one of his his famous annual reports they're they're very cheeky and fun to read and especially the opening paragraph so in
(48:57) one of those he he was talking about in a down year like' 08 um you know we soon discover that Leverage is not always your friend those of us that could do math realize that any number multiplied by zero is going to equal zero and that does that for you so yeah it's um again having grown up in the real estate business one thing you're going to do in the real estate business when I was growing up if you said I'm going to be a real estate investor they took you to the hospital they took out your risk meter and they broke it with a hammer
(49:25) and they put it back in you're not allowed to to perceive risk if you're going to be a real estate guy cuz and CU it's every it's a glass half full we're Eternal Optimus everything's going to work out cuz real estate's always awesome it's just awesomeness on Parade you can't mess this up the renters will pay your rent oh God that or pay your mortgage you how can you mess this up and you know so if if a little bit of Leverage is is good then a lot of Leverage is amazing and uh and that's how I went broke yeah you know I leveraged up to my eyeballs on had a bunch of short-term notes in the bank
(49:57) call did the unthinkable and called my notes when they got sold to another bank and they saw a 26 year-old kid owed them a million two on a 90-day notes doing flips this was before chip and Joanna told us how to do it and so do a flip oh my God and we didn't have HG to channel to tell us how to fix up a house I without cable TV I did this stuff and so um yeah so that's where it came from and then what happened to me because I lost everything following the borrow all you can because it works plan um I had to stop
(50:32) and go uh I think I've got a bad set of rules the Playbook I've got sucks I keep losing and my kids are getting skinny I mean this is not working so when I did that the first as you said the first uh door I went through was I was had just become a Christian and so I started studying the Bible and so from as a matter of faith I started reading scriptures and all the scriptures say negative things about that it doesn't say it's a sin doesn't say you're going to hell but it's stuff like the borrower slave to the lender you're a fool if you cosign I mean it says these things in
(51:07) scripture and then you talk to old rich people and they go well you stay out of debt boy you know and okay that's kind of Grandma God's and Grandma's ways of doing it so what did I miss in Academia when I fell in love with leverage from an academic Viewpoint because how is it it's in congruent to me that if this book of wisdom and these people M that are long in the tooth with gray hair that have proof social proof they've got money and they kept it are all saying avoid debt what is it that we missing in academic land with my intellect so spiritual social
(51:44) proof now I got to solve it intellectually and what I ended up doing I ended up speaking at uh Vanderbilt to a group of NBAs early in my career and it it it forced me to because I knew I was going to go in there and get tackled right because they're going to go you're primitive you believe the Bible you know you don't know anything and you don't how to do math and I know I know how to do math as a matter of fact it's about all I know how to do I'm a math guy so what I figured out was was that in business debt or
(52:13) real estate debt uh business is not publicly traded um no one includes all the math mhm they leave out a risk factor associated with debt mathematically and so we look at a very inaccurate and primitive measure of Leverage and so if I can borrow this money at 2% and I can invest it at eight uh why am I not making six well a you left out inflation B you left out taxes but aside from that um and and that's pretty basic because this is the argument it's that it is that the argument is that primitive right but you did not adjust for the risk you took on
(52:56) cuz think we can all agree if you have a business that's doing $10 million Topline and you've got uh $12 million in debt you have a lot more risk than if you had $2 million in debt and even $2 million is more risk than if you had zero debt we can agree that debt is equal to risk and if we can agree to that then we ought to be able to assign if we're going to really get down in the analytical jungle uh we can assign a mathematical formula to that well Tada there is one it already exists we just never applied it in that in the
(53:25) investment World they teach us M to adjust you don't compare an aggressive growth stock mutual fund that has a high peaks and valleys on the graph volatile with a growth and income fund which has almost no Peaks and valleys so a growth and income fund may have a beta of a08 meaning it is only 80% as risky as the S&P when you're comparing it to uh an aggressive growth stock mutual fund that might have a 2.
(54:03) 0 meaning it's twice as volatile risky MH and so in that world we're taught I mean one of the first things you learn doing financial analysis in that world is the you use the beta as an inverse in the math and you and you flip it on its head and you multiply it through and you adjust for risk mathematically so that you can then say after you adjust for the volatility the 08 versus the 2.
(54:22) 0 versus the S&P is a 1.0 it's your Baseline when you adjust for that risk uh the perceived Return of the aggressive growth stock mutual fund at 20% rate of return where the other one's making 11.2 it goes away it neutralizes it and you might end up with with uh risk adjusted that 11.
(54:46) 2 will come up and the 20% will come down risk adjusted and then you can actually compare apples to apples but you've risk adjusted for the volatility and mathematically we don't do that in business right we just go oh I want to buy bulldozer let's go get 50,000 at the bank yeah and I think I can do it I think we can push some dirt and that that is your risk analysis well kiss my butt that is dumb okay and and people do that all the time and so what I determined was is that I'm going to go I if you want to compare two dry cleaners you know one has debt one doesn't I've got a risk adjust for that mathematically and you have to apply a beta formula that I presented that to this group of NBAs and they're all
(55:23) sitting there with their jaws on their lap going uh no one ever said that I said it's because it's never been said no one no one does it in the world no one no you're not trained this way you're trained that way and only one bucket of Finance all the other buckets of Finance zero real estate people do this zero none they do not analyze risk and so if you take risk out then unlimited leverage right is logical but if you say unlimited leverage they go oh oh not quite maybe 80% maybe a 70% maybe a LTV right and uh you know but if you push them up to the edge they can actually feel it a little bit cuz they
(56:02) there's remnant of a risk meter in there but it just doesn't function anymore that's where that came from oh I love it probably more than you wanted but yeah no no I wanted to uh to kind of hear your take on it and uh because obviously you know in the business acquisition world there's also debt that's that's factored in now we've done all all cash deals um up to this point um but I wanted to just kind of hear your take on it uh and I I quote Warren Buffett a lot he's a big yeah but even even in the publicly traded realm you know if you we were taught and and still
(56:33) taught bonds are debt mhm and so if you're looking at a com company with publicly traded stock it has a heavy Bond weight yeah you discount the pte you you don't compare that stock Apples to Apples with a company has no bond rate zero bonds they have zero debt they don't have Bank debt they don't have short-term debt they're sitting over there debt free you you would give them some benefit on their stock analysis mathematically we're taught to do that but again it does not transfer from the mutual fund world or the publicly traded
(57:02) world to the real estate world or the small business World small business uh privately held business don't even I mean I know people that do you know have a billion dollar Top Line and honestly they don't even look at they just they just some of a lot of them just don't borrow money they don't even know why they don't borrow money they just don't borrow money cuz somebody told them to one time and they go I like not being in debt I can sleep better and that's their entire analysis you know uh me I've got analysis and I can do the country boy
(57:34) thing too and say I just sleep better bring on a pandemic I got cash yeah I I'll I'll I'll I'll bring this home because I had a and I could talk to you all day um and I appreciate you taking the time to to you know talk to me and the audience the game been honored it's fun fun conversation if you had advice that you could and I I'll keep it specific to business advice um that you could give for 4-year-old Dave what would you tell him then that like you know now that you didn't know then play incremental long ball don't look for the Home Run um I keep waiting for somebody to
(58:16) call me and for this to get easy one phone call and it's all over and it's like oh now I don't have to think about it anymore someone else is going to do it for me it's all automatic it's never going to be automatic it's never going to be easy it's um it's a hustle and grind it's a claw you're going to make a bazillion mistakes make mistakes that are experiments that you survive you put out a hypothesis you survive the experiment to live another day to have another experiment put out another hypothesis another product that fails another idea that fails and our
(58:47) failures at Ramsay are in New in number and in money are way greater than our successes the only thing is we survived them a we didn't have debt and B we never bet the farm on one horse and so from a diversification standpoint we never pushed all the chips to the middle of the table on one hand and so we're not looking for the singular home run uh we're looking to survive and fight another day and keep iterating and the the culmination of that uh the accumulated value of those iterations are what we call the gleaming mountain of success which turns out as a pile of garbage and mistakes that you're just
(59:24) standing on rather than laying under it I love that uh one of the say that we have in our community is 100 gold 100 golden BBS no silver bullets there you go that's one that's exact you know you beat me to that's much better than mine I would have just gone with that you know it's the same thing I keep waiting on the phone call but I mean it's never I had a couple of them I thought was it and then I was um found out they were just people and they weren't magic what's funny because I joke with our community because a lot of my community is small business owners you know probably you know from $100,000 a year
(59:56) to1 million a year is probably like the the broad brushstroke of the people who are listening to this um and the biggest thing a lot of them suffer from is you know shiny object syndrome is that as soon as something starts to get hard something new looks easy and so they jump from the hard thing to the easy thing and really it's just uninformed optimism and then they get into it and then they have informed pessimism that's beautiful that's beautiful yeah I mean by the time it shines you're light you're it's too late I mean if you
(1:00:28) think Tik Tok is new you're late yeah it's already not new it may have already turned down and we while we were talking right now well I mean if if we have a second let me know um in terms of how because you've survived survived a strong word uh you've thrived uh platform agnostic you know you have you I mean you were in radio you've done live stuff but then I see YouTube clips uh of your show pumping out every day you guys crush it on YouTube and you do it kind of your way um how have you thought about
(1:01:02) navigating platforms as they come and go and how you kind of like reinvest in where where are we going to make a bet and say okay we're going to start expending resources here or is it just if there's attention we'll go there like how how do you think through that uh we try to go there and then we expend resources based on um results and so um the YouTube shorts that we've been been pumping out is only about a year and a half old and uh we're getting incredible results uh but we're getting results on those as an example um we
(1:01:36) don't view those as life transformation items okay we view them as lead magnets MH to lead you to the long form show to Financial Peace University to a book which are life transformation items so um they're um free advertisements that cause people to get a get a little sample get little little old ladies stand in Costco with a sample biscuit right and so get a little sample and um uh get a little sample biscuit and then you may go buy the whole thing in the freezer uh and but so we I would not do in other words our Phil philosophy on changing lives as while we're here we would not only do YouTube shorts because
(1:02:16) they don't change lives MH okay we would not only do uh the new long form Tik Tok 6 minutes 7 minutes we would not only do that uh because it won't change life um and so it's got to lead us somewhere and based on its response on doing that or just general activity around whatever the item is whether it's a long form or short form uh it is we're going to we're going to pour gas on where we're seeing stuff work and you know so we don't you know for the last two years we put uh little to no effort in growing Twitter MH um Tucker Carlson might change that
(1:02:55) it may become a broadcast medium mhm and uh so we'll probably be on Twitter next week well elon's definitely pushing Elon and he's going to but I mean if it's not going to just be a uh a cauldron for trolls uh then um and it's actually going to put out some positive information uh in a way that is consumable and could grow and Tuck if if Elon proves that with Tucker I mean we'll jump in there and try it right now and all that is we're not going to put a ton of money on it or uh resources or bandwidth on it but we're I this week we
(1:03:27) were discussing we're probably going to try it and uh tuck what Tucker's doing and what elon's doing with Tucker and with that whole idea of broadcasting there um because Facebook live is didn't work I mean it's not working no not anymore um not from our perspective anyway but we're still there we're not we didn't abandon it but we're not putting effort on it we YouTube shorts yeah we got a lot of people in this building working on that every day yeah you guys crank those yeah they do they put out a bunch of them when you think
(1:03:51) about content for you are you cuz you're recording 12 hours a week correct four days three hours a day 15 hour okay well accounting commercials yeah we do we do three hour talk radio show every day days is that the entirety of your kind of content creation and then the teams take all of that and disseminate it through all the the channels uh I do a podcast that I just took over that's callar driven on leadership in small business called onent trade leadership took that over in January that and the Ramsey Show are the
(1:04:22) only two things I'm on but Ramsey network has about 10 shows MH are uh YouTube Andor radio Andor I mean we put them on everything but um I mean the Ken Coleman show is the only ones on talk radio 75 stations plus podcast plus YouTube um deloney John Dr John deloney has a huge show on uh podcast and YouTube only uh the Rachel Cruz with George camel the h smart money happy hours but we sawdust every one of those every one of those can say uh we're going to take uh pieces and clips and do all kinds of things with them instead of
(1:04:56) don't go create uh well I say very seldom do we go create a YouTube short of anyone in the building or anything in the building it is clipped from something we were already doing so it's repurposed uh content that was already developed for something else you know highly edited yeah I I mean because I've I've observed what you're doing and thinking like how can how can we do even more of that kind of stuff lots of payroll yeah where our media is um all right well uh this has been phenomenal and uh I'm honestly just so
(1:05:32) grateful that uh they they had me and my team out here um to uh is this considered Ramsey Studios is that what this would yeah we call it that Ramsey solution Studios yeah um and uh just also so grateful for that one tiny tidbit that wow wow I'm honored I had a tiny bit to do with all that you do man you're amazing I'm proud of you well done means a lot I appreciate it well thanks so much for having coming on the game thank you brother hope the something in the future absolutely you can count on it

Transcript:
(00:00) you guys want to hear something absolutely insane I was able to take home more than a year than the CEOs of McDonald's Ikea Ford Motorola and Yahoo combined as a kid in his 20s and I have continued to for over half a decade which results in a $200 million pre-year portfolio and $100 million net worth by age 32 and no one is more surprised than me me expressing that fact will create Envy in some anger in others skepticism in most confusion in old people and Inspire select few you are who I made this presentation for but
(00:42) before I dive in raise your hand if you'd like any of the following things to happen to be able to charge two times five times 10 times more than your competition for the exact same thing like Yeti We have basically identical cups and somehow they're able to charge $40 versus $10 simply because of what on the cup if you'd like to be able to have customers buy from you over and over and over again without considering competition like Harley once you're a Harley guy you stay a Harley guy for life and if you'd like to virtually
(01:15) guarantee sales in any new business or product that you launch like apple a lot of people just weit and lie they say just leave my credit card just bill me and send whatever you're going to come out with and that's more or less how a lot of Apple buyers are once they become an apple person they become an apple person for life so if you like that stuff great because that's what this talk is about and so I couldn't figure out how these Brands these companies were able to do this demand these prices get people to stay loyal for a really long time and I felt like for me I always had
(01:49) to like big borrow and steal and I had to squeeze and push so hard just to get people to buy whereas these companies made it look effortless and it's because I didn't understand this one thing and that's the subject of the talk today brand and the thing is even people who claim to understand it often don't and the few who do understand it do a terrible job teaching it so this definitely is going to be marketing oneon-one class on branding presentation colors and logos and this definitely isn't going to be about feelings
(02:20) presence Intuition or whatever this is about making money and this concept that I'm going to explain to you is How I build a 7.8 million person audience across all these Platforms in the past 40 months or so I sold over a million copies of my last two books and your deals worth hundreds of million doll in our holding Cy acquisition.
(02:44) that is why you build a brand or at least that's why I built mine and so today I'm going to cover three things number one what branding is you don't know what it is you certainly can't build one number two why it makes money because once you have it built you're like okay well how do I trade this thing for doll hairs which is what we want and then third how to start and grow yours so let's start with the first one what branding is so when I decided to build a brand I looked at what many popular marketers said about it here are some popular definitions that I have
(03:13) removed the marketers from them this is not throwing shade so I'm just saying them a brand is a person's gut feeling about a product service or organization a brand is not what you say it is it's what they say it is a brand is a set of expectations memories stories and relations to that take it together account for a customer's decision to choose one product or service over another a brand is emotional shorthand for accumulated and assumed information a brand is present with the value of what the product service or personality means to its audience is greater than what it does for the audience a brand is
(03:42) a product service or concept that is publicly distinguished from other product services or concepts so it can be easily communicated and usually marketed branding is the process of creating and disseminating the brand name its qualities and personality the promotion of a particular product or Company by means of advertising and distinctive design if these sound vague and confusing it's because they are and I was just as confused as you when I was trying to figure this out because none of them told me what to do and so after looking at all these
(04:12) marketers words I think I pieced it together at least enough that once I started thinking about this way in a different way I'm about to share with you my brand grew and it grew fast and the reason this is so important is that if you don't know what to do nothing's going to change fundamentally if you don't change your behavior obviously nothing's going to change as result and so I want to Def find this one term before we get going learning who here came to learn raise your hands fantastic all other words just being talking to the wall so
(04:40) learning means same condition new behavior and so if I wanted to teach someone a phone script then after teaching you the phone rings again and you say the new script you learned learning occurred on the other hand if I tried to teach you the script and then the phone Rings again and then you change nothing no learning occurred you learned nothing and that's why none of this stuff that these guys said helped me because I didn't know what I could do I didn't know what Behavior I had to change as a result of this so I didn't know how to do it and
(05:18) so here's how branding happens branding is a deliberate pairing of things through an outcome so I'll say that again bring is a deliberate pairing of things through an out cup so let's use Coca-Cola drinking it and liking it as our example the Yum aka the outcome that's what people get they pair that with drinking the action so what they do to get it with Coca-Cola the product so the next time you want some yum you're probably going to reach for a Coca-Cola if that was paired for you successfully and so branding is a deliberate pairing of things through an outcome that's it but sometimes
(06:03) businesses pair stuff pair their stuff with things that people don't like that's bad branding this leads to losses for the business now some of you guys may have seen this this is Dylan mulany doing a collaboration with Bud Light there's a lot of press around this advertisement this advertisement was actually a great advertisement and you might might think I'm crazy but it was let me explain it's just not the way you might think it was this is a great advertisement because it let a lot of people know about their stuff it let a lot of people know about the product about Bud Light by the way if you're curious that
(06:41) is the definition of advertising not branding advertising is letting people know about your stuff branding is the pairing that occurs as a result so it was good advertising but bad branding many customers hated this pairing lots of people found out but a lot of people hated it good advertising bad branding and so as a result of this bad branding people not liking the pairing fewer people bought the product which netted a loss for the business and so to fix this budl paired the product with stuff the audience liked like Shane Gillis who is a man's man comedian and the UFC a man's man of
(07:20) sports if you will and sales began to recover so that's the oneone explanation of branding let's go into 2011 so to go a little deeper because the better you get at this the more money you will make like the more Nuance you can understand how to brand and build a brand for yourself the more money you will make I promise you that and so to some people the dill m m pairing was actually good in general both good advertising and good branding hear me out for others it was bad obviously all pairings have positive and negative results and that's because
(07:58) everyone's different everyone has different preferences but for a business you can objectively see if a pairing was good or bad whether it netted you more money so more people disliked the Dyan tough date Dyan M pairing so SES suffered making it a bad pairing so this isn't opinion they objectively made less money and so this pairing was a bad for their ideal audience now the 301 version of this is is there a company or a product where the D vany pairing could have been both good advertising and good branding so that the majority of people would have bought I think the answer is
(08:37) yes it just doesn't necessarily mean it's Bud Light for conservative males as the primary audience and on the other hand some people love the new Gillis and UFC pairings and some hated it but more of the audience that is their ideal customer liked it saw it as good and so the business netted sales a result and they made more money good branding and so for Budweiser and I just want to call this out this is specifically for Budweiser in their customer base it's not that Shen gillers so the UFC is Magic in some way or Dylan
(09:09) mulany is unmagic in some way but for that specific audience yes the pairing mattered and how much of the base liked it or disliked it so if you're anything like me making money is the point so let's drive this home if you made a pairing of your thing and your customer and you got to choose which outcome you had happen so you have your product and they drink it there's an outcome that happens afterwards right that pairs with it on one hand 75% like it and 25 hate it or on the other hand 25% like it and 75% hate it which would
(09:46) be the bottom example which would you choose more money good the big the big green one yes of course the top one because it would make you the most money and so to be clear for the 2011 level of understanding branding always happens branding always occurs but our goal is good branding and good branding is a deliberate pairing of our business with good outcomes for our ideal customers and so what you pair your business with determines two key things one who pays attention to your business and two whether they go towards your business like the UFC example or away
(10:30) from a business like the Del Mia example and so at the beginning of this I said I was going to cover three things the first thing I said is what is branding but now that we have gone through that I want to resay what I walked us through which is what good branding is ideally what we're shooting for so now that we covered that let's talk about why it makes you money why good branding makes you money branding as I to find it happens everywhere all the time but businesses use it for profit so let's look at some of the
(11:00) earliest uses of branding to figure out how we can use it so these are the first entrepreneurs who use branding to make money the earliest version of branding that we can think of or at least that I can think of happened on livestock it was literally a brand they would heat up metal they'd sear it into the side of a cattle and they would get a lovely little logo maybe we'll have a Nike Swoosh cow someday and so they literally burn these symbols into animals and those symbols had a magical effect so let's say you're walking around and you see a cow with no bread you say
(11:33) hello cow the cow says move back and it has nothing on it this is just a cow you might leave it alone and that might be it on the other hand let's say the cow has a bread you recognize say it's your neighbors you might be like hey that's Bill's cow now if you like Bill you might grab the cow and pull him by the whatever you pull cows by and probably return it to Bill if you hate bill then the cow may stay lost in the wilderness forever and become lunch for your family for the next month or two in the form of
(12:08) delicious burgers but either way For Better or For Worse the brand affected what you did it affected your behavior and so to take this to the 2011 level what if you see a branded cow but you don't recognize the brand you might be like who this I see a logo but I don't know anything about it well then you would treat it how you treat braided animals in general in that you just know that it belongs to someone and so you would treat it the way that you treat it as though it belong to anybody else and even if only a tiny bit you would treat a wild cow different from a branded cow in general so if you had one
(12:50) that was wild and you had one that you didn't recognize but was branded you would still probably treat them differently so that just shows you the power of brand as a concept because it dictates a tie between that c in a human being or some complex animal that can brand cow and so these are all effects of brand in general so that's how affects what people do and so now I want to get tactical on how to get how we translate that concept into getting them to buy so let's say we pair our brand so this is where we get really tactial and this is
(13:18) like okay if you don't have a brand this is the step by step right now so you have a weak brand and we say it's a weak brand because it's starting up you don't have really a lot of Association fantastic so now you want to pair with people experiences other C other stuff that your ideal customer likes so in this instance I'm using little Nike pairing with LeBron and tiger who are Champions World Class goats Etc and so people who like sports and competition would see that probably as a positive pairing AKA good stuff and so if we do
(13:48) that pairing or we make that pairing for the majority of people braining will occur and so the brand grows and so the question then follows what's the benefit of a strong brand versus a weak brand and so the the the weak brand is before the pairing the stronger brand is after the pairing so a strong brand turns commoditized products like a $5 white T-shirt plus the strong brand into a premium product a higher value brand name product and preium products with a strong brand then get customers to want to pair themselves with the product so that they
(14:26) can associate the outcome themselves with the outcome the brand delivers which they do with their money so how do they make that Association they give money they get the shirt the association happens based on what they've seen where that logo has been elsewhere and so then they go from I want to be a winner to exchanging money and saying now I am a winner or I feel like a winner that's how this works and so this means that if the ideal customer likees boards winning and competition Etc then they're more likely to buy
(14:57) stuff from a brand paired with those things so let's lay it all out weak brand paired with stuff customers like creates a strong brand strong brand gets put onto a winning product transforms a generic to winning product then the customers want to associate with that winning product so they buy the product and they put money into your bank account in order to do it and so as long as you net a positive between what it cost you to associate with tiger and LeBron and how many t-shirts you can sell a result you make money and so here are some steps in
(15:35) words for those of you who are more word people you start with a brand that means nothing you have a logo just like the cow that the other person didn't recognize people know that it is a brand they just don't know what that brand means yet so it means nothing right now then you pair that brand with something or someone that your customers ideally like third your brand starts to mean the thing customer likes to them then they want to associate themselves with that thing they like or get more of it but they can't buy that thing but they can buy a tiny sliver of that
(16:08) Association so they buy the shirt with the logo that means that thing to them and so they get the shirt you get the money and it all happened because you deliberately paired it with something they like and this happens everywhere so DOL and gabana classic example they paired with Kim Kardashian they made a line specifically for her and so for a lady who wants to associate with Fame Beauty wealth that would be a pairing that makes sense and so that lady who wants other people to associate her with Fame
(16:42) high class money luxury wealth will then buy DOL and gabana and be like I'm just like him now she might not say that directly because she might just associate with the values but the transfer still happens and so when someone looks at two products that on the surface are generically the same you've got two T-shirts one that has a weak brand or no brand and the other that has the strong brand the person that has the strong brand they're going to be more likely to buy and pay more for and this happens because they actually buy the elements that we've
(17:16) deliberately paired with the brand which they identify with and at this point of building a brand you do this to change customer behavior and that excuse me that is the point of building a brand to change customer Behavior in your favor when they see it with a product and so this is a quote from warff that I like a lot kind of signifying some of the elements of the benefits of brand is that the single most important decision in evaluating business is pricing power if you've got the power to raise prices without losing
(17:45) business to a competitor you've got a very good business and if you have to have a prayer session before raising the price by 10% then you've got a terrible business and so if we have an unbred t-shirt for $5 and we say you know what we think we have a strong enough brand that we can raise the price and then boom we can raise the price and still not lose that many sales but we in this case 12x the price good branding drives that premium pricing good branding also improves advertising so with the generic brand if
(18:16) you're marketing this white T-shirt you might get half a percent of people there are many white t-shirts there are many like it this one is mine just kidding so the point for those of you got the reference um so if you have a 05% cluther rate on some that's generic there's nothing special about it on the flip side if you have a Nike bread t-shirt same identical t-shirt and it has the swoosh now you might get six times as many people to click and buy at a higher price see how these things stack together that is why these Brands exist for such a long period of time and make so much money so they get cheaper
(18:50) customers they get higher returns and they have better response rates and advertising and on top of that if if as if that weren't enough good branding ALS what drives Customer Loyalty AKA they buy more stuff more times and so like the Apple example I gave earlier once you buy one Apple product you tend to buy more and you tend to keep buying them and so this also a good brand also protects your business from competitors stealing that customer in the future and so as I promised in the beginning who's seeing how this all this stuff allows you to one be able to
(19:22) charge 10 times or more than your competition two get higher returns and advertising so you can scale that much more that much faster and then three get people to keep buying for Life compounding your money making skills for good okay which is why building a brand will make you lots of money it's also why Brands outperform Commodities in every single industry and give a lasting competitive advantage that to be fair is Theirs to lose so here's another quote from Uncle warrant it takes 20 years to build a
(19:53) reputation and 5 minutes to ruin it if you think about that you'll do things differently and so so I said that I was going to cover three things one what branding is which we renamed what good branding is second why it makes you money think we got that so now let's go to how to start or grow your own brand so branding is the deliberate pairing of things your thing plus what your ideal customer has through an outcome and good branding is the Del paing of your thing with something good to start a brand we have to know
(20:23) what we want to pair it with to attract ideal customers so here we've got light UFC good outcome for the majority of the audience and we want to understand that just as much as we should also understand which to avoid pairing our brand with to lose customers like the D Mia example and so here's how I like to think about assembling the pairings for a brand so if you're a ground zero you have you have no brand you've got these elements that haven't been put together yet so I think about it like a table full of flowers so if you want to put it bouquet together you start by having lots of different
(21:00) flowers all over the place on their own those flowers are not a bouquet just as products values experiences people Etc on their own are not a brand the flowers are like the brand elements that we pair with stuff or audiences like with enough pairing over and over and over again they form a bouquet now replace the word bouquet with brand and so that assembly is the connection it's the association between those things because the brand fundamentally doesn't actually exist if I take the flowers out of the vase and
(21:36) scatter them across was there ever a brand to begin with it's simply the association we make between those things that creates the oneof one brand and if we unravel it the brand disappears and so the deliberate pairing of those things makes the brand and if we want to get narrower on our brand so let's say I talk about tacos lifting and philosophy if I want to narrow my brand I'll just talk a bunch about tacos and then all of my flowers are just Taco related if I'm only talking about tacos but I want to expand the stuff I'm talking about to my audience and maybe capture a wider audience then I might
(22:15) talk about tacos quesadillas burritos things that are tangential and then if I wanted to expand even broader I might just talk about food in general and then I might talk in alcohol then I might talk in restaurants and then things that go wider and wider from there and so we get narrower as we Niche down and we go double down on one type of topic and we go broader when we Branch out but distant and random pairings hurt a brand because they're so hard to make the associations with and this is what most brands are and
(22:49) do most people's Brands happen by accident it's just whatever they appear next to whatever people associate their stuff with good branding happens on purpose because like what are we looking at with a a bike a single flow some socks and a burger not a lot not a lot to hold together there and so think about it like curating a garden you want some flowers to grow and you want to pull out the weeds you have to do both you have to add the good and take away the bad in order to assemble the ideal brand for you and in the beginning our brand won't be strong just like yours one if you're
(23:24) building it then you might only have a couple flowers there and it's because you have haven't had that many instances to pair your brand for that customer but the more good stuff we pair with our brand for the customer the stronger it gets you go from one flower to many red flowers or many red roses that become a bouquet of red roses that's what you're about and the more you're about it the more the brand strengthens now what if we make a branding mistake and pair with the wrong thing cuz it's going to
(23:57) happen one bet pairing can absolutely hurt a brand so if I now give my this lovely red rose uh bouquet to my wife and I say hey don't you love this bouquet and she sees this rotten flower sticking out the front she might be like e this bouquet sucks or this brand sucks or hey that guy got a DUI and I thought he was this Paramount of good ethics well that would hurt the brain and so just like one ugly flower messes up the whole bouquet it changes how everyone sees the Brand This bouquet sucks now to recover from something like that you just have to overwhelm customers
(24:33) with the stuff they like until eventually the bad pairing shrinks into irrelevance so we don't try and eliminate the DUI we don't try and eliminate the dead row it happened there's nothing we can do about it but what we try to do is just overwhelm it with way more of the stuff that the majority of our people actually like and so Kanye for example has said some things that people don't like but he also comes out with products that people love he made a Super Bowl ad he sold shoes he just came out with an album that came out after having some cancel culture stuff around him and things he had said
(25:05) and so over time people forgot the bad stuff and Associated the good stuff back with him and purchased they still bought and so you need to decide what values people experien Etc that you want to use to connect the audience to your product and equally importantly what things you want to avoid remove or ignore from the stuff they hate and so it goes without saying that even if you say you're premium but people think your thing sucks that suck will stick and so up to this point everything I've talked about has been the things external to the product they've been the
(25:42) people you associate the product with now almost all of that occurs prior to purchase so you can absolutely get someone to buy the thing but how many experiences are people are going to have with the thing once they've purchased it probably far more than they have with your advertisement and so the advertisement can let people know about it The Branding makes a good Association for the person they make the purchase and then afterwards the product does a lot of The Branding after that because if I buy that amazing Nike
(26:11) t-shirt and there's a hole in the armpit when it comes in I might say this is the first time I ever bought a Nike product this product sucks therefore Nike sucks and then I think the whole thing is a sham and then I also start to hate LeBron for even recommending right starts to transfer backwards now on the flip side brand can influence how people see the product so if the product is what I would call good enough so it's it doesn't have any holes in it now is it the highest quality it possibly could be maybe not but it's good enough that no
(26:41) one's going to find an immediate problem with the product that's where brand can carry you the extra distance to still make it a positive experience for the person and so brand in a very real way can affect how people perceive value through products now me personally this a pro tip here if I'm going to charge a premium price I absolutely want to make sure that the product is dialed so that I only further reinforce how much they like my brand rather than let my brand carry me or at worst have it conflict with the impression that I gave them of the thing they were going to buy prior to them buying it this is a quote from Warren
(27:17) your premium brand had better be delivering something special or it's not going to get the business and the only tweak I'd have on this is it it's not going to keep the business you'll get the first purchase you just won't get the ones after that and so all the things are like okay got it so brand is pairing I get how the pairing makes me money I have these big margins I got more ctrs more people buy and as long as my thing doesn't suck and ideally that it's good people will keep buying awesome but how do I measure that so braad has three main metrics one
(27:49) which is influence which is How likely it is to change someone's Behavior so if I show someone a brand and they react in any way they recognize it and they they they do something about it then we have influence second is direction are they changing the way we wanted or are they running away and third how many people it changes for that's it so if I show room up 100 people and 100 people react versus two people react the 100 person reacting at least recognition that is the reach how many people it changes it for so taking to the hypothetical extreme a small weak
(28:25) and neutral brand very few people recognize and the people that do don't care that much about it either way and on the other polar extreme you have a large large strong positive brand so that would be lots of people recognize the brand it changes Behavior when they see the brand and the behavior is generally towards so they try do in accordance with what that brand is asking someone to do and I want to make this point a lot of people have this misn that any strong brand is polar that because lots of people love it lots of people o have to ha it now I say this by percentage not necessarily by absolute
(29:01) if you have if the whole United States knows who you are you're going to have a percentage of people that hate you just because there's crazy people and that's how we're talking about I'm saying is there a brand that can't have that kind of status that isn't polar so I'll give a polar example first so I have the silhouette of Donald Trump here and he has a very strong brand he has a big reach lots of people recognize him even just the silhouette alone people recognize he a strong influence as in the percentage of people that when they see this have a reaction in either direction positive or negative but just
(29:33) that they react shows that he has strong influence and then third is the direction now for him he is polar meaning many people move towards him very strongly and many people move away from him very strongly and so many assume that all brands are that way and that's just because there are many examples of that but that doesn't mean it has to be that way and so I'll give you a different example so some Brands manage to change change many people's behavior towards them all at once and so like Taylor Swift sure I'm sure she's got some
(30:05) crazies don't get me wrong but the vast majority of people who see Taylor Swift recognize her she changed their behavior and most of the time it's towards her so she is a large positive strong brand this is also personally why I think the idea of like seeking out controversy absolutely gets you recognized but you don't have to make that trade you can't absolutely just build a strong positive brand Mother Teresa has a strong positive brand a lot of people know her influenced a lot of behavior did a lot of good stuff must be work like I hate Mother Teresa some people do but most
(30:37) people don't and the same thing goes with apple a lot of people like their products I'm sure there are some techs that are like Android's way better right they're like PC is awesome and that's great that's good for them but the vast majority of people who encounter the product like it which is why they're one of the largest companies in the world so all those examples that I gave to you up to this point have a assumed a large audience and I do that because this is a pration and it makes more sense for me to work with you on stuff that you already know but this concept
(31:05) carries independent of whether you have large reach and this is why it applies to you so if you had a small audience with high influence what would you have got Mom and Dad they are high influence as in most people when they see their parents their behavior changes they have low reach because for you they're only your parents they might have any they might be some other people's parents but not very many people's parents as you have low reach um and it will be your behavior will towards for some and a way for others
(31:39) meaning some people hate their parents and don't want to do anything they say and some people like their parents and do whatever they say and there's a lot of people in between and so that's how we measure if what we're doing to grow our brand is actually working are more people finding out about it are more people changing their behavior when they do it and ideally are they doing that towards the direction that we want them to go so if I say hey everybody go click here go download this thing go attend this event go buy this
(32:03) product whatever it is if a lot of people do that then we know that the brand is growing and so we want when we want to build our brand we want to pair our stuff with the things the highest percentage of our ideal audience like and so whenever we pair anything with a brand because especially if you're starting out everything is new and so every new pairing has risk and so you risk losing a certain percentage of your audience who has a bad experience with the thing you pair there's always that risk there's always going to be some people who don't like something you do if anyone seen a small town band go hit
(32:35) it big some of the old Towners are like oh they sold out they did whatever but what they did was they gambled the short-term loss of that local audience potentially for a much broader bigger audience so they made a bet they did lose people they did gain people they just gained more than they lost and so to the same degree when you make that bet as the local band you risk gaining other people who have had a positive experience with this new thing and ideally we have more green than red and so those news pairings the new pairings you make with a brand always lose
(33:04) audience right he's sold out I like the old stuff better this also happens with content by the way and so this person is the red bucket fantastic and the new stuff might also cause people to say no this new stuff rocks and that person is in the green bucket and so whenever you try to grow and you make any new pairing meaning you make new content you make a new genre you make a new song you make a new anything you make a bet that more people for your ideal audience will like the pairing than people who don't tldr that
(33:36) you'll net an increase in reach influence and positive direction and so my ask for here is don't let the five mean comments stop you from Gaining the 500 new people who like the new thing so let me finish the real life example to make this whole thing real for you I want to associate myself with business value so I associate self with making people money and growing their businesses so there's me there's me making content and then ideally money and so the best way I can do this is make content for the small business owner to consume and books for them to
(34:12) read and use so that they then profit the good thing and then they associate that growth and profit with me and so then they consume more of my stuff they drink the next soda they buy the next shirt and so the next time they want it to happen again they take the action or they have a higher likelihood of taking the desired action and equally important people who don't like business stuff won't like my stuff or they'll just prefer to watch other things so you've got this married couple they say we hate
(34:44) people who talk about money they're probably not going to like my stuff and that's okay but people who like business have a business or trying to start one might want more and this grows the brand because people consume the stuff and they say hey you got to check out herzi stuff and then that person they tell to says right on they J it out they get that positive outcome they make the pairing as well and the brand grows and ideally with my ideal audience and so to see this in action if you use this information from today to make money good branding has
(35:21) occurred and so I said I was going to cover three things what branding is IDE what good braiding is why it makes you money and how to start and grow yours so hopefully you feel like I fulfilled those three things and so now we can test if the pairing good branding actually occurred so if you are my ideal customer so here's a business owner okay awesome a lot of you fantastic we can see objectively if this provided value did we get a good positive outcome a neutral outcome or a negative one you might be like I hate
(35:51) this guy talk about money or you know what I think this could make me a ton of money well we'll see so I want you further associate myself with value and making you money and growing your business so I going to give you guys two gifts for free the first is for existing business owners who want to scale so most you guys should raise your hands I have two books $100 million offers $100 million leads people say they made their money there's a lot of five star reviews on them fantastic and I mean video versions of these books that you can get absolutely free on my site at acis.com

Transcript:
(00:00) if I were single and starting over this is how I'd find my partner the person you spend the rest of your life with will have the largest impact on who you become what you achieve and how happy you are but most people spend more time deciding what car they want to buy or what neighborhood they're going to live in than the person they're going to marry when I was in college there was a graph they put on the board in my economics class that said that there's a 71 correlation between your subjective well-being and the strength of your
(00:24) relationship with your significant other and if you pair that with amount of time spent with friends family kids alone and spouse over time alone and spouse go up and everything else crashes down to like almost nothing the person that you're going to spend the most amount of time for the rest of your life with is going to be your spouse the amount of single people that I see right now who are like H I don't want to be on the apps the apps don't work it's like we're talking about finding the one person you're going to be with for the
(00:54) rest of your life that you're going to spend the most amount of time with out of all humans by like a wide wide mark and you're like I don't want to go on more than 10 Dates it's like so you just want to spin the wheel 10 times to just pick whatever of the 10 that you get that you're like I guess this one doesn't suck and then that's it that's the rest of your life it's like I just want the rest of my life to kind of not suck it's kind of like the inverse of selling like in sales you have a pipeline and you know what your
(01:18) conversion percentages are the thing with finding significant other is you only need to find one and I remember when I was way younger like in high school going to college where you know some girls like what are you looking for we're like on a date thing and it did not go the way she was expecting um I was just like these are all the things I'm looking for and she was really discouraged looks like you're just trying to find a unicorn I was like only have to find one I think I believe in having exceptionally high standards only
(01:42) second to the standards you hold yourself to so either you've got like Camp number one I'll take anyone with a pulse that's one way to do it you're just going to get the scraps of society which sucks Camp two which is probably the more prevalent one which is why so many people are struggling is I want to have this amazing person but I suck but they should be so amazing that they should see me for who I am deep down like deep no deeper even deeper like really deep down they should be able to see that right even though I'm [ __ ] up
(02:08) and I don't have a job and I'm overweight and i' never stick with my commitments and I never follow through like besides all that and I lie sometimes you know what I mean that I haven't been faithful for like past relationships but still and I'm not complimentary and like I don't have any values that that they aspire to be I actually really have nothing going for me but besides all of that deep deep down I'm amazing they just knew how to look that's like Camp too and I feel like that's a lot of people and then
(02:31) Camp 3 is you know I I saw this meme that went like all over the Internet which is you can consolidate all of the relationship guru's dating advice to be successful and they were they were making fun of that yes that that is at the at the end of everything that's it 100 different hacks and most of them are about deception like realistically like most of the like dating hacks that I see are about posturing and perceiving you know making people see you a certain way but but the thing is is like on a long enough time R they're going to figure
(03:02) out who you are and so like it's short-term longterm and so people don't want to do the harder long-term work of just like being somebody worth being with and want to find out how they can like optimize their dating profiles and don't get me wrong like it's an ad so get nice images sure like maybe spend 5 minutes on what you're going to have every single Potential Prospect in your life see okay that makes sense the real work is like okay you go on the date now what right like you still have to like be somebody that somebody might want to
(03:28) be with so I'm a big like big Domino believer which is like if I solve this one big thing can I make all of the rest of these things go away I can do a 100 tiny tweaks and hacks to try and find a girl who's out of my league or I can just make myself so worthy that I can get any girl no matter what league she's in and if I just do that the rest I don't I don't need to optimize my profile I don't need to have I don't need to have all these things because if I just have that I'm fine and so I've just I've tended to try and find that
(03:55) one thing in business in Fitness in relationships um and that serve me pretty well my dad told me this when I was single he said everyone has a type and you'll date plenty of people who are that type but the chances are that you're not going to marry your type because if you were then you wouldn't have a type you'd have a wife and I found that really interesting because if you keep dating the same type of person and you're like this is my type then it is probably a good signal that that type of person isn't the person you end up
(04:22) with because you still keep dating them if you have been dating one type of person then you finally get with somebody else and it's very different it doesn't necessarily mean that's bad if anything it might actually be the type of person you end up marrying and I just find that as a really interesting frame for thinking through mate selection you know we date people who fill one clear role or one clear look especially when you're younger it's just I mean at least for me it was just like how hot is this person or whatever but over time you
(04:50) realize that like you date someone a little bit on the edge and you're like oh I liked all these other things that the people I normally don't have and then all of a sudden you start branching into very different types of people and kind of in some ways appreciating cuz I I would say I've I've dated a more diverse selection of people than I've been friends with I would say friends like anyone who's friends with me is very narrowly interested in certain types of things but people I dated I was willing to date people were far outside
(05:12) of that sphere of confidence and so even though I currently now am married to somebody who is in that sphere of like business and hardcore and all that stuff I feel like I I got a a big appreciation for lots of different cultures ethnically but also like psychograph of deeply religious people like I dated people who were deeply religious before and so I have a really good appreciation for that and so I wouldn't have had that exposure had I not been willing to kind of break the type I think being able to pick and judge people is one of the most
(05:38) valuable skills you can ever develop and it's one of the hardest ones to develop because it takes pattern recognition getting burned I'm going to lean into this like judging people is fine you have to assess someone how are you going to assess them without judging them the difference is calling them good or bad like getting an accurate assessment of who someone is or what they do is totally fine and it's human to do that and I think it's it's necessary and so this this idea of like you should never judge anyone it's like you should judge
(06:02) everyone you just NE don't necessarily need to measure yourself against them I feel like you're only going to be able to recognize patterns if you put yourself out there and you're willing to have terrible first dates and terrible second dates uh for an extended period of time because you might find out that there's like a whole set of character traits that you didn't even know were important to you and then you find them and you're like whoa this is now way more important than all the other stuff that I used to think was important I
(06:25) only found that stuff out cuz like it's really hard to even hear podcasts like this and be like okay what do I do with this like it is just exposure you can make judgments on people even outside of a romantic relationship of like man I like this person that I worked with like what are the traits that I like about this person and trying to like really pinpoint those like I I learned that I really liked a woman who respected me and who followed traditional gender roles uh those are things that are super important to me that I didn't know were
(06:48) important to me I only found that out kind of later I I I needed someone who does not get in the way of my goals if I had somebody who who was felt like I was taking by pursuing my goals I knew it would never work long term because I can't have my entire life be a take for somebody else I'll never be able to to flip that that balance so like I I need someone who literally doesn't even see it as a take not someone who's like you can take as much as you want that still doesn't work cuz the paradigm's wrong like they have to see it as a give like
(07:16) they have to see me working as doing as fulfilling my duty to our household and I want them to judge me on that and so making sure that the person you're with judges you by the metrics that you judge yourself on you might be spending all this time effort optimizing towards what you think you should be judged on but if they're judging you on completely different metrics you're screwed you'll never win and so there's always going to be this huge disconnect this huge gap where they're like you could be doing more and you're like how can I possibly
(07:43) do more but it's because you're actually judging against different outcomes making sure that the things that they expect of you and the things that you expect of you are the same and then they should be supporting you because they want those things from you too and then that way you can work in Synergy towards what you're trying to accomplish together uh rather than feeling there's always this give take cuz like really really super honestly like Lea and I don't really have a give take relationship we both just like want the
(08:07) same thing I never want her to think I could have done more or I could have worked harder or I left anything on the field and so I think that's been a source of mutual respect is that we're both harder on ourselves than the other person is on us and so we're always out outdoing the other person's expectations because we're both assessing on the same metrics if you want to be the ultimate husband find a woman who loves all the things that you currently do way less work than trying to change everything about who you are to match what they
(08:37) want from you the amount of times I was in relationships where the things that they wanted me to do I was like this isn't me like I can't expend effort to do this but I don't want to on a forever basis because I will resent you but the thing is that there's another guy who would love to do that and probably does it on his own and they should marry him and so I think just being like really really really brutally honest about what do you really want out of me and what do you expect like what's a 10 out of 10 husband look like to you and if it
(09:06) matches what I already do or what I'm planning to do then it makes both of our lives a lot easier because I'm going to work my ass off on what I already want to do and it will just so happen to F fulfill all of your desires but I think way too many people spend time in this like compromise Zone where neither person gets what they want even if both of you compromise you're not enjoying the thing that you're compromising on they're getting a worse version of what they ideally want and you're just walking out this like
(09:32) kind of middle path when I think both people could be better served by being brutally honest up front and being okay with somebody being an amazing person just not their amazing person you know one of the biggest things that I hate about romance advice and relationship advice in general in the whole Space which is why I try not to touch it is that there is no objective measure for a relationship billionaire so like somebody else can be married or in a relationship and I make a piece of content and they're like well you're
(09:57) [ __ ] wrong because of X Y and Z and I'm like things is that there's no way that anyone externally can see how healthy a relationship is internally and so that's what I think makes it so hard about the space cuz the only success metric we have is not divorced the vast majority of marriages that I see I would not want at all Roy southernland said this which I think is actually really interesting he talked about how realtors Realtors should be advertising the negative aspects of a property to allow people to make better decisions if you
(10:23) say hey it's you know I'm next to the pub area for some people that's going to be a no-go Zone but for somebody who likes the night life then it's going to be a pro but all Realtors do is talk about the plus sides but what you really want is the Arbitrage between something that you are fine with that would quote devalue your property that someone else isn't fine with and that's where the the mismatches or the better matches actually happen I think to the same degree people could approach dating that way which is rather than say all the
(10:51) good things like I'm hardworking I'm in shape whatever state all the downsides because if all of your downsides someone's like those things don't bother me me that becomes a very strong relationship or has the makings of a strong relationship because then there's all the things that everyone is complaining about of you if they're cool with it then they only get upside if I'm fine with being on the bars when it's late next to the Metro even though there's noise because I work from an office and I don't I'm not home during
(11:19) the day um if I'm a you know I'm a guy and I'm not worried about being in a rougher neighborhood cuz no one's going to you know necessarily approach me versus an a single girl who's 100 lb then that probably that house my match with that house is probably a good deal for me I'm probably get I'm going to probably get a steal on the house and so you want to get a steal on a partner is like all these things is what other people were bothered about [ __ ] I love all that [ __ ] or I'm fine with all of it like you work too much cool me too I we
(11:45) work together uh people kind of don't like that I'm like kind of particular about what I eat and like I want to you know stay in shape cool me too awesome and so just take all the negatives and find somebody who thinks as negatives are positives or at least neutral and then like how much effort are you put in the relationship you're just being you and they just like you for you and I think that's way more about like what is liking someone for who they are it's that and it's not like I don't think it's this whole journey of like they
(12:09) suck at these things but I accept them it's more like everyone else thinks the suck about them but I'm cool with it I think that's a much stronger frame the person whose opinion matters the most to me is hers like her hers carries the most weight so if she's like you crushed that it means a lot more to me than 500,000 strangers saying I crushed it because if she said then like she knows what I'm capable of whereas for many people who don't know you anything that's better than what they would do they would consider a success but their
(12:38) bar is much lower than mine is and so she knows what my bar is and she has a high bar too and so that's why it it matters more like the reason that she's probably not writing a book anytime is because she knows how much work I put into it and she's like I'm afraid it's not going to be as good as one of yours on the flip side she's so much better at running a company she's so much better at leading she's so much better at managing she's so much better at interacting with people selling ideas to the team I'm great at selling ideas to
(12:59) the public she's created selling ideas to the team and so completely different skill set and so I um and like when she does Great Stuff with the team like I just I just appreciate her and all the stuff that she does I would say that for me appreciation believe it or not actually comes really easily in romantic relationships like showering with praise like I I've always been good at that doing other stuff like gifts [ __ ] you know like acts of service tougher for me but like telling you did a good job I'm your guy even within the
(13:25) people that we date we should still have priorities of like what is the most important what's second most important and if you're like well they're all important then it means that you need to clarify your priorities cuz nothing everything can't be a priority this is literally strategy and business everything's important but some things are still more important than others and if you can't get clear on what the priorities are for you then how the [ __ ] do you expect your spouse or your partner or the person you're dating to
(13:45) figure out what's important for you if you can't even figure it out and so if you're clear on here's my checklist of tactics that mean a lot to me and then here's my checklist on goals or character traits or activities that mean a lot to me if they if they sacrifice a number three to keep doing doing number one you can't be upset about that because that was the tree that you decided to make now if they show you some three awesome it's gravy but the number one still has to stay number one for her me having big goals and being
(14:11) ambitious just was the number one thing that she was attracted to and I was like good cuz that's the thing that's not going to change now these other things if I have time or I have headp space or I remember I do them but I also forget all the time I forgot her birthday the first year we were married I also forgot mine I can't believe you would do that to your wife I was like I also did it to me I like me too so like what does that say it's making sure you understand the trade-offs you're making and then not
(14:33) being upset after the fact at the price tag for the Nikes that you chose to buy it cost 500 bucks either get the Nikes or don't complain about the price you can't have both I think really clearly stating you want this the cost of this is this are you okay with that if you're not this won't work because I too want this but I understand the cost is this and I'm willing to pay the cost but are you willing to pay it too and I think if that person is not willing to pay it then they are not supporting your long-term goals and then if you play it
(15:04) out and you don't achieve your long-term goals who do you blame you'll resent them and if you're an amazing stoic you'll blame yourself but realistically you'll probably just resent them so I have I have a friend who has been single for a long time he was dating somebody for you know a few years he was like how do you just stick with one person he's obviously successful guy in shape whatever like a Chad right who can who can get girls you know we' gone back and forth and I just try to consolidate it into one statement I added the other two
(15:30) on later what I told him is I was like you just trade novelty for loyalty like you you give up novelty but what do you get if you give up novelty but then you don't have loyalty yeah it's a bad [ __ ] trade but if you get loyalty for me I value loyalty arguably even above law loyalty as we have defined it is your ability to predict Behavior like if someone is loyal it means that I have a high ability to predict their future Behavior if someone is disloyal then they I might not know what they're doing and that's not a controlling thing it's
(15:59) it's just like does does somebody act in accordance to the statements that they've made you trade exploration for trust right like you can explore all these things but then you don't really trust anyone but if you stop exploring then you start paying you start investing in time into one thing and I think the dividends of that time is trust and then you trade like this is from a day-to-day activities perspective you trade the chase of chasing tail chasing women chasing men whatever for a journey together so one is you kind of
(16:26) on the hunt and the other is with you someone by side going towards someplace so rather than you going towards people you're with someone already going towards an idea or a goal or an outcome or a purpose and so for me those were trades that I was willing to make basically the moment I thought I wouldn't be able to marry someone I stopped seeing them I had mul girls big like not to be weird but like being like let's get married let's do this and I was like I don't think I want to and then that was it but it saved me a lot
(16:50) of time and saved them a lot of years and so I also think it's an ethical thing and this is this is more message to guys and really just message to the Chads out there so take it for what it is but like I I genuinely do not like when a guy pretends like he might do something later when he knows that he's not going to want to have kids or he's not going to want to get married and the girl is there waiting hoping I don't like that cuz to me it's a lie I State the facts and tell the truth is probably like one of my big comeback toos in
(17:18) everything in life especially hardships it's like if you have a hard conversation State the facts and tell the truth like I don't want to marry you if you would like to hang out with me in the meantime while you find someone with that but I want to be clear that this is my intention if it evolves into something later cuz you magically change maybe but probably not and I think that people can't have that hard conversation because they're cowards that being said if you prefer novelty to loyalty and you prefer exploration to trust and you
(17:44) prefer the chase to a journey then you shouldn't get married like I I have no I have no qualm one way or the other that was just a tradeit I was willing to make with this particular person it'd be hard for me to find another Lea your spouse marries to two people the person you are and the person that you want to become make sure that they love both sometimes they meet you in today but where you're going is somewhere very different tomorrow and so it comes back to the idea of change versus growth which is if
(18:14) they want you to grow then it's being more of what you already are in the direction you're already growing if they want you to change they want you to be someone different towards a different end goal and so I think a lot of people kid themselves this happens I think more women towards men than men towards women to be honest but like women will try and like he's a project it's like that's a [ __ ] terrible way to live life like dear God making the person that you are committed to a project it means that they don't either love who you are they
(18:40) don't love who you're going to become most people have been in only like three or four major relationships in their life before they get married and a lot of times it's just like the person who was there at the time when they were old enough that they should get married like that's really what happens most of the time which is why most marriages are nonsp spectacular but I think if you went on a 100 dayses you probably have a way better idea of the types of people the character trates out there the interest that you might be
(19:04) able to potentially share with someone and just not basically just not settling just being willing to say no to good and good not being good enough most people have an idea of their aspirations and their goals if those are your aspirations and your goals hopefully you share them with your spouse or the person that you want to be married to and if that person is aligned with those aspirations and goals then they should be aligned with you paying the price to achieve them it just comes down to that like if they if they're willing if they
(19:29) love the person you want to become then they're going to be willing to do with the sacrifice that it will take to get where it becomes an issue I think is where people don't know what they want to do with their lives and to me that's a you problem that you need to solve cuz otherwise you're just basically a a rolled Dice and the other person's a rolled Dice and then you roll them later in your relationship and you find out that you want different things which I think honestly counter to popular opinion I think that's a perfectly fine
(19:49) reason to not be with somebody and for some reason you're it's okay to break up with somebody when you're not married because you want different things but then if you find out later that you want different things when you're married it's not okay if Leila came to me tomorrow and was like I want to live on a farm and not work and do whatever I'd be like that's going to be tough I'd try and convince her otherwise but like that would be tough cuz it would just it I was like that's a price I'm not willing to pay because
(20:09) what I'd be sacrificing is my dream of who I want to be because at the end of the day like your spouse can either be a liability or an asset and a reminder is that liabilities decline in value over time assets increase in value I recommend choosing the latter that is why growth is so important to me from uh picking a spouse perspective because women's status declines in time they're most attract acve at you know 20 to 30 years old and then it declines in time if you use Society standards they have to have other ways of providing value I
(20:35) would rather be with somebody who's continually getting better continually working on themselves continually trying to get new skills get New Perspectives new experiences whatever and somebody who's going to stagnate and just basically ride the coattails of their genetic Lottery which unfortunately I feel a lot of like entrepreneur or you know wealthy guys that I know like they just pick somebody who wanton a genetic Lottery they're just instead of being a trust fund kid it's a it's a it's a beauty trust fund girl they just were
(20:58) born beautiful they have nothing else cuz they never needed to and that sucks so there's a stat that always gets thrown around that more than half of marriages end in divorce but it's a little bit misleading because it's actually significantly lower for first-time marriages so first-time marriages have like a 30% chance of divorce third fourth Etc I think second is like 70 and third is like 80 or something it's very high very very high so so the reality is that the people who get married many times skew the stats
(21:26) because the divorce rate is based on marriages not based on people but yeah so there is this illusion that like you know all marriages in but like if it's your first marriage you've got a seven and a 10 shot of staying married till one of you dies I feel like that's a little bit more encouraging yeah I mean I see I I like the I like the term partner even though it's like considered like woke or something now I think but I like the term partner or life partner because of what it like really entails more than spouse or wife or husband
(21:49) because what you're really signing up for is somebody who's going to partner with you for life and so like if you had a business partner you'd want somebody who had you know contrasting skills with to you but had the same goal like if you have a partner like you want to build this amazing thing together they should want to go the same place as you they should want to have the same values as you is getting there but they should have complimentary skills that's what picking a good partner looks like in business and it looks the same in
(22:10) marriage if you find a true partner then the sum of the whole is greater than its parts I would say the vast majority of relationships one or the other is a liability and is a is a weight against the other person and the person who's in the relationship would be better off if they were alone and so that's kind of how I measure that's how I would measure relational success is how how much more valuable is the sum than the individual parts and so I think the people who get the biggest Delta between who they are
(22:40) individually versus who they are together that's what I would deem is the measure of a successful relationship how much better are they together I love this is analogy from Gary ve cheerleaders don't ask the quarterback to leave the game when the game's on the line a good spouse clears the way on the field or cheers from the sidelines to support you but you know what they never do ask you to leave the game when the game's on the line and the thing is I see so many so many spouses who when the game's on the line and the person's been
(23:07) putting all this time in to achieve the goal that they said matter to them then says I also have this other goal that matters to me too I'm changing the rules on you and I think that creates a lot of conflict it's like I'm trying to win the way that I thought we both said we wanted to win but now you're saying that halfway through the game or when I'm at the 10 yard line that touchdowns don't matter anymore that for me if someone did that and meant it I would run the other way cuzz you can't win honestly most relationships are one person's
(23:34) watching from home with the game in the background while they're doing other stuff blowing up the person's phone while they're on the sidelines before like an important point that they need to win saying all these things that aren't going to help them or even actively hope that they their spouse's team loses so they can finally come home because they changed the rules and said this is actually winning now but then when they're home they say why aren't you winning on the field and if you're with somebody who can't get straight
(23:56) what they want from you find someone who does I had a I had a relationship that I was super into for a very long time but at the end of the day they wanted different things out of life they were like these are the goals that I have and I was like these are the goals I have and like we amicably split I was like I hope you get all that stuff I'm not the guy for that but I hope you get it cuz if that's not a line then like we're just going to run into conflict later cuz one of us is going to have to give if there's two separate goals one
(24:21) person's goal is is going to have to give or you have the same goal and then you both give all you have to that one goal and so rather than being detractors the efforts become additive and then they stack on top of each other which is why the whole value of relationship or the strength of relationship is based on how much better they are together versus apart at the end of the day I think we all need someone who believes in us as much or more than we believe in ourselves bonus points if they are your spouse and double bonus points if uh
(24:43) you're that person for them if the if the whole point is to get the sum of the whole to be greater than the parts they have to believe that you can be better than you are and it's about being better not different than who you are and I think that's a big delineation that gets confused like they Define you being more the way I want you to be as better but it's really just different than who you are but if it's I want you to be more of who you are then that's better and if that better is also their better that's
(25:06) when I think the magic happens and if you can also do that for them then I think you have a really virtuous cycle of both people reinforcing one another to become better versions of the self themselves align with the goal that both of you already pre-agreed to saying that you wanted I think everyone should have obscenely high standards for the one person they're going to spend the rest of their life with but you can only have those obscenely high standards if you hold yourself to a higher standard than you hold them to Big goals plus big work
(25:29) equals ambitious big goals plus lazy equals entitled and I think most people feel entitled to an amazing spouse but they aren't ambitious about how they want to pursue them and so I think if we replaced a lot of this basically being mediocre and complaining about the mediocre selection you have with how do I hold myself to a higher bar than I'd hold my spouse to my future spouse too I think you'll find that future spouse but it's probably three or four iterations from who you currently are to deserve or be worthy of that spouse I think um
(26:03) Leila had someone asked her not in a weird way they're like how would I be able to get a girl like you she came to me afterwards and she was like I didn't want to say the mean thing which is like I would never be with someone like you like that's the real I think most of better marriages comes from becoming better people better people then are attracted to better people which then means that you have the very hard work of looking yourself in the mirror and saying like where am my deficient and if it's everywhere you start with the most
(26:30) important one and you start there I'm much wealthier now that my wife is in my life I'm in much better shape than when I met Ila I'm much less angry than when I met Lea I'm more patient than when I met Lea I'm Kinder than when I met Lea I have far more endurance and far more longsuffering and I experience a lot more joy in my life than when I met her there's no almost no stat that I have that has gone down if you find someone that is taking you away from more than one of your goals especially if they are priorities
(27:04) for you I think you're far less likely to change them and it' be far easier to find someone who is

Transcript:
(00:00) so if you're broke or you don't know what business to start by the end of this video you will know what business to start who you're going to serve how you're going to serve them and the exact message to send to get your first five customers I'm a co-owner of school.com where we help tens of thousands of new people every single month start their first business online and right now one out of two people who start a paid community on school make their first dollar one out of two this process I'm going to show you works so there's five
(00:27) parts of this Frameworks and then two bonuses one is that's a advance and one that'll give you next steps on what to do with this so you can make your first dollar so it starts with the what which is what is your business actually going to be about and so I use something called the three PS framework all right so you can write this down the three PS and that's because almost all businesses get born of one of these three PS the first is pain so it's something that you went through personally and had to overcome so A friend of mine has a wife
(00:59) well they're married and they have nine kids and so in her going through this process she was like well what would work for me and I'm like well you have nine kids so I'll bet you that you just making lunch for nine kids every day is probably a process she's like oh yeah I have this whole thing that I do so I organizes so everybody has their own uh bags and they all know who it is and then I can do it in a time that's cheap for me and gets them all the food that you know all the protein and all the other stuff in the Street's like I have
(01:25) a system around that and I was like that is the beginning of a business the second is your profession meaning what you do for a day job or what you've done in the past I've recently made a video about a lady who quit her job as a registered dietitian at a hospital and then started teaching other registered dietitians how to Bill insurance and the reason that she learned how to do that was at the hospital she had to work six days a week and work 12 plus hours per day as an RD and so she only had one day a week that she could bill her personal
(01:56) clients on the side and so she had to figure out this really complex Billing System and how to do it really quickly and so she took something that she learned from her profession and made a business around something really really narrow and so a lot of people think that it's got to be this big crazy thing if you solve one very specific problem for somebody that is a business and you might think oh well how am I going to get a huge following from all that this particular individual has 5,800 people who follow on Instagram and she takes
(02:22) home almost a million dollars a year in income and so if you're an accountant or you do HR or you edit videos or you do whatever like every single job that exists in a business means that fundamentally people exchange money for the skill you have and so any professional skill that you do in a business you can do as a consultant or as an independent contractor or teaching other people in that profession there's lots of tree branches that come off of that but this is the second big category that businesses are born from the third
(02:55) bucket of peas is Passion these are the things that you're always interested in these are the Articles you read these are the YouTube videos you watch these are the podcasts that you listen to in your spare time it's the stuff that you're just inherently interested in that you like can't get enough of and so for me personally I was somebody who was into fitness it was what I was reading I was reading tenation which none of you guys have even heard of but it was this blog online that had all of the lifters in there and all these trainers and
(03:21) coaches that were talk about stuff and every night I would eat my meal and I would read whatever the new T Nation articles were and I did that every single night and that's what my passion was and when I went to work the guys that I worked with are like dude if you don't start a gym like I will they like they offered to front me the money to start the gym because I was so obsessed with Fitness at the time and so if you're like okay well I overcame food allergies or I am an accountant or I'm into painting model cars got it but how
(03:47) am I going to turn that into a business don't worry that's what I'm covering in step five so let me break this belief for you really quickly that you need to get the perfect pick on the first try the reason this isn't accurate is that it assumes that you with zero context having not talked to customers and gotten zero feedback or are going to pick it right the reality of it is that picking anything is the first step because that begins the iteration process of feedback so that you can get it right so the five-step
(04:16) process I'm going to walk you through is going to get you to your best bad idea as fast as possible and the reason we say best bad idea is that we want to get it out there so that we can make it less wrong over time and if you keep making a bad idea less wrong eventually it becomes a good idea and then people say how did you pick that right on the first shot and you will smile and know that that's not actually how it worked so great if you have your first P you say I know what pain it is or what profession or what passion Now we move on to step
(04:45) two which is the who so who are you going to do this what for there's three categories that the who's are going to fit into the first is people like you the second is people that you've helped before and that can be for money or not for money but I'm assuming if you're watching this video that you haven't helped them for money you just did it as a favor which I'll tell you my story about that in a second and the third is people who you think are underserved now this is probably the more formal way that people look at markets that are
(05:14) growing that you think there's an emerging Trend it's people that have this huge demand and they're underserved this is probably the most formal way of doing it but most businesses that come from I would say the heart or the mind come from one of these two things it's I went through this thing and then I took a long time to figure it out and now that I had fig F out I want to help other people who are like me figure it out Sarah Blakeley was like man none of these underwear like you know hide the hide the bad and show the good and so
(05:39) then she created Spanx and then Spanx went on to sell for a billion dollars to blackon I think earlier last year and so you can absolutely build a massive business just trying to solve a very personal problem to yourself differently Zuck started in his dorm room to make some sort of platform for horny college kids that eventually would become face Facebook or for me specifically the reason I made my first dollar the first actual dollar that I ever made was there was a lady at the gym and she said she came to me and said hey can you help me
(06:10) with my food and it was just cuz I looked in shape and I was like sure and like I didn't know her super well and so we met at a pizza shop ironically and she and so she asked me to talk to her about her food and so I just asked her what she was buying for her groceries and gave her a couple of you know recipes that I did to increase her protein intake and at the end of me sitting at that pizza parlor with her for like an hour and a half she just took out her purse and wrote on a check $100 and she handed it to me I didn't
(06:36) sell her I didn't say a price she just handed me $100 for the amount of help that I'd given her and it was really weird because we walked out of the pizza parlor and then she got in her car and I like opened up the check again and I was like holy I could get paid to do this and it was this huge moment for me and forever always grateful Sandy Smith so once you figured out whether it's someone like you someone you've helped before or an underserved Market you pick one of these three things and then you plug them into this which is a call out
(07:03) and so the call out describes the person back to them this is going to be important for what we use in one of the later parts of this that's why if I had to pick one for you I would have it be this one because you already know what it's like to have the Pains of this person you're usually in the demographic you have you're in the age group and so you probably know a lot of the aspirations and dreams that they do rather than having do the research so this is the quick and dirty way and many many many businesses are started this
(07:29) way and in my opinion this tends to make mercenaries this tends to make missionaries and so what I mean by that is people who start purely based on analyzing markets and Trends and things like that they're like they're in it for the money they don't really care about the product or even the customer but if you're helping people like you overcome something that you overcame before you know their pain and you will care that much more to deliver an exceptional product and improve their experience over time and I
(07:56) think this is what keeps you in it for the LA ha and when you look at some of the biggest companies out there in the world many of them started with a Founder in a garage with some problem that they hated and then tried to fix so let me draw this on a new page to give you a really clear idea of why this next part is important if you're just like people like me that's not descriptive enough to get really clear on the Avatar and so I think about it as having five kind of frames that I think through to narrow down my avatar I've got the age
(08:27) gender profession like before because if you are going to use profession then you might as well say it got their problems or their pains and then we've got their interests or passions and you'll notice these are more or less than three PS from before okay and so what we do is you want to pick three and so let me give you an example so if I'm looking for 35-year-old men to it's not narrow enough right or if I just said 35-year old it's not narrow enough 35-year-old men who were accountants now I can get even narrower by adding more but you
(08:59) have to have at least Le three you want to do three or more so 35-year-old male accountants who uh are bored at their jobs right great well that's a pretty clear Avatar if I say that and there's a room full of 35-year-old male accountants who are aboard their jobs and that was in the other room that other room should light you up so think about it this way from a visual perspective if you could fill a room with just a certain type of person that You' get excited to go in there and help them what is that room of people look
(09:30) like what are they interested in what are the problems they're suffering from what what's their job now you could do the same thing and not have the profession but I'll give you an example so if I said 35-year-old or 45-year old women who are struggling to move up in the workplace okay that's at least three get the idea so you just want to get narrow enough that they know you're talking to them let me break a second belief for you that if you get really narrow it means you're not going to be able to make as much money because you don't
(09:58) have as many people to sell to the other part of that is the more specific you get the more you can charge so let me tell you something that might blow your mind so if I sold time management as my thing that's really really broad all right that's my what okay well I might be able to charge for my time management PDF I don't know 19 bucks okay now if I said I've got a time management product for salese then all of a sudden this is probably a $199 product if I said I have time management for outbound salespeople
(10:34) then that's going to be even more specific and this might be a 1999 product and if I said I have the entire outbound time management system for garden and power tools then this could be a $10,000 thing because anybody who's this specific with their Niche knows that they're going to be able to make a couple sales with this new system and more and pay for it and so as you get more specific with your prospect you can get more premium with your price and if you're the best at time management s for outbound sales rep that do garden
(11:10) and power tools how many competitors are you going against almost no one and so you're selling in a total blue ocean where it's just you with the with a life raft and all of them are in there in the pool around you struggling and then when you have your lifecraft and you're the only boat in town they've got to pay whatever you want in order to to scoop them out of the water if you're enjoying this process I run something called the school gam you can go to school.
(11:36) com games you can start for free I'll help you build your first business by taking you through Frameworks like this and many others and give you the platform to do it to make your first dollar right now more than one out of two people who start the school games with a paid Community make their first dollar online very proud of it so if you like that go check it out you can start for free so that's step two that's the who now we go to the how and there's two parts to the how how so let's cover those now so with how part one we think about the upside
(12:04) this is all the good stuff that you're going to help them achieve or experience as a result of using your thing all right so you want to think about how much easier their lives are going to be as a result of using your thing you want to think about how guaranteed the outcome is now as a result of using your thing you want to think about much faster they're going to be able to get what they want using your thing and you want to be able describe to them how it would feel to experience their dream scenario and so if these look familiar
(12:36) these are the four elements of the value equation but written in the positive and so the perfect offer is something that is incredibly easy guaranteed to happen immediate and is exactly what they want and the sub part of this is exactly the way they want to get it I'll give you a b a b example from gym launch so the average gym makes $30,000 in their first 30 days you using the gym launch system now the average gym owner makes $36,000 a year in take-home income so if they make $36,000 a year as take-home income
(13:09) then we can help them get what they want easier guaranteed faster and exactly what they wanted to do which was to fill their gym up and make money whatever benefits you sell there's some good stuff and so we want to say hey here's all this good stuff you want and here's how I make it easier faster guaranteed and this is what it looks like when it's right that's what we explain with the how part one so now that we've listed out all the good stuff let's flip over to how part two which is going to be the bad stuff and if you think about
(13:39) motivating an individual in general you fundamentally only have two things that are going to increase the likelihood that they do what you want you either have to take away the bad stuff that they don't want or give them more good stuff that they want that's it that's all you can do and so thinking about it from this framework has helped me so much in copyrighting in sales it's like you're either you're going to get this thing or you're going to avoid this thing you hate that's it and it's just how well you can describe either of
(14:05) these things which makes it more and more compelling which is why picking someone like you makes it easier to describe the very intricacies of their pain so for example if I said lose weight fast that might have worked in the 1900s but people quickly learn that they can't believe things that people say and so the more specific you are about the pain and the benefit the more likely they are to believe you if I say hey stop feeling your thighs chafing when you're out in the sun that's a very specific pain right and so someone would
(14:35) be like oh I I experienced that but it would pass their guard rails and their Banner blindness around ads and copy and marketing because it's very specific to their pain you want them to be like I can't believe they know this about me because you know it about you and you just describe it back to them so now we're going to talk about the bad stuff so these are the inverse of the things that I was mentioning earlier so instead of the guarantee we're going to talk about the risks that we're going to help them avoid instead of how fast it
(15:05) is we're going to talk about how slow it is for them that they're not going to have to experience that slowness instead of it being easy we're going to talk about all the pain and sacrifice and suffering that they have to go through in order to experience the benefit so the nice thing with this one particularly because there's going to be the most meat here in terms of what you're describing because the guarantee you to say this is where you state stats and you and you show what you've done what you plan to do the fast and easy
(15:34) you put a timeline around it and what they can expect versus the timeline of what's bad and with the ease there's two sides to this so one is what are all the good things they normally have to give up that they no longer have to give up with your system and what are all the bad things that they would normally have to start doing with other products or other services to solve this problem that with your product they don't have to start doing so let me give you an example so weight loss is simple so if I have to start working out and waking up
(16:08) early then that's something bad I don't want to start doing and so if you use my system you don't have to start doing this bad thing you don't want to do to get the result if I want to avoid the negative thing that you don't want to give up which is hey you like doing taco Tuesdays and eating out with your friends normally you'd have to give that up but with my system you can keep that thing you like without sacrificing it and still get the result and so you show both of these that make it easier because what makes things hard what
(16:35) makes things hard is doing things we don't like and giving up things we like and so if we have our solution that they can not have to do things they hate and keep doing things they love then they will like that better you might be thinking okay well I get the good stuff and the bad stuff for how part one and how part two but how do I get all this stuff well first off if it's you then you know what these pains are if it's not you then you do the three-letter method you ready for it ask people who you want to sell so you get on the phone
(17:04) you reach out to people and you basically do an interview now a good interview basically functions like a sales call which is like what are the problems you're struggling with right now how long have you struggled with them what makes it painful specifically can you describe what the experience is like when it's not right could you describe your ideal experience if it were done the right way what are some of the things you have to stop doing that you like doing that you don't want to stop doing when you've done things in
(17:25) the past what are the things that you have to start doing that you hate doing that you've had to start doing in the past in either of those scenarios in all of those scenarios you're learning more about the customer you're learning about their dreams and aspirations but the pains that they've experienced along the way and the culmination of all of those answers become how part one and how part two the good stuff you're going to help them get and the bad stuff you're going to help them avoid and if you're still
(17:46) wondering how am I going to make money from all this stuff don't worry we're going to get there right now step five putting it all together combine so this is the Mr Miyagi moment in Karate Kid where you've been waxing on and waxing off this entire time so you can get to the moment where you can finally get your car so we're going to do osim money Mad Lib we're going to drop everything in so I help who which we got from step two which is the combination of what the big thing's about and then narrowing it down through step one and step two I
(18:14) help who 35-year-old male accountants get a new income stream whatever the whatever the good thing that they want is Right which is how part one without how part two the bad stuff through and this is going to be the bonus that I'm going to cover in a second all right which is something called a unique mechanism all right so I'll cover that in a moment but fundamentally you could ignore this last part and this is the basic version of it and this is the more advanced one once you get some reps and the reason I'm
(18:43) going to explain that one in a second is because if you haven't done it yet you don't have a unique process and so if you're just starting out this is me meeting you where you're at I help who get good stuff without bad stuff I help 45-year-old women who just had kids get into High School get back into their High School jeans without giving up time with their family I help non-fiction business authors get on the Wall Street Journal bestseller list without looking cringe and listen it doesn't have to be like you don't have to perfectly do this
(19:14) every time I could just say I help young guys starting school for the first time pick their Community under 30 minutes like it's just if you can nail them then the person's like shoot that's me right the more you add these pieces in they're like that's exactly what I'm struggling with this is exactly what I want and then the unique mechanism makes it nice and sexy so now that we hit the bonus let's go to the bonus section so the bonus number one is going to be something called the unique mechanism all right now the reason I wanted to
(19:43) combine it before the unique mechanism is that if you are starting out you might not have a unique process yet all right but a unique mechanism is something that differentiates Your solution from other peoples so if there's two people in your Market or 10 or 100 people in your Market one you could probably go narrower your Who and the problem you're trying to help them solve but let's assume that you did that and there's still 10 people that all help 35-year-old male accountants you know uh watch Friends reruns because
(20:08) that's your passion without feeling the Judgment of other people because you have a cool streaming platform or you know access between all these other ones that allow them to do it for free whatever okay so let's say that that's your Niche and there's 10 other people who are serving them what you want to have is some unique mechanism and this is not a new Marketing Concept you want to have some sexiness or some special sauce that makes the prospect think oh I'm going to push all of my hopes and dreams into this process like if I had
(20:38) only had this special sexy thing I was six inches away from gold and then I just needed this thing to get me over the hump and the point is that that's what they should feel like oh if I just had had this thing all along I would have already been successful so it's like you have this secret that you can help them be successful with and the proof is in the pudding and so even if you think about this YouTube video as a product if you wanted to the unique mechanism is the five-step process or the five-step niche narrowing the niche
(21:05) narrowing nunchuck right because it's a a wax it on the head so let me explain how this works is that you're going to either have a list or steps that someone has to follow to achieve a result fundamentally that's what it is you're either going to say you have to do all these things so just think of checklist like once you have done all four of these things you'll achieve the outcome or you have to follow this in sequence you have to do one and then you have to do two and then you have to do three and then four the difference here
(21:30) is that these don't have to be in order you just have to do them all here you have to do them in a specific sequence but either way you're going to have a list or a step a series of steps that someone's going to follow and then all you do is that you wrap this whole thing and then you name it because this becomes your proprietary process and that proprietary process becomes your unique mechanism if you've heard me talk about content we have promise proof plan and so it's hey I'm going to help you pick your Niche by the end of this video
(22:03) proof is that I've helped tens of thousands of people do this on school so are pretty good at it and then the plan is we're going to follow these five steps Tada and here we are and so that process we can call the mosy money Niche method whatever so if you've heard of P90X the unique mechanism they had was muscle confusion right and obviously a zillion Fitness influencers like there's no such thing as muscle confusion and they're right but the thing is is it was unique mechanism they sold hundreds and hundreds and hundred hundreds of
(22:29) millions of dollars of fitness programs using it if you look at Weight Watchers they have a point system the point system is their unique mechanism if you look at some of these other ones they have their XYZ portion control thing like they all have a unique mechanism their way of doing it think of this as the vehicle this is going to take them from where they are to where they want to go and you're the one who's piloting this ship with them in the back seat or they're piloting it with you in the back seat with you as the guide the point is
(22:56) is that that becomes the special sauce and everybody should do this and that's where you can have the naming conventions I cover naming stuff in my last chapter here on the offers book where I either like something that rhymes or I like alliteration if I can if I can do it so as promised if you're following this process then you got the what which helped you narrow down the who you followed the steps in that to Niche down to figure out very specifically who the Avatar was Someone Like You someone you've helped before or
(23:22) someone who's underserved we did the good stuff we looked at the bad stuff we put it all together into one sentence so you can immediately use it if you're a little more advanced then you figured out your unique mechanism or your system or your process or your method to put it all together so they're like wow this is exactly what I need so what's this last bonus well I said I'd help you get your first five customers so let's do that all right so I'm going to give you the absolute simplest system for getting
(23:43) your first five customers using what we just had and so what you do is you will greet someone greetings hello you will mention something specific about them that's a compliment you'll insert that sentence that we just went up with came up with and then you'll ask them if they know anybody who could benefit from that and you will do this for 4 hours per day or until you reach a 100 I don't care which you can do four hours a day or until you reach a 100 and if you do this every day and you make this process what you reach out to people you
(24:19) will get five customers I outline this entire process inside of the leads book in the first chapter called warm Outreach to help you get your first five customers and if you like me to help you lead along and you want to do it via community you can go to school.com games I walk people I literally walk thousands of people through this every single month uh so we're pretty good at it like I said more than one out of two people make their first dollar online so um check it out
Brutally Honest Advice to My Younger Poorer Self - YouTube
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ln24y0FPJHo

Transcript:
(00:00) this is my most brutally honest advice to my younger self you can beat 99% of people simply by continuing to work without needing your immediate reward this bit is advice to my younger s on how I work harder you're going to lose sleep you'll doubt whether it'll work you'll stress to make ends meet you won't finish your to-do list you'll wonder if you made the right call and have no way to know for years but that's what hard feels like the other great reason for working harder is that the harder you work the more you realize
(00:22) what you used to think was hard work isn't even close to what you're capable of because if you want to know what the most dangerous money-making combo in the world it's work ethic and time because once you real realiz just how much more work it takes to get from good to Great you realize you can only be gr at a few things and you're forced to ignore the rest the amount of work it takes to be good negates the ability to be great at more than one or two things cuz there's just only so much time it just takes work shitloads and shitloads of work and
(00:46) every time I dress it up or cut a corner I get brutally reminded by life that the work just needs doing so yes this is your friendly reminder that it's okay to work on weekends I used to think that if I worked on something for a day it was a lot I was like dude I worked on this for a whole day that was like a huge amount of work work and I would say that to someone to show them how hard I worked and then it became like I worked on this for a week and then a month and I would say now that I can work on the same
(01:07) project for a year or two years and that's what like to the books has been huge projects for me my quickest shorthand on the shift in work is that I started counting in hundreds hundreds of minutes hundreds of hours hundreds of days towards a specific goal if you count in hundreds it just automatically forces you to do a significantly larger amount of effort just sheer volume of work I think one of my favorite Parables about work is that there was an art class they SP split the class into two groups and one group they said make the
(01:33) absolute best pot and turn in one pot and the other group they said make as many pots as you possibly can at the end of the semester the team that had to make as many pots as soonly possible not only made more pots but also ended up making better pots than the one that spent all of their time trying to make one I think a lot of people need that permission to have a lot of shitty first drafts in order to start working harder on anything but that's not how I operate because for me I would rather spend a lot more time on my first draft so I
(01:58) don't have to make so many more edits if if you do it the right way you realize how many hours you're going to have to put into something and usually most people that I feel like haven't done that level of effort confront the work and then they get scared about it I have to find a different way this can't actually be how people do this that is how you do it the work just needs doing and no one's going to do it for you I started with a normal hourly job and I think a lot of people do a lot of early job thoughts or lessons are that when
(02:23) you show up to work you are working because you're getting paid to be there when you start working for yourself you're not getting paid to be there you're only getting on what you do I've gone on vacations with other entrepreneurs they're like man we had a crazy workday I was like I was with you homie like that was not a work these are off days for me like these aren't like real work days because work occurred it to me is not a work day unless I have a clear output for what I have done or move forward work didn't happen the
(02:47) longer you can delay when you need to be rewarded for the work that you do the greater the outcome is it's kind of like a plane taking off the longer the runway the bigger the plane and so a lot of people can barely even get a bottle rocket off the ground because they have such a short attention span and such a need for immediate reward if you feel like you're behind where you should be by now if you feel like you're losing if you're not sure it's going to work there's nothing wrong with you that is entrepreneurship you're
(03:13) on the right path you're doing the right things you're seeing the Milestones along the way but the Milestones aren't parades it's uncertainty it's a Sleepless nice it's not knowing if you can make payroll it's not even being sure that the 5 years you put into this idea is actually going to turn into something that you'll get credit for eventually the biggest shift that I had internally during those harder times was that I am the output of my work all of this effort is to create who I want to become I get to use that as my reward
(03:39) every day rather than the approval of strangers sitting in uncertainty is the feeling of Entrepreneurship you're not doing it wrong like that's what it feels like it's kind of this weird dichotomy of feeling like you never have enough time but then you also have all the time in the world the biggest reason that a lot of entrepreneurs don't succeed is because they're in a rush the rush is what creates poor decisions and so they consistently hop from thing to thing to thing because they think this thing will get them there faster by hopping
(04:02) consistently they guarantee that they'll never get there and I think we have a culture that rewards speed because everybody wants things fast and easy in $100 Milli offers the book I talk about value you have a dream outcome and then you have basically everything that discounts or multiplies it a discount would be risk associated with it I want this thing but I want it to be guaranteed I want it to be easy and I want it to be fast and Entrepreneurship is literally the opposite of that the dream outcome's there but it is not
(04:26) guaranteed incredibly hard and takes forever the problem is that that it's so compelling to sell people on that and there's so many more ad dollars that go into it's fast it's easy and it's guaranteed that it's really tough to shift the landscape of the language around entrepreneurship because there's just so much money to be made by making that promise the concept of the the billionaire who like starts back over and they're like could he do it again it's like well of course the problem with the show is is that they give you
(04:52) 90 days the premise is wrong and I get why they do it is because they have to cater to people who think that way which is most people can you build a million dollar business in 90 days but it's like but he could build a much bigger business in 2 years and that billionaire would probably never build the business that he builds on the show so it actually reinforces the wrong perspective from a brand Foundation perspective it's how can I build a reputation over a long period of time not necessarily with the intent to
(05:16) transact but simply to build a reputation associating myself with these positive things that takes time for one lots of people to find out about you and two for a lot of people to develop a strong affinity and make multiple associations with you so that it's stronger the classic example of that is somebody who makes content for 5 years and then launches a product and the product's immediately a billion dollar thing well it's not that they made a billion dollars in a year it's that they spent 5 years letting the roots go down
(05:38) for the bamboo tree and then eventually it shoots up right on the other hand you've got kind of product based Foundation software you might take a long time to code and like write a huge code based that could go after some big problem it can be regulatory stuff because if you want to get into like banking for example there's lots of barriers to entry even if you're starting an e-commerce brand you would be talking to different manufacturers you'd be going through prototypes you'd be trying things out you'd be testing it
(05:57) in beta groups to get feedback and then you'd probably have some sort of capital investment to capitalize your first inventory run all of those things are the foundations the reason I like service businesses for people who are starting out is that you don't have to do either of those things but if you had one or two or both of those things then you can create something bigger faster on a longer time Horizon it's actually the classic example of how long do you sharpen the axe if someone is doing a business that they have no leverage
(06:22) because they built no Foundation they basically just take whatever ax is given to them and they just start hacking away at the tree except in the game of business the tree might be mile wide and the axe that you have could be a lightsaber if you spend enough time sharpening it even if it took one guy a year of going from dull axe to lightsaber he would still catch up at year two and then from year 2 to 10 doesn't even get close to the other guy but the problem is that everybody listens to everyone else who's judging
(06:47) them on their time rizon like you quit your job on a employee time rizon your family is like have you started making money yet and you're like it's been 2 weeks they're like well yeah this is when you would normally get a paycheck your measuring stick has to change when you get into a different game sometimes the f fastest way to get to a million a year isn't the fastest way to get to $10 million a year and to the same degree the fastest way to get to 10 isn't the fastest way to go to 100 if we're measuring effort in terms of stress and
(07:09) hours per day running a local restaurant takes the same amount of work as building an application that could be a billion dollar application and it might take you a few years for a restaurant to build a reputation in the area get locals coming in hire and train good talent like it takes a lot of work to do all that stuff and to the same degree hiring really good development engineers and creating a prototype like the actual work and stress is almost identical it's almost like you have three slot machines that you're going up to and they all
(07:34) cost the same cost but one of them has a billion dollar payout one has a $10 million payout and one has $100,000 payout and everyone just lines up for the $100,000 payout the third variable if we're going to like make this in terms of Dimensions the next one is how long are we measuring the payout for the slot machine we assume that slot machines pay out immediately but if one slot machine pays out now one pays out in a year and one pays out in 5 years what if the odds were the same but you only got one coin which one would you do
(07:59) people will say they would do the billion dollar one but based on their behavior they're just standing at the at the the fast token machine not being able to break it the fact that you don't know if it's going to work is exactly what makes it worth doing it's why entrepreneurship isn't for the faint of heart you have to embrace uncertainty what makes entrepreneurship isn't the work itself it's actually just not knowing if the work will work we're afraid of wasted effort but if it makes you better then no effort is wasted and
(08:23) as as long as you can make that connection you're not going to burn out you're just doing what it takes the biggest metal lesson of my entire life was when I lost everything the first time I had sold all the gyms and then that was my Nest Egg for my 5 years of work even though it was not as much as I had hoped but it was still something and then I put that all into the next thing and then lost it all but after losing it all I was able to immediately go out and make $100,000 the next month with nothing maxing out a credit card to do
(08:47) it that moment was when I was like oh like I thought that the gyms were the thing that I had built but it was my skills is the thing that I had built I consider skills income Insurance you just know that you will be able to make money people want to invest in the stock market because they want to have a retirement if you invest in skills that is your retirement because you will always be able to trade them for money and whether the money is in Bitcoin cells or dollars you'll always be able to trade something of value and I'm sure
(09:10) this is going to piss off the exact same people that we think it's going to piss off you don't need a weekend like the concept is barely 100 years old it's a modern invention right what you really need is work that you don't need a weekend from instead of thinking about work life balance as like a 7-Day Work Week think about work life balance as like on like a 7-year time Horizon and so like there are seasons of work and there are seasons of less work my goal would always be that I just never have something I want to retire from in some
(09:33) ways you could say I retired from owning gyms for a while but I haven't retired from work I don't think anyone who wants to live a long life should retire from work all the people that I know who are really old they pretty much die when they stop working I've seen the people who stay alive the longest have reasons to stay alive and work is a good one the problem is that everyone's idea like the masses who are listening to this their idea of what work is is not what I'm talking about theirs is like the soul sucking work at a job you hate for a
(09:55) boss that doesn't appreciate you for a company that doesn't do good in the world I completely understand why you would not be motivated to do that and you would want to get away from that as soon as possible you'd be amazed at how much faster you can get to your goals when you don't go backwards 104 days a year contrary to what the mediocre masses will tell you weekends can also be for work we had a contractor once who said I quit my job so that I wouldn't have to work weekends and he was upset that he had worked a weekend you do not
(10:18) have an accurate estimation of reality if you think that starting a business is going to mean that the first business you ever start you're not going to work weekends right now if I started a business I could take weekends if I wanted to but I think it's cuz there's a level of skill you have to get to to get there a buddy of mine was talking to me about how he had an employee who was asking for like 6 weeks of paid vacation they had like not a lot of experience was like I need this time he's like well I tell you what he's like what if I give
(10:41) you 110 days a year off paid would that work they were like yeah he's like cool that's weekends and federal holidays if you just don't go backwards on weekends you can move ahead so much faster if you go out drinking or you do your cheat days on the weekend then you can undo all of the work that you're doing in the rest of the days of the year and be neutral or even negative at the end of the year depending on how bad off track you go during those 104 days from a business perspective you might get inquiries over the weekend if you don't
(11:08) work your leads over the weekend you start in a deficit you might lose those sales if you generate income during the week and then you don't on weekends it's 104 days a year that you're not generating income out of 365 you're also going into a deficit that you have to then make up for in the first two days so let's say that the two-day negative has to get offset by two days of positive then you're really only working three days now you compare that to somebody who's either not losing Steam on the weekends or actually getting
(11:32) ahead on the weekends that person isn't moving ahead like twice as fast they're moving ahead like seven times as fast and so I think that's the piece that a lot of people are missing is they'll look at somebody who's further ahead be like well this person works like this it's like well if you work the same amount as them they're actually going to keep getting further ahead so you have to work as much as them to match probably a little bit more because they're more skilled at working than you are and then even more to get ahead
(11:51) success is the only Revenge as you expand they shrink into irrelevance as you get louder no one can hear them you don't beat them you cast a shadow so big no one can see them to begin with because at the end of the day there's no greater waste of time than justifying your actions to people who have a life that you don't want and there's no amount of pain you can inflict on a hater that will be more painful than their own life last part was from Leila like there is no retaliation there's no retribution there's no actual Revenge so
(12:20) I have beaten a lot of business people in the field people that I saw as competitors like where it was very clear we're going head-to-head for a market what's really weird is that when you actually win when someone actually goes out of business it's like not cool you don't like spit on their corpse you're just like oh there is a Tipping Point at some point where you start to gain an advantage you start to separate from them but then like they start flailing and acting erratic and trying to get ahead and then that further you know
(12:42) they go down that vicious cycle because you their hater in their mind or their competition the biggest mistake in my career I made because of a competitor that mistake cost me somewhere in the neighborhood of $25 million actual money not like like oh this is an opportunity that I like I actually lost like $25 million on this and I just swore to myself that I would never let somebody else dictate my behavior winners focus on winning losers focus on winners so the same thing goes with competitors winners focus on customers competitors
(13:08) focus on winners they're always trying to copy you but because they're trying to copy you they're not looking at their customers they're looking at you and so they're completely distracted they're not looking at the data source that matters most first off if anyone ever copies you you've already won because they need you you don't need them you should be afraid when people stop copying you because it means you've got nothing and so I see people copying what I'm doing as a positive sign that I'm on the right path rather than a distraction
(13:31) that merits all of my attention getting redirected to trying to destroy someone if you walk like downtown in any City well that building is a $400 million building and that building is $400 million that's how much money a billionaire has everything else that's there is still up for grabs there's so much out there it's super hard to comprehend when we had 5,000 plus gyms in gym launch I think we had 45 gyms in Atlanta they would be like well there's another gym down the street I'm like there's also 1,500 gyms in Atlanta so
(13:56) the 45 that are all gym launch gyms are just going to do do better than the other 1,455 the pie is so much bigger than people think it is if you feel like you are the output of your life at the end of your life who you are is the thing that is the thing that you became then competition is good for you like if you look back at that that person would you want that person to have no challenges like if you were at the end of your life and you looked back would You' be like I'm glad I overcame no adversity I'm glad no one ever put me to the test I'm
(14:20) glad I never got to see what I was truly capable of I'm glad I never had to risk it all when the chips were down you would never say that we just don't like going through it in the short term but we do want the outcome of it if you just accept that that's the price tag for the person you want to be then you just pay it willingly my two simple lenses for friendship number one do they genuinely root for you when you win number two do they make you better finding people who do even one of those two things is rare
(14:42) both is even rarer which is why they get the highest title of friend one of the highest Roi trads in life that you can make is all the fake friends that you have for one real friend that has your back even when all seems lost bonus points if it's your spouse the rear people in your life who root for you to hit your goals are more valuable than the goals that themselves consider yourself lucky if you find even one human who believes in you more than you do and never let them go when you start out people are happy for you that you're
(15:06) doing something but I this is going to be really [ __ ] up but I actually think that people are happy that you quit your job because it counts you out of the race because the likelihood that you win is so low and so they're happy because you're actually taking a step back you literally take a step back in income take a step back in status because you're not doing as well like I went from a white collar job to being a personal trainer like it was a big step back so any of my peer group were like oh yeah so good that you're doing that
(15:29) if I had immediately jumped and started a tech startup and raised $100 million they probably immediately wouldn't have been happy for me I think the reason that you get that Underdog rooting in the beginning is because you actually take a step down in status and so their relative standing actually increases so they encourage you but then as you come up your success reminds them of the dreams that they didn't pursue to begin with it also reminds them that you started with probably the same resources and that's why it's so hard to go home
(15:51) for a lot of people because everyone who you grew up with in middle school and high school you become a glaring example of what they could have done but didn't it's what you make them think about themselves astonishingly more people know what they should do than claim to know what they should do there's usually a voice on some level acting is a hypothetical punishment they haven't actually experienced yet for taking an action that they haven't done yet because we fear this hypothetical punishment we don't take the real action
(16:13) a lot of people just stay stuck there there was one specific voice that I was like really afraid of for selling gym launch because I thought 46 million wasn't enough that that person would be impressed and then what I thought about was like this person is going to prevent me from like this person's opinion I like what do I care he can do his own life what if he does sell his company for more money than me does that mean I suck no it just means that like I decided to do something he decided to do something I'm only ascribing value to
(16:32) this person's SP just cuz I know who they are there's 100, times more people who I don't know who beating me than the ones that I do so why would I listen to this one person unless someone is ahead of you take their hate as envy and then disregard it Envy is when you want something that someone else has jealousy is when you fear losing something that you have so if you've got your girl and some guy comes up you get jealous if someone has a girl that you wish you had you experience Envy so Envy is about something you don't have jealousy about
(16:58) fear of losing something you do if people are further behind you then they're envious of you if someone's ahead of you then they're afraid that you're going to take what they have mind you in either of those scenarios it doesn't matter I see hate as feedback nothing more nothing less and I think feedback is worth taking into consideration and what level of validity there is so if someone says hey you copied my entire business and you've never met them well you know that that's not true I had this guy come up to me
(17:22) saw me on the street randomly he was like hey man I need to apologize to you for what I've like really really hated you for a long time why he's like because you stole the closer framework from me and I was like dude I don't know who the [ __ ] you are he was like let's be honest like what's the likelihood that we both came up with the same acronym and I was like hi you take an acronym that's for a closer and then you fit the words I actually went back I found my first document that had closer on it and I screenshotted the date and
(17:46) it was before he had started selling he squashed it and I was like you're copying me [ __ ] I said it jokingly cuz I don't give a [ __ ] the hates feedback if I'm getting data from the environment it's data it's not good or bad it just is if everybody ahead of you is afraid that you're going to beat them that's probably decent data if everybody behind you is envious of where you're at that's probably decent data to know if people are all trying to sue you at the same time for something then maybe there's something there that you
(18:08) shouldn't have done that you did it's the second layer of judgment is the one that everyone gets in trouble with this thing happened now I'm going to ascribe meaning to it what does the hate mean doesn't mean anything it's just feedback and then you take the data and do whatever you want with it sadness comes from a lack of options which is why it feels like hopelessness anxiety comes from many options but a lack of priorities which is why it feels like paralysis looking everywhere but moving nowhere solve sadness with knowledge and
(18:31) anxiety with a decision understanding this changed my life let's say somebody gets really depressed cuz they get laid off why are they sad because they have a perceived lack of options if I have five job offers on my table am I sad that I got laid off because my job offers are better than one that I just left no now if I had 100 options on the table I might have anxiety because I have too many options and I don't know which one to do it's a perceived lack of options with sadness you don't know what to do because you don't know anything to do
(18:51) with anxiety you don't know which to do disappointment is when an expectation was UNM you neither change your expectations or change reality the stoic frame for that is that you imagine all the things that could have gone worse I mean there's a lot of frames but that's one of them the other one is that you imagine that that thing happens a thousand times in a row what would you feel on the thousandth time probably nothing why because you'd already adjusted your expectations and if you already adjusted your expectations then
(19:09) you can adjust them now Buddhist monks fundamentally basically do that they just change nothing externally and only change internally which is fine but to a certain degree like I want to benefit humanity and I don't know how beneficial that is and to be fair me saying that I want to do that also creates an expectation of myself which I could be let down for so like I do create a possibility that I am let down by saying I want to help people and if I don't help them then I would be disappointed you can shoot big as long as you don't
(19:30) make missing mean that you suck I think that being has been the best goal for me to pursue because it's the one that's 100% under my control if I have something that is disappointing that occurs what type of person do I want to be in this instance and then what would that man do and as closely as I can map my actual Behavior to that person's the more joy I will experience because I'm present in doing the things that I think I should be doing and I can still give myself kudos for how well I handled a shitty situation and then end up
(19:54) deriving Joy from something that otherwise might have been bad I remember seeing this quote once I was like if you follow your own advice you'd already be way further than you currently are and I thought about that and I was like yeah I don't think I need to follow anyone else's advice I think I should be doing the things I already know I should be doing then you just have like kind of the emotional component of feeling like you want to maybe release something or whatever and me being able to talk to my future version of myself in a dialogue
(20:15) format allows me to get Grace from a future version of self and also get approval from a future version of self so somebody that I esteem higher than myself is future may who's hopefully better and his judgment on my current situation and his advice it tends to be really good advice the best advice I've gotten has been from future no one's afraid of failing they're afraid of what other people will think of them when they fail but if they're afraid of that imagine what those other people think of you when you're not even trying well the
(20:41) reality is they're not at all if they don't have what you want don't listen to what they say having what you want is a really easy evidence Point that's high likelihood basically it decreases the risk of whatever advice they're providing that's not a perfect frame cuz there are amazing Olympic coaches that never won the goal the fastest way to move forward in life is listen to people who can give you advice that can get you there faster so not having to suffer and experience and waste all that time and back step to learn the lesson to move
(21:06) forward and So the faster you can avoid those lessons and just keep moving forward the faster you move but the problem is we don't know who to trust and so I have made seven levels of how I weigh advice that have served me well at the lowest level number seven comments on social media which is basically comments from strangers who don't know me and don't have what I want number six people giving their two cents who do know me but don't have what I want number five someone who knows me and knows someone who went to where I'm
(21:31) trying to go number four someone who's been there number three someone who took someone else there number two someone who took someone just like me to exactly where I want to go and number one someone who has been there took someone else there just like me multiple times do I trust somebody who's taking someone else there because I am the someone else more than someone who's only taking themselves there cuz if someone's taking someone else there then I could slot in and there's a likely they could do it again if they've only taken themselves
(21:55) there and not taken anyone else there then they might not be a very good teacher which happens all the time Michael Jordan has an insane record playing basketball has a very poor record owning a basketball team I'm big on give give give until they ask right especially if you're starting out the best thing to do is give away step for free for multiple reasons one because you probably suck because you haven't done it yet and it's a gift if someone allows you to work for them because you have a chance at providing value and
(22:21) from there you can leverage that into testimonials referrals and potentially even a paying customer they might if you continue to provide this value for free eventually say hey I've got too many people providing for free I have too much Demand on my time at price of free and I can go to 20% of the price that I want to go to and if everyone says yes and you still have demand then you go to 40% of the price and then 60 and then 100 and then then 500% right and you keep going but what happens is a lot of people will Short change that and so I
(22:43) get DMS every day of people saying Hey I want to give you value in exchange for and it's just stop don't tell me what value you want to give me and what you want to trade that value for and usually it's them actually massively undervaluing my time as though them making it free to me is somehow more valuable than me paying for something like I have tons of money I don't have tons of time and so it's my much scarcer resource this kid was like yeah I have a lot of advice that I think I can give you on social media and I click over his
(23:09) profile he's got 100 followers and he said I'll do it in exchange for a testimonial and it was just like it was so blind to reality first off you have no evidence that you're good second off it's delusion and so the way to do it right is to go above and beyond do a ton of work and then just give it to the person not in exchange for or an expectation of but just give it to that person and then guess what will happen nothing cuz most times if someone's way ahead of you they might not want it or might not need it but you make your best
(23:34) approximate guess of what they might need do your best shot at it there's probably three things that can happen one most likely nothing happens they don't respond to you they don't care the second option is that they see how hard you worked on something and even though they don't need that thing everyone one level up needs people who work hard on things and then so you still prove how hard you work by how good the thing that you give is and so they might have an opportunity for you not even in in the main thing but on something else and
(23:56) then the third and probably the least least likely but probably the one you want the most is that they say wow that's amazing I would love for you to do that now to be fair most of the people on my team came from doing that you roll the dice and people roll the dice one time with their time and say I did this work for this one guy and he didn't immediately hire me on retainer but did you do it for 100 people if you give tremendous value to 100 people you'll be able to make more income than most jobs in America simply by providing
(24:22) a tremendous amount of value to 100 business owners one of them or five of them will respond back and say yes I would like more work from you or I can offer you a job I was afraid to charge people money but I did want them to like be invested and so I started a nonprofit called the free training project where I said if they donated $500,000 the charity of their choice I would train them for 12 weeks that's how I got my first customers but then after the 12 weeks some of them were like I still want to keep training with you and I was
(24:45) like hey I'm the charity now I am poor please help me that's literally it literally at the end of 12 weeks I was like I think I want to do this full-time CU I did it while I still have my job and then I was like I think I want to do this full time I hope you guys are okay with this I like if you could pay me instead I just kind of like everyone did no one had any problems with it

(00:00) we are all one decision away from changing our lives forever and a lot of us don't even know it and the difference between the decisions you make today and the ones that you made last year if they've gotten you to where you are right now they were not good decisions and so if we want to have more power in our lives we have to first understand what power is and second how to unlock it through the actions and decisions that we make and if you have a company or a business or a job where you need to influence other people or you need to get people to say yes or you need people to make decisions or most importantly make decisions for yourself that are going to change your life for the better
(00:28) then we have to understand what the topic means if you don't know who i am my name is austral mostly i own acquisition.com and 10 years ago i was sleeping on a gym floor and 10 years later i am now in my mom's basement that is how much better my life getting this is actually penthouse and i like to work in a closet because i like having the quiet and not having distractions but uh my life has gone significantly better uh and i recently spoke at coaching con and they wanted me to talk about this specific topic because there was a series of events and decisions that made
(00:54) massive differences in my life and i broke them down and after i gave the speech and got off stage i had hundreds of people who messaged me saying that that uh speech was one of the things that made them take huge strides in their life and honestly made them more powerful and that is all i want for you mostly nation is to become more and more powerful so that we can all make the world a better place all right so enjoy the presentation and i'll see you guys the other side it's just great to be here so thank you guys so much i promise that i will do my absolute
(01:18) best to give you a high return on your attention uh because it's the most valuable thing you guys have i just want to thank you for investing here with me today so that being said uh the reason i went up with gold diggers because we all know who's the real person who makes the money in the family um and so i i picked right that's by the way the best passive income strategy in existence is just to marry someone rich um they don't talk about that one right the uh the second thing though that i want to talk about is uh is power and i think that actually before i
(01:56) get into that who here wants to be powerful awesome and that's not everybody raised their hand which is interesting and i think i find it interesting because i ask that question sometimes and in an audience sometimes it's easier to remain anonymous but one-on-one when you stare at someone's eyes you're like do you want to be powerful a lot of people shrink away from that and i think it's because at least me when i was coming up i had negative associations with the word to me power was like the emperor in uh star wars you know the
(02:26) lightning old fingers and everybody and so to me that was like power but i saw it as a negative thing and i feel like as i developed i started to learn that power is neutral you can be incredibly powerful and bad incredibly powerful and good and so the idea is if we can harness power then it amplifies who we are and if we're shitty people then we're very very shitty people and we're very good we're very very good and so i hope that all of us aspire to have more power in our lives and that is the underlying theme of the presentation i'm gonna talk
(02:56) to you guys about today so decision making who's so excited about decision making well i'll give you the sub headline which is selling with logic to make lots of money and i think there are different selling styles when i because i've trained a lot of sales teams we've built a lot of sales teams sold a lot of different industries now people sell differently who here would consider themselves like an emotional seller like you get like emotionally invested in the prospect you get them to cry anybody like that i'm saying cool who here is somebody who is
(03:32) uh is more of a like i'm not going to let you leave type so you know who you are just raise your hand i am that way too sometimes all right just me fair enough um and then the third is kind of logical selling which is like let's just talk through this and if it makes sense let's do it if it doesn't no worries between those three types i i tend to actually be more of a logical seller in general and i've gotten a lot of a claim rightfully or not that was wild um sorry i actually have a fear of birds um so
(04:07) this was about to be a very short presentation and so and so a lot of the a lot of my like success using logic and sales has given me a lot of acclaim and this is the first presentation that i've put together so this is just for you guys this is a brand new presentation because i've been thinking about like reverse engineering what are the things what are the frameworks we think about to get to yes right and the yes that i want from somebody is not a yes i'm going to buy but yes i'm going to decide and i think
(04:36) if you can delineate that for yourself too it takes a little bit of the pressure off selling because my goal is to give this person power and you have to understand what power is in order to give it right who here knows the definition of power go for it i love that thought to existence is what he said which is actually a really favorite way so the dictionary definition is the ability to influence or direct events or people that's the dictionary definition but i love how you said it because as i see omnipotence so god or a
(05:08) god figure would be as they think it appears so the the distance between thoughts and reality are ins there's there is no distance right that would be an omnipotent being if he thinks the world the world exists right and so as we take steps towards that as the ideal we become more powerful and if we can do that for our prospects we can allow them to step into the person they want to be and make a decision to own their [ __ ] one way or another does that make sense cool all right so let's rock so this will either be
(05:38) the best presentation on sales you've ever heard the worst presentation on sales you've ever heard or somewhere in between that is a promise all right and so i thought it would make sense to start with this we have a high this is charlie munger who's probably like my number one hero in this season of my life we have a high moral responsibility to be rational and i think that getting someone to rationally decide is important because emotional buyers oftentimes get excited they'll buy and then who's had somebody who calls him two days later is like i don't know why
(06:08) anybody raise your hand just so you know you're not alone okay and what happens is it's just like dating i think layla talked about it yesterday if you have a rational foundation for a relationship or a decision when the emotions fade the logic will continue and so it's good to answer both sides of the decision-making process the short-term side is the emotion that gets you to decrease your action threshold and take a step right but the logic is what makes it stick and actually makes a great customer all right and so
(06:37) for me and i think that the further along you get in business and the higher up you get in business the more you'll see people who tend to make more logical decisions more logic first decisions and fewer and fewer emotional decisions all right so what does being a rational sorry what does rational logical have to do with selling well you have logical buyers and you have emotional buyers in general right most people sit on this continuum one way or the other and emotionally people want to believe you people want
(07:08) to buy you must help their logical brains justify the decision that they already want to make think about it that way they want to buy from you you have to help them all right so who here identifies actually i'll skip through this emotional logical you're probably in between anybody in between these two anyone all right then you'll love this so before we get started i thought i would give you a few beliefs about selling that have served me very well throughout the years number one people want to believe you they want to buy you must help their logical blames
(07:43) brains justify the decision two selling happens before you ask for the sale closing happens after so you're selling for a lot longer period of time but the moment you kind of like take your pants off and you're like this is what it is that's when you're closing right you have now solicited now you close three it's easier to handle obstacles than objections i'll get to what the difference between those are in a second that being said expect and plan for no it is not failure it is expected so stop being surprised it's one of the first things we talk new sales guys into is
(08:26) expect no that's not like that's a part of this if they already were going to say yes then you are not necessary no is the job right if they could make the decision on their own they would just send you the money right the reason they're struggling is because they can't and they need your help which is why sales is actually the first step in coaching and i see sales as power if you can have the ability to direct or influence others that is power and i feel like it should be made much cooler than i feel like it is five if you didn't get a gasp from a price tag
(09:02) you didn't go high enough this is another belief so for those who are afraid to raise your price if you're not getting gasps you're not going high enough straight up and when you do it that way you can always walk down and have a beautiful price anchor right when you say a hundred thousand dollars first a grand feels like a rounding error it's true but when i say ten dollars first like i'm saying right now ten dollars and i say a thousand sounds way [ __ ] bigger doesn't it so you gotta get the gas and you gotta train your guys if you have a team
(09:33) they have to be comfortable with no and they have to be comfortable with the gasp they gotta go for the gasp and be like dude you should have heard the gasp on this one right there we go seven selling properly is the first step becoming a coach right your first impressions the expeditions you set dictate the relationship how you sell the fact that use logic in the sale will set you up for success and your client for success in the long run eight selling is helping prospects make decisions out themselves like you are helping them help themselves that's
(10:02) where the power comes from you are not helping them you're helping them help them see the difference it's nuanced but it's real nine keep the prospect not the sale as the priority it's not about us the more you can vanish in the sale and and magnify them the better your selling conversations will go because it's not about us they don't care about you they only care about them and they will talk about themselves as long as they'll let them this is a really important one especially when you start to getting into closing seek to understand
(10:37) not to argue and the way that i train our sales teams around this is childlike curiosity so when someone says when someone objects to something it's like huh that's so weird i wouldn't have thought that tell me more about that right and you get to be able to maintain that childlike curiosity the same way they train fighters to not breathe too much during a fight through exposure the more you more times you get into these uncomfortable high stakes closing scenarios the less weird and high stakes they become because they become what you do every day and the good thing is you get to have this
(11:13) conversation hundreds and thousands of times and they only get to have it once so you [ __ ] better be better at it than them closing is a dance not a fight it's seduction not rape i mean i'm being super serious about this the goal is not to beat them into submission the goal is to sell from your back foot it's like i'm good i want to help you help you and if that means not doing this then i [ __ ] love it i'm with you i'm on your team and i'll give you a bullet around that in a second selling is a transference of belief over
(11:49) a bridge of trust therefore there are two things that are required you must believe so that you can transfer it and you must have trust to make the transfer because if you truly believe in a lot of times you st anyone been on a hot streak when they're selling anyone anyone who just had their hand up ever been on a cold streak most times you go from hot to cold not because you forgot how to sell because you stop believing in why you're selling you have the same skills as you did the day before but sometimes you get a text you get an email you get a pain in the ass customer you ask for a refund whatever the hell
(12:24) it is right and then you question yourself and so that bridge might have been created but there was nothing to walk across it because your cup wasn't full and so that's why especially it's you in the beginning but your teams over time the process of filling conviction is one of the easiest and best ways to increase someone's closing percentage better than any of the training in the world if you get someone to believe they will sell the right way because they're doing it not to make the deal because they want to help the other person 16. you
(12:52) can only build trust if you generally want to help and humans are exceptionally good at sniffing out intention it's a survival mechanism you have to know if someone's trying to double cross you we're very good at smelling it out and the reason a lot of you guys can't close is because you only care about closing belief and trust are a continuum not binaries so it's not you believe or don't believe it's not they trust you or don't trust you but how much do they trust you how much do you believe how deeply do
(13:18) you believe because anyone ever been around somebody who just believes balls to bone something that you think is batshit crazy like i mean all the way so much so that you start to question what you believe that's what real conviction does 18 closers ask hard questions and it's because you genuinely care that's why you do it it's why we're here who here wants to impact thousands of lives and help people then you got to [ __ ] ask hard questions because it's the only thing that's going to actually pierce someone's heart and actually get the
(13:48) transformation to happen if you can't make if you cannot have transformational conversations you cannot coach and this is the first step the person who cares the most about the prospect wins the sale that includes them so if you care more about their well-being than they do you will win and if you are more convicted they will question their own excuses because you are so certain a little little nugget for you report all your sales by the way because when you do get on that hot streak right you get on that
(14:19) hot streak and then you get cold again watch your hot streak see where you pause what jokes you made when you asked for the sale when you did it how you overcame it and it'll get you back in the flow much faster than trying to question yourself what i do what i do always report all your sales it's also the easiest way to train new people and then lastly 21 power is the ability to direct or influence people if you want to be powerful you must understand this skill and that's what we're going to talk about cool awesome when does selling happen does it happen when they're a lead does it happen when
(14:55) we're qualifying them does it happen when we solicit the sale does it happen when we close the sale when does the selling happen all the time the entire time selling is happening but what are we going to talk about today just this just closing everything you have to do after asking someone to buy why are we doing that rather than the entire process beyond the fact that we'd be here all day the other reason and i love this is that closing has one of the highest predictors of success in business and here's an analogy for it everyone familiar with the nfl
(15:32) great so here's an insane statistic the top five red zone offenses in the league now last five years made the playoffs 90 of the time here's why this is interesting and crazy there's a million other stats they could have horrible defenses they could have terrible coaching they could have a terrible whatever it is right they could have all these things that are wrong with their they could have terrible special teams whatever but just this one set if they're in the red zone they [ __ ] close and i can tell you if you have this ability if you have the skill it will
(16:08) make up for a tremendous amount of deficiencies in other areas of your life and business and it will buy you time to learn those but if you can't close it's very difficult to grow in business especially in the beginning because it's probably you that's why we're talking about closing why is this important from a money getting perspective well first off if you have 100 people walk in the door 10 are never going to buy just accept that right problem is you don't know which 10 it is but ten percent ever gonna buy ten percent are always gonna buy you just gotta not [ __ ] it up
(16:41) and most of you guys these are the only sales you're getting they're like well i already i'm already here my friend told me about you i have my credit card out and some of you are like well you know let's make sure you're like just shut the [ __ ] just take the card you know what i mean like shut up right that's like hey my friend's so awesome you got to meet him and she's like oh my god he's great and then the guy starts talking and she's like just kidding you know like terrible right but this is what we fight for this is what we train and if you want to make a big impact
(17:10) that's what we're fighting for it's the middle 80. why this presentation will make you money if after this presentation you just have one more bullet one more play in your arsenal to close where i get you one more deal a month i'll feel like my job was done all right and hopefully if you just do that it'll pay for your entire weekend all right that's my goal for the president that everything that you guys have done for this whole weekend is paid for is that cool fair outcome all right this is one of my favorite sayings you're only one decision away from
(17:39) changing your life forever and whenever i feel overwhelmed or i feel like i'm decreasing like i feel powerless i feel like i have less power than i want to have i always say this to myself because it's like i can take one decision and change [ __ ] everything you know i mean like i can i can drink a bottle of jack get in the car i can change everything with one decision right i can make a step to to invest in something i can buy something i can invest in myself i can i can have a terrible conversation with an amazing conversation with layla but just one decision and that's always given me
(18:09) power but the thing is is that instead of changing our lives we blame when i say blame i want you to think give power to sources outside of our control and this is what you and this is what your prospects and your customers are doing and this is why so many people are weak and powerless and so we're going to do a fun activity today because i want you to be involved so you can learn it we're going to do this so that one you can help decisions to help yourself with whatever decisions you're facing two you can use these frameworks to help prospects help themselves
(18:38) and the three become more powerful so but rather than keep this hypothetical i need you to visualize the decision that you need to make all right you do that for me fantastic and this is why i want you to actually think through a decision together because this is a statement from confucius i hear and i forget i see and i remember i do and i understand so my goal here isn't for you to take screenshots of every picture of every slide that's not my point here because the thing is is when you do that and you kind of i mean this is why i do
(19:08) it i take pictures so that i don't have to remember it but i don't want you to remember it i want you to understand it if you understand it you won't have to go back to your notes because let's be real half the time you're not even open these notes up again you're here now with me try and understand if you do that it can change your life because what we're going to do is not going to be some scripts that you have to understand but the logic behind the arguments that people will give you as to why they are not choosing to become
(19:32) more powerful and if you can unlock that you people will feel more powerful talking to you and they will want to buy from me because of the feeling they have does that make sense and so that's when you're using logic to create an emotion so here here's an easy one for you anyone here presented with the decision last 24 hours yes great fantastic so who thinks the decision could change your life for the better great for the worse who knows all right let's go so here's my goal i want to show you as though you were prospects how to think through a decision and help others using these frameworks right what you want what you don't want maximize
(20:04) the left minimize the right so here's what this is translated to if you decide to buy the offer you feel more certain about your decision decided not to buy the offer you feel [ __ ] certain about the decision and if you're undecided you make a [ __ ] decision all right and you feel good that it's the one that has the highest likelihood of getting you closer to where you want to go and this is what we have to walk through with our prospects when you're looking at them you have to be like i don't want you to buy i want you to decide for you not for me
(20:33) i'll be the same either way right you're like i'm going to be ripping in shape it's not going to change me right like that's not going to change but like it will change for you right so quick note on sales ethics and then we'll dive in helping someone make a decision to help themselves does not mean buying from me that's a reiteration you have to keep their goals at the center of the decision and you should be happy i mean this because if you can shift this truly if you can be happy when someone decides to own the power and not work with you then the pressure around sales disappears it evaporates there's
(21:03) no stake the stake is did i help them does that make sense and that means that you can win every sale because you change the metric you're measuring yourself by that's the superpower like and that's where you do make the most sales because you don't care about the sale because you care about the person and the people pay the people who pay the most attention so i call it paying attention they pay for it they pay for you to pay attention rather than talking about yourself right because they don't care about you because they're thinking about 100 other things and this is why most importantly
(21:32) make high-stakes decisions to help your prospects in order to best serve them okay so i told you earlier i was going to talk about the difference between obstacles and objections a couple you guys raised your hands but the differences i'm not gonna ask i'll tell you what it is obstacle is a thing that blocks one's way or prevents or hinders progress when you disagree with them that is an obstacle this happens before you solicit the sale someone says some [ __ ] before we even get to the sale that's an obstacle
(22:03) a simple example i hear all the time hey why'd you hop on the call today hey why'd you walk in the gym today whatever it is right them i just wanted to find out a little bit more about the program first 10 seconds obstacle you're not here to find out more about the program your because you're fat but they got to say it so you're like oh so you're finding out like do you do this all the time do you go to lots of different programs to find out information or is there a problem you're trying to solve they're like oh well you know i'm trying to lose weight like oh god so you're not just hopping on 100 calls a day because i was like that would be a very weird
(22:32) existence right you just hop on for information all day right fantastic i've had this conversation before right so it's an obstacle right and the thing is it's easy to confront and destroy obstacles before you ask for the sale once you've asked for the sale you switch to objections objections is when they disagree with you so it's much easier to be on the other side disagreeing and helping them break their beliefs before the stake has been presented after after the after you're in the red zone it's all closing it's all objection overcomes right example that's like i don't want to buy right now and you're
(23:09) like totally understand what are the main criteria thinking through which is always funny because people are like i need to think about it i've never had someone like leave because they need to think about it i'm like cool what are you thinking about they're like oh i'm still here right so learning how to talk through these high stakes decisions with yourself or others is the purpose of presentation and as a result you'll become more powerful okay so before i dive into these each of these arguments i have to make this one statement that the person
(23:35) must really want the goal and believe three things one which we'll get to there we go the product will get you the goal comma the way they want to get there and i learned that second half the hard way because we found out in gym launch that people would say no sometimes to buying memberships right or buying challenges or whatever but when we offered them the ability to come back the next day help them for free we'd sell them 400 of supplements and they just said no to 100 down service thing and like what the [ __ ] it's because
(24:08) they want to lose weight but they want to lose weight their way and so that's when i started learning like oh not only do we have to make sure that they want the goal and they believe that the product's going to get them there that has to get them there the way they want to get there this gives you ammo for the questions that you're going to ask just make sense okay the second thing is that you and others will support them like are you telling me the truth is this really what's going to happen will other people around me support this decision and the third
(24:38) is that it will work for them and not just everyone else sure i've seen the people who step on the stage but they're different than me i'm a snowflake i have metabolic thyroid ketosis right whatever i have zero influenza allerger whatever you know what i mean like i have no following is itis right whatever it is right whatever [ __ ] you tell yourself and what you have to do in this situation is you have to provide proof so that it'd be more unreasonable not to believe than to believe and this is a logical close this is not a this is not an emotional close
(25:10) this is when you look at someone and say how many people would you need to see for it to be more unreasonable for you not to believe than to believe at what point is it 10 is it 50 well here's a thousand tell me when to stop okay okay okay great so that's not the real reason and then you can confront the real [ __ ] all right so otherwise if they're not sure of those things if they don't actually want to lose weight if you don't actually want to make money doing online fitness then it doesn't matter what jason says
(25:39) you don't want to make money doing all my fitness you're not going to buy right if you do want to make money doing online fitness then you go down you go down the track the train tracks that make sense okay again this is why you expect no at first because if people could make the decision they would have already made it all right now to the main course richard feynman besides charlie one of my favorite thinkers of all time he was like the second guy on uh the atom bomb sounds negative brilliant teacher he's
(26:03) known for this understand don't memorize learn principles not formulas and that's what the rest of this presentation is about is the principles behind overcoming these distortions that people have and so this is me asking you for your own sake don't take pictures of the slides it's because all the stuff's gonna be in the recordings but you are here now so be here now so you can understand it okay so there are three sources this is a huge breakthrough for me so i'm going to share it with you the first time shared a life there are three sources that we cast our power to okay and it took me a
(26:34) very long time to get through this because i looked at grant and he had his you know you got stall decision maker money then you talked to barry who owns sage she's like you got time fit uh money fear shame right those are hers and then jordan belfort's got his and so everybody's got like these are the only overcomes right i was like there has to be an actual truth here like there has to be something that's true that's unquestioned and so trying to figure this out i actually went back to dr albert ellis
(27:04) anybody who knew he is no one great um who here knows what cognitive behavioral therapy is cbt he invented it smart dude and so what he noticed is that he originally had 11 distortions of reality then he dropped it to nine then a seven and they came with three and the three stuck and the three are what i'm about to share with you and you're like why is he talking about this about sales because the objections that people offer you where they cast their power to are distortions of reality they are the things we use to upset
(27:35) ourselves these are the three circumstances and this is the irrational statement that people make i must get what i want when i want it i must not get what i don't want if i don't get what i want i can't stand it that's when people blame their emotional disturbances on emotional services on circumstances two others other people must treat me fairly and kindly and if i if they don't they are no good and deserve to be condemned and punished it's like your animal brain right three self i must do well or else i am no good these are the three core distortions
(28:11) that upset people this is like mental illness right and so i'm not saying anyone has mental illness if they don't agree with you it's more so that these are distortions that are not real and if you can understand not memorize if you can understand this then you can have these high-stakes conversations understanding exactly which distortion they're suffering from and i'll show you how to overcome them okay and so i like to consider like the onion of blame people this is like one of the bigger breakthroughs i had they start with the outside they blame
(28:40) circumstances time money other [ __ ] and then the step next to that they start to blame other people my spouse my kids my employees and then finally they say like it's me it's my fault and so you might have to overcome multiple layers as you peel back and based on the objection they give you you can know where you're at you know how close you are if someone just says i have to think about that you're like great i'm talking the person who's in power and the decision maker and i just need to get them to say yes if they're like i don't have
(29:11) they're casting the power away and some of you guys are probably casting your power away on decisions you need to make which is why i'm making this presentation even though that these are the things that distort people's realities because you're like no one's ever said circumstances are getting in my way right like no one says they manifest in five ways that i want to equip you to deal with all right for yourself and others so these are the five most common excuses scapegoats that people use for circle and if you find other ones these are the biggest buckets because i didn't want to have 100 things here but
(29:40) the big three buckets are circumstances others itself right but they manifest with time in multiple ways and i'll show you how value price money etc fit i'm a special snowflake others which is i don't have the authority to make the decision and then finally self which is what if i just don't make the decision let some let life make it for me right avoidance stall you go from surface level to core and as a side note you should never get stuck on the stuff near the top and ideally you should really never get
(30:11) stuck anywhere on this equation if the person wants what you have and you truly believe in what you have to help them and i mean that like if you understand this thoroughly you can walk someone towards helping themselves okay this is what they look like or this is what they sound like in reality not a good not a good time right now i'm really busy right that's time can't afford it too expensive fit not sure if it's for me i hate broccoli i can't do a plan with broccoli right i can't do a plan where i have to dm
(30:41) people every day it's against my brand i'm poor but it's against my bread right authority have to talk to my partner spouse i have to talk to somebody who has more power than me it's funny because when you start thinking this way it sounds silly and then avoidance i need to think about it clearly let's think about it now all right and so i told you i want you to think about the principles behind these things not memorize you've got circumstances you've got other people and you have yourself and we drill down so quick test who here is physically in the room raise your set wonderful arms
(31:12) are working we're rocking so here's my ask raise your hand if you or your prospects present with this distortion so who here is a time person i'm busy it's not a good time maybe in the future anyone deal with these sometimes it's yourself totally so i'm also going to tell you a secret about this i think the reason i got pretty decent at logical arguments is because i am inherently skeptical and i will paralyze myself from not doing anything unless i have really sound reasons to do it and i realized that i couldn't move forward and make any progress in my life until i had these frameworks to think through these hard decisions through so i could
(31:49) start taking steps to where where i wanted to go it took me years to get there and so hopefully i can give you some keys that help me unlock my own head to get out my own [ __ ] way so that you can too and help your clients all right so the way i think about time and there's a lot of overcomes for all of these things what i tried to do is bunch the three biggest ones that i like to use most frequently and if i uh veer from like the the bullets on the screen it's because i'm riffing with you and i'd rather just kind of stay in the flow is that cool okay fantastic so when
(32:19) you're overcoming this one each of these is kind of a specific angle that you're attacking it from so macro is like um this is a busy season for me i've got lots of stuff going on right micro is like i don't have any time in my day so you're one person saying i've got lots of [ __ ] going on one person's like i can't find the time it's different sounds subtle but it's both about time but in different ways all right and then the the last one is well when when i have time i'll start right whichever one is this [ __ ] horseshit but whatever okay so
(32:50) as always we never disagree with prospects because you're not in a fight totally get it totally understand do you think like do you want this to be something that lasts for the long term right it's a question you're like yeah do you think that you're going to be busy again in the future well yeah so you want this to last in the long run and you do think you're going to be busy again in the future well then don't you think it'd be best to start now when you are busy because if you learn how to do it when you're busy you'll be able to do it forever if you can only learn it during a perfect circumstance then
(33:20) you're going to fall off when it gets busy again and isn't that the time you'd want to have the most support it goes for you guys too that's just number one we got so many lore right and so when you knock that out the goal is that the person says well [ __ ] that's not a good reason you take one step towards the truth so when you're thinking about it's not like oh i've got to overcome this one thing and then they'll buy you got to keep peeling and if you have this framework you understand the direction you're going in and you can
(33:47) start listening for the oh they're talking about themselves now i've gotten two layers deeper right so that's seasonal micro you can't tell someone in a sale hey take out your phone take out your hours by week pull it up oh look 22 hours on social media this week you've got time so you say it differently you say you know what i had the same issue and i used to complain all the time about like how i didn't have time to to be successful and do things i needed to do and my wife got so sick and tired of me saying this she pulled my phone out and she was like look i guess i just
(34:15) found your time didn't i i was like oh [ __ ] and you can say it that way and then a prospect feels better does anybody here feel like they don't have time right and the first thing that any program is going to do if it's a good program is going to cut out the 90 of the [ __ ] that you are doing which is causing you to feel overwhelmed which is probably the real reason you feel like you don't have time jeff bezos at the same time you do right it's just what are the things that you're doing that he's not it's not about adding [ __ ] to your plate it's about removing stuff that's not working because clearly everything
(34:44) you're doing that's filling your time is not making you more money so you're doing the wrong [ __ ] so there's gonna be plenty of time because all the stuff you're doing now is not working right it sounds simple but that's the reason right so we want macro grow when then hey in the future when i've got time i'll totally sign up for your program right anyone heard this one anyone say this one right and again you wanna you wanna empathize you don't say like ah that's [ __ ] you say totally understand that's i was stuck like this for years if you can step in their shoes you're not attacking
(35:19) them you actually go from the inside out you step into their self and then you walk them through the epiphany that you experienced and it doesn't feel judgmental it feels helpful that make sense i used to feel the same way right and i found this out actually from jason fladley and he was when he told me this it's a it's a logical fallacy it's called the one then fallacy which is why it's how i remember it and the one then fallacy simply states when i have x then i will do y but it flips sequence so it's like when i get better i will go to the hospital
(35:50) sorry there's just so many like hilarious ones about like money and stuff like i will start saving money once i'm rich like all right the thing is is that we do this right we do this i'll pay for the program that'll make me more money when i have more money that's the point of the program i'll pay for the program that'll help me get a six-pack once i have a six-pack once i have more time which the program's gonna help me you know i'm saying like it's just it doesn't make it's a fallacy and so what that means is it's a distortion
(36:19) it's not real and so the goal of having these high-stakes conversations is simply showing people we're not attacking we're just walking them through and be like do you realize that this is holding you back and i know this better than anyone because i'm a skeptical [ __ ] the reason i can do all these logical things is because i'm the first person i'd overcome right and you might be too so once we attack time from these three angles depends which one they present with if they present with one and then move to the next you
(36:47) can knock all three out you'll probably find some that that make the most sense to you but the thing here is it's not about memorization you just got to get it macro you're always going to be busy won't you want the most help when you are busy so they can stick forever yes time my wife showed me my phone turns out i got [ __ ] time but the reality is it's not about what i am doing it's about the stuff i got to stop doing and that's what i help you with right this isn't scripting this is just understanding it right and then when then it's a fallacy it's a distortion it's not real and then just use two
(37:16) crazy examples like once i have money then i'll save money when i'm rich right it's just like ridiculous okay so what do we do one reason down and we're getting closer to the core right right so who here is somebody who's like i can't afford it it's too expensive or has heard this from a prospect i was like i better see everybody's hands especially if you're selling high ticket which hopefully you get a gasp so these are the four frameworks that i think through there's a million like money closes but these are the ones that i like the most
(37:47) and that that to me resonate the best right and so why a lot is good is kind of like my my first one here and so the reason that if someone gasps or think that this is a lot of money you just ask them is this a lot of money to you and they're gonna say yeah if they say no then you're like awesome buy it and if they say yes right and if they say yes then you're like that's the exact reason why you're going to be successful because there's other people who buy this thing and you know what they're not all in on it but the question is do you
(38:16) want to draw the lawn in the sand and go all in do you want to step over the line and be the person you want to be because i can tell you that this is not about whether this works not i've already proven that the question is whether you work or not and so if you put more on the line then you have a higher likelihood of being successful so you should be the last person to be worried about this i'm more excited because the best stories are always coming from people like you in your exact situation so don't let that be a reason not to do it that should be the reason to do it
(38:41) so the next one is like why is this not a lot so first is the fact that it's a lot for you is good it means you're going to try hard the second was like well it's a lot in terms of absolute amount but relative amount it's very little right because if all this does is add ten thousand dollars a month to your income is it worth it if all this does is get you into a bikini is it worth it yeah and so then what happens and the reason that this is a stepping process right is that we're we're just taking these objections out of the way so we can get the person to confront reality not a
(39:15) distortion they've created because the reality is the thing they're afraid of and so what happens is when they say yeah if it did that it would be worth it right the problem is they don't believe you right and so it's like great then it's not about the price it's about whether you believe me so you can sidestep it does that make sense we're taking a step closer and then obviously you can use a comparison you know depending on what you're selling if you can price anchor with like well here they don't have a four-year degree for doing online
(39:42) fitness that's why the alternative education industry exists and it's because the formal education has failed most of us right anybody graduated here with a four-year degree anyone immediately be able to use that for your degree to get leads make sales no me neither right and what's crazy is that some of these degrees are 50 100 200 000 and take four years when you've got something that can help you make make that entire amount of money in half the time right for a tenth of the price when you think about it like that frame it's actually a great deal does that make sense so you just frame it you have to give
(40:20) context all right so number one is the fact that it's a lot for you is good it means you're actually going to try number two is if it does what we say it's going to do the value is there so that's not actually what you're opposed to which then we can take the next step all right number three is what's money good for anyways this is actually one of my favorite lines of reasoning for a variety of reasons and i'll get to it when you're looking at a prospect or looking at yourself you're going to spend this money either
(40:48) way over the next 12 months you're going to spend it right and in fact not only are you going to spend it you're going to buy the program the question is whether you're going to pay for it money or pay for it in time and so like you can learn every single lesson that's in this program whether it's losing weight you know getting leads selling online whatever it is right you're going to learn these lessons but do you want it to take 12 weeks or 12 years and the question is are you going to be able to live a thousand lifetimes
(41:17) because of the thousand people that we've helped just like you and gathered all those lessons and put them together so you don't have to do the trial and error for that entire period of time so the question is not whether you're going to buy it or not it's just how do you want to pay and so for me this is a personal note and i'll probably say it at the end but like the reason it'll move quickly through life is that i will buy other people's mistakes because it's just it's the only way you can buy time
(41:39) in this life is to buy the knowledge to take less time from other people who have taken their time and like if you think about human civilization in general edison took however long to make a light bulb and then we just bought the lesson from him and now we have light bulbs right and the next guy figures out the next thing and then we just buy the lesson from him and that's how we have to move faster so you're going to spend the money either way the question is 12 months from now is it going to be on [ __ ] that didn't get you anywhere or
(42:01) stuff that is going to get you somewhere and no matter what you're buying you're buying the program you're just gonna pay time you're gonna pay with money and if we're being real you've probably been paying for time the last six years how's that working for you do you want to do more of that this is also this is a this is a classic one it's a very easy one to remember but like who here knows the difference between a self-made billionaire when they had nothing and where you're at right now if you have nothing zero they both you're both broke
(42:31) they were broke you're broke whatever it is that's where you're at right now the only difference is that that proves that if they were successful it wasn't about the resources they had it's about how resourceful they were so i'll tell you a quick story about this so anyone here read uh shoe dog right the story of nike so in the story he talks about how he was about to lose everything multiple times it's a crazy story and this time it was like it was it was going to go down like it wasn't going to happen and he needed a tremendous amount
(43:02) of money and he just didn't have it he'd extend all his credit lines the banks wouldn't do it and the next lenders they canceled on him and the company's going to fold because he was growing too fast at that point he could have just given up and said there's nothing i can do i backs out all my cards i maxed it on my banks there's literally nothing i can do and his people already worked for free they're like we can't do this anymore he went to his vendors and said you need to pay my payroll for me he went to his vendors
(43:27) anybody use like landing page software anyone uh anyone use something from a vendor right it's like going to that guy like going to your videographer me like listen you gotta pay payroll for me this uh this month because otherwise i'm not gonna be able to keep doing business with you because i'll be out of business resourceful not resources and the reason this is so important is because when you have nothing it's the easiest excuse to give yourself because you're like well i have nothing that's why i can't it's like of course but every self-made millionaire and every self-made billionaire was self-made
(43:56) and they started with nothing which puts them the exact same seat you are so the question is do you want to have power or do you want to not have power when you have power you're resourceful in our resources right and so if we want to make these decisions that are going to help ourselves we need to step into that and so when you're talking to your prospects it's the same thing right does that make sense okay rocking i mean you can drill deeper into this is like do you think there's anyone else who's been in your situation who's
(44:24) achieved this or maybe worse than your situation the answer is yes and if they can why can't you right so we're taking steps closer you guys digging this okay cool oh thanks okay thanks i wasn't sure if it was rapt attention or sheer boredom so we're not you feel do you feel what progress you're making like the person presents this is i don't have time this thing shit's busy blah blah and you're like no no we're gonna take one step closer like you know what but i i don't have the money or it's too expensive
(44:57) you're like well if you don't have the money you're gonna be successful it's worth it right yes i understand why it's worth it well you don't need money to begin with right you got to be resourceful and you can find the money because i'll ask you this is a fun one for business owners who here has had an unexpected bill ever come up taxes right yeah and then all okay so everyone here is still alive who raised their hands who here was able to magically pull money out of their ass and figure out a way to do it raise your hand
(45:32) here's what's crazy you have the ability to be resourceful when it's for someone else and not for you it's because you choose to be powerful when someone else needs it but not for yourself [ __ ] up right so stop doing that if you function like you have to make payroll tomorrow and like you you're back on rent you're going to get kicked out you think differently and if instead of paying your landlord you're paying you because that's what you want to do it shifts internally because everyone's here just proved the fact that you can be resourceful when you choose to be
(46:10) so just choose to be so number three is it's not sure it's a fit for me so besides the obvious ones which is like i don't want to work out broccoli sucks i i can't do a program where where i i can't do cardio whatever the [ __ ] right um like i said i don't want to do dms i don't want to post on instagram i don't want to have a facebook group whatever right whatever the [ __ ] is all right i'm not sure if the vehicle is a fit for me so usually you can overcome the easy ones but if someone is just really sticking hard these are the three that i use to shift perspective okay
(46:44) so this one is new identity new priorities so it's good to have cues for these things which is like we vote with our dollars about the things that we care about and if you show me what someone is spending their money and their time on i can tell you what their future is and i'll tell you an interesting story so um i had somebody who was just like you who was like you know what i don't want to do this either and i told her this story can i tell you it yes and this is what you'd say to the prospect right so i was with layla and
(47:09) we went to sephora which is a makeup store and i show up like this oh i feel welcome and so we're standing there she's doing something and i usually stay in the corner like this um and i saw these two little girls they might have been like i don't know girl age so like 12 to 15 this like this this and they were like giggly and so excited and they had like the girl with the smock came over was like helping her out helping them out and she was like okay this is like eyeliner and this is lipstick and this
(47:44) is whatever blush um i'm just like using words i've heard this is how you paint your face and the thing is the girls were like so excited and then they were like right before they left she was like girls she's like you have to remember like now that you're getting older and you're becoming a woman you need to start budging for this stuff all right so you're gonna start buying this every month all right so like remember you got to save some money for this so you can have it and the girls were so excited that they were like yes like we're becoming women now and these are the things that women
(48:12) do it's because when you have new identity you have new priorities and so you've had priorities that are aligned with your old identity right there's the you that goes out that you the drinks the you that does the blah blah blah spends money on [ __ ] you shouldn't do spends time on [ __ ] you shouldn't be spending time on and there's the you that you want to be and so right now we can draw the line in the sand and be like do you want to keep walking down the road that you have been walking and if you don't
(48:35) then you have to step into a new identity and with that new identity comes new priorities because people who want to be rich spend money on themselves they spend money on education they invest in their skill sets because i want to align my identity with the identity of those who came before me who've done the things i want to do right and just like those little girls stepping into that identity we too must step into the identity that we want to be does that make sense and so when you're talking to somebody who's trying to lose weight and they're like i can't afford a gym membership and you're like girl you're spending 200
(49:04) bucks on your nails and you've got a thousand dollar outfit on do you think another thousand dollar outfit would make you look better or your high school weight right do you think another thousand dollar outfit would make you look better or being rich as [ __ ] and i say that for those of you who are thinking about on the money side right like you waste my i like some of you guys have bigger shoe collections than like it's like fitness like fitness people and shoes it's like the weird like and lululemon and the you know spandex it's like a hundreds pieces
(49:41) anyways so it's like your whole wardrobe could be consolidated into a skill that could buy you as many wardrobes as you want if you chose to right okay rock it i don't like this certain aspect this is one of my favorite easiest ones to hit which is like you got to change the change right what you have been doing has been getting what you've been getting and you got to change the change because like i remember i would go through meal plans with people and they'd be like well can we change this because this is
(50:08) what i eat for breakfast can we just can we make that to breakfast and i'm like that breakfast makes you look like you [Laughter] that way you spend your first four hours of the day makes your bank account looks like what it does look like oh right right taking steps right we're getting closer to the truth and so the thing is is that it's going to hurt to change because change hurts and you've heard this one probably from tony robinson if you haven't the question is whether the pain of staying the same is greater than the
(50:42) pain of change unless we just ask someone and this is in the help part if someone's like the pain of staying the same is not worse than this change it's like then girlfriend like gain 50 more pounds and come back you know what i mean like get there i mean hit rock bottom this isn't it for you i'm being real some people rock bottom is 12 body fat some people it's 500 pounds but everyone's got one you just got to know where yours is and all you really got to do is just move what rock bottom is for you which is
(51:10) kind of interesting because you start making a change here which is kind of interesting like interesting as a thought but are you in enough pain is the question you ask the person so for those of you who are unwilling to make a change because it feels contrary to like i don't want to do i don't want to seem salesy i don't want to i don't want to help people like whatever right like is your current situation more painful than the change that you will have to go through or experience to get to where you want to go and so the last one is hypothetical i actually really love this this is a great framework overall for overcoming lots of different obstacles
(51:41) um or objections that present themselves but the hypothetical there's lots of ways of phrasing this which is like you've probably heard the unicorn clothes you probably heard like if this were perfect would you do it i on a scale from one to ten where would this program be if 10 was amazing and one was terrible what you know where is this they say a number and you say cool what would make it a 10 why isn't a one like you guys heard this scripting before so you guys are like no please talk slower um the reason i said we have to learn the principles behind it rather than
(52:05) memorizing the script is that it all is based on one thing which is hypothetical which is if this were perfect would you do it because you get a hypothetical agreement and they say yes if it were the thing is if you're like if this were perfect would you do it if someone says no then you're like girl okay like let's take five steps back does my breath smell yeah because the thing is they've actually told you a lot there it's like it has nothing to do with the stuff you're talking about they don't trust you and now we can talk about that right so it's a great question to frame like where are
(52:34) we and so it's like if this were perfect would you do it sometimes they'll laugh if you ever pour the left they'll say yes right and so then you get to flip it and say then what's different between perfect and what we've got the thing is is that people are very hard they don't actually know how to generate making a program because they're not going to like know all the things you can deliver on the spot right and so they're like most of the time they'll be like i don't know you're like right well because it sounds like it's nothing to the program it's
(52:59) all about to do with you so let's talk about that right and all of a sudden boom one step closer to the truth does that make sense yeah yeah all right and that's why we do hypotheticals so if it were perfect what's missing and then if you can if it's if they do give you an answer and they're like i just don't want to do broccoli and you're like i'd do green beans would you do it they're like yeah you're like great green means it is sign here right like something you would be [ __ ] amazed how many times [ __ ] like that happened so it's like one crazy thing it's like well if we didn't have that would you do it like oh yeah sure
(53:35) where were you 10 minutes ago right and that's how you do hypothetical okay we're making we're making progress still with me still digging okay cool authority all right this is one of my favorite fake and so this one instead of having three i really just have like one very good statement of reasoning that you should understand okay this is real [ __ ] so this is more of a process than it is anything else but the spouse or decision maker is not there right now note for you guys a lot of you guys have had the opportunity to go talk to a spouse but a lot of you guys don't have that in your business
(54:10) right like spouse ain't there and they leave they're not coming back right where they are but very small percentage don't wait for it okay so what we have to do is try and sidestep it by isolating the objection and casting aside the partner because the partner's not there so how could they object to anything they don't even [ __ ] know who you are right and so the idea is and again this is assuming if you have a really long term thing then you want the partner to be there right like ideally that's what you have but if you don't have the opportunity then you got to go through the next step all right which is
(54:39) what do you think they wouldn't like and then they will tell you and then you just overcome the thing which has nothing to do with the spouse because spouse isn't there right very easy side step does that make sense this works really well it's like why wouldn't they what's like cause they don't want me to fail whoa they don't want you to fail let's talk about you and so this is the process that i walk through do they approve of your current struggle they happy that you're struggling no okay then why would they not approve of something that's going to fix something they
(55:13) already don't approve of right they're not happy with how you're currently doing why would they be against something that's already making them unhappy right right well let me ask you this and their paws like if the rules were reversed and your husband needed this to make what he wants his dreams happen or your wife needed this program to make her dreams happen would you support her then why wouldn't you support you right right and i think the real problem that we're dealing with here and this is the kicker is for everybody is that you're asking for permission instead of support
(55:53) because it is your life not theirs and what happens is if you give that power to them and then two years from now you're still fat you're still poor whatever it is who are you going to blame them and so that's when you have a resentful marriage because you didn't own your [ __ ] and so i'm not saying you shouldn't like explain the decision to them but the way you explain to them is what i just said which is if i don't do this for me i'm going to end up resenting you and i don't want that and instead of me bitching to you every
(56:27) day about how we don't have money or about how i don't like my body i'm now doing this and i'm joining a group of support of community of people just like me and crazy enough for some reason doctors go to college right right that makes sense they go to medical school lawyers go to law school but where do entrepreneurs go there's no entrepreneur school no one teaches the stuff but it turns out there are people who teach it just for this specific industry and i can take failures of a thousand people and pack it into a year and
(56:55) it's one-tenth the price of a four-year degree right and so instead of whining to you what i commit to is i'm gonna show up and be a better husband a better wife a better partner i'm not gonna [ __ ] to you about the stuff because i'm gonna take this seriously i'm gonna go all in and i'm not asking you permission i'm just asking for your support all right that's how you can overcome it because i'm be real with you it is about them and you have to believe that like you can't say this unless you believe it because like you will you save marriages
(57:24) by showing people that they're the ones in control because if they keep saying my husband's not gonna let me buy a weight loss program what do you think she's secretly saying i can't believe you won't let me do it right if that's real if she's using it as a foil you side said be good to self right but that might be the real thing and if that is the thing then you have to let them step into that and that's where you know having that's where like having a three-day no-sweat guarantee or something like that is also helpful it's like hey sign up and i use i use a lot
(57:54) of rapport and humor in my selling and so i'd be like hey cindy if you sign up and you tell your husband and he's upset you have and when he sees you he's like girl i don't want you to get in shape i want you to stay overweight i want you to put those sweatpants on i want you sit on that couch reach your hand a bag of cheetos put the the cheetos fingers on there i want you to create generational unhealth i want you to live 10 years less long i want you to see our grandkids i don't want that right i want
(58:22) to marry a younger better you sooner because you're going to have a heart attack if he says that to you you have him calm and then they're like cracking up and you're like okay okay listen sign up three day no sweat like if he if he does tell you that he just wants you to be out of shape and never leave him because uh because he's once you get too hot because he's insecure if he says that um yeah just let me know all right so like the whole time you're just joking and stuff but the three-day guarantee helps like nudge a lot of these people over is that cool you guys get that one
(58:49) okay sweet and so that goes for you right like it's it's about support not permission that's the bottom line right support not permission because otherwise you're going to blame them for your lack of dreams being realized rather than blaming the person it should which is you all right so this is avoidance now we're getting to the core we've gotten rid of time we know that you've got time and the best time to do it is today because you're going to be busy forever right value we know that you can't afford it if you can't afford it you'll buy it if you can't afford it's a great reason to do it and if the value is there
(59:24) then there's no reason not to because it'll pay for itself right what's money good for anyways you're gonna pay for the program regardless you wanna pay less time or more time value's not a problem fit you got to step into an identity right you've got to be willing to change and the question is just whether the pain that you're experiencing is less than the pain of the change that takes to experience the next thing right if they step into that they're good because it's not about resources it's about resourcefulness so fit's not an issue
(59:53) authority they have to own it it's about support not permission we all here do you feel like we've peeled the layers back on your prospects and they're just laid bare naked there just you've solicited the sale now you got to close all right avoidance so now they're like wait what do you think about it so now that we've exhausted i'm putting this as emphasis we've exhausted all outside reasons now we're finally talking to someone in power and that is what a good coach does we don't make decisions for people we help them make decisions so here's i have to think about it not sure give me
(1:00:31) a hand who's dealt with somebody who says things that way all right at least one person here i'm kidding all you guys did you guys are great so this is how i divide this up past present future and so hopefully this should already before i dive into these give you simple frameworks to work through time you've got macro micro when then right you've got you got value you're thinking about it's not a lot of money even if it were a lot of money it's not a lot of money you're going to pay for it either way but you have the
(1:00:55) simple frameworks that you can walk through you might just hit them with one and if they hit it with again give them the other angle because they're logical frameworks they're not scripts that's why i made them bubbles you don't have to memorize it just gotta understand it past so like i need to think about it and so the thing is and this the first bubble there is if someone's like i feel like this is happening so fast can we get that one like i just i just got on the phone with you i don't really know who you are and you're like hey this is
(1:01:17) not a fast decision right you've been making this decision for last six years you continually make the decision all we're doing to say is deciding you're actually going to do something about it right how long you want to lose weight a long time so this is not a fast decision at all but the thing is is that and this is where you go sunk cost so if i were talking to you guys i would say you find you know you bought tickets because you saw some ad you registered there you got your flights you got a hotel you blocked the time you flew here
(1:01:46) you listened to this whole thing you're six inches from gold this isn't a fast decision at all you did all these things to get here because it's important to you so don't let that distortion stop you from getting what you want right it's fear right let's face that what are you afraid of having happen which by the way i took the slide out but my two favorite questions to ask in a in a sale that i feel like are the fastest to cut through is what are you most afraid of having happen if you buy what are you most afraid of what's the worst thing that you envision
(1:02:17) in your mind and if they're not sure i just fill in the bikes i'm like i take your credit card i swipe over as much as i possibly can i go to vegas i put it all on black and then i go to monaco where they can't extradite me fair enough and they're like i was not thinking that and you're like right so what's the worst you know like what's what's the real thing like and then they're like you know i just have bought so many programs before you're like right let's talk about that right and so i'm gonna skip one forward and then i'm gonna go back to it this is one of my favorite obstacle or objection overcomes
(1:02:49) it's i call don't let it burn you twice and this literally you can see the date it happened yesterday this girl texted me or messed april 6th she said it's crazy to think that i had a sales call with you six years ago and i'm kicking myself in the butt for not jumping on this is yesterday right like i don't even know the company anymore and i said you let a bad decision burn you twice once when you made your poor investment but a second time when you let that bad investment stop you from a good investment it would
(1:03:11) be like anybody ever have a boyfriend or girlfriend in middle school or high school that they're not currently married to anyone just like just come on help me out here okay it would be like having a bad eighth grade boyfriend or girlfriend and being like you know what men aren't for me all coaches suck right there's good coaches there's bad coaches there's crazy ass [ __ ] and there's crazy ass dudes you know what i mean like there's also good ones and some things if you stop if you let the bad one prevent you from the good one you
(1:03:43) get burned by being with the bad one and because you let the bad one control your next decision right and so when someone has had a bad experience with doing keto or whatever the [ __ ] right or you had a bad experience with some program that you did or did not do or they didn't fulfill whatever either way don't let that burn you twice because no matter what you're gonna have to do you're gonna have to do these actions whether you're part of the program or not you gotta do these workouts where you're part of the program or not it doesn't matter you're gonna have to do it so you
(1:04:11) might as well do it but somebody can get you there faster right let me go back one real quick so it's not a fast decision and this is another one that i love which is do you think that you're maybe in this position because you have struggled to make a decision in the past you have waffled when it came time to make to make the hard call have you been in this conversation and said no before yeah do you think that's why you're here yeah do you think that might be the reason you should change that yeah okay let's change it one decision change
(1:04:41) your life and the last one is like are you tired of another year of almost right tied another year of almost hitting your goals of almost getting to 10k a month of of almost you know hiring the team that you wanted of almost retiring your your wife or husband or almost moving into the neighborhood that you wanted to move into or almost being able to pay for your kids recreational sports rather than not being able to because you can't afford it you're tired of another year of almost well if you're tired of another you're
(1:05:04) almost and we can't do what we're doing to get here for another year because we're gonna get another year almost and so the question isn't what it costs you but how much has it cost you to not decide up to this point right the cost of inaction and i think that when we think about our lives in reverse we never regret the things that we did we regret the things we didn't do the opportunities that we let pass by and i think that if you can let that person step into that power they will make the decision to help themselves
(1:05:31) like this person did not all right present so depends on what you're talking to someone's talking about past stuff then you deal with the past stuff the second frame for avoidance is present which is they just don't know how to make a [ __ ] decision right and so you have to help them make a decision and so this one the rocking chair is one that i just for some reason have used a tremendous amount of time especially when i'm selling weight loss is to be like i just really really need to think about it
(1:05:55) like totally understand well let's walk through like what that looks like you're not gonna like go home sit in the rocking chair you know smoke a cigarette because of course you're not healthy yet right you'll quit when you're healthy right you're smoking your cigarette you're like hmm am i gonna do this weight loss program right you just sit there and stare into the clouds like i wonder no of course you get in your car and then you're gonna realize you got to pick up timmy from soccer practice you got to get groceries you got to cook you got to clean you got to pick up you know go do laundry gotta do all these things right and then three
(1:06:20) four five days from now you're gonna put on that old pair of jeans and it's not gonna fit and you're like [ __ ] and just there you'll have made the decision you'll keep living your life and so let's just make it now because the reality is that it doesn't take information to make decisions so it doesn't take time to make decisions it takes information and i'm the only source of information you got so let's talk i'm here i'm here for you let's do it right because that's the fallacy is that people think they need more time to make decisions because they assume they will get more information in that time
(1:06:52) but if you are the source of the information then time does not help them and so let's confront it now and let me answer the questions you have to make the decision one way or another does that make sense all right and so then they're like well then [ __ ] how do i make a decision you're like glad you asked so there's three things that we got to understand do you believe that this product or service is going to help you achieve what you want yes or no they're going to say yes right if they don't you can confront it note all of
(1:07:20) these are confronting decisions so we've moved all the way down the onion right we're at truth now and all like the theme of the of the last bullet is confrontation we have to confront the decision we got to peel it back and be like are we going to do this or not right because we already got out the time we got out the fit we got out the sp we got everything out of the way it's just you do you think that this is going to help you get closer to your goals yes or no two do you trust me to fill to fulfill my word that i said i'm going to help you i'm going to do these calls i'm going to do these workouts i'm going to do
(1:07:51) whatever right three this is the mo probably the most important one do you think it'll work for you and if they say no you say why not and then they have to defend why not and then it's very easy at that point it's a six inch putt all right and once they say yes to all three which is usually what will happen they're like cool we'll make the decision together you know how to make the decision they'll say no you go through the three the last question is they said yes yes yes it's just do you have or have access to the amount of money to get started do you have the amex do i want to help
(1:08:19) you enroll in an mx cause i wanna i wanna help you i'm good either way but if you believe that this is going to help you get closer you believe that what i'm saying is true and you believe that you can be successful it's my moral obligation to get you going and do everything in my power to help you get the money or get access to it because the real world is if i was giving you a ferrari right now for five thousand dollars you'd find the money if your landlord needed you to come up with ten thousand dollars because you had background in payroll you'd find the
(1:08:42) money so find the money let's do it right three who wants to make informed decisions yes how can you make an informed decision if you haven't even tried it huh so this is when you have some element of trial in the program or some sort of guarantee which is why i'm a big fan of guarantees it's like well you can't make the decision to buy that's informed until you're on the inside so i'm not even asking you to make a decision right now i'm just actually making an informed decision which you can only do on the inside and if after 30 days i'm not what i said
(1:09:17) this product doesn't do what i told you i didn't fulfill my promise and you don't think it's gonna work for you you let me know i'll give you the money back low pressure you get someone to decide but not deciding even easier that make sense think that'll help you close yeah all right and then uh this one is i it depends on who you're selling to but sometimes if you have a logical person it's like do you know what deciding even means like where the etymology of the work comes from it's d cadere which is latin which means to cut off to kill off and so the question is
(1:09:48) which future are we killing off today are we killing off the future of the dreams that you want are we killing off the future sorry are we killing off the future of of not doing anything and the life that you've lived up to this point because indecision is a decision inaction is an active decision right and so it's just which one are we killing today we kill your dreams we clean your past second last one future so we talked about past so if they're thinking about the past things that hurt them don't burn you twice etc right they don't know how to make a decision rocking chair this is how you
(1:10:24) make a decision three things you've accessed the money great let's get going you want to kill your past you want to kill your future right awesome we're talking about the future this is actually magnifying pain which is cool you got here it's been five years you've been struggling how's another five years sound what if we just keep doing let's go with indecision let's look at it what is five years of you doing what you've been doing look like and is that a place you want to be no you got to change the change let's do it right and then you go right into let's
(1:10:53) consider the options which is like like this is logic right so let's consider the options option one you do the thing you get the result life is awesome option two you don't do the thing you don't get the result because you didn't do the thing option three you do the thing but then you don't get the result all these are the options that can happen in front of you because we have a guarantee they're all risk-free except for one of them only one of them has a true guarantee of not getting you where you want which is walking out the door so which risk-free option you want the one that's risk-free that guarantees
(1:11:29) that you're not going to get there or the one that's risk-free and has the potential to get you where you want to go right that's not an emotional close it's logic and if you have an offer that's set up that way you should be able to close most people as long as they don't think you're an [ __ ] right okay this is one that's more around urgency because again this is avoidance if someone says i'm still not sure i want to think about it more or whatever you say well you're not going to struggle forever right like you don't want to struggle forever
(1:11:57) you're going to do something about this whether it's weight loss business whatever they're going to say yes you're like well if you're going to fix your business eventually you might as well start fixing it now so you can start enjoying the fruits of that labor sooner would you prefer making more money faster or slower what's your preference great so if you're going to do it eventually you might as well do it now so it makes sense it's a little nudge this is a final one that i just really like from a framing perspective which is instead of like
(1:12:25) this has to be my savior this program has to get me to an ifbb pro bikini body and i'm 100 pounds overweight probably not realistic right reframing the question is do you think that making the decision is going to be help you get closer or further from your goal that's it because if we keep making decisions that keep getting us closer we will get there eventually but if we make decisions that get us further away we will not get there and so do you think that this is going to get you closer to your goal than what you're currently doing yes what are we waiting for we don't need to be snipers we need to be directionally
(1:12:58) right we do that long enough we'll get there does that make sense that helps you too because we have this fear of perfectionism is this gonna be the one probably not but it will get you [ __ ] way closer right so i can tell you there's no one program that changed my life but the decision to buy education changed my life forever does that make sense all right boom and so let me look at the top we have no reasons left not to own the power that you have it's just you all right and here's bonus number six and you can use this as one of like there's some clothes that you use all
(1:13:36) the time you always go back to right the reason you are telling yourself not to do this is the reason you do it how long do you want i can't afford this to be on your list of problems in life the fact that you don't have time is the very reason you need to do this the fact that you're so dependent on your spouse is the reason you need to take this decision and own it right the fact that you're not sure about the person that you want to be is the very reason that we're going to help you get it in this program so whatever the
(1:14:00) reason is is usually the biggest chain that you're holding on to is the thing that you're enslaving yourself to is the thing that you're casting your power to if you break that chain power comes back to you and so the very reason that you're holding yourself back is typically the very reason that you need to do it so hopefully this helps you realize that you and your clients are always in complete power did i accomplish that awesome thank you and like i promised at the beginning my hope is that you become more powerful by making decisions rather than letting life make them for you all right so
(1:14:35) here's a few final thoughts fortunes are created by taking a lot of risk with a little bit of money fortunes are maintained by taking a little bit of risk with a lot of money and every one of those people that was self-made takes a lot of risk a little bit of money and sometimes you need to take that step because it's the only way to build the fortune all right and if everything that i've ever made in my life sorry everything that i've made in my life is the result of investing in my own education it has gotten me far
(1:15:05) higher returns than any stock any real estate any crypto right any whatever by a mile and people say like it's all about investing yourself like i just i think it sounds amorphous it's like buy experience and skills because no government can take that from you no divorce can take that from you nothing can take that from you and i come from a family where so we're persian and so my my parents had to flee iran during the revolution and so they had land and houses and other stuff right and my uncle was uh the brother to a guy who started the
(1:15:45) lottery in iran he owned the lottery because you can do that there right very rich and so my dad and him he went to london my dad went to the u.s he had no skills and he was able to just forge enough money to buy a print shop and he lives above the print shop in london and still to this day that's what he does and went to visit him it was incredibly sad seeing just like what once once a incred and his wife my dad gave her a scarf and it was like a nice scarf apparently and she just bawled she's like i used to have rooms of these and now i have nothing and blah blah blah right my dad came the united
(1:16:21) states with a thousand dollars but because he had skills he built it all from scratch and so i mean he was a doctor as all middle eastern and indians are um right doctor lawyer account engineer anyways uh the only four approved paths but when we say invest in that we come from a place where like it was literally all taken the government was like that's our house now that's our land now that bank account is our bank account now and so that was why it was so and like that might be a benefit for me i had somebody who's always like it's the only thing no one can take from you
(1:16:58) and so why would you not invest in the one thing that can never be stolen can never be taken and compounds with time and it increases your capacity to make money increases your capacity to live and so i like to think of the investments that i've made in myself as bricks on a bridge and so if i'm on the bottom left here and where i want to be is the top right ish right looking like the nightmare before christmas now you're going like there are many skills that it takes to cross the bridge right and just like you
(1:17:30) have an arithmetic teacher in high school once you learn calculus you're not like that guy was a load of [ __ ] calculus is what no you have to learn things in sequence right and so the thing is is that we build this bridge it's one brick at a time and i always come back to the same question which is is this going to get me closer to where i want to go i don't need it to get me there i just need to get closer and if i get better i'll get there eventually right as long as i don't stop moving and so that's why that's that what i've dedicated my life to education my mission is to document and share the
(1:18:00) best practice of building world-class companies because when you realize that you are the source you realize that superman is not coming it's just you and every decision that you make is a vote towards or against the person that we want to be and so the question for you is that are your decisions voting towards the person that you want to become or just more of what you already have and so people ask me all the time how do you move so quickly and the answer is i know how to buy time and the follow-up question is how do you buy time you buy time by buying the time
(1:18:31) took other people to make mistakes that taught them the lessons that's how you do it right that's that's the heck and so right now the ignorance of not knowing how to create a million dollars a year is costing you a million dollars a year the fact that you don't know how to make a million dollars a year is costing you a million dollars a year think about it right and so therefore you should always be willing to invest money to increase the capacity for your income because once you have it that capacity pays you forever you're increasing your ability does that
(1:19:00) make sense we're widening the pipe and so when i thought about this i just added zeros to it and i was like it's [ __ ] costing me a billion dollars a year not knowing how to make a billion dollars god right but it's true because the thing the number one tax that no one appreciates or no one respects is not the tax of the government it's not capital gains it's not income tax it's the time tax of ignorance someone asked layla yesterday what's the number one thing that people from 0 to 10k are messing up
(1:19:31) you don't know what the [ __ ] you're doing that's what's messing you up you're ignorant you have no idea you're eating an orange like an apple no clue right and it's not because you don't have the processing power it's not because you don't have the ability to reason it's because you just don't know and so the goal is to pay down the time tax of ignorance as fast as humanly possible and the only way you do that is by educating and investing yourself right specifically investing in experiences that build skills so
(1:20:01) make the decisions that to help yourself implement like crazy take ownership because we just discovered that all the other [ __ ] is not real it is literally a distortion of reality that anything that you give your power to that's not you is fake you're making it a false god in your life and your prospects are too and now you know how to confront those when your mind tries to play tricks on you and realize that there are no silver bullets no program is going to save your life all right but some things can move you
(1:20:30) close to your goals and when those rare opportunities present themselves take them all right because either you win or you learn and both of those get you closer to wherever you want to go all right and so i'll wrap up with this ten years ago i had to that was me in a swanky uh you know when i was a consultant looking cool it was actually after i don't even have a good picture when i was a consultant but there's me in a suit um and i i knew i hated the job that i had um i made okay money but i just like i
(1:21:06) just really wasn't happy um and i emailed 40 gym owners i was like hey i think i want to get in fitness can somebody like help me out one guy was like sure you can work for free i was like awesome uh that guy was saying back to your and anybody know who sam bacteria is ray's hand geez okay well seven-figure sam is what he used to be known as he actually died during covet which was really sad for me because i really looked up to sam and the thing is is that when i got to his office i literally drove across the country from baltimore to l.a or chino hills
(1:21:40) which is where he was and i showed up without notice and he was like you're a psychopath i just met you from the internet i was like i'm here i'm ready to learn he was like i'm going to lunch and um but right after he came back from lunch he was like all right so you should join my my mastermind and i was like i don't have a gym he's like that's okay it was a gym mastermind um and i didn't i mean like i was 22 like i did not have a lot of money um and he was like well it's 10 grand and i was like i i don't know and he's like you need to [ __ ] commit man he's like you've been waffling back and forth i had multiple
(1:22:19) phone calls with him before i left um he's like i think you need to draw a line in the sand and thank you god you know thank god he did because i did take a step over i had no idea what the [ __ ] i was doing but i was trying to start paying down the time tax of ignorance and i got around a whole bunch of other fitness professionals and i learned way more from all of them than i ever learned from sam but because of that my belief started to change the ways i saw the world change the traits i started to embody change and started taking steps the mastermind
(1:22:49) i got from sam is not what made me a hundred million dollars but it got me on the right path towards making it and so if you can make those choices i think it's these small steps not believing that it's going to be a savior but believing that it's aligned with where you want to go and believing in yourself that if you keep walking on this path you'll get there so thank you guys so much [Applause]

Transcript:
(00:00) this is brutally honest advice for poor people I've been there I had toing pay rent every night I would think if I didn't wake up tomorrow I would be okay with it and I don't want that for anybody I get [Music] it I was just going through all these old files yesterday and I saw a goal that I had written which was to make $10,000 a month income and so it was 13 years ago and so like I viscerally remember what that was like um and I know I never I was in so much pain during that during that time that I get it and so like the reason we make this stuff is cuz I I've been there and I
(00:40) don't want that for anybody you know like I missed I missed my 20s like I just I didn't have them as people traditionally say it you know like it's it's weird because in today's like internet culture like I started my I started my first brick and mortar business like store Front I was 23 like I I know about like I knew nothing and like I didn't know you could hire employees like it wasn't a thought like I didn't know anything um and so like I cleaned I did the billing I did the sales I taught the sessions like I fixed the equipment like I did everything because I didn't know you
(01:21) could and I also I I didn't know and I didn't have the money frankly to afford anything else and so um I get it like like I get I get I get it um but to get out of that you have to take steps and the first step is saying that it's my fault the second step is that you have to use what you have and so in the beginning I would I would you know I I was reading the self- health books and all this stuff and um none of them really hit for me because a lot of it was like power of positive thinking and like affirmations and like
(02:01) all this stuff and the reason I make the content I do now which has now almost become like a shtick um countering that is be is because it didn't work for me and I'm trying like I'm not trying to speak to everybody if you if that works for you then like awesome like awesome like I people mistake me saying this is what worked for me with this is what I think everyone should do and it it couldn't be further from the truth I'm saying if what H what you have been doing hasn't been working then consider this which is that like I remember
(02:30) because I just read this yesterday the intro in the book I say um I wish I could tell you that the reason I was able to make it out of the gym was because I was like really passionate about changing people's lives and I loved Fitness and I loved you know my clients faces when they would light up and they'd step on the scale and they'd lose weight they'd be able to fit in their high school clothes again it was none of that it was just the sheer anger that I had but the idea of being wrong and having the People Back
(02:59) Home be right about everything and I just couldn't I couldn't I mean I still can barely tolerate it and so I mean I took in some ways and this isn't a uh I don't if woe is me is the right is the right term but like I had an otherwise very successful career like I was in a white collar job and sometimes it's hard like I mean hey I don't know I haven't been in the other situation but taking a step down and humbling yourself to minimum wage after you've been in a white collar situation not easy and I remember I had clients who walk in and be like oh did you did you uh did you go to college and they were saying that um
(03:39) patronizingly um and mind you everyone here at least this channel knows that I don't I don't give a um but they were saying it to basically like when I was going to like write something down like am I literate and in those moments again it was like I could be right or be rich like I could try and humiliate them back because of the pain of what they just said made me feel they probably didn't even that or I can be like yeah yeah I went to I went to school I'm very grateful for it you know like so what are your goals I could just move right past it and so you develop that skin because I had to because I had to pay rent
(04:13) and so I mean I tell stories about having a kid drawing marker on the wall while I'm trying to close his mom and he's writing in permanent marker and I'm trying not to lose my over the fact that I'm have to repaint the wall because she doesn't know how to parent a child but I needed to close the card to pay for the paint and so it's like I can scold the kid and lose the sail or I can close the sail and keep my cool and then eventually clean the clean the wall and so like you only get that stuff by doing
(04:39) it um and so if you're in if you're in a place right now where you don't have a lot you only have one thing which is time and so you have lower leverage I'm not going to lie to you and say that you like you're there there's this one play this one secret no it's just it's sheer Brute Force like you have to Will yourself out of it like there's you have to do it's it's like a it's a it's a huge amount of of Soul driving energy that you have to do outside of what you normally do so it's like you have to live one person's normal life you have
(05:14) to do your normal work your normal job you have to eat you have to sleep you have to clean you have to do whatever else and then then the workday starts so that is how you eat today but you're trying to get ahead and you have to eat tomorrow and so you have to you have to you have to eat the glass so that you can take the pain today and you're trying to take as much of the pain from tomorrow as you can today so you can get ahead and like even the concept of getting head I like I think about this visually which is like if you have this this timeline of life that you can pull
(05:45) towards you and it's glass in the beginning and then it's slightly less less coarse and then less coarse and then it gets and then it gets neutral and then it starts to get a little bit sweeter and a little bit sweeter and a little bit sweeter but you have to get through that glass period where you pull towards you and I do have this theory that like on a long enough time R and if we could live A Thousand Years everyone would eventually be successful but people wait too long and they die too early and I say die too early on a long on a long timeline and so I want I have
(06:14) to live today and tomorrow and the next day so I can live three days at a time so I can get to my second and third life's benefits now and so that was what like I remember the only times that I took off when I was when I was at the gym and one of the biggest things that I was grateful for with the gyms is that I moved across the country and so I knew no one I was at Huntington Beach I was from Baltimore like no one and what would happen so one of the gifts of that was that once the week was over my Saturday sessions were done at like noon
(06:45) my phone didn't ring no like in some ways very sad because like no one wanted to see Alex you know what I mean like no one was inviting me out but I was like  like I got to make this work and so I would just I'd sit there and be like how do I sell memberships how do I Market how do I everything you know but I but that was how I got ahead and so I I tell the stories of like I remember when I when I stopped watching the Ravens and I was from Baltimore so that was like like a tie to home and so um yeah it's fresh for me because I just read the story yesterday but it was like it was
(07:29) tough I'll catch my breath so all that to say the sacrifices that I encourage people to take are not sacrifices I did not make and I I don't say that there there's there's no ways to to get there I'm just saying that this is the way I got there and if this path works for you then maybe it works better than what you're doing right now which is I had a lot of pain and so I I tried to use it I just use what I had I just you know I was just angry I didn't I didn't want to fail and so I just kept going and so
(08:15) there was no like there just wasn't another option and so I think that's like that's what I would encourage people to think about was like they're just there I just didn't I didn't allow another option because the other option was just was just worse than dying because I mean I've told this story before and things get hyperbolized I mean you know exaggerated romanticized whatever but like when I had my big consulting job I was making good money and I had the approval of my my peers and all this stuff and I just didn't
(08:52) want to wake up the next day every day and it wasn't like I was trying to kill myself it wasn't that but I was I every night I would think if I didn't wake up tomorrow I would be okay with it and so when I knew that that was what I was going back to if I didn't make this work I just had I had no plan B I mean I had Plan B is that I would drive Uber and strip I joke about that but that was very much my plan B if I didn't make it work um but and I I I get I get grilled on social media for saying this because of like race Wars but like there
(09:28) have been slaves for thousand thousands of years there were slaves in Egyptian times there were Jews who were slaves there were Persian slaves there were white slaves there were back slaves humans have enslaved one another period And I like to think of things in extremes because it allows me to think about what's possible and so the idea that someone else at some other time in history has worked seven days a week every hour that they're awake with a threat not of their own death but of their children's death because that's what I would do if I were trying to control somebody I would take their kids and say kill them if you
(10:00) don't work and guess what they'll probably work that that capacity exists and so I would think to myself like I would try and I would try and put myself in that frame so that I wouldn't get into the woe is me cycle and think all these things I could blame for why I'm here right now why isn't this working as fast like how is it that these guys are making more money than me like why don't these people give me the respect I deserve blah BL blah blah blah blah um and just say like what can I do now and then just every hour of every day well what can I do now and so it was
(10:41) I have to learn how to Market I have to learn how to sell I have to I have to go to these these groups that where other gym owners are and I got to learn their stuff I gotta I got to go to these seminars I got to save up so I can learn some stuff and that's what I did and so that's how I got out of it that visual of life as this like bloody game of tug of war where like most people their hands just get too cut to keep holding on to the Rope is like it's in it's stuck in my head yeah it's that's really powerful yeah it was
(11:14) tough so I'm I'm the first 100 Grand is the hardest and I know that that sounds like an unfathomable amount of money it took me 5 years like I get it so like you just just have to save it $1 at a time like that's like that's what it is now obviously I talk about other things like there are smarter ways to make money for sure like if you can sell expensive stuff you can just move the decimals like I mean like the thing is is it is factually true it is spiritually false and I don't even believe in spirituality in general but like it is it is tough to sell a $10
(11:55) million building and make a million doll commission or a $500,000 Commission when you are broke as it is very like it is like you would have to become a different person which is why most people's first sale is not that but is it technically possible yes a lot of people watch YouTube and the internet for complex money-making skills and they haven't even mastered showing up on time and so it's like they want to go straight to calculous but they don't know how to do simple Edition but the thing is is like simple Edition is foundational to that and none of the
(12:30) other stuff will matter unless you can do the basics but the basics doesn't make them less important usually they're the foundation of building which make them arguably more important they just are simpler to understand but not simpler to do and I think that's the big disconnect a lot of people have is that they think they because they understand something conceptually that they feel like they have already mastered the skill which are two very different things and so one of the most common traits that people who are poor have is that it's always tomorrow and so they never talk about anything in terms of
(13:01) today and so it's about starting tomorrow the diet tomorrow the diet on Monday next year my New Year's resolution it's always it's always pushing off so rather than uh delaying gratification they delay pain and so rather than trying taking pain now for pleasure later they take pleasure now and pain later and so they flip the equation and so they're surprised when today is later from yesterday that they're in pain because because if if last week you were like I'm starting my diet this week then it is now this week
(13:37) and you've delayed the pain to today and that means that the body you have right now is the result of the delayed pain that you are now forcing yourself to endure and so they're somehow surprised when the bill comes due that they pushed off from the past and so the first lesson of getting out of poverty is two words it's my fault it's I have to own that and I think my fault you can kind of extrapolate to right now not like you basically have to own everything that passed to this moment so all the pain that I've gone through all of the Mondays that I've missed all of the
(14:14) diets that I've skipped all of the savings I haven't made all of those are not my dad's fault my mom's fault my circumstances fault the country I was born in Fault the ZIP code any of those things fault it's just mine and the thing is is that people have this belief that because they have a strong argument for why it's something or someone else's fault that that somehow helps them and it just doesn't because whatever you cast blame to is where you also cast power to and so if I say I can't succeed because my mom didn't love me guess who controls me my mom and so
(14:51) if you also like replace my mom with a race a gender a political party whatever the thing like I can't succeed because of Trump's laws I can't succeed because of the radical left because of wokeism because of whatever you actually give that thing more power in your life than you give yourself and so it's completely it the thing is is that and this is what's so deceiving about it is it's very it's very um self-fulfilling is that you get more evidence and you get more confirmation you get more evidence you get more confirmation and the more your life sucks the more you're confirmed that you were right but like
(15:28) do you want to be right about the fact that your life sucks or would you rather like there's there's I think it's an old Zig Ziggler saying he said you can either be right or you can be rich and I mean it's simple but this is what he was getting at is that you can say you know what you are right your dad kicked the out of your whole life and you don't have any confidence because he told you a piece of every day you're right but in order to be rich you need to let that go because every day you say that I'm not successful because of this it means because this now owns you and
(16:01) for me personally that realization that the thing that I hated most in the world the things that I blamed for why my life wasn't the way it was I was their and just realizing that um made me angry but through that anger I was able to say well them like I will succeed despite the fact that my dad said this or my mom said this or Barack Obama said this or Trump said this or the woke left says what despite that despite the fact that the chips are stacked against me I will still win why does saying my fault and
(16:37) taking that accountability begin to set someone down the path of making more money and so if you think about if we think about success in terms of layers like foundations right the the the base level like when you're digging the building where you put the hole and you pour the concrete in the base of the entire thing is who is in power who is source because if it's anything but you in that base layer all of the other things on top of them will topple down it's it's a foundation of sand otherwise you can't
(17:09) build on top of blaming other people there's nothing that stands on it you see like I want to learn sales but I can't learn sales because I didn't get hugged enough as a kid and so I don't like people and so as long as you keep holding on to that you have sand as your foundation but if you want to learn how to sell or you want to learn how to Market or you to learn how to do whatever until you say well it's my fault that I don't know it and because of that it's within my power to change it so it's not sales
(17:40) books it's not it's not reading offers it's not it's not even your books at the at the very beginning you have to accept that which is the first two words my fault my responsibility all me I am source and then once you can accept that one thing and what's crazy is that that one Foundation is where 90% of people literally aren't they're not there they can't do it the reason my girlfriend left me is because of this not me the reason I lost my job is cuz my my employer was a dick my boss sucked whatever the economy like but like it never serves you like give me one
(18:17) instance one example this is to anybody who's listening to this one example of when you blame something else and it made you better one you can't find it because it's fundamentally not true and so you cannot both desire to get better and also maintain blame you have to pick when did this really hit home for you was it when you lost money no when I was 19 years old I had to write an essay about uh depression in an intro to site class and I used to I don't talk about mother my mother very much but I used to Har a lot I was an equal I was an equal opportunity angry person I was angry at
(18:56) everybody uh in other words I blamed everyone and so I blamed her for X Y and Z and I remember having to write this essay on depression and you had to do it from someone else's perspective and so you had to say how would they how would the environment and their upbringing things like that contribute to the outcomes in their life and so by writing the essay true or not to be clear about my mother's upbringing and how heart she had as an immigrant coming here getting beat up as a kid getting made up for not being able to speak the language all that kind of stuff and this
(19:33) was in the 50s it's when like it was more accepted to beat up foreigners rather than let them in anyways um so she had a tough time and so it made sense and and when I framed it like that I was like you know maybe she's actually a massive success given where she started and so then I thought to myself now mind you I still wasn't over it but it was in this process that the first thing that happened is when I went back home for fall break or winter break I remember she said something to me which would normally just like be the beginning of some big fight you know you get into these routines like I'll say this thing that we both hate and then
(20:11) we'll just get in a nice fight about it and she said the trigger and I was just like I understand you I'm sorry you went through the stuff you went through and she just like looked completely shocked and then just like started balling and so I was like we're cool like you don't anger me anymore and I think for the most part since then like that's been more or less the dynamic that shifted but leading into that was also the idea that all the relationships that i' had that i' blamed for not working because of the dynamic that I had with my mother I was like I am giving her this power over my love
(20:53) life that's gross and so I was like well I'd rather just say it's on me to change and not have my mom or parents at all involved in my relationships and so that was me taking it's her fault that I can't make these things work I have commitment issues I don't want to get close to people I've been hurt before blah blah blah to like okay well let's take it to the ACT extrem great you're right you'll never be close to anyone you'll never have a relationship that I'll last you're right now what I remember I was out a conference and I had this lady stand up
(21:32) in the crowd and I had just done a thing on like I don't remember what it was called it offers and she stood up and said let me give you six reasons why this isn't going to work for my business and so she went down her list and I was like uh-huh uh-huh uh-huh so I got to the end of the whole thing and um she said and that's why this isn't going to work for my business and I was like you're right you'll never be able to make this work for your business and she looked at me like angry and she lashed back she's like yes I yes I will I'll be able to make this work for my business for this reason this reason and so the
(22:06) thing is is that like if the victim frame is just taken to the Natural extreme you realize that you're right you win the game and by being right the entire team you lose everything and so it's one of these frames that I love Dr cashi says this he says you're 99% right but 100% wrong and what that means is like for example if I every time I bring a girl home and I want my parents approval I bring her home and they say this isn't the one this isn't the one she's not good enough whatever it is every time it's easy for them to say
(22:38) that because every single person you date except for the one you marry they are right on and so they're 99% of the time they're right and they're confirmed by saying that that person that you bring home is not good enough because every time eventually you break up oh it's not going to last this isn't the one it keeps going right but if you keep doing that all the way to the Natural extreme you're 100% wrong because you will be wrong eventually it's the same thing as like I want to start this business it's not going to work it's not going to work the second one will work the fifth one won't work the seventh one
(23:07) work won't work and they're right but they're just wrong on the long enough time Rison because one of them will work and one of the girls or one of the guys that you bring home will be the one that you are going to be with but it's so much safer for them to be right and right and right and you and they get deceived by their short-term rightness that they miss the long-term wrong and we do this to oursel too when you're in the victim frame I don't even like using the victim frame but when you're in the powerless frame you give the power away and you get to be right
(23:38) over that's why it didn't work this didn't work this relationship won't work this job won't work you keep it's not going to work this time either because you get to be right over and over again it makes you feel good in the short term but in the long term you guarantee the loss I think there's also like social reinforcement like we love to complain about the weather it's literally the same thing as never investing like if you want to invest your money right and you like you have all this big pile of savings if you ever invest there's
(24:03) always the possibility that it goes down in the short term it's just the nature of markets in general but if you never invest you guarantee that you will never get rich over the Long Haul and so every day you could make this risk you take a small risk but you guarantee a macro win so you take a small risk today potential for loss today for the guarantee over the long haul that it grows and it makes you money but the flip side is you don't take the small risk of loss today you take the Comfort today for the guarantee that you get the long loss and so so
(24:34) many people flip their life to that same thing is that they have they flip the pleasure for today and they and they they just forget the second half of this which is pain for tomorrow and that today is also yesterday's tomorrow and we're living through the pain that you cast like you own this and until you're like this is my fault them in pain today because of decisions that I put off pain for tomorrow where today is tomorrow when you're broke every dollar means so much to you but and you want to see the dollars in
(25:07) your bank account go up but I never made that my goal I made the amount of money I made every month my goal because I saw that as my like potential energy versus stored energy not to get I mean whatever physics people you get what I'm saying and so I was willing to take that stored energy and reinvested to take $5,000 a month in income to make it $6,000 a month cuz I knew that over a year I was going to make 12 and so if it cost me two to make the 12 in income I would make that trade every time and so whenever I'd save up a small like nut
(25:42) now obviously I've always been pretty good at about spending money like I i' I haven't had that that habit so like again foundations like first it's your fault second spend less than you make third take all of the excess and spend it on making more because if you're making minimum wage I'm GNA say what you probably already know you're not going to get ahead like you're not going to save your way there you're not like everyone loves to tell the story of that one girl at McDonald's but you know they don't tell the other hundred million people who worked at McDonald's over
(26:12) over the world who didn't make it and like the outcome they're talking about is like she made a million over 40 years at working McDonald's like you can shoot for more and so like take the money you make live on nothing and the hard part is just swallowing the Pride for the fact that in the short term everyone's going to be right when they say that you're amounting to nothing and that's the tough part that's the glass that you have to you have to swallow that they have to pull towards you and there's just no other way like you have to learn
(26:43) the skills now I mean to be fair YouTube didn't exist when when I was doing this and like Instagram was like a new platform so like all this stuff like the stuff we have today is crazy like the stack that these videos and this podcast like all the stuff didn't ex like I remember when podcasting came out out like I was already a business owner like none of this stuff existed but at the time I just took all the money I had and I I want to I want to make this point again is that people think that the money is about buying courses and stuff like that and you can like there's
(27:12) nothing wrong with that I've learned a ton from a lot of the stuff that I've bought to be really honest with you but I think that I've always had an amazing return on education because I always did it and I think like I always wanted to be the best student in every class and I was good at school and I and I I just took business as a different another another type of school but part of the expenses that come into like what you take that money for is experiments that fail and so one of the things that
(27:34) happens when you're broke is that you bet on stuff and it doesn't work and people feel like they're back at zero but you're not back at zero you're at where you were plus one experience plus two experiences plus three experiences plus four experience but when you have plus 18 experiences all of a sudden Boop you level up one you get experience points there's a reason in video games call experience points so you didn't trade it for nothing you got an experience point and with enough experience points you get to the Next
(27:58) Level and so I think if you just even thought about it like that it's not a loss but at an experience point it could get it could bridge the gap between your current income level and the income level that you want to get to and then guess what there's more experience point that you have to get there and those experience points also cost more money because when you take a bed in the beginning and when I say it cost money it's like if you run an ad and it doesn't work it costs money if you want to set up a Shopify store or an
(28:21) e-commerce store and you spend 30 40 50 bucks a month whatever it costs money um and it does you know like all of the these things cost money to start now mind you it cost a lot less than it did in the 20s when you had to mortgage your house and guarantee that you'd win or you'd lose everything forever um so like the bar hasn't never been lower than it is now but there still is a bar and you have to get over it and I still think that the vast majority of the that people trying to get over has nothing to
(28:44) do with the difficulty of business but the first step the foundation which is it is my fault that I am here and in it being my fault I am the one who can get me out of it it sounds like in that stage three when you start experimenting and investing in that and let's say the kid who has a failed Drop Shipping experiment or starts a school group and they want to win the school games but they don't they measuring stick for whether or not they're doing well shouldn't be how much money they're making or should it like should they be thinking about money at that point
(29:13) or so the wealthiest people I know only think about skills they think about what can I learn and then what can this skill get me and so they will always take any money they can to buy more more skills and in the beginning you have to buy all the skills yourself once you have enough skills that you can generate an excess of income you can start buying other people's lives and what I mean by that is like everything comes down to buying time and so at some point you're 10 years into your career and you have a handful of skills but you can buy someone else's 10 years of skills by just paying them to do something too so
(29:52) you don't have to learn all those things and so you do need to get good at stuff and then eventually you generalize to being good at people and that's pretty much always the path for everyone maybe the framing is like a lot of people who are wanting to make more money just don't know what the Avenues are yeah so a lot of people who want to make money don't understand how money is made and so it's made by getting it from someone else and they have to give it to you voluntarily or it's theft and so assuming you don't want to steal then you have to give something to someone else first and then by doing that they
(30:25) give you money in exchange which is why I love capitalism it's voluntary exchange between two parties and both parties say thank you at the end because both parties think they're better off from the trade and so the idea is what you want to be able to do is find something valuable to trade and so you can either trade stuff you can find a place where you can get stuff and then bring it to other people where it's convenient for them so they pay you more than you did when you had to go find it at some back alley cuz you know Suburban mom doesn't want to go into back alley
(30:56) to get X Y and Z but you'll give it to man it sounds like I'm explaining drugs but well there's a reason they make money but anyways point is is that you can sell stuff at a at a margin and a part of that margin is going to be the convenience that you deliver them and either you're selling stuff to someone else manufactures you create your own stuff now if you're starting out you're probably going to sell someone else's stuff and I do think and I I mean I'm saying this right now I do love the concept that the first thing you sell is not the last thing
(31:25) you're going to sell and so learning to sell in and of itself the best way to learn to sell is sell something and that's why uh referral referral uh programs Ambassador programs affiliate programs for different types of businesses almost every business I've ever owned has an affiliate program um it's great to enroll in those I'm not even going to say any of the names of the companies that that we have because I want you like it's not about that I want you to if you can just because then you you only have to figure out one skill like if I just sell someone if I just promote I get paid cool and I can
(31:54) do that over and over again now over time you're like man I want to make more of the nut cool then you just you eat up more of the responsibility so you can either sell stuff or you can sell skills you can SK sell outcomes and so that's where you develop a certain expertise so like in the beginning for me and like the first time this ever like the first money I ever made from a stranger was that I had a lady at the gym it's a real story I was in really good shape I like to think so and she said will you meet me uh and
(32:26) do a nutrition consultation for me and she didn't even say that she said will you help me with my food I think is what she said and I said sure um and so we met at a at a pizza place ironically college no this was after college this is after graduate from college um when I was still consultant so I I went we met at a Pete's Place and I was like okay well what are you currently eating and she was like this and I was like well what do you want to do she's like I'm trying to lose weight and I was like
(32:51) well this is something I eat for breakfast that's less calories than your thing it's pretty good and try this and try this and try this and it took like an hour and then um I had like a notepad and I gave her the notes or whatever and she took out her purse and she wrote $200 on a check and she handed it to me she was like thanks so much and I was like looked I was just like looking at the check looking at her looking at the check looking at her and I was like okay don't act surprised and I was like uh
(33:18) thanks and then she left and I was like holy I was like I just got paid for but like realistically I'd been in at this point I was competing so I'm winning I'm like I had a state record at that point I was in I was in shape you know what I mean um and I think she knew I was a state record holder cuz the gym that I was was powerlifting gym um but I had done some stuff I had gotten some level of authority on some tiny thing and people were like oh can you help me with that too and to be really honest with you my entire life and I'm saying like there's many paths but like my life
(33:50) has been learn something get good at it have evidence that you were good at the thing and then people ask you for help on that thing and so in the beginning people asked me how to get in shape and then I started a business around getting people in shape and then people who had businesses around getting people in shape asked me how I was getting my businesses that were getting people in shape to work and then people who had businesses that were national scale that helped people in a specific Niche or industry started asking me how I was
(34:13) helping people in a specific nich industry and then people who had really big businesses just started asking me how did you get a really big business and so like my entire life's been simply doing as hard as I could to get good at something and then do it enough times and to be really like very clear with you every time I did it it was not to move on to the next step it was to just get good at the thing and then by getting good at the thing people asked me about it and so it wasn't like I lost 10 pounds and then tried to start selling you know weight loss advice I had multiple State records and I
(34:44) like I looked good you know what I mean like I was in very good shape and then people started asking me about it and then I didn't have one gym and start telling people hey here's how you run a gy I had six gyms by the time I was 26 and and then people were like okay you're 26 and you have six gyms and you did all cash flow like you're doing something right and then people started asking me about the stuff and then and then when I had the licensing business doing 4 million a month people who had other bigger businesses were doing a million a month or 500,000 a month like how do you get to 4 million a month and I was like well this is what I did and
(35:16) so like I've just tried to figure it out and it's it's like the path has always been revealed as I took more steps and so I think a big fallacy in the early on days is trying to think that you're going to figure out the entire path before you even take the First Step it's just not true I was going to ask how important is it for someone to have that moment with the check where they just make their first I mean in some ways I think it's everything in other ways it's nothing like one of the cool um Shameless plug for school the
(35:42) um 3.44% of people who finished their first month of school make their first dollar online and that's like so like like that's why we do it you know what I mean like I know how hard that first dollar is like there's there's so much to get the first dollar across the because the second dollar comes so much faster after that um that I mean that's why that's why I invest in the company that's why I'm so adamant about it but um anyways the the point is is that yes I think having the first dollar get across is very important but if you can reframe it from that experience points
(36:19) perspective that there's there's there's probably three levels before that you have to like level one is that you have to understand that it's my fault level two is that you have to use what you have not what you wish you had to get to where you want to go and where you want to go isn't 100 steps forward it's just the next step and so like I don't think that anger drives me as much as it used to but it was everything that I had when I started and so if I had listen to the positivity Mantra when I started I never would have gotten going because nothing made me feel happy and so they were like
(36:51) follow your passion and I was like my passion is to not be poor and to not be here in Baltimore that's my passion is not be here and so that's what drove me and so I think that it just needs to be restated that like is that the goal sure but is that necessary to start no it's not and so I can tell you that even when I was angry um and getting through that making more money did make my life better like I had more ability to deal with inconveniences hassles health issues from family members that I had to putot the bill for like all these things like money can
(37:27) provide value and so um I'll say this thing that a mentor told me he said money does not buy happiness but it can help you avoid pain and so like I think that there's nothing wrong with getting with making money obviously I like doing it um but I just hate the people who espouse that you have to feel a certain way to win or that or that winning when you are angry or sad or in pain or shame is somehow wrong and so I just like you have to meet success where you're at and the first step you have to take out of anger and the next step you have to take out of sadness and the next one you have to take out of Shame and use that to to
(38:10) propel yourself forward all that matters you take the step and one of the things that I always like is for a very long time I didn't consider myself a good person I mean I still probably don't but um in terms of like I I always identified with the villain um and the oppressor in most scenarios which is bad but anyways but I there's a point to this is that I never thought that I deserved the good life I never thought I didn't think I deserve the happy ending I put it that way and so the thing that got me through that was the idea and this felt like honestly like gaming the system so like from the
(38:49) evil side was that I could still get the good guys ending if I just did the thing that they do to get the ending so I didn't have to do it with pure intentions I didn't have to do it as a great guy but if I just still did the things I could still get the getting and I think for me that that realization has been why my ruthless focus on like what did you do and to everyone who listens to my stuff like it's like great throw the emotions out throw the spiritual energy vibrations out what do you do patience is just figuring out what to do do in the meantime like courage is
(39:30) acting as though you weren't afraid like like what do you do and then eliminating everything else and then just doing that and then doing whatever mental tricks you have to do which is like there were slaves who work seven days a week so can I like and then alternatively catastrophizing the alternative path which is that if I do not do anything this is what will happen eventually that pain in the future will be my pain today and then actively thinking about what that pain would be like and then seeing if that can make you more uncomfortable than the comfort that you're in and I think I I think
(40:05) Tony Robin says this he says change happens when the pain of staying the same sorry when the pain of change is less than the pain of staying the same and so if you're comfortable and staying the same the point is to make yourself more in pain to get yourself to move and so I think there's a skill in being able to Future pace and think through what pain you're going to go through like if you're like man okay I have gained 5 lb a year and it has been 4 years so I'm 20 lb up well if 4 years from now I'm
(40:36) another 20 lbs heavier and Imagining the snide comments at the Holiday party or the if you're a girl the guy who says man she'd be really cute if she lost 40 PBS or like even like I'm going girls perspective here a guy who says something that's like um I would be with her but she's just she's just too fast she's just not cute enough and you're like wow that's so Politically Incorrect deal with it it's life but the thing is is like your thoughts don't need to be politically correct they're your thoughts they're no one else's thoughts and so whatever you have to do to get yourself there and for
(41:12) me the idea that a girl that I would want to be with would be like I just don't think he's ambitious enough I don't think he's successful enough like that those ideas killed me and so I never wanted to be denied entry to somewhere because I didn't have these things now do I believe that people should be denying entry no but I also realize that's the way the world is and so you I think you can balance both beliefs like I'd love things to be different but I accept the fact that they're not does this feel like a good argument for getting rid of other broke
(41:37) friends because I bet other broke friends reduce the pain of staying the same a friend who supports you is someone who deliberately decreases the possibility of failure and so if you look at your friends and you ask yourself does this person increase or decrease the possibility of failure with my goal it's very easy to answer that question it's yes or no it's increase or decrease there's no in between do they increase or they decrease my possibility that I get to my goal if the answer is decrease and get rid of them because imagine that you have 100% chance of
(42:14) hitting your goal and you have three friends that have a 30% decrease like you might now have a have a you know whatever third time three is whatever you have 27% chance of hitting your goal now because you have three terrible friends like negative experience yeah yeah they're they're they're it's like getting in video games it's like you've got somebody who's casting like a slow spell on you and you're like moving so slow and you're like weak and like all your all your hits have like half power like a lot of people need to
(42:42) shed friendships but the thing is it's more that they call them friends but they're not really friends they're just there and they're there because they've always been there but not because they should be there but because they're going to help you get to where you want to go they just they're just there they exist they're not going anywhere they don't have goals and they're at a different part of their Journey there's nothing wrong with that but if you're going to start the path of of of drinking glass and starting to to to double time you got to live your life and you got to live tomorrow's life and the next day's life and start dragging
(43:12) that towards you they're going to they're going to be upset about it and so one of the say I recently have that I like a lot which is there are no social obligations only social consequences and the people who want to deliver those consequences often do it by talking to you less and by avoiding you more they try to spend less time with you and talk to you less to punish you for the fact that you missed the party you missed the going out you didn't show up to their wedding you didn't show up to their dogs christening
(43:44) or whatever but the crazy thing is is that if you felt obligated to go then it means you didn't want to go and if mean that means that if you didn't want to go and the punishment of not going is that you don't have to go more in the future because they avoid you and they don't invite you anymore then to me that's a win-win you save time today and you save time tomorrow and I don't understand why people are not willing to deal with that like just looking at what happens rather than whatever emotional noise they make with their face at you like moving past that great you expelled Air at me
(44:16) understood got it but the outcome is you will no longer invite me which is what I want great I feel like we won here and so thinking second and third order outcomes from what happens when I quote break up with this friend or what happens when I offend this friend a lot of times it's you closer to your goal and I've always been okay with that and like if someone if someone like the moment I have seen somebody as decreased in the likely that I hit my goal I am happy to tell them that like I think I think you are not good for me I don't think you help me hit what I want to hit and they' be like well then
(44:57) they'll try and downgrade your goals and say you shouldn't believe this way and then they'll cast their beliefs on you and for me it's like that's amazing that you believe that I don't believe that and I don't really want to believe what you believe because then I would have your life and I certainly don't want that and so like again I I you I I make these tweets about this but it's like if you don't like their life don't listen to what they say like don't take their advice if you don't like what you see
(45:20) and so if everyone around you has a life you don't want then don't listen to any of their advice like again hopefully you're listening to this and you're watching if there's some element of my life or whatever that you find awesome cool then maybe some element of what I can share is helpful for you um but you have to put blinders on because there is a period of time where you and I mean I've said this but you're not going to be successful enough for the next tier of friends but you're too different from the friends that you used to have and so that middle path is very lonely but the
(45:51) good thing about loneliness is you've got time and right now time's what you need because you got to learn stuff you got to get the skills so you can start trading that for more and more money and then you can take the money and trade that for more money but in the beginning you just have time and that's what you have to spend and so if you are broke or you are poor and wish to no longer be broken poor the first is owning the fact that everything that has to do with your life is your fault and a lot of people will reject that and you're right stay poor you're
(46:21) totally right you'll never be successful you're totally right I believe you the next next step is being willing to use what you have rather than what you think you should have or what you wish you had the circumstances the connections the money whatever the passion the purpose the meaning behind the work you can wish for all that stuff but you don't have it so you have to use what you have which could be anger could be shame could be pain whatever and then as soon as you start taking action everyone around you will collapse and
(46:58) try to pull you down and so the only way to protect yourself against that is to increase your own approval of self and decrease how much their opinion of you matters which means that you have to be you have to be proud of you for taking the step and actively look at their lives and think do I want what they have if the answer is no then do not listen to what they say and then when you do that you keep walking you keep taking steps no matter how painful it is then you never stop and if you do that you will get
(47:40) there so cool

Transcript:
(00:00) so you want to get shred in 2024 well you're going to need lots of exag testosterone and to pick better parents but if you're not going to do either of those things I've got 12 protein packed recipes that require zero Time Zero prep have almost zero carbs almost zero fat and tons and tons of protein this loan has over 200 g of protein and almost none of the other macros and I'm going to show you this recipe at the end of the video first let's talk about breakfast Chef bro Rd to the rescue so breakfast the least talked about thing of the day was like breakfast champions
(00:30) for old people uh it's also great for gains so uh if you're somebody who struggles to eat enough like I do or if you're somebody who eats too much also works for you I'm going to show you how to make a 100 G protein bomb for zero prep in just a minute using stuff that you have at home that actually tastes delicious so number one I use this F yogurt there's plenty of other brands it doesn't really matter I use this 0% this puppy has 94 g of protein in it and just under 500 calories for this whole thing and if you have this this whole thing it is spilling and for people who struggle
(01:02) with dairy yogurt tends to do a little bit better than somebody who just drinks pure milk cuz it's already turned so already has some of those metabolites and all that fancy stuff that I know nothing about that being said I do know that if you eat that compared to drinking gallon of milk that's easier on the stomach now we're going to take something that's all natural and we're going to ruin it with lots of artificial flavors so that it's actually delicious and you can use a bowl what I usually do is I just put it in here because I don't like dishes and I will take fruit punch
(01:29) I like Berry personally uh there's different ones there's like a berry sangria that's pretty good and the nice thing with this is that these are always available everywhere so if you travel and you usually have your Main Stays at home you're like shoot what do I do like almost every grocery store nowadays has has Greek yogurt and so I put about half of one of these guys in and this is like for a pitcher so I figur this is about half a pitcher of fluid so I put half of one of these guys in and then I mixy mixy mixy now if you do need a bigger
(01:55) bowl cuz it does make it easier to mix just for visuals I'll show you guys you put this guy in that looks great and then we just mix this guy so this is my prep time can we start the timer here's my prep time you also get a nice little forearm pump so you get a little pre-workout workout if you know what I'm talking about what's cool about this is it actually smells like Yokai or Danon or any of your favorite uh you know yogurt yogurt brands that we know and loved when we grew up and then later found out they were made by big farmer to kill us and all that stuff anyways I like Fruity
(02:32) Pebbles so this is my preferred uh cereal of choice let's take this guy out and so here's the cool part is that this can stretch a really long way so a cup of this has 140 calories in it and 30 G of carbs pretty much nothing else it's almost all carbs all right so let me show you guys a fancy trick so leave the actual cereal scooper as one cup in there so that you always know what you're getting every time and and so for me I pull out my cup make sure it's even on the top don't give yourself a heaping scoop all right and then after that I know I've got 140 calories of carbs and
(03:09) so rather than mix them in because then they get soggy what I'll do is I'll sprinkle some on top doesn't that look delicious and then I'll peel off the first layer they stay crunchy and then I'll put the next layer on and then I'll peel off the second layer so I can have this nice Fruity Pebble crunch all the way through and you can see I didn't like I barely used a lot of my cup and I just did two kind of coverings worth and you can use like a cup is plenty you could do a half cup like if you're dieting cuz I've done this when I was dieting if you use a/2 cup of this it's 70 calories it's 15 G
(03:44) of carbs and this thing's 500 calories of protein with basically nothing else and it almost nothing else right and so that's my choice it's like this is a filling breakfast all right you put all this in here that is a filling filling breakfast it looks like a massive bowl of cereal except this has almost 100 g of protein in it it doesn't take any time to prep and if you eat it out of there which is what I normally do you don't even have any dishes let's see if it's as good as I remember it still delicious by the way if you do have a beard beard Nemesis so definitely
(04:20) check yourself in the mirror before you leave the house other you have pink all over your face that being said let's go to the next one by the way I'm making these recipes because the last video I did so many of you guys commented saying like give us a part two and so this is part two and we'll have the recipes in the link in the description enjoy so this was a lunch that I had for like a couple years because I tend to stick with the same thing for a really long time until one day I decide I'm going to have something different but this is an awesome lunch so this is Ezekiel bread
(04:49) which is just fancy organic schmancy bread that has I don't know less preservatives whatever it's in the refrigerated section it's like a dollar and a half more anyways so I had this stuff cuz I figured if I'm going to have it every day I try to eat better stuff so that being said take two of these guys and if you want to know per slice each slice of this thing is only 80 calories which is not bad for a slice of bread especially given how like weighty it is so some some slices of bread are like kind of foamy you could like mash
(05:13) it in your hand and put into a little itty bitty ball this has more weight to it so it's 80 calories it's got 5 gr of protein in it 15 G of carbs and almost no fat now if you like toast which I do there's speed toasters that can toast it in like half the time or a third of the time and every minute is precious to me so I have a speed toaster that I toast these guys in but just to keep this video rolling imagine these are toasted all right so once it's toasted what I do and I've experimented with different ways to eat this cuz I ate it every
(05:41) single day for like 2 years is I have fat-free cream cheese all right so this is zero fat cream cheese which you're like how does that even work honestly no idea it's probably some sort of Franken food it just kind of has the texture of cream cheese I think they use milk to make it who honestly knows I don't really care that much but it tastes pretty good the way to to do this guy is uh usually sometimes they'll have like little measurement things on here um if you have a scale because you want to be precise awesome I have done it enough times to know kind of like what a
(06:10) tablespoon looks like um and so that's about what that looks like and by the way these are lowfat locks again I'm a lowfat guy which means it's pretty if you have fish that doesn't have carbs in it and used to have fat what's left protein so this is pretty much close to the same macros as a chicken breast kind of cool um it is a little bit drier just to be fair but for me I didn't really care that much The Taste was good enough for me and that worked different ways you can eat it version one is you put the cream cheese on and you layer that
(06:39) on top I don't like that because the bread starts to get soggy the next way you can do it is that you can put the salmon on here and then bite by bite put the cream cheese on that way does work cuz it doesn't like the salmon doesn't really make the bread wet but the problem is that the Salmon's really hard to bite into cuz then you pull the whole thing off of the bread and so after eating this a lot of times I have some settled on the third way of doing it which is that I actually Mash this guy up into like salmon
(07:05) tartar all right so I just cut the out of this thing and I really I'm not even trying to like grind it up I just want to make it in big enough slices that if it comes like I'm not going to tear the whole thing off the bread when I eat it so that I like I still have salmon that's on there when I'm eating it all right tricks of the trade now once I have this now what I'll do is I'll take my cream cheese I'll throw this guy on I'll some with this on and then I just take my bite and I just do that over and
(07:35) over and over again and that has been how I ate it for years and years and years so the bread stays crunchy I don't have to accidentally eat half my salmon in one bite and then just eat plain ass bread the rest of the time and the cream cheese stays cold because if the cream cheese is cold and then the bread is hot they just end up being lukewarm and sucking and so this stays crunchy and hot this stays cold and creamy and then I have a bitable amount of s and it doesn't tear off at once and that is how I eat this thing now let's talk about macros real quick so remember this
(08:05) thing's all protein this is more or less all protein and this is low calorie so if you didn't want to eat Ezekiel I would just say go with low calorie bread I just try to minimize my carb intake unless I'm trying to eat them on purpose and so I pretty much just eat protein throughout the day and then when I am going to eat carbs never skip dessert I go any e carbs for real and I eat as many carbs as I feel like so like I said in the beginning I try to eat around 100 g of protein per meal and so I would actually do three of these guys and I eat them as open face sandwiches so I
(08:35) have fewer carbs overall and so I'd put about 4 oz of this protein locks on here I'd have my bread and I'd have two three maybe five grams of protein that would come from the cream cheese and so between the 20-ish that comes from this the 3 to four that comes from this and the five that comes from this I get about 30ish grams of protein per Open Face Sandwich there's my 90 if you guys are paying attention at home this is actually not enough salmon for what would be on one sandwich so the salmon gets stacked up because remember this is protein right so I'm going to show you
(09:05) this because this is aesthetically what it would look like at a fancy restaurant but in the brasic kitchen this is how much salmon would actually be on your sandwich all right so I actually tried to eat as much as I could on these open face puppies so that I could then get swo all right so there we go now I put it like this and I could take these massive man bites and have three of these guys but I didn't want to throw away pounds of salmon uh for no reason cuz those salmon give their lives for us like that boom delicious so I have three of those guys
(09:46) 90 g of protein all in calories 240 calories come from the bread probably 100 or two from the cream cheese and the rest is just protein coming from the salmon and if you have a beard once again so you don't look like you have a facial wipe your face delicious so we just crushed lunch now let's talk about snacks on the go so two of my favorite snacks that go on the go that you can eat pretty much anywhere in the continent in the United States are you got jerky and you got light key Point string cheese all right so let's
(10:17) dive in so you might not know and again this isn't for all the healthy people if you're going to be a healthy person then just go watch another video but if you just want protein this is for you all right now original jerky and I found this out lat here has a lot of protein in it all right so this is this little guy has six servings of 10 g of protein there's 60 g of protein in this there's less than 500 calories not bad right so it's 480 calories 60 g of protein and so not a bad uh snack that you're on the way on the go so if you don't have time to eat or something like that but you are a bigger guy and you need more
(10:48) calories and if you're a smaller guy and need fewer calories just cut it in half all right now the other thing is string cheese now I use scoops of weight protein or pure protein sources as a good lipus test t for is this a pure or less pure protein Source all right so like if you have a like the purest version of this is that you have a 120 calorie scoop of protein it has 24 grish of protein that's about as lean as you're going to get in any kind of normal food now if you have four of these guys it's 200 calories and 24 g of
(11:17) protein all right so not I mean really really close and the added amount that comes from this is fat so there's 2 and half Gams of fat there's almost no carbs in this um in the string cheese and so if I have four string cheeses and this guy I've got 84 g of protein and you're like man four string cheeses and all that it's like yeah it's kind of like a meal which is kind of the point and so you can have this on the Go and all in all you'd be up 680 calories with 84 g of protein and the stuff keeps great so if you just want to like have a snack on the go and you don't eat 100 grams in
(11:48) one sitting you just open it up take a bite tough not all of them are good but that one's okay I'll bet you the string cheese goes down a little e easier cuz that's super dry and you canare this with a lovely Savon water and this guy though people were like how do you eat six strink cheese you got to like bite one bite two it you eat six of them honestly six string cheeses it's just cuz they serve these to like four-year-olds so like the string cheese is just not that much cheese it's like two bites so it's really just having 12 bites of cheese it's not nearly as much
(12:27) as you think about they just package it like so they can charge you more there's not that much it's this it's not a lot of cheese all right see there you go it's like three bites I'm remembering now while I eat this jerky and the cheese actually taste delicious together it's meat and cheese it's actually really good so this is for those of you who are just rich and feel like spending more money but still don't want to have anything but protein bring on the next one so I used to eat this when I was cutting so this is my cutting diet so this is shrimp that's been peeled and
(12:58) cooked already so you can get this from the freezer section or if you're really fancy you can get from the Fresh section I prefer the freezer section because it's cheaper so for all you fancy  boom shrimp which all you have to do is defrost it this came pre all what ever all right so you just let it thaw all right the way that I did is I just do it under the sink cuz it thaws it faster and then it just comes coldish and then you take this puppy this is to cocktail sauce which by the way has 30 calories per4 cup which you're not going to have more than like A4 a cup anyways all right maybe two all
(13:31) right so this is probably I don't know a/ cup maybe and so I got 60 calories of tartar sauce so all you got to do is dip one of these puppies in this is the fancy eating instruction herle B that's it very easy you can do whatever you want and the nice thing is that most people can unless you're allergic to shrimp most people digest shrimp pretty well and so the nice thing is that usually shrimp has a lot of volume and so it's very filling at least I found it filling and so if you want to be fancy you can do that and if you want to be a
(14:00) little less fancy you can have like 8 O of chicken and 8 O of shrimp or if you want to be a little bit less fancy but still feel fancy you can have 4 oz of shrimp and 12 ounces of other doesn't really matter it's all just protein but the cool thing about shrimp specifically is that shrimp has zero carbs and zero fat the thing is pure protein and so unless you add fat to it or you add carbs to it there ain't going to be any all right and so the only thing in this meal that has anything besides protein is just the cocktail
(14:25) sauce and this thing like a little bit goes a long way and I barely even count this stff when I was eating it so now that we finished our fancy fancy shrimp shrimp dinner dinner now let's talk about beef and cauliflower all right so this one is one that is a classic also one that I ate a lot when I was dieting because I needed to really get my uh my protein up and my uh my calories down but all I do is I have the leanest ground beef that I can find so this is 937 usually you can find 964 if you find a good place that does it just get that
(14:55) um you can also do it with ground turkey um it doesn't matter uh if you were really poor uh I used to just buy chicken breasts and then put them through a food processor which I had for my dog at the time and so I just feed them in and just grinds it up for you and I just have all this ground chicken breast and that worked pretty good for me so one is you've got your beef or your meat that's going to be lean two is you've got these microwavable packets of riced cauliflower all right now this stuff is heavy like it's very filling and the nice thing with this is that if you've ever had an uncle Benz or a quick
(15:26) or minute rice or whatever it works the exact same way all right so you just crack the top put it in the microwave and heat it up now one thing I will say is that the beef you usually prep at one point during the week so you're going to have a few pounds of ground beef already hopefully somewhere in your home and then all you do is you just got to add something to it so that it makes it into a meal and that's why this is a no prep deal now up to this point you're like okay so you're just talking beef and cauliflower like why is this a meal good
(15:56) point because that on its own would be disgusting and so what I'm going to do is I'm going to show you how I make a sauce that is both delicious and not nutritious in terms of it's uh not chalk packed with macronutrients but it's actually just chocked full of deliciousness and not a lot of cows all right so let's put these puppies together and I'll show you the secret sauce and we'll enjoy it together so first things first we're going to start with the meat look at that cooked it already man we're Speedy who said this
(16:22) was Zero prep anyways so next thing is we got to take our cauliflower and we're going to Nuke this thing right so now we've got these two puppies so how we're going to make this delicious cuz right now this looks like dog food and I agree with you so we're going to enter secret ingredient number three the sauce so let's talk calories about mayonnaise all right so one first thing is that we actually accidentally bought the wrong one this should be light mayo most light mayos are about 35 calories per tablespoon this is this
(16:49) puppy now if you want to not keep measuring spoon by spoon by spoon which you can have lots of error you just put the thing on a food scale and just see how many grams it is it's a much easier way to do that but for the visual demonstration purpos of this video let's rock with it so if I've got 100 call it 30 calories that I want to eat all right in terms of fat I've got one of these guys and the reason that the the the weighing it is kind of useful is cuz you always have some kind of like leftover on the spoon and so you're kind of counting the same thing twice and so I like just weighing it but it is what it
(17:24) is all right here we go now if you also want a little hack uh use the spoon that you did the scooping with to do the mixing because that way you get to use some of the stuff that's on there that you had to get credit for in your calories all right so that's 130ish calories cuz each one was 35 * 4 whatever 140 there you go 140 calories all right fantastic next one is Hermos secret Special Sauce which is just Sriracha all right so then this guy I've actually I just don't count calories on hot sauce cuz there's not enough to really give a and so I put a little bit in depending on your desired hotness
(18:00) levels now I like a little spice to my to my stuff all right and we go a little mixy mixy oo you can even smell it woo that smells like heartburn yes it does you're going to feel that tomorrow yes you will okay fantastic now I take sweetness and add this in so this is Stevia if you want to use Splenda that works too all right now again this is like spicy and sweet are to flavor all right I like to add a couple in you'll get a feel for it add one in see if you like it and then add another if you're like oh I like this to be sweet cuz what ends up happening is when you put this whole thing
(18:33) together this becomes this really nice fatty sweet spicy mayo all right look at that it's kind of fancy right all right so check this out so we combine our forces together boom we've got our our rice and our beef and then we go mixy mixy again I'm going to give you another hack if you need to get sauce and you want to stretch it further instead of just like taking this and just dumping it in what you do take a little bit of this dip your spoon go on top and then take a bite that's it actually is really good so
(19:11) that being said that's how it works all right and I do it that way because you can you can you'd be amazed at how many more calories you can get if you just dip your fork or dip your spoon before you do it and if you're really clever about it I try to put the sauce on the bottom side of the utensil so that it's like directly on my tongue so it feels like there's way more sauce but there really isn't and so that's you can stretch 140 calories for a pound of meat so now that we just did a little spicy spicy let's do something sweet I'm going to show you the nastiest ghetto fabulous
(19:39) way to get protein you've possibly ever seen and it's so weird you're probably going to try it all right this is 100 g of protein in one serving with zero preparation of any kind this is the only food on the market that I'm aware of that you can literally take off the shelf get 100 gram of pure protein with no fat or carbs and it is egg whites now you're like well how are you g to zero prep egg whites well something you might not know is that egg whites are ultra pasteurized they're not even pasteurized
(20:04) they're Ultra pasturized which is why if you look at expiration dates on eggs they're like super far in the future because there's almost no bacteria in it all right now you might be like okay what is he going to do with the bowl great question actually we have this here so you can see it all right but this is how you do it and you're like wait Hershey syrup zero sugar yeah now you're getting where I'm going with this now if you grew up having chocolate milk as a kid which I didn't cuz my dad didn't want me to be fat but uh if you
(20:28) did good for you um I did get them at school though they had the little cards of milk you know those CR yeah I had some and that was like one of my big sources of protein ground anyways so what you do is step one take ultra pasteurized egg whites I call these tall boys all right there are 20 servings of 5 g of protein in this puppy that is 100 g of protein there are exactly 0 g of fat and exactly z g of carbs in this entire thing it is pure protein and then we take pure delicious where there's exactly zero g of protein and 0o G of fat in this and
(21:07) probably just gelatin and who knows what Frankenstein's piss anyways and so you take this all right and there's 32 servings in here and so a tablespoon if you remember what the Mayo looked like it doesn't matter because there's not that many calories in this anyways it's five calories per tablespoon all right so we're going to put some of this in here all right that's probably like 3 tablespoons 4 tablespoons all right and so what we're going to do is we're going to go mixy mixy either the way keep your
(21:32) finger on the top hear that mixy mixy you can almost hear the gains loading and you and that's it let's see this it's just like chocolate egg whites that's all it is and if you want to add more in you can but I will say after having drank many many many of these Pro tip drink 95% the last five is like kind of gritty so I would just like take 95 g of protein called a w um and the thing is is like if you had this entire thing for everyone at home who like wait how much did he put in there this whole thing is 150 calories you're not going
(22:16) to use the whole thing if you used a third of it it'd be 50 calories which I didn't even use a 20th of this all right so like it's going to be okay but you can make this thing as chocolate as you want so that would be an ex extremely chocolatey massive nonsense look at the texture here look how thick that is kind of delicious right look at that it's like real chocolatey this is uh a great way to start the day so you can knock out half of your protein in a single sitting doing this if you need 200 g of protein
(22:47) and if you just eat like a normal person the other three meals of your day you'll probably get 200 g while we're on the Chocolate Train let's keep it going all right so let's uh let's dive in so one of the things I didn't know is that Premier Protein actually make cereal there's some other cereals that claim to be protein cereals but let's be real they're not really protein cereals they just like a bunch of soy crisps put together that still have shitloads of carbs and fat but this one's actually pretty good so this is one cup of this
(23:10) guy is 180 calories and 20 g of protein which is basically the equivalent of a good it's like a little bit more than literally pure protein in a scoop and a little bit less than most protein bars so like really pure version of protein and so if we put a cup of this in but let's be real no one eats one cup of cereal all right so what we're going to do is actually have a protein breakfast of champions and have one cup wait for it two cups three cups all right so there we go you got three cups of this puppy this is 60 g of protein and then open up one of these
(23:50) guys make sure it's good oh yeah well this is from the uh this is a I think this is March of 23d three oo it's a great vintage anyways so we dump this puppy in there which I'm really doing for visual effect cuz what I would actually do is actually pour this in the bowl first and then put one scoop at a time in so I could keep the cereal crunchy but it's a little bit more dramatic this way for the visual cams all right and so we're talk about zero prep protein 90 g of protein like almost the purest amount of calorie per calorie
(24:25) protein out there um this is all way though so to be fair if you were somebody who doesn't do dairy well this would not be for you um but if you do handle Dairy well which I do um this is just this is a good time so this is 700 calories 90 g of protein and probably cheap as so if you're broke and you want some protein that takes zero time to cook and is delicious I throw this puppy on the list especially if you like chocolate you can handle milk enjoy if you're riding this br rasic Voyage with me then you will
(25:00) love this one too so this is a lunch meal or a dinner meal if you're kind of wild you can even have a breakfast cuz you're just a psychopath that being said all we do is we take this chicken of the sea can tuna which I think is my favorite flavor of tuna just cuz I like saying Chicken of the Sea make sure that you have it in water rather than oil so that there's not extra cows in it you can open this guy with one hand not really everyone uses two hands to do a can opener ask the disabled is that too soon anyways uh
(25:23) that being said this guy has 66 g of protein and only 300 calories ice cold all right so this thing has zero carbs basically zero fat and only protein so one of the nice things with most Seafoods uh especially Crustaceans this is not Crustaceans but but in general tuna is a very very lean uh protein and so that's why it's lean all right so that's 66 g of protein 300 calories that's step one in this puppy step two is we're going to take this F or Fage depending on how you want to say it all right take a 3/4 cup get this guy in here
(25:59) here by the way whoever invented these ones that have these little rims well done don't have affiliate links don't know what brand it is but if you find those then awesome on you all right we're going to put this thing here I actually already did this but this is a second take so deal with it all right that being said this is now in total 300 calories of tuna and 90 calories of yogurt so 390 calories but here's the cool part there's 86 G 84 g of protein in this bowl and less than 400 calories so let's this up with even less calories all right next one is yellow mustard guess how many calories are in this L zero and this one because it's
(26:38) zero Cals you can add add libidum which is Latin for as much as you want all right so now what we do is we go mixy mixy you'll notice mixy mix is a common step in our no prep our no prep fantasies all right mixy mixy also if you like pepper pepper ises kind of good in here and uh some people like celery but like again I don't care about prepping that much I want to do like as little as possible to make something good but if you like some texture celery and cucumbers uh salt and pepper that kind of stuff works I I usually just don't cuz I don't care enough uh pepper I do usually have at the table I don't usually prep with that
(27:15) I just kind of sprinkle it on top all right so now we've just got this delicious yellow looking mustard bowl and remember we only have 390 calories still so like this is a meal like this is like this is 84 g of protein less than 4 00 calories if you had three of these every day you'd probably be pretty full you'd also be lean as because it'd be less than 1,200 calories a day all right so we take this set spoon put it on set bread a bite set easy peasy and if you have a beard yet again check yourself before you leave the house all right you
(27:50) Psychopaths we're going from lunch to breakfast again because you can't go in order here we are all right so what we're going to do is uh we're going to take this egg whites that has all the Hershey milk stuff in it um well I forgot to buy two of these for this video so so there's only going to be one milk but we're going to pretend like this is uh clear even though this is going to look like dark chocolate eggs but you know what it might be delicious so we'll find out all right so we're going to take our egg whites which are nice and chocolatey all right and remember this whole puppy has 100 g of
(28:19) protein in it here's why this is cool is that if you don't drink the eggs you can just nuke them because you don't need a pan to cook them so a lot of people don't know this but uh you can just microwave these guys and they just fluff right up so usually they actually have the directions on the thing and if they don't they have it on the Google cool so let's go microwave these puppies over here I just Googled it and it said 90 seconds so we'll find out by the way look at this fancy cookbook that we made
(28:44) for you guys for free thank the team uh they put that together for you guys so hopefully you guys can just get more jacked CU who doesn't want a more Jack mation I mean I do all right so 90 seconds while the microwave is cooking let me show you a little special edition F I gave you guys the Fruity Pebbles and Crystal Light fruit version there's also a Cinnamon Toast Crunch version that I have I think done pretty good with all right so same original base of f but here's the difference is that in the F instead of squirting in Crystal Light
(29:14) you're going to add in vanilla extract mixy Mixie add in one or two packets of your fake sugar of choice or real sugar if you feel like adding calories I don't care either way all right and then on top of that instead of adding Fruity Pebbles you go CTC like a king on top sprinkle it and enjoy and if you want to get fancy fancy and you're serving it for your lady take some cinnamon do a little dusting on top little chef's kiss back to the microwave all right so look at this looks like a sule all right so we got our eggs all sued which is French for Blow by the
(29:52) way uh which is kind of funny all right so we got our egg whites here and uh obviously you know chocolate it's probably delicious in and of itself probably does take taste like a suai but uh if you're less fancy than me which maybe you are or maybe you're more fancy than I am I just use canned canned Salita all right and we just going to pop this puppy all right and what I do is I don't again I don't count calories on Hots because I just don't care like this whole thing is 150 calories for this whole Mamba Jamba and I'm not going
(30:21) to have anywhere close to you know anything reasonable on this so I'm just going to put some sauce on here and like that's it now imagine this is white instead of chocolate but it's actually really good it's really easy to do now here's the thing is I made like a cup maybe of eggs if this thing was this whole tall boy i' need a bowl like this like egg whites blow up in terms of size and so if you are somebody who's like on an extreme diet or somebody has like a huge appetite and you need to be full doing a tall boy of this and actually cooking the eggs is a
(31:00) mountain of food and so uh that's why I drink them rather than eat them cuz I don't even have the appetite to eat that much even even when I'm like dieting and starving I don't have the appetite to eat that um but if you are somebody who has that salsa plus egg whites plus microwave zero prep zero skill all protein all delicious all the time so now that we're done with the salsa and eggs let me tell you what I actually eat for breakfast every day the world's shortest and easiest 84 g of protein that's 230 calories of Pop 460 in total
(31:30) so 84 g of protein 460 calories all delicious honestly Fair life you guys did a gift to humanity by coming out with this this is only recent by the way until like not that long ago we just had to eat chalk dust mixed with uh and I was willing to do it hey willing to do it for the gains um but these are actually really good these just taste like chocolate milk I prefer vanilla obviously have chocolate I mean I'll drink them both um they're both very good but vanilla tastes like melted ice cream it's really good and uh this is how easy it is to prepare and make
(32:13) this I think this is a summer month this is probably bottled in July just a hint you can taste some of the floral undertones all right so last but not least and the reason I'm doing this one is because I actually up one of the other 12 dishes so I couldn't do it but this is actually what I have for breakfast mday anyways all right so that being said let's do kudagra right cud if we want to get fancy on it all right uh bro nachos so there are three ingredients in Bron nachos or Brin brot chips uh they are as follows number one Quest cool ranch
(32:51) chips side note this is the in my opinion the best flavor they have bu a long shot I mean the other ones are fine but but like these borderline taste like chips the other ones are like protein chips um these are really really good so number one got quest uh ranch chips number two horel chili delicious make sure that you get no beans cuz you want beef in there uh what's cool about this is uh there's lots of protein it lasts forever you can buy them in bulk I'll tell more about this stuff later number three is Le or Fage depending on how you
(33:22) feel like pronouncing it uh also more protein you've noticed it's a common theme and number four salsa all right so let's rock and roll let's go over the macros real quick so number one this is 140 G sorry this is 140 calories 19 gram of protein I mean this is leaner than most protein bars in terms of calorie content and I think they're delicious like this is this gets close to just what a chicken breast is so like really really pure source of protein and also delicious um this Hormel chili is uh is is 520 calories
(33:55) per can 30 30 30 g of protein so a little bit fattier but again we're making a meal here and I'm trying to make this bastic all right so there's that so that's 520 calories this guy we've already covered from earlier and then salsa usually has no calories and this is 5 calories per serving 50 calories for the whole thing so let's assume that I want to have a bastic voyage and we're going to go on it together so number one is uh we're going to try and eat a lot here all right so let's make 100 g of protein per the usug
(34:27) all right so we're going to go two two bags of chips because why not all right so that gets us 40 right off the bat now obviously guys you can cut it in half and if you're a little a little itty bitty little itty bitty girl itty bitty guy you can uh you can just have half all right that's fine all right so we got 40 g of protein so far all right now we're going to take our horel chili so what we're going to do here is we're going to this guy here there we go all right and then we're going to put a little chili on there little spoony spoon oh yeah oh
(35:05) yeah oh yeah there we go all right so now we got 70 GS of protein and we need 30 more and obviously if you want to like have more protein you could just have a leaner meat this is just fun and easy because I said earlier I wanted to have no Preps stuff so that's no prep all right and so we need 30 G more which is going to be 1 and 1/2 cups this is 2 cups this whole thing so it's basically going to be most of this all right there's one all right left about all right a quarter in there all right now you could probably just do
(35:46) this and be pretty happy about it but I like throw a little salsa on there and just like that take your Chips you take your take your sour cream take one of these guys go on top get really get in there there we go there we go yeah honestly a fox is great it's really delicious it's actually good and um this is food and so this is how we'll make it for camera real life I would take a bowl I'd start with the chili I put the sour cream on top and have the salsa I would take the chips and I would dip it in that way the chips stay crunchy doesn't
(36:37) look nearly as cool but that's what I would actually do all right and so that is the bastic voyage of nachos and protein it is 12 ways that you can have zero prep zero intelligence 100% protein as little fat little carbs as seemly possible while having maximum deliciousness in little time and if you make a mosy meal tag me on Instagram or Twitter I'm going to be rearing the best ones and if you guys find something that's even more delicious than the 12 that I had that is zero prep that's 100 grams of protein that takes almost no
(37:08) time tag me in that cuz I might try it myself but I'll definitely be sharing it so thank you guys keeping awesome hope you guys have an amazing 2024 get as shredded as you want and uh that one of these meals actually gets into your rotation and becomes a main day and for x-rated food content like this check out my only fans m
If I Wanted To Become a Millionaire in 2025, This Is What I'd Do [FULL BLUEPRINT] - YouTube

Transcript:
(00:02) this is the blueprint to making your first million dollar and I'm going to walk you through it step by step even if you're starting with your first dollar so there's three levels in the blueprint and level one is fundamentals and it starts with who you are and the reason we start with who you are is because you are the foundation of everything that you want to have and so there's a thing of me and the building blocks of who you are are first the knowledge that you have the things you know about second the skills you know how to do third the
(00:33) motivation to actually do them and fourth the environment to make it easy so the first pillar of this is knowledge in order to become a millionaire the first thing we have to do is know what a millionaire even is to begin with a millionaire means that you have over $1 million in investable assets liquid minus your house so your primary residence is actually excluded from this now I'll give you a fun fact that you probably don't know one out of nine Americans is a millionaire and the thing that separates the people who are the millionaires from everybody else is what they know exists and if you're like who
(01:11) are you to even say this uh my name is Alex rosi I own acis.com our portfolio of companies deser over $250 million a year and since 2016 every single business I've ever started has gone to over $10 million a year and we have three companies that are worth over $100 million plus so the reason that rich kids for example have an advantage over poor kids kids is because rich kids have parents who tell them about opportunities that exist that get better Returns on their time if you don't know private Equity exists you sure as hell
(01:41) aren't going to get into it if you don't know that you can become an investment banker and sell companies worth hundreds of million dollars and get percentages of companies that you didn't even found and take on no risk then you're not going to pursue it and so I make these videos so that you can know things that you might not naturally have around you or anyone in your surrounding area who knows that these things exist and to give you some context I was 22 when I started this journey and ultimately quit
(02:05) my job before I ended up starting my first business when I did go to quit my job I emailed a bunch of different gym owners cuz I figured I wanted to get into fitness cuz it was something I was into and only one of them got back to me and that gym owner was a business owner and he was making money and so I moved out to California I changed my environment so that I could be around this guy and this guy helped me learn the ropes and taught me about my first business which opening a gym and it was only after learning and paying for
(02:34) Consulting for a gym business that I didn't have that I felt comfortable enough to begin on my own so the second component of knowing who you are are the skills you have these are the things that you do and so what can be really deceiving about this is people say hey I want to be confident I want to be charismatic I want to be good on camera but they make it seem as though it's a trait so a trait isn't a real thing what it really is is a Bund bundle of skills so let's say if you wanted to learn the skill of sales and so underneath of sales we may have being able to actively
(03:09) listen being able to repeat back what someone says nodding and keeping eye contact being able to shake a hand firmly walking into a room and be able to project your voice being able to have reason to arguments with someone if they have some fallacy that they believe that you can help them overcome all of these are subskills that if someone exhibits all of them someone say he's a good salesman now if you have this first level skill you can usually become a millionaire literally with just that but then fundamentally if you want to level up you can learn
(03:43) marketing and marketing is basically sales done one to many and so all the things that you learn how to do one-on-one you start projecting to large amounts of people and so this is just sales at scale and so underneath of marketing you would also have to understand media so like where your communication is happening you'd want to understand headlines uh because that's going to be the first line of communication you'd probably have to learn something about web pages and you'd have to learn conversion right these are all subskills underneath of marketing that would make you a good
(04:14) marketer now if you know sales and marketing then you know acquisition because that means that you can completely acquire customers and so each of these skills stacks on top of one another and makes all of the skills retroactively more valuable so the more you learn the better you get the better you get the more you get and so the path to becoming the person who can make the first million is predicated on the knowledge you have about the world so that you pursue the right path to get the skills within and so sure it's just as hard to
(04:49) learn how to pack boxes in a warehouse probably as it is to learn how to do sales they take about the same amount of time to learn this one just has significantly higher returns and so this is where the knowledge shows you where to orient your effort so you get the highest returns back on the skills you learn so now let's talk about motivation my tiny little box of motivation and so motivation fundamentally comes from deprivation it's from what you don't have that creates the action or urgency around acting in general and so for
(05:20) example if I'm sleepy I'm motivated to sleep if I'm hungry I'm motivated to eat and so right now if you're motivated to become a millionaire it's because you lack a million dollars one of the easiest ways to become more motivated in money rather than physiological stuff like hunger sleep whatever is to surround yourself with people who make significantly more money now immediately you're like wait a second I don't know anybody who's a millionaire of course you don't but you may be able to create a reference group that you compare
(05:49) yourself to who are millionaires and so for me for example when I had my job in Baltimore which is what I left to become an entrepreneur and start my first business most people were just like this is a terrible idea why would you throw away your college Years why would you throw away this good job that you have that's steady and stable and looks good on paper and sounds good at cocktail parties and it was because I hated it and at some point I realized that basically everyone except for one guy that I kind of knew who we talk about our entrepreneurial dreams together all of them thought this was a bad idea and
(06:19) so at some point this is where High agency or high self-belief has to become more important your belief about yourself has to be more important than what other people say about you and so this is a perfect segue to my second tiny little box environment and so think about your environment as friction or a lubricant on your goals and so if you want to change someone's Behavior you change their environment so let me give you a really simple example of this I can guarantee you that I can get every single person in a building to take their clothes off how could I do that I could do that by locking the doors
(06:49) that's one change to the environment second putting them all together in one room second change to the environment third cranking the heat until it's 200° eventually everyone would strip down because it would be so hot in there and so you are that little rat in the experiment and you want to create the Box around you that lubricates the activities that you want to do and so fundamentally what you want to think about is how do I make it as easy as possible to work as hard as I can and then how do I eliminate everything else
(07:17) that distracts me from my goals more specifically how do I eliminate everything that distracts me from doing the stuff that gets me the skills that takes me towards my goals and so that means that it could be people it could be software it could be alcohol if you just simply put this as your filter thinking does this increase or decrease the likely that to hit my goals cut out everything that decreases the likel that hit your goals cuz sometimes that's easier to see and then all that you'll be left with is nothing and time and the
(07:47) ability to learn and act I've talked about something that I call the season of know which I've entered multiple times in my career as an entrepreneur which is basically where you're not successful enough to be in the group of friends that you want to be in but you want to have a completely different lifestyle than the people you're currently with and so you basically just have to say no to everything and that means that you're saying no to the social Gatherings because you know none of those people there have the goals
(08:10) that you want and none of them understand what you want to do it's saying no to the distractions and no to the entertainment that you do normally because you know that that's not going to increase the likelihood that you hit your goal so for me I gave up fantasy football I gave up drinking with the boys I gave up going out I gave up really just like friend gatherings in general and so the only thing that I did was I worked and then I went home at 5:00 and then I worked from 5:00 to 9:00 and so I'd work 5:00 to 9:00 in the morning go to work work 500 to 9 again at night and so I had 8 hours of time
(08:41) that I could work on me and what I wanted to do next and 5 to 9 that I or 9 to 5 that I worked in the middle of the day that was basically how I paid my bills and if you're like wait there was no time yes there was no time I didn't have a girlfriend I wasn't going out to the movies right like it was just 100% focused on removing everything that wasn't getting me Clos to where I wanted to go go and if you're like wow this makes me a weirdo yes yes it makes you odd and if you expect to be normal and Achieve odd and outlier results good
(09:12) luck so we've just covered who you are and you made a little bit of money the next step is figuring out who to sell to and I want to make this really real for you and so a lot of people think that you got to to make a million dollars you got to sell 10,000 people something for bucks right and that would be $1 million right that's that's what that equals but it's way easier to just sell a 100 people something that cost $10,000 which also equals 1 million bucks and so believe me finding a 100 people way easier than finding 10,000 and so the real problem that you're
(09:51) solving is what do I have that's worth $10,000 well the thing is is they also don't have to pay you now this can be split over 4 years right which would then be 2500 bucks a year which is now $200 per month and for you to acquire the 100 customers you're talking about two people per week which is not that hard and if you're reaching out to 100 people per day then you getting two out of 700 people to be willing to spend $200 a month with you all of a sudden this million dollar goal becomes a lot more
(10:27) real if you're trying to figure out who to focus on on for these two people a week that you're selling to that's what I'm going to cover right now you have three basic circles that I've identified from all the entrepreneurs that I've talked to number one is that you help someone who is like you overcome something that you overcame in the past and so that's typically some sort of painful thing or some sort of problem you figured out a solution to and then you operationalize that for other people the second is something that you're just
(10:52) very passionate about so it's like you're really into this thing and then you help other people get into that thing too the third is some sort of professional skill and that's like oh I used to do accounting or bookkeeping for this business or I used to do building management or I used to do Property Management like whatever it is you have some sort of skill that you learn in the professional Marketplace that you help other people do and so all of those things those three PS pain passion profession are the three fundamentals
(11:19) that I look at in terms of trying to pick the who so pain passion profession underneath of this if you're like okay where do I want to start the reason that I like helping fewer people rather than more people in the beginning is because you don't have money and you don't have resources and so if you're going to start a business you might as well start with fewer people that pay you more because it's easier to run that business and so I like to use the uh the old Tesla analogy here which is when Tesla started he
(11:49) wasn't trying to bring in the model 3 into Mass Market he started with the Roadster which was the most expensive version of the car because he knew that the fewest amount of people would be able to afford it the other thing that this does is it actually positions you at the top of the marketplace then he moved down market and created the model S which was now a $120,000 car then he went and got the model X and then he had the model 3 and then he has the uh the cybertruck which I think is why anyways
(12:20) the point here is that he basically worked his way down and went broader and broader and broader Market as he continued to get resources and be able to redeploy them into broader and broader parts of the marketplace and so for you you're going to probably pick what pain passion or profession you're going to go to you're going to start with the smallest version of that market that you can the most specific the closest to who you can help the most and so I will give you this third little piece here which is if you're for some reason split between two of these like
(12:51) oh I like this and I also overcame this thing help the person that you can provide the most value to now if you're like okay I can help this poor person go up by $10 and I can help this rich person go up by $100,000 then in a real way that $100,000 is a representation of how much value you can provide that person meaning go do that one first now once you've identified okay I'm going to start with a niche I'm going to pick one of these three PS then you run them through these filters that I have is that number one you want them to have
(13:24) the problem to solve now all of these things fundamentally are problems right they there's not enough information about about this passion there's not enough information of this pain or there's not enough information about this profession they want to learn but fundamentally all of those are the problem so you have to have a problem that you're trying to solve and the people you're trying to sell to need to have that problem number two is they have to have the money to spend if they don't have the money to spend but they got the problem then you don't have a
(13:45) business around it you got a nonprofit which is not the point of this video this is about making money underneath of this problem to solve you want them to have the urgency to solve it now so this can't be something that they're like that would be nice it has to be something that they want to solve right now because this will overcome all of the people who are like ah I going to think about it they keep pushing it off if you have cancer and somebody has a cancer treatment you want it now now on the money side you also want them to have the authority to spend it so you want them to be the one ideally who's
(14:17) the principal who's the one who makes the decision about the implementation that you're going to help them with and I want to be really clear I use these as thought exercises to help you get started and pick the who that you're going to serve but the end of day if I had to boil all of this down it just comes down to this one truth which is that you want to serve the person that you can provide the most value too I'll tell you that a16z y combinator Etc they have one rule that they learned in years which I will share with you is that they now only invest in Founders who already
(14:47) have experience with the problem and I again I Define problem very broadly here that you have overcome this sort of difficulty and you've lived with the problem for five plus years if you've lived with it then you intimately understand understand it because that means that you'll also intimately understand the prospect that you want to sell to and so it kind of is like this hack for already knowing what their thoughts and dreams are what the pains that they're experiencing how they talk the words they use so it's kind of this big time warp of saying oh I already spent the last years of my life living
(15:15) being me if I can sell to people who are just like me then I don't need to do 5 years of studying and figuring this out and so for me I had struggled getting into shape that was my problem I was not jacked enough uh and so then I spent all my time learning about it so that I could become Mor jacked so much though that I annoyed everyone at at work enough that they were like please quit this and start something Fitness related and so for me that was the perfect first pick now I was between SAT prep and why
(15:41) was that because I had been pretty good at test prep I tested pretty well and I'd gone through a process of improving my own scores and I was like I could probably help other people improve their scores too the other thing that I was considering was frozen yogurt because I actually really liked froo at the time this is before frozen yogurt boomed and so I actually was you know to Young Alex was actually not a terrible time to get into frozen yogurt and so fundamentally it's like I had two things I was
(16:05) passionate about or pain these are really just equal sides of the same thing right it was a pain and then I became passionate about it when I solved it sat froo JY and so actually all three of these were in this pain/ passion bucket and I chose to start the gym because uh frozen yogurt cost 150 Grand open which I didn't have then it was really just between SAT prep and fitness and I actually started on the SAT prep path first first and then I was going to partner with someone and then I'll just say it it ended poorly and because of
(16:35) that kind of negative experience and I wasn't emotionally mature enough I said fine I'm not doing that uh I'm just going to do Fitness so it was kind of like a process of elimination I couldn't do yoga CU I didn't have the money I felt like I got uh burned on my SAT prep thing and so then I just ended up with well I guess I'll just do Fitness and so the only disclaimer that I have about all of this stuff that I just covered so this is my warning right this is my warning call for you is that you want to
(16:58) make sure you're going to be in a market that's at least flat or growing you don't want to get into a market that's shrinking and so if I wanted to get into retirement homes for old folks that's a growing Market that's a good thing and so if you had just recently placed your grandmother and it was a pain process for you and then you figured out how to do it in a way that was really smart and efficient then you could provide that solution to other people who are in the exact same position as you and it
(17:23) probably urgent and they have the money and authority to do it you just don't want to get into selling print newspapers today so we've covered who you are who to sell to and you've made a little bit more money and now we talk about what to sell so there's four elements that I like to have in every product that I sell number one is that it's Unique and the reason for that is because I don't want anyone else to be able to sell it the second is that it's expensive because expensive stuff makes you more money per unit third is that I want it to be sticky I want it to be
(17:58) things that people don't just just buy once but keep buying again and again and the fourth is I want it to be air so unique expensive sticky air meaning it's something that doesn't cost me a lot to deliver and so this is basically the relationship of your gross profit it means it costs you a penny you can sell it for a buck and people keep buying it again and again and no one else can sell it but me so let me show you a product that everyone's heard of that actually matches all four of these Coca-Cola it's Unique in that no one else knows the recipe for Coca-Cola it's expensive Rel
(18:29) relative to how much it costs it might cost a few pennies to put this together really probably the can is the most expensive part of the product itself and it's sticky in that I mean literally if you spill this on the floor it is sticky but on top of that is that when people start drinking Coke they don't stop drinking Coke products for usually their entire lives imagine introducing someone to a product and then knowing that they would literally always buy a product they'd always go to restaurants and Order what you had when they go home they crack up in your thing when they eat food they drink your products that's
(18:57) a great business so these are all exceptional things for making your first million dollars now if you want to make a gazillion dollars then you want to add something else to this which is scale so if I just need to have 25 clients like I talked about earlier then I very much I could just do myself give people time give people service give people some skill set and transfer to them that's unique because no one else can do it because it's just me I can charge a lot because it's just my time which is the cost and if I'm good people pay again and again and again and so these like a
(19:30) normal service business with one really good person meets all four of these things the issue then becomes scale and so what a walk you through is different ways to make any product more scalable I think that people have a massive misunderstanding about what it even means so the first part is that it's not is something scalable or not it's how scalable is it so this is really easy to scale and then this is really hard to scale and so oneon-one with you is harder to scale than let's say me adding use your own School the software platform and so everything about scalability has to do with something
(20:06) called the incremental cost of adding a customer but all that really means is how much cost do we have to incur as a business to bring on one additional customer the most scalable businesses bring on an additional customer cost almost nothing imagine your cell phone carrier if another person signs on to their network of cell phone usage it doesn't really cost them much at all to add the additional user if another person comes on to Facebook it's not that much if another person comes onto school it's not that much to add the person and so all of these
(20:35) things are easier to scale now I will tell you one of the things that's very interesting about very scalable businesses is that typically they are more demand constrained meaning it's harder to get people to buy that stuff whereas there are some businesses that are very hard to scale think like a very high service business so like accounting for example is harder to scale because it's hard to find really good accountants and be able to maintain that quality of service at a high level scaling a law firm really hard because it's all about expertise which means you
(21:09) have to get lots of people in it takes a really long time to get them good enough and you always have the risk of them leaving and so often times very unscalable businesses have partnership structures so that people come in so that they feel like partial owners in that business but if you're the ultimate original owner it can be harder for you to scale again there are massive law firms it doesn't mean that it's impossible it just means that it's harder congrats you're onethird of the way there and now we move on to level two and this is level two and we start
(21:39) with get them to buy and there's two steps to this Step One is they have to find out about whatever it is that you sell and in fact I wrote an entire book about this thing in $100 million leads which is getting strangers to to want to buy your stuff all right this is advertising the second thing that you do is you get them to buy so let's start with number one find out so there are eight things that you can do to let people know about your stuff the first four only you can do the second four are things that other people
(22:12) do on your behalf these I call the core four these I call the four lead Getters so these are the only four things that one person can do to let other people know about their stuff so you've got warm Outreach which is letting people who know you know about your stuff cold is letting people who don't know you know about your stuff then you've got content which is letting people who know you one to many know about your stuff and then you've got paid ads which is letting people who don't know you one to many know about your stuff these are the only four things that you can do to let someone
(22:51) else know to force them to find out about whatever it is you have to sell because they cannot buy it unless they know you exist now if you want to get more leverage because this is about becoming a millionaire then you can use these four things to get lead Getters now the first type of lead getter is a customer this is the people who you actually get to buy now they can get they can do the core for themselves they can let people they know one-on-one they can let strangers know oneon-one they can be in ads for you or they can make
(23:21) content that's when they make a review or they make a post talking about how great your stuff is that lets more people know about it the next is you've got employees employees do the same core four as you do on your behalf so they do warm Outreach they do cold out bound they make ads for you they make content on your behalf the next version of this is Affiliates so Affiliates are businesses that already have your customers in their business and so let's say I have a gym if I want to get more people in my gym I can make a deal with a
(23:55) chiropractor and I can say hey I will send you patience when they dings VES uh at my gym and then when you have somebody who wants to lose weight because that's why they're back hurts you can send them to my gym so that creates a reciprocal relationship between you and another business and every customer they acquire they can send to you and vice versa and the last is agencies so these are other businesses that specialize typically in one of these so you've got content agencies you've got paid ads agencies you've got outbound agencies in all of those you'd still have to start with the
(24:22) core 4 to contact the agency and then they would use the core 4 to actually advertise so these are the only things any person can do to let other people know and these are the types of people that become the targets of the core 4 that can then do it on your behalf now if you're trying to get 25 customers right like I talked about like you only need 25 people to pay $10,000 a year for four years to become a millionaire okay so the thing that you have and that's assuming no taxes I'm just going to assume this is international video uh
(24:46) the first thing and the easiest is here is warm out bound you just let people know who already know you that you have this thing for sale and that you're willing to help them one of the easiest offers is hey I'll help you for free so that means I'll put 3 hours or 5 hours of my time to helping you achieve some sort of outcome and at the end if you don't mind I'd love to make you an offer about what it would look to work with me for paid for money in the future very simple offer and the thing is is when
(25:10) you offer 2 three four 5 hours plus of your time for free a lot of people are willing to do that and so fundamentally just think about it like five sales calls that you do in a row except it's really smooth and you're just providing value and that way it kind of gets the Jitters out for people who've never sold before and when we actually talk about how to close I'll cover that in much more detail but but this is the easiest way for people to start now you can pair this with content because then you let people know publicly hey I'm doing this
(25:35) thing one to hit me up in fact I'll put my hopefully first post somewhere over here this is the first post I ever made to promote my business and it was something called the free training project and I had already worked with people doing War outbound for a year at that point I think I had 13ish customer something like that and then I published their results and I said hey if you guys want to work with me I got a few spots open and that's what became my first content post to let people know so they
(26:00) could find out about my stuff now over time I learned how to run PID ads and do cold outbound which is like calls emails DMS to strangers to say hey can I give you this amazing offer and ads work the same way except we call them up bring them in and close them and if you're starting out this can seem like a lot of stuff to do you're like oh I'm going to do all eight until you get to a million dollars you can just do one of these and if you're going to do two do content and warm outbound this is the easiest way to
(26:25) start it's also the cheapest here you have to have a really good skill set this is also pretty cheap it's just harder to do but if you're going to do cold outbound you might as well start with warm start with people who aren't strangers and then level up to people who are strangers but these ones are the least expensive way of getting customers this is the most expensive but it's scales quickly so once people have found out about our stuff great so now they know but now we got to get them to give us money so now we got to get them to buy when I started my gym I hated the idea of sales I even some someone say
(26:56) hey you're a Salesman and I was like I was disgusted by the idea I was like I'm an academic and so then I had to pay rent and clearly was like how do I get these strangers to give me money and immediately learned sales now over the last 10 plus years I've done 4,000 plus consults and it wasn't until I had to transfer that skill of sales to other people that had to create a framework that was repeatable for other people to also close I remember the first time I went home for Christmas uh I had an employee closed their first sale without me and I got teary because I realized it was the first time that my business
(27:27) could make money without me and so this is the framework I have which is closer and so this is an acronym and it's very simple and it's easy to remember and the reason that one's smaller is not because R is less important it's because Amazon Jeffy B decided to only send us five of the right ones instead of the six so the first of the closer framework is clarify why the person is there and so fundamentally the big advantage that we have as a business is that these customers have reached out to us and so
(27:53) we need to clarify why they're even why they even took the time to reach out why did you respond to our ad why did you respond to my email why' you comment on my post whatever it is if you have't engaged leads which means that they've responded in some way then they've taken the first step and basically every form of advertising this exists and most people aren't cold calling and then immediately closing and so even in that situation you would call them said an appointment and then on the appointment
(28:16) you would then say hey what made you take this appointment what made this worth it for you and then what we're doing here is we're clarifying the problem that leads us to the next letter which is L which is label them with the problem now that may sound similar but it's actually very different so what we're doing is when we label we say huh so it sounds like you are here you want to get here and this is the thing that's getting in the way does that sound about right and so what we've done is we've said this is your current this is your desired and we've established a gap and
(28:48) sometimes an obstacle that's a monster okay and what we want to do is we want to position ourselves as the sword that can kill the monster and ultimately get them to their desire to state but we can't sell unless we have a gap and that is why CNL are so important before you get into anything else so for example you're 200 lb you want to be 150 50 lbs is the gap the reason that you're struggling is because you don't know how to work out you don't know how to eat let me see if I can do a spoon here or a fork there you go you don't know how to eat and you have no one who's holding you accountable to
(29:19) making sure that you do these first two in a B2B setting it's like you're doing 10K a month and you want to make 100K a month and the issue is that you don't have ads that are working or you don't have enough leads that are coming in that brings us to the next thing once we've clarified we're there we've clearly labeled them with a problem you're here you want to be here this is the problem then you overview past pain all right I call this the pain cycle so you overview past experiences the reason this is so important is that pain is what motivates action and so if you think about motivation in general it's
(29:49) always from deprivation like I said earlier so you being overweight and reminding them of how overweight they are and the cost of being overweight this whole time it basically f further brings them this way it expands the gap between where they are and where they want to go and the further that Gap is the bigger the rubber band is and so remember this is our amount of deprivation which is the amount of motivation to get someone to buy and so when we do the pain cycle we simply say what have you done before how' that work out for you and then the pieces that they liked you compare you associate
(30:20) with your solution and the pieces they don't like you associate with why it didn't work and why your solution is different this time once you get to the end of okay okay what' you do how'd that work for you oh it's different in this way oh it's similar in this ways what else have you tried you keep going through that pain cycle to continue to poke on that pain button to keep expanding the gap between where they are and where they want to go and the frustration in the present for not having achieved it and so once we've
(30:43) overviewed the pain now we sell the vacation S A lot of people salesmen this is when salesman blab this is when salesman lose the sale and the reason they lose the sale is because they just do this massive monologue and that doesn't work instead what you want to do is come up with what I call a three-pillar pitch and each of the pillars is usually one or two statements and Then followed by an analogy or metaphor and so you say hey if you want to create SEO to get more leads then it's kind of like and then we basically
(31:13) make our transition it's kind of like when you get a paycheck and when you have an investment account your paycheck you work and you get paid every single month but you put a little bit of that money towards your investment over time that investment compounds until eventually it makes you more than what you make in your active and so SEO kind of works the same way now realistically there's really no similarity to getting traffic to a website as there is between paychecks and investment accounts but it
(31:35) Compares something that people understand with something that they don't understand so they can learn and so fundamentally you should come up with three analogies that explain each of the pillars of what differentiates Your solution if I was selling leads which I came up with a script for mortgage brokers it was the leads had to be exclusive they had to be timely and they had to be qualified and so you just say okay have you ever got on the phone with somebody who doesn't have money and they're just window browsing yeah it's in the ass totally right and so it's
(32:00) like cool you just give an example you give an analogy that explains it if it's something easy to understand examples if it's something hard to understand metaphor and the reason I call it sell the vacation is that you'll notice that I'm not actually explaining much about the product at all and the main reason is because they care about themselves they don't care about our product they care about their problems not about our product and the only reason they care about our product is if there's a way that they know with high conviction it's going to get them to their goal and so we want to talk about Maui we want to
(32:24) talk about Hawaii we want to talk about where they're going what it's going to be like when they're at 150 what it's going to be like when they're making $100,000 a month not all the steps it's going to take to get there we're not talking about TSA we're not talking about taking your shoes off and sitting next to somebody who stinks and and getting on the plane and having bad plane food cuz guess what all of that stuff is I just gave you an analogy and so once we've done s we then go to E which is explain away their concerns so
(32:49) at this point after you've overviewed the pain you say hey I think I might have something for you would you like to hear about it they say yes and then you go sell the vacation once you've sold the vacation you ask you say you're ready to get started does that sound good to you any kind of closing question you want fair enough great now if they then say anything but yes I want to buy you then go to E explain away they're concerns and so the way that you explain away they're concerns is that typically there's three big categories so people blame their circumstances for why they
(33:14) can't do something they blame other people for why they can't do something or they avoid the decision altogether which is basically blaming themselves they give their power elsewhere and So within that you basically have six categories of questions that fall underneath so one is they say they don't have the time I'm too busy right now now's not a good time the second is they say I don't have the money to do this right now this is too expensive this is outside of my budget number three is they say somebody else has the decision-making Authority all right the fourth is they say I'm not sure this is
(33:45) right for me this is a fit question all right which is really just means that they have a preference that isn't aligned or that they believe is in aligned with the product that you sell oh I have to follow meal plan I don't want to count Cal five is they blame other people's past experiences with them and so this is one that we overcome with something I call ber you twice but it's other people's products then finally they avoid this is a stall this is sounds similar to this but it's actually very different this is I don't have time this is give me time that covers the explaining away the concerns there's a
(34:23) hundred other closes I give you but those are the theories behind each of them finally we have to reinforce the decision so now we have somebody who's made the decision they've choosen to given us money which is amazing we love them for that but the thing is is that sometimes people change their minds when they go away especially if you're good at sales and so when you have the r what we're doing is we're reinforcing that they made a good call now this actually Begins the handoff to onboarding all right so when you onboard a new customer this is what happens in the first 24 48 Hours post purchase and what you want to
(34:54) do is make as many promises as you can in that time period and keep them so that they feel and we're talking like hey this is what's going to happen next in the next 30 minutes this is going to happen right you're going to get an email and then you can click that link and then this is going to happen next and you want as many of those things that you tell them to have happen to happen and from this we do something called bamfam which is book a meeting from a meeting and when you do bamfam it means that no one ever gets uh left in the cracks no one falls through and so the reason that a lot of customers
(35:23) cancel is because you said someone's going to reach out to them and they thought it was going to take 30 minutes you didn't set the expectations it takes two days and they're like you know what this isn't for me I actually I've changed my mind right instead you want to always have them it's like a Baton Pass it's like sales passes to onboarding onboarding one passes to onboarding two onboarding two passes the senior engineer or the media buyer or whatever it is that you do to deliver results for people and at that point you've kept them through the process and you've reinforced you know what these
(35:51) guys are on top of it they're legit and if you want to make this extra magic what you do is you you pass on the notes so you never want a customer to repeat themselves and so the way you do that is that you take notes on every call and so if you get on a sales call for example and the setter had notes then you can start the call being like hey I know you talked to Andrew and you said this this and this and these are the problems you're struggling with they're like wow these guys are on it and when that goes to onboarding and they have their onboarding conversation
(36:16) with Sarah and then Sarah says oh I know you talked to Andrew and you talked to Jeff and you said these things they're like wow this business is legit very small change massive Improvement in terms of how satisfied customers will be and because this is all about making more money the likelihood that they actually Ascend and buy more in the future yeah and if you're a beginner you're the one taking all of these calls so at the very least take your own notes and remember what you're talking about with these people and if you have multiple customers review the notes
(36:41) before you get back on the call with them close more deals make more money save the world we got them to buy we got our first customers we've made a little bit of money now we get them to buy even more so now we got to get them to buy more times and specifically this is all the different ways that you can make a customer worth more money to your business and so the idea is that the customers or the businesses that make customers worth the most are the ones that make the most money unsurprising but there are eight specific ways that you can do this with literally any business so the first way
(37:10) is that you can increase the price so for this example let's say I'm selling gum all right so I'm selling gum and what I can do is instead of charging $5 for this I can charge $6 it costs me the same amount but I've now made more money the second way that I can do this is I can decrease my costs all right so if this thing was originally $5 and it cost me a dollar to make I can buy more inventory I can do advances so that I can get this down to0 50 Cent so I still make 50 cents more per box that's the second way that we make uh any product more profitable for us the third way we
(37:42) can do this is we can get them to buy more times so right now I say hey you want to buy my gum great but wouldn't it be cool if you got on a gum subscription so you get one of these every single month the fourth way is to get them to buy something else that's new or different all right so right now I'm selling you this gum but wouldn't it be cool if you got these Nicorette patches as well so wouldn't these patches go great with your gum it doesn't matter what you sell you could have burger with fries you could have an iPhone case with your iPhone there's always something else that pairs or is complimentary to
(38:15) whatever your core offer is and sometimes you make more profit on this thing than you do on the main thing the fourth thing that you can do is get people to buy more quantity all right so this is when the number goes up so currently you're buying one box what if you bought three boxes of gum and so the difference between this and this is this is how many times they're buying over a period of time this is how we're increasing the quantity all at once so this is think about this as bulk purchases buying more volume the second way that we can do this is increase quality so now we say okay how do we
(38:47) sell you a better version of this so these ones are 2 milligrams of nicotine these ones are 4 mg so if I have a box of the same size but i s you a 4 migr version then it might be a higher quality or maybe the nicotine in this one comes from a magic plant in the Amazon either way we sawell a higher quality version if I were selling burgers instead of selling mystery meat you could sell sirloin burgers right if you're selling iPhone cases it would go from plastic to Kevlar it would go from uh plastic to metal or wood we have a higher quality version of whatever it is that we sell and if you're selling
(39:19) services there's a zillion ways you can make more valuable but it's like you have higher uh quality Representatives who are going to be answering your thing you have priority support you get answered first uh you have extended hours so you get more times all of those things are different versions of higher quality the next is that you can do the equal opposite you decrease the quantity you decrease the number that someone buys so instead of buying 160 pieces you just buy 20 so you can have a down sell now the reason that this can make you more money is that it actually makes you more money per person you talk to not per customer and so with
(39:51) this is you make money here when you take a no and turn into a yes so it's taking a no a small no turning into a small yes and then later you have all these other things to turn into a big yes and then finally we go from something that's higher quality to something that's lower quality so is there a version of your product that could be the the the discount version the economy class version and with Services it's literally the equal opposite you have Junior reps who answer it you have extended times you don't get calls you only get chat support it's all
(40:19) just thinking what are different ways all the components and features that I have with my service most times if you have a service you just have you haven't even defined all the stand standards you have you just need to think through every single thing what about speed what about quality about who they're talking to what about the medium they're on is it one to many is it one-on-one is it recorded is it live like all of these things are factors that make something more or less valuable and so with physical products the same idea except it's usually going to be the ingredients
(40:43) and how new it is this is an older model those are all things that decrease the quality and so when you're looking at this these are the eight ways that you can get any customer to be worth more and so if you're a beginner you want to know the easiest one of these to make more money charge more for the exact same thing and often times when you're a beginner you want to start low so it's okay but what I would recommend doing is what I call the five to five to five model so basically every five you sell you bump it by 20% all right very easy
(41:15) so if we're at $5 for our gum here the first five people if everyone buys no problem we bump it to $6 so $5 goes up 20% it goes to $6 and if the next five buy no problem then we go up to 720 and we keep going up by 20% and you can keep doing this Forever Until people stop buying and so then you just look at how much gross profit do I have times the conversion rate and that gives you your perfect price and so I'm telling you you might be worried about what if what if I sell fewer people you just have to do the math and you never discount in order
(41:46) to make a sale you can choose to test your price but you have to stick with it for the number that you said you would the second easiest one of these to do besides obviously raising the prices over time is just getting people to buy more stuff this one requires nothing new from you this one also requires nothing new you're just asking them to buy again next month this one gets them to buy more today and so these ones are among the easiest that you can do as a beginner this one decreasing cost super
(42:11) valuable for you usually takes more time for you to negotiate with vendors get economies of scale things like that but still valuable all these other things are things that you add to the business which creates more products not say anything wrong with that but it's typically a more advanced move so these three right here are the ones that you want to focus on if you're a beginner and this is a concept that you should understand how to master this is the language of business and so it doesn't matter what we're talking about you should be able to apply all eight of these to anything so if I'm selling
(42:39) whiteboards I say okay I can raise the price of this whiteboard next is I can get people to buy more whiteboards over an extended period of time wasn't that one great wouldn't it be great if you had more of those for your team or I could get them to buy five whiteboards today one for every room in their office right uh or I could say hey this is a you know flimsy metal uh whiteboard let me get you a wood one it'll look better on camera or I can make it higher quality by saying hey I won't put my logo on yours so that it's not in all
(43:04) your camera shoots the next is I can decrease how much it costs me to actually manufacture each of these whiteboards this also increases my profit the next thing is I say okay you got these whiteboards but what about your paper right that you know what would go great with your whiteboard rolls of paper the next is okay uh can I decrease the quantity okay so instead of buying five you buy one right and then in terms of quality we go the other direction so instead of buying this wood one you buy this metallic one and if you're starting with metallic then maybe you should go from this metal one to really flimsy metal or an older model
(43:35) you should be able to apply this to anything you sell and once you've mastered this you can become a master of increasing the lifetime value AKA how much people spend with you imagine this bucket is your business and imagine this is new customers coming in the door if you don't fix this leaky bucket they're never going to be able to stack up and so once you fix it you can flow all as much as you want but now you're keeping your customers and your Revenue compounded and if you do that for a long enough period of time while we wait for
(44:07) my friend over here to fill up the bucket this is a cyber truck and this is 100 Grand and in the next 30 days September October November December each month in 2024 I'm giving one of these to someone who's watching this video right now and so the way that you win this stuff is by building the largest group on school within the next month and last month's winner just to give you some context got you about $50,000 per month in recurring revenue and we make it pretty easy so right now one out of two people who starts a community on school that's paid makes at least $1 online and
(44:35) often times it's a lot more than that in fact right now the average is $1,360 per month so no this isn't going to get you on the Forbes list but it can help get you started and so if that sounds at all interesting the best part is you can start your own community on school absolutely free going to school.
(44:53) com games all right join the community have fun make money save the world and I'll see you on the other side and if you keep doing it over dive you'll have more money than you know what to do it and you'll be overflowing with customers and cash and that's how you create a cash flow explosion and once you got people buy it and people are buying again and again again now you're making a little bit more money but the next thing you need is going to be help and so you're going to have to have other people help you along the way cuz this is how you scale and these are two mannequins that
(45:22) represent employees so let me share a framework with you that's really expanded my vision in terms of how companies grow and this has taking me years to develop but fundamentally I see the size of a company is always going to be limited by the number of brains or the cumulative knowledge that exists within the company and so that should make some sort of sense like the amount of total knowledge that that exists is going to be the potential of the business which is why as entrepreneurs you have to learn more because if you
(45:50) make your brain bigger and you make your knowledge base bigger look how much bigger the company can get but the thing is is that you don't realize that you can get three or four or five other people's lives built into the business by saying hey I don't need to learn Finance I'm going to go find somebody who's got 20 years of Finance experience in this industry hey I don't need to learn HR and recruiting Because I'm going to go find somebody who has that experience because what happens is once you do that the potential of the business you can't even see it because
(46:19) the peak would be all the way up here and so this is the big unlock this is how Steve Jobs built the biggest you know one of the biggest Tech companies in the world it wasn't because he knew how to build the iPhone he knew how to build the team sh that could build the iPhone and so the most valuable skill set fundamentally that you can have as a business owner is the ability to get other people to do stuff for you and so on one level you have the influence to get them to want to do that thing for you and then everything else after that is enabling them to know how to do the
(46:50) right stuff and so the first is the persuasion side now that I think I covered during the closer stuff that's going to be the values you have what you present and if people really admire you and that's where you have to continue to level up yourself this is the who you are part in order to attract the best talent but once you have good talent how do you make sure that they know how to do the right stuff and so I call this the Management Diamond all right so it's very simple so I reversed this from if
(47:15) somebody doesn't do what I want them to do why would that be the first reason is they didn't know that you wanted them to do it at all because you hadn't told them or you weren't clear about it now if they know that you wanted them to do it it they might not have known how to do it because they're like okay I got that you wanted me to do it but I just don't know how the third is that they knew how they knew that and how but they didn't know when you wanted them to do it by so they could have just been totally able they just didn't know that you wanted it right now the next is they knew that how and when but they didn't
(47:47) have any motivation to do it they didn't know why you wanted them to do it and so when I think about each of these things you can actually solve this so you solve this through Comm so this is through clear communication where you include the deadlines which is here what you saw for this one is that whenever you include what you want someone to do you give them a Time duration and then you ask them how long they expect it's going to take to solve the how what we do is we have the 3DS which is document which
(48:13) is you figuring out a checklist of exactly what you do because often times when you're a beginner or when you're starting your own business you have to do every single job and so you know how to do the job better than they do the problem is in the beginning you're more unconsciously competent or you do a lot of other things that you don't know that you do which is what makes you successful you're like no one can sell like I can sell what it really means is I don't know how to teach anyone like I can sell and so that means it's a
(48:36) deficit on you not a deficit on them and so the first thing you do is you document step by step through a checklist what you do to get the result whether it's making a website or it's doing outbound or it's doing sales or making content whatever it is you document step bystep what you do the next is you demonstrate it which means you do it in front of them using the document so you say hey let me show you how I'm following the checklist and then look at what happens so I follow the checklist and look at what happens and they gain trust in the checklist in the
(49:06) documentation and so after you've documented and you demonstrated in front of them then they duplicate which means they now do it in front of you using the same document and if they get the same outcome as you do using just the document then you have duplicated the skill and now they can do it and so they know how now finally the why is a question of motivation so I'm not going to be able to solve human motivation in one video but what I will say is explaining and leveling up what this thing does within an organization a
(49:37) lot of people do want to do a good job and they do want to be contributing members of society but a lot of times we haven't explained how what you do here feeds this overall machine which hopefully does some good in the world and so it's simply explaining in simple terms how customer service for example it's like hey you do customer service and you respond to tickets using this process we get happier customers happier customers stay longer pay more and refer their friends and if we want to have this big mission one we want to make sure we're delivering to the people that we're currently serving but on top of that we want to be able to help more people over time and so you very much
(50:10) are important to our whole business to success and so if every person in the organization knows how they tie what they do directly or indirectly to you being successful as a business then they have a larger motivation for why they should do it and so if you ever have a conversation where you're like why is my employee not doing anything I would also suggest using this as a framework because then it's not none of these blame them you say hey John I asked you to do this and then you didn't do this and so help me understand was it that you didn't know that I wanted you to do it because I see this message here so
(50:43) was that part unclear is it that you didn't know how to do it was it that you didn't know when to do it by you didn't know why to do it and let me give you the bonus number five was there something blocking you and so this is actually one of the most common ones of the diamond because what it is is for example hey I could have the best chef in the world and I say hey make me an omelette he understands what baking omet is he knows how to do it and I say make it for me right now he's motivated because he's on live television what's the problem he ain't got no eggs and so the whole point is
(51:13) and I had this I'll give you a real example with my team I was like Hey guys why are you guys not getting these edits out on time and they were like ah we want to spend more time at home we want to spend it at the headquarters and I was like I built this massive headquarters for you guys like why are you not spending time here and so it turned out they knew how to do it they knew that I wanted it they knew when they needed to buy they were very motivated to do it the problem was the internet at our headquarters wasn't fast
(51:35) enough they were way faster at home and so we spent 200 Grand to get Google Fiber drilled down into the building so we get a gigabyte a second now and now they all edit here and so the thing is is a lot of times as a as a boss or an owner you have to see what are the things that are blocking because most people do want to do their jobs but this little five five five-part framework this diamond is one of the most valuable tools I have because this actually makes a productive discussion cuz either you can solve the constraint for them or you
(52:03) find out that you've got somebody who despite all of these thing still chooses not to do it in which case maybe it's not a good fit for them so we had a a new sales rep that came in uh and we were really excited about him and he you know he seemed really sharp really understood what was going on and within three days he was doing all of the stuff but he came to us and was like I really hate this now that's something that I can't fix if you hate you know talking to new people and talking to customers or talking to prospects all day long then sales is probably not for you now
(52:32) that being said we also want to break down like hey everything's got periods of suck you got to learn skills things like that but if I check every one of these boxes and someone says checks all of them and nothing's stopping them except for themselves then it makes the conversation really easy it's like dude I don't want you to do something you don't want to do no worries so boom why do I bring a tripod here if you're like what are the three pillars of business these are the three pillars of businesses Alex understands them the
(52:56) first the for the spear is acquisition that's marketing and sales that's letting people know about your stuff and getting them to exchange money in order to get it the second pillar is delivering that stuff so someone advertises someone sells and then someone has to create and deliver the iPhone so once you advertise and you sell now you have to deliver the product you got to give the person the iPhone so that comes from the design that's product that's distribution that's delivery in service businesses that's
(53:20) customer success that's onboarding that's delivering the service itself that is all the stuff that goes into this delivery it's how you fulfill the promises that acquisition made the third one and this is the one that a lot of people forget and this often limits businesses is operations so this is everything else that's not included in these two but that support these two so think it legal Finance payroll HR recruiting all of that stuff supports these two other functions these are the core value creators in the business you
(53:50) got a market and sell stuff you got to deliver that stuff but everything else that has to exist in order for these two to continue to function you got to pay taxes you got to pay payroll you got to send people checks right these are all things that must exist but most entrepreneurs are severely lacking and this is sometimes where the biggest outside help can come and help expand the overall business so that the potential of how big the thing is that you want to build can get so much bigger and then you just keep adding more and
(54:19) more people to this and you keep expanding the stool but the Three core pillars of the business remain unchanged and so if these are the three pillars of the business and you want to take a partner on so let's say that I want to take this partner not necessarily a life partner but I want to take a partner on in my business because this happens a lot really early and usually it's because there's so much work and you have no capital and you're like well you know what if two of us work at least twice as much stuff will get done the
(54:44) problem is most Partnerships come from two guys or two gals who are buddies and say hey let's get like we have fun hanging out let's and we love talking about business let's do business together but the problem is let's say they both love marketing and sales or they both love product or they both love operational stuff just like people and things like that well then you actually are super uh topheavy and what happens is this goes like this because you're over over indexed on one and the tripod Falls over and so you want to be
(55:13) balanced in the business so that the business can continue to scale proportionately across all functions and so if somebody is going to partner with you they have to have a skill that you don't have time you don't have or Capital you don't have and from the skill perspective it means they have to have one of the other legs of the stool that you don't have from a capital perspective that might be the thing that flows into the business that allows these people to work in the beginning when it might not be as profitable or
(55:37) for you to buy inventory for you to buy a machine that you're going to do the equipment with or let's say it's you sending the capital somebody else is going to be running the business on your behalf as an operator or owner now they're putting in time or energy that you don't have because you're doing other stuff congrats you're now done with level two more money and now it's time to go to level three so here we are on level three and I want to Quick take a quick pause to invite you if you're a business owner doing
(56:02) over a million dollars a year and you'd like to scale to the next level I want to invite you to come out to our workshops here in Vegas to my headquarters to meet with me and my team each of my functional directors who are working with companies in my portfolio doing hundreds of millions of dollars a year to help you have advertising go from 1 to 10 we know what it looks like to have delivery go from 10 to 30 we know what it like looks like to have Finance go from 30 to 100 and so we can help you DEC constrain those things and help you ultimately scale if that sounds at all interesting
(56:38) I'm sure the URL is around here and we'd love to have you out otherwise keep enjoying the vid let's go to the first level of level three keeping your advantage so things are working people are working for you you're making sales now we want to expand the gap between you and everybody else and if you're like why is there a big seesaw here I'll explain in a second but the fundamental Crux of all this this is the big word leverage which is let's define it how much you get for what you put in so leverage doesn't mean good or bad it's just how much you get now if I do this
(57:09) many times and let's say I'm pumping something then I'm doing more repetitions and the amount of Leverage I get is proportional to the size of this lever right now if I want to get more for what I put in then it means I would extend this lever all the way out here and i' would get more for every push if I wanted to have less which why would you I would put my heads here and I have a much smaller lever so it's much harder to do the same amount of work and so how much you get is leverage High Leverage
(57:35) is I get a lot for what I put in low Leverage is I get very little for what I put in and so there's lots of forms of Leverage in a business and the idea is that you want to have as many working for you at the same time as seemly possible so I'll give you a couple examples so one one that I've built mine on is brand it's reputation so that means that if I have a brand versus is not having a brand the brand gives me leverage in a lot of ways so number one is I have higher click the rates if I run an ad with a trusted figure then more people will click than otherwise
(58:07) would have normally without a brand that means I get more for what I put in high leverage second I get higher conversion rates and so the people who click also have a higher likelihood of opting in following through and ultimately buying and once people do that then they're able to say yes or they're willing to say yes at higher prices another form of Leverage is people if I can get more for what I put in I only lived one life one lifespan but I can get somebody else's life basically their experience to help Propel my business towards my goal then I get my life plus
(58:44) their life and so that gives me more leverage so I want to make this real for you so imagine you see an advertisement for this blank t-shirt all right are you inclined to buy it probably not unless you're just in the market for white t-shirts but all of a sudden if you see this one right next to it you might have a much higher likelihood of clicking converting and then buying at a higher price so literally if these are side by side this might be $30 and this might be $5 and you still might be more likely to buy this one that is the leverage that
(59:16) bring gets you because they for the same ad and the same dollars get more sales for what they put in and you can see leverage everywhere if I write code and I write it one time and then millions of people use it that gives me leverage I did work once people use it millions of times so for example if I write a book then it takes me x amount of time to write the book but once the book's written I don't have to work again for the book but if people keep telling their friends about the book and saying it's good then it continues to sell copies and spread the word that's leverage I'll give you another one so if
(59:47) I get if I do this in the beginning I'm probably really inefficient at it but if I do this for days and days on end I probably realize I got to put my weight on it you know what I can lock my arm out so I don't have have to use my muscles and I can just lower my weight on this thing so my skill gets better and so I get more per unit of effort and so skill is also another form of Leverage and so one of the most important relationships to get leverage earlier on in your career is understanding what work is so work which is what you do every day is
(1:00:19) volume times leverage equals output which means work equals output so it's not about how hard you work it's about how much you get for the work you do and so if I have a lot of Leverage awesome but if I have a lot of Leverage and I do a lot of repetitions then I get even more output and so the thing is and this is what people don't understand is in the beginning you need to do volume because volume gives you skill skill is leverage and so for example let's say I'm doing cold calls in the beginning of my career if I do 100 cold calls and
(1:00:54) somebody who's been doing cold calls for 10 years and has an amazing skill set does 100 cold calls he's going to get more appointments booked than I will and so for the same work same volume he's going to get more output so in a very real way he worked more than I did he got more for what he put in and so there is a reciprocal relationship between volume and leverage because the more you do the better you get and the better you get the more you like it the more you like it the more you do it and so this
(1:01:19) is The Virtuous cycle of work but you have to get started in the beginning when you have low leverage and so the only thing you can do is compensate with volume it means you have to do a thousand door knocks a thousand cold calls a thousand cold emails a thousand pieces of content so that you can start getting good and so one of my favorite and least favorite sayings is work smart not hard because the reality of it is that you have to work hard in order to work smart and so now we just finished keeping your advantage so you've made even more money and you're continuing to
(1:01:50) scale your business and so now we move on to the next part of level three sticking with it because if everything's going well the only thing that can stop you is you and so I'll give you one of my favorite quotes from Charlie Munger which I'll paraphrase he more or less says compounding is the eighth wonder of the world and the objective of compounding is to never interrupt it and so he talks about this to stop people from day trading and getting people buy in and out of stocks he says you should be willing to buy a company and have the stock market be closed for the next five years because you bought a share of a
(1:02:20) company and you believe it's going to go up for a long period of time so that's why you buy high quality businesses but the concept of not interrupting compounding is one of the key philosophies that I have around focus focus is one of the most important things of entrepreneurs and if you talk to the most successful entrepreneurs they talk about ruthlessly focusing for long periods of time and Steve Jobs was famous for grilling his direct reports and asking them when he would start meetings what have you said no to lately and so I Define focus by the
(1:02:52) quality and quantity of things you you say no to so if you say yes to many things then you are not focused if you say no hypothetically to literally everything except for one thing you would Define that person as incredibly focused probably obsessive but like imagine a kid for example who did nothing but play video games all day he's incredibly focused on video games he doesn't eat he doesn't sleep I'm saying hypothetically does nothing else he's incredibly focused at some point I'm not saying you do that but it points out the hypothetical stream of what Focus really is and so some people claim to be focused but it's not are you focused or
(1:03:31) not it's how focused are you and so if you followed any of my stuff at all I talk about the woman in the red dress and the reason I love this analogy is it's perfect so in The Matrix there's this moment if you haven't seen the movie where Morpheus who's the guide or the teacher in the story is teaching Neo the main character about how the Matrix works and so they're walking through a crowded City he's talking about something and he says were you looking were you listening to me or are you looking at the women in the red dress and he says 'what and he says 'l again and he says and when he looks again there's a gun pointed at his head and so
(1:04:01) he says if you're not one of us you're one of them and so these are agents agents basically are the things that disrupt everything in the system and so what appears to be a woman in the red dress what appears to be this shiny object this amazing thing that catches your attention this big opportunity you think you should leave your current thing for that is often an agent in Disguise meant and sent to kill you and destroy your progress and your focus but let me tell you how deceptive this is and this is what it looks like for
(1:04:29) entrepreneurs and so there's five stages that I think entrepreneurs go through in the beginning you have uh zero right and then you have uninformed optimism which means that you don't know what you're talking about but it looks really good this is the grasses greener on the other side then you have informed pessimism which is now that I got into it oh it actually isn't that easy to make money in this thing even though my cousin's doing he's actually been doing it for five years there's all these other things I didn't know about
(1:04:58) but now you know about it you're like o this is actually a little harder than I thought then if you keep going you have the valley of Despair this is where everyone gives up and everyone stops trying now what happens most times is they never get to step four what happens again well I'll tell you step four and then I'll tell you what happens to so step four is you get to informed optimism so now remember the optimism here now you're informed about it so you're like okay I get what it takes to make this work and I can see a
(1:05:29) way for me to win and then finally you get to here which is you achieve the goal right you do what you set out to do to begin with but you have to go through the valley of the spirit this happens in every single business especially when you're starting out but what happens for most entrepreneurs is dotted line they start it all over again and so they say oh you know what I'm GNA go find my point of uninformed optimism because there's another thing it's not Drop Shipping it's crypto it's not crypto it's wholesaling it's not wholesaling it's insert whatever opportunity you think is quick and easy
(1:06:03) and I promise you none of them are because think about it this way if something were quick and easy everyone would do it and already be winning so I want to break this myth in half because I think it's so important because it is the number one thing that destroys most businesses is disrupting compounding and I think part of the reason that this myth is proliferated is because the people who are selling you that myth make money on you buying their solution and so what they is they say oh the average millionaire has seven income streams right and so you think oh
(1:06:31) millionaires have seven income streams therefore I have that's like saying oh the average billionaire has a private jet therefore I should fly private to be a billionaire it confuses sequence it's not that you get tall when you play basketball it's that tall people play basketball and so for you in your career most people who make a lot of money Focus all of their eggs in one basket and then once they've achieved all the success then they diversify but after they diversify their returns go down not up Bill Gates for example if he had never sold his Microsoft shares right now would be a trillionaire he'd be
(1:07:08) worth one and a half trillion today instead he's worth 100 to 150 billion and the main reason is because he Diversified after he focused all of his wealth building into Microsoft now Steve Balmer his number two man in the very beginning had a much much much smaller share so I think Balmer has like two or three 3% a tiny slice of Microsoft Bill Gates had 49% when they went public so he had half the company and so today Steve Balmer his number two is almost as wealthy as Bill Gates because he has stayed focused this whole time and never
(1:07:42) liquidated his shares and continued to grow in Microsoft and so they want to feed you this myth that somehow 17th of you splits between all these things they say try a bunch of stuff see what works the reality is any of these things can work if you concentrate all of your attention into one then see overflows then that is how you get an overflowing opportunity you keep working it you keep doubling down on it and you say no to the woman in the red dress because you know that she's just the value of Despair she's just an agent in Disguise
(1:08:16) and if you stick with it you will win and that's the thing that separates the people who win from the people who don't is that they can just keep saying no to everything else they keep saying yep you know what that's an amazing opportunity for someone else that's an amazing opportunity for someone else and let me show you this mathematically so let's say that you're in your third month your third week your third year whatever increment you want of you developing some skill right you continue to get a little bit better every single year fine
(1:08:46) now you see this new opportunity that you're a ground zero for and you think man I think I could grow faster by doing this thing and so you have to reason let's say that you're on year four of opportunity number one that instead of saying okay well I'm going to go to you know I'm going to go to my fifth year so you're not you haven't done this yet so this is hypothetical instead you say you know what I'm going to start this new opportunity and new opportunity I'm going to be here which is higher than where I was before and it's going to be
(1:09:10) a double the rate okay but now I'm on year two here guess where I'm going to be if I'm on year two past this on this opportunity and so you can't compare year two here to year two here you have to compare year two here to year five here and so this increment I promise you it's significantly easier to take something from $10 million to $15 million than it take from zero to five in a year so you finished keeping your advantage and sticking with it and you've made even more money we just keep making money we're crazy and so we move on to the last and final step of level three get better and keep getting better
(1:09:47) and so one of the key skills that I've developed over my career that I want to share with you is the ability to learn but not in the way that you might think traditionally and so what happens is sure in the beginning you want to get from courses and experts and things like that but over time what you want to double down on is volume because what volume does is it gives you data and then data you can do something called a common factors analysis so let's say that I make 10 pieces of content okay these are my 10 pieces of content hopefully that's 10 all right now that means that within
(1:10:19) those top 10 pie those 10 pieces of content there's going to be a top one and there's going to be a bottom one and this is going to be the one that did better and this is going to be the one that did the worst and so what I want to do is see what did the top 10% have that this one didn't have what are the discrepancies between these two and those discrepancies are the golden nuggets that build together to help you acquire skills and so one of the things that people shy away from in the beginning is how low leverage you are you have no Capital you have no friends you have no other people who can help
(1:10:49) you out so it's just you and when you start you suck but the thing is is that the pain of how bad it is and how hard it is in the beginning is the thing that forces you to seek out better ways to do it and so you have to go through that pain so that you can seek out these improvements and then all of a sudden you figure out a new way to use that lever that takes on Tenth of the time you figure out how to tweak your email headings to get way more open rates or you tweak your offer to get way more responses or you make your ad hooks better so you get higher you know people
(1:11:18) clicking the ad all of those things are skills and so this pain and this volume and this is the poor part getting a feedback loop going is what creates skills so it's not just doing a lot you have to do a lot so that you can see what works so that you can get better fundamentally common factors analysis is how I learn everything because a lot of the skills that I have to learn now are things that no one teaches there's no courses for what I for what I'm trying to learn now and so I have to just try a lot of things and see huh what are the
(1:11:49) top 10% have in common and this works for figuring out your customer Avatar you're like hey what are my top 10% of customers what do they have in common in terms of what they did and who they are what are the bottom 10% what did they do and who are they okay well I want less of those and more of these and so this is a continuous loop that you do on your customers the same thing works in your content what are the top 10 pieces and the bottom 10 pieces what are the top 10 ads and the bottom 10 ads what are the
(1:12:12) top 10 uh perfect sales scripts in terms of recordings what do we say differently on those calls than we said on these calls it literally applies to everything and that continuous loop of progress and feedback is how you get better and that is the core of Leverage from a skills perspective and so right now if you're watching this video maybe a million dollars is your goal and if it is your goal then you have to deconstruct it to what you need to do remember from the very beginning and what are the actions that I have to take and you take these actions so that you can look at what
(1:12:41) worked and what didn't so that you can get better and so this is fundamentally how you create goals and know this isn't your mama's goal video because you've already seen that this isn't about smart goals this is about your relationship with your goals and this is something that I don't see people talk about but you have a relationship with your goals it is something that you're willing to sacrifice in order to keep and so when I think about this for myself I had a conversation with Lea for example where I said you know what I Define love as what you're willing to give up in order
(1:13:11) to keep something and so you say hey man that guy Rod he must love that car because he's he continues to keep working on it over and over again it still doesn't work he must love that thing because of what he's willing to put up in order to keep it and so if we think about that as the measuring stick of how much not do I love something or not but how much do I love something then you can see in a very real way how much do you really love your goals are you willing to lose a friend over it are you willing to give that up in order to keep your goals are you willing to give up a girlfriend for it in order to keep your goals are you willing to give up a
(1:13:41) wife or a spouse for it in order to keep your goals for me the answer is honestly yes and the reason that I have such an intimate relationship with my goals sounds kind of weird is because my goals have fed me more than anything in my life they have helped me become the person that I want to be because they have oriented my behavior to help me do the activities that create the character traits that create the outcomes and so I use that as my filter for the people who are in my world so if someone comes in my world and I think do I need to sacrifice my goals in order to
(1:14:13) keep you now a lot of times it's not an allout sacrifice sometimes I just ask the question is my goal achievement more or less likely with this person in my life and often times it's just neutral which then for me is okay well then you're going to drain me of resources that don't get me to my goals that I could otherwise those marbles that I could otherwise keep focused on the main thing which means I have to say no to this because I choose my goals over that now this may sound extreme and that's because it is but you can't want to be exceptional and not be willing to be the
(1:14:44) exception it is normal to be not normal to have not normal outcomes if you can't expect this is a preference thing from the closes you can't want my outcomes but want it your way if you change the variables you change the outcome and what I can tell you universally is that the people who achieve outsized returns are the ones who did outsized work and more specifically made outsized sacrifices in order to continue to be able to pour in to that which mattered most and so I'll I'll be real with you for a second I've hit my million dollar
(1:15:15) goal I hit my $100 million goal and now I've been pretty public I'm trying to document everything that I do to hit a billion and Beyond and at the same time the billion dollar goal matters a ton to me and at the same time not at all because the billion dollar goal is not because I want to hit a billion dollars for some reason I can't buy there's nothing I can buy at a billion that I can't really buy now that would that I can consume as an individual sure maybe I buy companies or buy big buildings or something like that but it doesn't actually change my day-to-day living but the reason that I hold on to that
(1:15:44) billion dollar goal is because I would like to meet the man who I would become who's able to achieve that and so for me the quantitative measure of what my business has grown has been an indicator of my personal growth and so I have a belief that either your business is growing or you are and so when your business is grow is going down guess what you're usually growing a ton because it's painful and that's why they call it Growing Pains not growing Joys it's not fun but the thing is is that most things in life aren't fun decline is painful stagnation is painful growth
(1:16:14) is painful the question is which of those pains get you closer to where you want to go follow the steps in this video and hit your million but you should want to make as soon as you hit the million set it for 10 and as soon as you had 10 10 set it for 100 not because you need the money because but because you want to meet the man or woman who's capable of making that a reality the biggest gains in life the best players in life play Infinite games because the objective isn't to win you're not going to win at business like take it to the Natural extreme let's say you become the richest man in the world let's say
(1:16:47) historically at the richest men none of them was the richest man for their entire lives they touch the top for a brief second for a year for two years and then they disapp appear or they die so it's this whole idea that's not even true you don't win the point of business is to stay in business that is why it's an infinite game the point of marriage is not to get married it's to stay married the point of fitness and health isn't to get fit or get healthy it's to stay healthy and so most of the games worth playing in life are not finite
(1:17:17) games they're infinite and so if you can adopt this learning mentality then there is no end because you are the asset you are the outcome and so by saying that you are finished playing means that you are finished becoming and for me I don't want to stop getting better until the day I die so we started your journey to your first Million by figuring out what skills you needed to have what knowledge you needed to know to get started then figured out who you were going to sell to then what you were going to sell them
(1:17:44) then figuring how to advertise and close in order to get them to buy then from there we increased how much they were worth by getting them to buy more times then we recruited the people who need to be our team to help us along along the way and scale then we keep and expand our advantage through leverage and we stick with it to unlock compound and growth within the business and ourselves and then finally we get better through a continuous learning Loop and that is how you get to your first money and if you enjoyed this click the next video which is 13 years of brutally honest business
(1:18:15) advice because at this point hopefully you'll have your first million or be on the way to it and then I'm going to get you with some harsh truths of getting from 1 to 10 and Beyond

Transcript:
(00:00) I'm going to show you how to get your first five customers in 10 steps the wild world of YouTube has videos everywhere telling you how to scale and grow but I think people over complicate it and so this is actually a sneak peek from my new book 100 million dollar leads which comes out 819 you can go to acquisition.
(00:15) com forward slash leads let's dive in so the first step to getting this going is you need to get a list Alex you're damn straight you do number one I want you to go to your email account to pull all the contacts that you have in there anybody that you've ever messaged or emailed that becomes list one list two is I want you to go to every single social media profile that you have go to your social media profiles where you can direct message people so if you have followers that you can DM I want you to write down every single one of those people list number
(00:41) three pull out your phone look for your contacts I want you to export them list one is all your email contacts list two is all of your Social contacts and list three is all of your phone and private personal contacts if you add all three of those together you will have a shitload more leads than you thought you did you're like wait you're gonna ask me to contact these people slow down not yet and we're not going to do in a really weird way I'm trying to do in a classy way this is how I started every business I have and have people thank me
(01:04) for it the second step is that you pick a platform all right so you have all these contacts but you're gonna have to pick one platform that you're gonna start messaging or emailing them with start with the one that you have the most people on so if you have the most Instagram people or you have the most email contacts or you have more people in your phone than any of those start there step three but what do I say you personalize your message so what you want to do is you want to use something you already know about the person or
(01:26) Prospect in order to initiate reaching out to them this is also just called being a human being what you do is you take 30 seconds you look at someone's profile and you say oh they've got this thing we have something in common and you could reach out to them with that as your primary message so for example you can be like hey Saul you got a baby hey saw you switch jobs hey saw you move hey you saw that movie last weekend it doesn't matter all you need to show is that you took the few seconds to actually not just blast some sort of
(01:53) message step four you reach out and you reach out to 100 people every single day so let's say you had 3 000 people between all your emails all your phone contacts and every single follower across all your social medias it took you 20 years to send your first DM and it'll take you two minutes to send the second one everything must be hard before it can be easy so just get over the hump send it just something so you can realize that you won't die step five what do I say if they reply you warm them up I use a framework that I call
(02:20) ACA you acknowledge compliment and you ask for example I can acknowledge and say oh so you have two kids they're gonna compliment about the thing so it's like wow you have two kids you must be a super mom working full-time and having two kids when we go to ask we're gonna tie our ask to the complim we just gave them then we transition to whatever type of question that's going to lead them to the service we sell if I was selling weight loss I'd be like hey so you're Superman how do you have time to eat right and work out wait a second this
(02:48) sounds like selling it's not talking [ __ ] humans step six invite their friends when you're talking about this stuff you're not going to sell them this is [ __ ] cute you're not gonna solicit them you asked a question they're going to tell you stuff and then it's going to be like oh yeah by the way do you know anyone who's looking for X Y and Z because I'm opening up a few slots to help people do exactly that you're just asking them if they know anybody and since you're friends with them and since you're contacts you're asking them for a
(03:17) favor you're not asking them to buy from you this should make you not feel weird about messaging people if they say hey I'd like to find out more now what they have done is they've transitioned from a lead to an Engaged lead a lead is somebody that you can contact an Engaged lead is someone who you can contact comma who has shown interest in the thing that you sell if she says I haven't been able to keep up with my workouts Etc now they have shown interest in the thing well then how do I get them to buy from it we're going to
(03:44) give them the easiest offer in the world to say yes to you're going to make it free they probably know that you're not that experienced just be honest the reason we do it for free is you say hey I'm gonna do all this stuff for free as long as you promise to do three things one you actually use my service two you give me feedback on it and three leave a killer review if you think it deserves one those are the terms of exchange the reason I want you to start with that is that one it'll get you more reps two you
(04:06) probably suck three you need to learn how to suck less and you suck less by doing more and it's way easier to get more people to work with you if you lower the barrier to free you're actually getting the better end of the deal you might be wondering why I just mush the [ __ ] out this banana in my hand and it's because the launch of my second book 100 million dollar leads is both nutritious natural and uh will make you lots of money unlike bananas but the event itself where I'll be launching it on Saturday August 19th will be bananas
(04:32) I've spent over a million dollars in the event itself and I'm going to be giving away a secret thing that I've been working on for over four years to everyone who's there with me live and I I would love to tell you what it is it kills me inside that I cannot tell you but I want the surprise itself to be worth it and I think it will be this is a date that you're not going to miss it's a day after my birthday and it's my way of giving back to you guys for being so awesome click the link register and I'll see you guys I'll tell you the
(04:53) quick story of Warren Buffett and Ben Graham Ben Graham was the goat back in the day for investing Warren Buffett was just a kid out of Columbia and wanted to go learn investing and he offered to work for Graham for free graham said you're getting the better end of the deal the actual answer was you're overpriced so free was too expensive for Graham because Graham knew that he was gonna have to invest more in getting Warren good enough to actually work for him and so right now these customers and they are very much customers because
(05:20) they are exchanging something for your service they're exchanging their time and their effort and some stuff later that you're gonna have them do just because you're not getting paid doesn't mean it's free but it is monetarily free so gather round I'm gonna give you two versions of this you say by the way do you know anybody who is describe their struggles looking to dream outcome in time delay I'm taking on five case studies for free because that's all I can handle I just want to get some testimonials for my
(05:46) service or product and we're being honest because this is their first business and you [ __ ] have no idea what you're doing so you better not take more than five customers I just had a girl named XXX work with me to get dream outcome even though she described the same struggle the person you're talking to is struggling with I'd like to get more testimonials to show Works across different scenarios does anyone you like come to mind if they say no here's a really funny way you can respond to that you say haha does anyone you hate come
(06:11) to mind honestly that's when you'll sometimes get the real response if you don't have time to say all of those things you just say I help the type of customer get dream outcome in time period without effort and sacrifice and I guarantee XYZ to decrease risk that's it that's if you just have that moment to deliver one thing of what do I do some special snowflakes are going to be like you should never sell your time for nothing you suck you have never done this before so it would be unreasonable for you to be good why would you want to sell sucky
(06:39) service to people you know if people don't want to work with you even for free then ask them why because the reason that someone tells you they don't want to work with you even for free is because there are hidden costs associated with whatever thing you sell if you figure out what all those hidden costs are you can eliminate those hidden costs and then be able to charge significantly more for your solution later compared to the other people who charge for it and still include those hidden costs so I'll give you an example
(07:03) I got solicited in this exact Manner and a guy messaged me and said I want to do short form videos for you you don't have to do anything I will take all the stuff you already have online and I will make them for you and I'll even post them for you like you actually just need to say yes and so I said yes and guess what you started making short videos and he started accepting payments because he had removed the hidden costs if people get value from this thing that you have especially if it's free they're far more
(07:25) likely to leave positive reviews give you feedback and send their friends and family once we have that we have our first customers now we go to step eight you start back at the top so you had that big list and we hit all of the months and back again so some of those people by the way when you ask them if they know anybody they actually just give you people that they know that might help and you get free leads because if you reach out to 3 000 people with a free thing you'll get five people who will take you up on it I promise you
(07:47) so now you're like but Alex I can't work for free forever now we're on step nine start charging once people start referring that's when you know you were good enough to start charging when this happens all you do is you go back up to the script that I just read to you and you change free to 80 off and you say that's for the next five what do you do after that change the 80 to 60 after you get those five change to forty then to twenty then you're at full price but guess what it doesn't have to stop there you can go 20 over you can go 40 over
(08:14) that because there are no rules and if at that point you're way better you may Merit that because of the value that you deliver because ideally you're charging full retail but now you're at 10x the value value that you have done has gotten better because you figured out from the feedback that these people that work with you for free have told you so that you can make it even better for people who pay you once you have those people and you started transitioning congratulations you are in business and you are making money you will at some
(08:38) point reach capacity when you fill up all your slots with free people and discounted people now you have true scarcity and so you can ethically sell with conviction that you really don't have that much room they will desire you more because you are scarce from a resource perspective and then they will pay the same or premium in order to work with you and then you turn to your free person and you say I am accepting somebody who's paying full vote in order to do this if you would like me to keep doing this for you you would have to
(09:07) start paying to match them are you comfortable with that if they're not no sweat because all you did is you help them for free and you say no worries can I get the the killer killer review you asked me for or I asked you for and those Free People you have to love and cherish them more than anyone else in your life because they're going to get you business in three different ways one They're Gonna Leave You reviews that are going to get your best too they're gonna send you people that are going to get your business and three they themselves
(09:30) May transition into paying you which will also get you busy don't think short think long and you'll make long money now you have paying customers you're reaching your capacity you're consistently raising your price because now there is more demand than you have Supply and we have artificially created a condition for profit so what's the 10 step keep them warm you've got this big list of people check in like a human being provide value to them on a regular basis when you do that you continue to reinforce and deposit Goodwill in the
(09:53) audience because what will happen eventually is you won't even need to ask them because you've provided enough value you start posting enough testimonials enough results talking about some of the insurance stuff that you're doing right now that people be like hey that's actually pretty cool hey can I find out more about that and then they'll actually start soliciting you and that's the game that's how you go from zero to hero and get your first five paying customers

(00:00) productivity is how much money you get out for the time you put in I know this because I went from $0 at age 23 to $100 million plus net worth at age 31 simply by better investing my time and I'm going to teach you how I do it so that hopefully you can do it and I'm even going to show you my calendar at the end of the video and walk you through step by step how I get good Returns on my time have you ever had someone reach out to you and say hey God minute hey got 10 hey let me introduce you to so and so they're going to be in town how does 10 a.m. work a normal exchange like that
(00:32) you might say yeah I've Got 5 minutes or sure I can meet so and so for coffee the problem is that for one specific type of worker that five-minute meeting blows their entire morning because they can't do the development work they need they can't edit the video they can't write the book chapter because it disrupts their workflow on the other hand there's another type of worker where for them it's actually very optimal for them to take that meeting the question is which one are you and at what times also special shout out to Paul Graham who wrote a tiny blog this 14 years ago so
(01:01) if time is what we invest and money is what we make from that investment then the people who are the best investors of time were the ones who make the most money and so it turns out there are two specific types of entrepreneurs and you'll switch hats throughout your day or throughout your week the first and most common investor of time that people are familiar with is the manager schedule and these people have a very specific way of investing time and getting Returns on it so they can make the most money so let's talk about that managers divide their time into the
(01:34) smallest chunk possible they often have 20 plus chunks per day from 15 minutes sometimes 5 minutes all the way to an hour or 90 minutes and for managers an empty time slot is a lost opportunity that's time that did not get a return on investment for them and for that reason they treat time like currency and the only real cost for them to fill is just the cost of coordinating with somebody else's calendar to find a mutually empty slot so that they can work together now on paper since work on meetings is a
(02:06) mutually filled slot it makes both people more productive and so when a manager interacts with another manager and they mutually fill a slot both of them make more money now they talk to lots of different people and do many different kinds of tasks all day long this is the nature of the manager they collect data they report data to persuade to lead to train and encourage and make other decisions one-on one and sometimes in groups of people for them they have a pretty clear beginning of the day and a pretty clear end of the day the day begins when they start preparing for their meetings maybe 30
(02:40) minutes or an hour beforehand and it ends at the end of their last meeting now if they prep for the next day then they could add that on top but more or less the duration of their day is directly proportional to the duration of the meetings they have they basically work until their last calendar slot and that's how their day works and this is the key Point here the main objective of the manager is to use up all their chunks in the day day so that they maximize their time a fully booked day is a maximally invested manager they've used up all of their time slots and so they are
(03:11) productive now the second type of time schedule management is something called the maker and this is one that the vast majority of people do not know this is where the creators this is where the entrepreneurs this is where people who have to make big things who build stuff get the highest returns on their time the vast majority of entrepreneurs at some point have some or all of their time that's dedicated to making stuff this is the Deep work this is the stuff that moves the big ball forward there are often tasks that are not urgent but
(03:43) incredibly important and when you look back on your month or your quarter or your year the few things that you remember that actually move the ball forward that actually move your business forward in the long term were these chunks of work now the problem is most entrepreneurs do not have the time and do not have the system for maximizing that time of important work because fundamentally if those are the footholds that allow you to push yourself forward towards your goal then you want as many of those as possible the difficulty is
(04:13) that it's never urgent this is like if you're a coder and you need to develop software obviously if that software is developed that's the most valuable thing you can do if you're an editor and you make videos then actually editing the video so that it can get out in media is the most important thing that you can do if you write copy for emails or you're an author and you write books you actually writing the book and actually doing the work of the book is the most important thing that you can do all of those things are maker work you create
(04:37) something that before this did not exist although this work is important it's incredibly expensive in terms of time and the problem is the vast majority of the world works on manager time not on maker time so let me explain the difference so for the maker when you get into maker mode instead of many small slivers like the manager has you have only a few large chunks and the reason for that is because if you put a meeting or you interrupt a 4-Hour long block then you often can't get back to the work that you were doing before also if you know that you have a block that's
(05:11) coming you can't get into the flow because you know that you're going to have to get out of the flow and so this is like the end of day meeting that kills you this is called the zernick effect it's that we tend to remember open loops and meetings are open Loops because you have to set timers so you don't forget it you have to start setting a timer before the timer to start wrapping up even if you're using right now then you start thinking about the meeting and what you have to prepare for that meeting and now you're not
(05:34) thinking about your own work and this eats up your brain power and saps your ability to make unlike the manager where the decisions the direction and the coordination is the output of their work for the maker the stuff the things they build the things they make is the output of their time and so instead of working on meetings they work off meetings they work on projects that can't get done in 30es minutes sometimes those projects last weeks months quarters until they're done and so the way that that work
(06:06) actually looks is that most makers have a set start time but variable end times so unlike the manager where they they know when they start and they know when they finish most makers work open to goal if you've ever lost yourself in your work and you're like man I just want to keep riding this this High I want to keep riding this flow that's what it feels like to make you want to stay in there as long as you possibly can and that's why having no cap on the allows you to get lost in the work and produce more than you ever could so if you have only large time chunks that
(06:36) means that you only have one or two per day sometimes three if you're working 18 hours and so that means you usually have a morning block and a post lunch block now if you're somebody who likes to also work after dinner then you have a post dinner block so you basically have three four to six hour chunks per day that's it and on a sustainable basis most people just have two per day and so if someone takes one meeting in the morning they blew one of your 10 work blocks per week if you only work 5 days a week and
(07:06) so someone's taking 10% of your total output by having one meeting the issue is that that manager who's working on manager time puts that thing in and for them they're becoming more productive but they're destroying your productivity when this happens is when you finish your day feel like you look back and know that all your time was spent but you got no return on it you have nothing to show for it and if you feel like you have that happen again and again and again this is how businesses stay small this is how entrepreneurs fail to grow
(07:36) This Is How They relive the same 6 months same 12 months same two years over and over and over again because they do not know how to invest their time for the maker an empty time slot is not a lost opportunity the empty time block is the opportunity to get the return if you're a maker you understand what I'm about to share with you if you look at your calendar and see that you have literally nothing on there you have no meetings you have no nothing it's just empty until the end of the day how much energy are you filled with you're like oh my God I'm going to crush this day there's all this this big project I want to sink my teeth into it I'm going
(08:11) to be able to take a huge chunk out of it that energy that you get is because that is a maximally productive day is an empty calendar rather than a filled calendar and so for context when I was writing my book my days every day were just writing the book and I told my team that that's all I was going to be doing you're like but don't you run this portfolio of all these companies and there's all this money and these deals and decisions that have to happen and the answer is yes and when I show you my
(08:36) calendar it'll all Mak sense so literally diametrically opposed calendars are both maximally allocated to invest time to get the highest Returns on it in terms of money the big problem is when the two need to interact because if you just had makers making and you just had managers managing everyone would be happy the problem is when managers manage makers and they have to meet so when a manager doesn't know how makers work they kill the productivity of their team managers often assume that makers can work like they do on demand
(09:09) they think it's hey it's just 30 minutes and you've got free time what's the big deal I looked at your calendar you have nothing all day you're barely even working because they're using their measuring stick of work their way a calendar looks when they're maximally effective and then transposing that on top of the Maker's calendar and thinking these two are the same when they couldn't be more different for a manager a short meeting costs one work unit which is maybe 15 minutes and for them they've got 20 plus per day so they can easily spare one whereas if they take
(09:38) one from a maker they take one of the two time slots you have per day and sometimes you take both based on what the topic of the meeting is if you say hey we're going to do your quarterly performance as an employee at 2:00 in the afternoon the likelihood that the employee leading up to that is going to be able to think about the work that they're going to do when they're worried about their job or they're worried about their performance all day long and then afterwards they thinking about what they said and they could have said
(10:00) differently that day shot to make matters worse if a maker is falling behind the manager's solution is to interrupt them more which creates a vicious cycle this means managers prevent the work that they check in on so by checking in on them they disrupt the Maker's work so that they can't actually make during the time slot to check in if they're actually working because the manager Works while on meetings where the Maker Works when they're off meetings and when this happens and it happens often both parties lose and this is the main point the manager loses because the maker is
(10:29) not making what they need to be making and the manager is responsible for some level of output so both people aren't making the best Returns on their time this is why this is important for managers and important for makers so if you are on a team share this with your boss share this with your teammates so that this become like this can become more common in the Lexicon all my companies understand and use this language if you ask as a manager for a maker to make time for you they either one offend the manager by saying no I can't do that because I'm working and
(11:01) the M manager's like well I see that you have an empty time block and I outrank you or even if your peers it's like what do you mean you're not going to give me that time I see that it's empty by refusing them they offend and they can incur other risks by making that you know offense and declining the invitation this often time damages the relationship and decreases the likelihood of collaboration in the future which they might need you as a maker might need the buying of that manager and so you risk losing that Goodwill by declining the invitation but
(11:30) by doing so if you accept the invitation you destroy the morning right and so option one piss someone off option two destroy half your day a very terrible proposition and the crazy part is that even if you accept that meeting often times the yield from that meeting is nothing because the person who had the do you have five minutes didn't really have an agenda didn't really have a plan and just basically said I'm just going to steal your morning from you and give you nothing back by the way this totally applies to networking stuff too if you're like hey let me ince you to John
(12:01) he's in the area you guys should meet for coffee does 10:00 a.m. work I'm like yeah let's just destroy everything right let's just light my whole day on fire so that I can meet John who you think I have synergies with maybe there's potential for collaboration let's explore opportunities together you know what's crazy I know what I need to do to make more money and I just need to do that I get asked all the time about what's the one habit that you have that has been the highest you know predictor of your success and I really genuinely
(12:35) believe that it has been this is that I have been ruthless with my time everyone who knows me knows that I am a dick with my time and the thing is is that I've been able to maintain relationships because during that maker time where I say no to everyone else I keep moving forward because I have a fundamental belief that as long as I continue to achieve and I continue to make things that are valuable for the World those meetings those connections those synergies that friend dinner will always be there and that has proven right in my life and in the beginning it was the hardest because I didn't have
(13:11) the accomplishments to show for it but I truly believed I was like I know that if I can get this stuff done and I do it every single day for a year two years three years five years if every day I move the ball forward that's the thing at the end of the month when I look back on what I actually accomplished 100% of it is stuff I accomplished during maker time not manager time and so once I realized that the maker time was where everything all the speed of me moving towards my goal was getting accomplished then I spent the rest of my time trying to optimize my life and create a system
(13:41) around this that allowed me to do as much of that as I possibly could and to be clear there are roles in the business like if you're CEO or coo from an operator perspective you're going to have more one-on ones you're going to have more team trainings you're going to have more coordination and decision-making that's required but you just have to be clear that you're not not doing your job by not having maker time it's just that your job is the manager stuff and then the maker time you have is to get more leverage on the
(14:09) remainder of your manager time and so ilila has a different schedule than I do she still has maker time but it's probably inverted in terms of her schedule for her she has probably one maker day per week and four manager days where I have four maker days per week and one manager day and so you can have an inverted schedule but the important thing is is that she has to have that makeer day because it's what gets her leverage gets her higher Returns on the other four days of the week and then for me I have to still do that manager day
(14:40) because it gives me leverage on all the organizational decisions that have to happen throughout the whole portfolio you have to get out of the either or thinking and think which of these Styles is best for me in this particular moment but I can promise you that you do have elements of both when most people have elements of neither which is why they never move forward so I think I've accurately described the problem here makers and managers work differently these guys want empty calendars these guys want filled calendars when they interact one person destroys the other person time and it's a disproportionate
(15:09) trade and when things get bad they get even worse because the managers interrupt the makers even more and the makers trying to be polite because they don't want to turn down invitations just make their lives worse and worse and they have to work longer and longer hours lose sleep lose family time lose their weekend so that they can just keep up with their work without pissing anyone off and so let's talk about a different way way to do this so I use something called a three-pronged approach for the solutions and that's because you have to address it from all
(15:36) angles it's not just saying hey makers deal with it hey managers do something different hey organizations you have to attack it from all three directions you've got the managers you've got what the makers should do differently and then you've got the organization overall so you've got all three of these parties that you have to accommodate to the managers step one under understand both the costs that you put on the maker the first cost is the cost of coordinating times while they work so they're trying to work right now
(16:08) before you coordinate the time that you're also going to disrupt them so you disrupt them while they're working and then you disrupt them at the meeting that you're trying to plan so you disrupt them twice secondly and once you have that time set aside understand that the time itself eats an entire work block itself and you have to know the difference between your work and the Maker's work and when you ask for a meeting it costs them 10 times more you use up one of their 10 time slots per week whereas you use up only one of your hundred or more time slots so when you choose to make an
(16:40) appointment or choose to make a meeting be sure that it's worth it especially if it's an ad hoc or impromptu if you have a set Cadence of communication if it can wait until that time and you got to be really real with yourself can it wait is this just a convenience thing for me or a preference if it is then don't destroy the poor man or poor woman's time step two understand the value of the makers no and this is something that I hopefully becomes incorporate in your Lexicon at your business is that this is a maker's no not a not a real world no it's a maker's no is that if a maker
(17:13) declines a meeting don't take offense see it as them actually trying to keep their larger commitment to you the company and other people to get the meaningful work they need to get done done and so this means you don't get offended this means you don't you know hold back the the promotion or say that they're not being productive because they keep turning down meetings if someone turns down the meeting it's because they're doing something that they can accurately say this is more important than that now if you as a manager say I know that you have this is going to destroy the morning in terms of
(17:42) your productivity but I think it is worth your time to be on this because we need your Insight then you can frame it that way and then you can give the maker the time to prep for that meeting if it is literally of that importance step three for managers is actually ask your team what an ideal day would look like for them like what's a maximum productive day look like like and allow them the time to give you the response and I suggest following that to the greatest degree possible so that you can actually help them be the most productive and so for example for us uh
(18:10) our media team leaders asked the editing team underneath of them hey what's the perfect day for you guys what's a perfect weekly calendar look like and as a team they were like well if we could just Bunch all the meetings here and we could have all the rest of the days free that would be awesome and then if we had it was like okay well how do what about when we coordinate it's okay well we'll have specific coordination times that we keep four brainstorming sessions and things like that but beyond that we keep
(18:33) everyone's calendars empty and so that way as a team you as a as a manager also can have fewer meetings so that you can fill out with other meetings that aren't makers right so you can do more leading more directing more encouraging more persuading more training and then let the makers make and we've also realized and I think you will break your own belief around this as soon as you start doing this that a lot of work doesn't have to be done at the same time everyone doesn't need to work on the same thing at the same moment to get the most done as long as everything gets done by this period of time now this
(19:03) video isn't the protect the makers video this is for all businesses and all business owners so let's talk to the makers now step one good managers want to help you so let them tell them how you work this is you communicating to them send this piece of content to them to help them help you and yes you will have to take meetings that eat your entire day sometimes it's part of the job you have have to work with other people because your project would never see the light of day without marketing marketing it sales selling it product delivering it
(19:36) and everything else that happens in between it's a team and so if your manager is going to choose to put a Time Block in the middle of your morning or the middle of your afternoon then switch that whole block into a manager schedule Fight Fire with Fire and try to knock out as many meetings as you can in that formally free time so that means that okay if I know that I'm going to have this one time slot that's killed my big chunk well then let's slice that baby into as many chunks as I can and get all the other ad hoc impromptu meetings done that morning so that I now switch to a
(20:06) maximally productive manager and so the thing is is that you don't want to identify as one or the other you just want your calendar to reflect the nature of the work and so the point here isn't to have two camps of makers and managers is to understand what type of productivity system you're installing for that period of time on your calendar because especially if you're an entrepreneur you've got to wear both step two for makers have standard meeting times where you accept meetings so you say Hey you know Monday and uh
(20:37) Thursday afternoons is when I have all of my meeting times open so whenever someone requests a meeting ask them if they can make it in those times and this is where when you get into the organization if everyone has those times then everyone's on maker schedules for those time blocks and then it becomes more efficient at an organizational level which I'll get to in a second it's rare that a meeting is truly urgent so if you can push them off to those designated blocks that you said ahead of time you will make a lot more money with the time that you have remaining and you
(21:03) want to make this time available to anyone who meets with you on a regular basis and add some empty time slots or leave some empty time slots in that maker meetings for the ad hoc meetings that inevitably come up I would say I've gone through three distinct periods of understanding this maker manager concept and using it to great success the first one is you basically have to do nights and weekends uh in Early Mornings in order to get your maker time in but you have to do it and so when I was doing this as a gym owner so a small business owner I would wake up and I would like
(21:32) work on ad copy and work on ads which was like deep work that I'd have to do and then I'd step into the gym at 9:00 a.m. and start taking sales calls or uh take training sessions or have to have one on- ones with my trainers like I worked like a regular person with fires and people interrupting me all day because I was running a small business and so if you need to make sure that that maker work gets done then you need to find one block that's usually at the very beginning of the day or the very end of the day if you're the entrepreneur and no one cares about your time in the beginning if I had not done
(22:03) that I don't think I ever would have gotten out of one location I would never have been able to build the systems that it takes like how do you build the training system to get trainers on you do it in maker time how do you build the nutrition system that you're going to use for your whole location you do it during maker time how you going to run an advertising system for creating ads and writing copy on a regular basis you do that during maker time not during manager time and so to build the assets that I could build the business on top of to build the Enterprise I had to do
(22:28) that in uninterrupted time chunks and the problem was everybody want to interrupt my time and to be fair they could because I didn't have my my time wasn't super valuable in the beginning over time you'll begin to have people who can start protecting your time for you so for a big chunk of my career as I started to make more and more money the first half of every day until noon or 1 p.m.
(22:49) was always wide open because I do my best work in the morning and then once I've kind of used up my Creative Juice I can do the coordination and meetings and things like that now I'll give you a second Pro tip on this which is if that is the way that you want to plan your calendar let's call yourself an intermediate entrepreneur start planning your day back to front so what I mean by that is someone wants a meeting you start at it ends at 5: and starts at 4: if someone else wants a meeting then you say it ends at it ends at 4 and starts at 3:30 and you work your calendar from Back to Front that
(23:19) way your front of the day is still the most open you possibly can have it now you still suffer from the quote zernick effect but you still have a very large chunk of uninterrupted time and by doing it this way you avoid those empty dead times where you're like great I have 45 minutes between two meetings like what am I going to do now and you're like I guess I'll just have a snack so if you have less means then you work double time you work on your client's time and then you do your work in off hours so
(23:43) like I was saying in my early days by doing that morning five days a week and then I would work both shifts on the weekends I would get four on the weekends I get a morning and an afternoon on Saturday and Sunday that I can put maker time in and then I get five blocks during the week and so this still gave me nine makers blocks per week to move Big Stuff forward that's a full-time job but the key here if you're noticing is that yes you work double because you have to work the job that you're currently doing to make money and then you work the next job to get out of the job you're in so the V1 of this is
(24:14) you have to make maker time the V2 of this is I I think is the 50/50 split the first half of your day is maker the second half of your day is manager and you work from Back to Front that's the V2 version the V3 version which is what I do currently right now is that I have entire maker days so I have two three four days per week that are just maker days and then I have a manager day where I stack the hell out of my meetings introductions you know coordinations decisions quarterly meetings with portfolio companies all of that type of stuff happens on those days back toback
(24:45) so I don't feel unproductive at the end of the day because I know going into it I'm not going to do any maker work I'm just going to crush as many meetings as I can step three communicate about how you're going to communicate tell people when you're going to be slow to respond specifically during your maker box so people have an amazing ability to adapt if you tell them ahead of time people really only get upset when you have unmet expectations they expect you to respond immediately and then you don't and then they question if you're working when the reality is that's why you're working is the fact that you're not
(25:14) responding so change them so let everyone know that this is how you work and this is when you're going to be responsive and if you do have that time period where you say you're going to be responsive then be responsive which leads to step four actually work when you say you will if you if you have the luxury of having people who respect your time and respect your schedule and understand this maker manager Dynamic then you owe it to them as a maker to not waste your time because if you don't you will confirm their suspicions this whole time that you've been goofing off
(25:43) all day because you're not actually working and that's what the vast majority of managers think when they look at your calendar and see that it's empty is that you're not actually doing anything and what you don't want to do is prove them right so I covered what you have to think about as a manager right you want to understand this lingo you want understand how makers work and you want to tryy and respect that and Empower them to the greatest degree possible as a maker you also want to understand that you work within an
(26:06) organization there are times that you're going to have to take meetings if you do take meetings you want to block that time and then Crush as many meetings as you possibly can be responsive when you say you're going to be responsive and then work like a madman during the times that you actually have empty time slots on your calendar great so we have both of those covered but how do we install this into an organization so that we can make this Canon so that we can make this standard and this is what I'm hoping across many organizations so if I can
(26:28) use my platform to like help businesses make more money and help people actually enjoy their work more than like can't think of a higher return on my time than doing that across thousands and thousands of businesses so as an organization and this is if you're the entrepreneur who can make those decisions step one consider mandated quiet time on the calendar so during these times entire teams can't message one another or meet and so either make this a a a time of day every day or make this entire days
(27:00) of the week so for example for us Wednesdays are quiet days for the editing team like no one talks there are no meetings they can just crank on one or two big projects they want to work on throughout that day and I want to be very clear on this caveat it doesn't need to apply to the entire organization only the ones where you have makers so think Engineers developers copywriters editors Builders writers presenters media whatever the people who have to work on projects that require intense periods of time without interruption the reason I I think this is more important now than ever is because of remote work
(27:32) remote work has removed the transparency between someone working and so I could walk I can walk around my office now and walk past the editing Bas and see people plugged in working on their computers editing so I know they're editing even though their time block is empty if I just check their calendar but in a remote setting if I look at someone's calendar and see it's empty but I have no way to check in on them or see them then I don't know if they're actually working or if they're just like rock climbing and so I have no way to know that then you think okay well I'll just slack them but by doing the slack
(28:03) message you then disrupt them anyways and if they're super responsive on slack you feel like they're working when the likelihood is that if they're really responsive on slack they're not working cuz they're on slack and so the real real is that if you're remote or the teams that you have that are doing making a remote you have to have an element of trust and you still need to measure on output so you can give I would say basically extend longer periods of trust where you say hey we have this big project this is the deadline for that project and then you want to remove as many obstacles as you possibly can to allow that person to
(28:32) work and let's also be real there have been days where I wake up and I'm like I don't have it in me like wherever the magic is or the Muse didn't show up to work today sometimes if you're a if you're a maker then maybe see if you can get meetings on that day because you're like dude my brain's dead like I don't think I'm going to I'm going to create anything today but there are some days where I wake up and I feel like the the touch of God is upon me and I'm like oh my God I think I actually can cure cancer today and when that happens then
(28:56) sometimes it's worth changing the meetings and saying hey man I'm in the middle of something right now and I'm crushing it is there any way we can just meet later you know what's crazy most people when they get that message are like sure no problem it wasn't urgent anyways and sometimes they're like you know what we don't even need to reschedule the meeting I actually handled it already and so I would strongly encourage you as a maker to kind of keep a pulse on yourself and also managers to extend the time trust where you allow makers to make now if
(29:23) they do not meet the deadlines and they are not meeting the output then you need to be very clear about this is the trust that extending to you so what is the reason that you have for not getting this done and real real a lot of times you actually have to dig into their personal lives cuz that's usually the mess anyways as an entrepreneur you're often going to have times where you're a maker and a times where you're a manager and being clear to your team about Which hat you're wearing so I literally say
(29:46) hey I'm putting my maker hat on today hey manager hat before I step into something and that gives me and them a mental cue to know how I'm operating for that day and kind of the Rules of Engagement and by doing it that way it sets it's it sets all the expectations with one thing one change of hat rather than me have to re-explain the rules every time all right before the last and most important point for organizations let me show you my calendar and walk you through it so this is an actual time uh block I think today is the 31st of May
(30:16) um as we're actually recording this and so this is my this is my actual calendar and so you'll notice that we had uh we had Labor Day weekend right so Monday um I actually took off on Monday um so this was a short week but Wednesday Thursday Friday I have nothing on here except for maker time so you recording for me is maker time like I'm making these videos I can't do this and then take a meeting and then come back and make this video right like I have to stay in it until it's done and so this whole day all
(30:41) three of these days are just straight up empty and you can see I have a gym meeting with myself uh in the afternoon so I can get swole so I was telling you that on Wednesdays we have our quiet day for editors but it's actually organization wide and we just separated people into are you a maker are you a manager and so if you're a manager you deal with lots of time slots and this just doesn't apply to you but for everyone else in the organization which everyone else has transparency into all of Wednesday is an acquisition. comom quiet day and the reason that we put it on Wednesday was that way if you think
(31:10) about how the week works out it's like you have two quiet days on the weekend no matter what and then you have two days that could potentially get interrupted with another day in between so basically the longest amount of time that you have to wait is two days before you can have a guaranteed quiet day now you'll notice that Tuesday basically functioned as my Monday for this week I had a team meeting with my whole company I had a one1 with my head of investment he's the one who runs our deals I had my executive meeting uh which is just uh
(31:35) all the leaders in my company at acquisition. comom I had a oneon-one with my book manager I had um meeting with our Workshop manager because uh we wanted to touch base and after that meeting I said let's not have this meeting anymore immediately after the meeting so to be clear like I try to always audit like do I need to do this again or is there a processor a person who can do this instead of me and most times there is a processor person after after that I had my school games Q&A so I had once a week I take a call with the school games and notice I do these calls that I have with customers on my meeting
(32:06) day because it's still an interruption and it to me it feels the same it's like I hop on I'm asking questions I'm answering questions I'm directing I'm doing whatever then I had my marketing meeting for our internal marketing stuff and that was it I had a hair trim and then I had my gym all right and so you'll be like wait that's it I just saw Alex's whole week that's all the meetings he takes and the answer is yes now I think what might be more important than the things that you saw or the things that you didn't see and so there's meetings that happen all the
(32:34) time with the leadership with my team and portfolio companies with you know my media buyer and their media buyer my you know uh portfolio operating partner and the CEOs of the companies that we own right all of those meetings you'll note none of them were on my calendar at some point I see the entrepreneurial Journey as a relinquishing of control and at every level of Entrepreneurship you need to learn a new level of giving up control and so it's interesting is that when we get into entrepreneurship we do it because we want freedom but as soon as we do it to get Freedom we actually have absolute control over everything
(33:05) because you have control of you're a solo preneur now like you have no team it's just you but when you have control over everything you actually don't have freedom so you cannot have both absolute control and absolute freedom at the same time and so if you want freedom you have to relinquish control you have to extend trust to people now those trusts can have guard rails and you can still have outputs that you measure people on and then you basically tighten up the Reigns if things don't go to plan but as as
(33:27) long as people are doing their job and meeting the outputs then you can continue to kind of extend the leash I don't really like the terminology but you get the idea and so at the end of every one of these meetings I'm telling you like if you could just put a little reminder to yourself those do I need to do this again a like does this meeting even need to occur again and secondarily is there somebody else or a system we can put in place to eliminate this all together Lila and I she's even better about this because she has more meetings as an operator than I do um every single week she starts her week by looking at
(33:57) all of her meetings and deletes she deletes first and then on a quarterly basis she looks at all recurring meetings and says how do I how can I change the time that's being allocated across the whole company so she sees everyone's calendars and everyone's meetings she does some Rainman stuff where she says I don't think we need to do this anymore I think we can combine these two I think you don't need to attend the and she tells people I don't think you need to attend this anymore I don't think you need to attend this and I think that's where a culture of
(34:21) meetings don't make you productive is a very important subline here for organizations in general and you'll notice this with Elon Musk and basos and some of these these great entrepreneurs they talk about this where they want to standardize like hey you can get up in the middle of meeting and say hey I've just got stuff I need to do and I don't think I'm relevant here or I don't think I'm adding value that's you returning time to the company because this is the thing that everyone forgets is that let's say let's say uh you make $50,000
(34:47) a year that means that you make around $25 per hour in general and so if you have and let's say you've got some people are making $100,000 a year on the meeting so that's $50 per hour that means that if you have 10 people on that on a on a on a one-h hour call it's like that was a $500 call or a $400 call now if we took the whole team out to Chili's and we spent $400 on drinks and chips and whatever it'd be considered a major expense right but every day all the time you're taking the whole team out to chilies 10 times a day this is why people stay poor because they don't know how to allocate time to
(35:27) get the highest return so let's walk through the last step for organizations to make this real to get the most out of everyone spread this content to Makers and managers alike so that everyone can use the same language to describe this larger source of waste and prevent it because if you are working with a maker manager schedule where everyone understands where people can get the highest returns in their time and your comp competition is not working this way you will get higher returns Returns on human capital on the time you invest in people because they will be happier they will stay longer
(36:03) they will have higher output and the quality of their work will go up so you'll both get higher quantity of work and higher quality of work both by changing how you allocate time and try and actively remove as many makers as possible from meetings and also managers don't need to be there and my goal with this video is to increase the awareness of these two types of working Styles and put words to something that plagued me for a very long time and so if you're listening to this and you're like this is music to my ears this is what I've been trying to describe for such a long time and I have been able to put words
(36:34) to it I made this for you so that I could put words to something that hopefully everyone else can use and distribute at a bargain on time is that you don't have to worry about making this thing you can just send it so that people can understand it for you and hopefully this gives words to the makers whose work moves the world and helps managers understand how expensive got a minute really is

(00:00) to go to college or not go to college that is the question in the game of life and I'm going to show you the data so that you can make your own decision and at the very end I'll give you my honest advice and so let's talk about playing the game of one of zero every time I make a point for college I'm going to move my college graduate forward one point and every time I make a point for my non- college graduate I'll move him forward in his career one point let's see who wins in the end this chart shows you how much the cost of
(00:35) going to college has gone up compared to the starting salaries now you might be like wow okay there is a big difference here to put this tuition increase in context this has doubled in just the last few decades whereas the median starting salary has more or less stayed the same so you pay twice as much for the same thing let me show you what the result of this has been this is national student loan debt and you're like oh it's measured in dollarss that's in trillions 1.
(01:09) 76 trillion is more GDP than every country in the world besides maybe the top 10 so that means that our College days kids young adults are taking on more debt than entire nations produce and so at some point you have to think are they going to be able to make that up and if you're a parent or loving relative that a young person who's making this decision is sent to I want to talk to you specifically I went to Vanderbilt which is a very good school right now I think it's ranked 13 that's tied with brown as a pseudo ivu League school I graduated in three years magnet
(01:38) klow I was president of my fraternity I was vice president of the powerlifting team and I did it in three then I went into a white collar job management consulting for two years and then while I was at that job I studied very hard and got above Harvard Business school's GMAT midore and so that was my plan until I started thinking a little bit more for myself about wait does the math really make sense here fast forward a decade I now want a portfolio of companies that does over $200 million a year and I make these videos so that
(02:04) hopefully younger people or just people at different stages in their career can make better picks and so that's my formal education side my informal education side is that I quit my white collar job started at minimum wage at a gym where I paid a guy to let me work for him and follow him around all day then I got into the gym business scaled that to 5,000 locations in the US and there a company called gym launch and I sold that to private Equity Group for 46.
(02:30) 2 million I now own a portfolio of companies that has over a thousand employees and so I know what businesses today are actually looking for and it's not what I used to think and maybe what you used to think years ago which is no one even looks at where you went to school or what you majored in or even what your GPA was all we care about is your experience and the likelihood that you can do the job well and many of the jobs that are available today there is no school for because the school degrees and the things that they taught have nothing to do with how much
(02:56) the economy has changed and I know you care a lot about whoever you're helping make this decision I I want you to know I care just as much and I don't benefit from either of these decisions that they choose to make except for maybe if they do something that adds benefit to the workforce they might eventually work at one of my companies but that's really it and so I make this as even-handedly as I can because I benefited from both sides and here's one of the worst Parts about this debt number one is that the
(03:19) interest rates are high and number two is that you literally can't bankrupt out of it meaning once you do this you're stuck paying it for the rest of your life I think that's one point for not going to college now what do you actually get when you pay for college this is the median lifetime earnings by education level meaning if you stop at this level of Education this is how much you can expect to make over the rest of your career and so if you don't graduate high school you make less than a million dollars for the rest of your life that's
(03:50) the median the middle person in the range now if you do finish with a high school diploma about 30% better 1.3 million if you have some college so you go and make maybe you drop out 1.5 a little better bachelor's degree 2.2 million all right now we're more than double our high school diploma master's degree 2.6 doctoral 3.
(04:13) 2 and then professional degree 3.6 million now that's how much you make over the rest of your life I would say that that's a strong point for education so let's move our graduate up one point now we see this really high increase in income but it's not not free so remember this slide that I showed you earlier the debt that you take on for student loans you cannot bankrupt out of which means that until you die you have to pay it back and they force you to make that decision when you're 18 years old and you've never made a dollar in your life nor can you
(04:46) comprehend the scope of what $250,000 of after tax income is and the interest rates that you're paying when you make a $250,000 loan out you're not paying back $250,000 you're paying back $400 $500,000 in post tax money over the span of your career and so that leads naturally to like okay well how is that going to affect the rest of your life well look at how earnings actually increase over time and so this is important when you look at your actual life you're going to be saddled with relatively large payments for a long
(05:22) period of time and so you can actually start catching up in your late 30s and early 40s where earnings begin to spike when are you starting a family when are you getting married when are you buying your first home if that's what you want to do all here and yet you're still saddled with that debt that you cannot get out of and you have very high interest on to me that's a very strong point for not going now the median incomes that I showed you earlier that's over your lifetime but those don't all happen at once and often times earning
(05:54) power and income happen later on in your career and the higher your degree the longer it takes to actually get there and so you can see some of these bottom rungs more or less stay flat that whole time whereas some of these other ones that you have to pay for takes longer in order to earn back so by the time you're late 30s early 40 you might be making more money but you also have the drag of the debt and the payments and the interest that you have to carry with you in the tune of a few hundred, extra does this differential after tax after
(06:26) lifestyle and family and house does it make up the difference you might think wow then I should not go to college well the odds are against you in terms of earning income let's dive in this line represents bachelor's degree median lifetime earnings We compare this visually with each of the other levels of education so you have a 7.
(06:49) 3% chance of making more than somebody with a bachelor's degree if you don't graduate high school the odds aren't in your favor not to say that you watching this who's investing in yourself trying to get educated you're not that 7.3% cuz you very well might be but statistically you've got a 1 in 12 shot of just beating someone who went to college now if you do graduate you double your likelihood of beating that person you go to one in six if you get some college one in four if you get an associates one in four is now let's go to Masters you
(07:21) have a 6 out of 10 shot of making more money than somebody who just has a bachelor's if you get a doctoral 7 out of 10 and then finally a Prof professional 83% or 8 out of 10 shot of actually making more money when you do have more skills you do make more money the question Still Remains is it worth it but in my mind this is a clear argument for more formal education one point College all the while you're thinking through this decision you need to use Warren Buffett's investment question which is the difference between
(07:53) what you pay and what you get so if someone says Hey I want to give you this Ferrari you might think well obviously I want to do that well for what price now if they say for $10,000 that's a great deal if they say for a million do you might be like that's a terrible deal and so it's not about necessarily whether getting more education makes more money or not it's just is it worth what it costs if I said hey I can get you to make $200,000 a year you might say of course I'm in but if I said in order to make that $200,000 a year you need to
(08:27) pay me $7,000 for the rest of your life okay okay well all of a sudden the amount I'm making is significantly less than that and so you can't take how much you make without considering how much it costs I think an important point to make here is that these are percentages but it also shows that 27% of people who have a doctoral degree still don't make more than people with a bachelor's degree all that to say these aren't guarantees the way that they are purported to be and a lot of college money goes into advertising that this is
(08:57) the guaranteed way of moving moving forward in life but looking at these stats if you're that one of those five people or one of those three people that's below you literally got none of the upside and all of the downside so why is there such a disparity between these earning levels well it also depends what industry you want to get into so for example if you want to get into personal services Blue Collar health support sales and office the higher education doesn't make nearly as much of a difference on the flip side if
(09:29) you want to get into science technology you want to get into health professional so we're talking doctors uh managerial and professional then it does make a bigger difference and so part of making this decision is well what do I want to do when I grow up so if you think that you want to go into a very formal career path you want to be an accountant you want to be a lawyer you want to be a doctor then it might make a lot more sense for you but if you want to be a salesperson you want to be a marketer do you want to do any blue collar job any
(09:57) kind of Home Services things like that then it probably doesn't make sense for you and so in my mind that's one point for both sides so one of the questions I would be asking is okay well if one out of eight people who has a high school degree can beat somebody who has a college degree over their median earnings then I'd be like what makes that one person special we actually pulled up a great research study that looked at that exact question which is how many of these people would have been successful who went to college already
(10:29) on their own without going to college one of the big skews of college is that people who go to college in general have more money come from higher socioeconomic families Etc well if those people had just gone out on their own and gone into the professional world would they have just made the same amount of money the results might interest you if you are a white person or an Asian person you have no value ad from college if you control for SAT score socioeconomic status and other factors that would differentiate people
(11:01) on the flip side if you are Latino or you are black college does have a significant 30 to 40% increase in median earnings the results like life are a little bit nuanced it depends on who you are now I could make an argument or you might say hey Alex was going to win either way but what some of you guys don't know is I went to Vanderbilt and I graduated magn kumlu that being said everything that I do in my life today I didn't learn in college and so the question is what is it worth the money the other question is if IID started 4
(11:32) years earlier would I be further than I am today so one of the most interesting statistics I've come across is that there's one metric above all others that predicts your earning income better than anything you want to know what it is it's not your race it's not your gender not your IQ think how crazy that is it's not even your IQ it's the zip code you were born in my theory on the reason of why that is and the differential between races is that when you go to college you can figuratively change your ZIP code
(11:59) because you change your environment and the people you know and more importantly the people you compare yourself to poor people can feel rich if they compare themselves to other poor people but as soon as you get into a room where everyone makes 10 times more money than you all of a sudden you feel like the poor person and what do you do you change your behavior College may add value to people who didn't already get that value given to them interesting which makes a strong argument for being the first person in your family to go to
(12:27) college because then it actually changes the trajectory of your Offspring and your Prodigy and your family tree if you're not the first person it makes a lot less of a difference and so the thing that gets a lot of people to win at college is the same thing that gets you to win at business and life and so the question is is the college really necessary if you have those characteristics already in order to get in like if you got a high enough SAT score to get into an IV League school like Harvard Stanford Yale then you
(12:58) probably are smarter enough to do the other things without going to Harvard Stanford and Neale and still make money as a side note personally I got above Harvard's GMAT score for business school I haven't gone to Harvard Business School but I've done pretty good in business kind of interesting if I were to go to Harvard Business School and then make money afterwards was it Harvard or was it may and I actually faced this decision when I was thinking about going to Harvard and I thought to myself well do I want to not make money
(13:26) for 2 years and incur $250,000 of debt and when I did the dollar and cents for me going to business school I thought man why don't I take the $250,000 and just start a business and I'll bet that by the end of those two years I'll have learned more than I did in business school and I'll graduate The Game of Life two years ahead and making more than the median income of somebody who went to business school and that ended up being true and so if you want to get into anything that doesn't have a formal degree required in order to make
(13:58) that money then it doesn't make sense and that's one point for the career so one of the big things that Pro col Advocates talk about is the network that you meet when you're in college and how much that Alumni network can benefit you getting a job doing a deal or whatever it may be in the future and I will put two strong caveats on that claim number one is do I think that for $50,000 a year I could buy into whatever Network I want to be if people making significantly more money than me with skills that I'd like to learn for
(14:31) $50,000 every single year for four straight years to me that answer is mood or even more in favor of just going the career and if you want to buy a network then buy a network to me that's an argument for not going to college if we're trying to control for the same money now one of the other points that's Pro college that is often made is what about the social experiences you have the once in A- lifetime opportunity to be around all people only your age potentially meet the love of your life party have lots of fun get dressed up in
(15:03) toas learn how to beer bong and all of that stuff for $50,000 a year $1,000 a week you could party your absolute face off and make friends with all of these people in that same period of time now I would say though it is more difficult to meet that many people your age in a professional career than it is to do it at college and I would say that if you're looking purely from a fund basis I'm not going to say real world's going to beat College now can you get close with $11,000 a week you go to Vegas it'll show you a
(15:33) hell of a time but I would still argue that from a social perspective those four years would be more fun the question is what you're optimizing for now if you want to say I just want to go to a resort for 4 years I totally understand but understand that that's what you're choosing to buy but if that is what you want then I would say that the social aspect is a pro for college now one of the things worse discussing is can you get the upside for free now if you have FAA and you qualify for it mean you can get financial aid or you
(16:00) can get grants or you get a merit-based scholarship for sports or for scholarship that makes a real difference because now you're getting all the upside without having the downside and if you live within these 24 States you can actually get a bachelor's degree whereas the other 26 states in the union don't actually offer that and if you can go to college for a bargain then that might be a great deal and that would be one point for college I do think that there are some full price colleges that even if you had to take loans it would
(16:28) make sense to go to if you get into Harvard or you get into Princeton or you get into Stanford or Yale or one of the Ivy League schools a top 20 school in the United States that everyone recognizes the name I would say that for how much that will impact your personal brand that is worth it because one every single time you walk into a room people be like oh yeah he went to Harvard or he went to Yale and that will immediately shift their perception of you and the types of jobs and how quickly you can progress in your career
(16:57) the second factor is that the people who go from those colleges become the ruling class they rule the world they go to the highest paying jobs the people who graduate from those schools their median income I don't know what it is but many of them are in the tens to 20s to 50s of millions of dollars per year and so in those instances if you can get in there then the Arbitrage of what you pay versus what you get is still a great deal now let's look at the lifetime earnings with a little bit more Nuance because this is across all degrees in
(17:29) all schools but I think we can both agree that all degrees are not created equal if somebody says hey I have a PhD from State you versus I have a PhD from Harvard you could probably bet that that Harvard PhD is going to be going to top firms move faster and ultimately just make more money over the long term they can also network with other Harvard phds who get into those great places whereas that might not be as prevalent and so the 75th percentile at Harvard for a bachelor's degree might might be not 3 million but it might be 6 or 10 or 15
(18:02) million and so in that instance it does make sense and as much as you're like man this is a more complex decision yeah many variables exist and many variables must be studied Welcome to the Real World because the ruling class are so scrutinized for having advantages there are such generous endowments for those IV League schools that most people who don't come from the ruling class can get significant financial aid for going there making the trade even more worth it so if we look at the scoreboard between college and not College we're
(18:34) dead even and so let me just give you my honest opinion right now so I'm looking down at my life four years in the future and I see college and I see career me which one do I choose so if I started going down the college path if I come from a wealthier family then I don't get the benefits of college and I incur the debt so that might not make sense on the flip side if I am less fortunate or coming from a less fortunate family socioeconomically then I do get a better benefit from college and I will likely get some sort of financial aid
(19:07) increasing the difference between what I pay and what I get and I have a new network so my ZIP code improves that might make a lot of sense for me if I'm super well off then I already have the benefits of going to college and I might as well start my career with those benefits already not incur debt and make four years more income and four years further in my career path provided I don't want to do science technology doctor lawyer accountant stuff if I'm lower socioeconomic status then I might not have the same benefit and I might
(19:43) find myself in the bottom part of that Circle that represents the statistics not to say that you're not the one of eight people who can earn more it's just less likely so given those variables where do we go from here if I came from a a lower educated lower socioeconomic family and get financial aid significantly I would say 50% or more of that tuition I would say go to college you pay less for what you get and you get more than anyone else does on the flip side and this is counterintuitive if you already come from a highly
(20:17) educated family and you have higher socioeconomic status and you're not going to get favorable financial terms for paying for school it makes less sense for you to go the counterintuitive thing here is that the rich families the better off families are the ones that encourage their kids to go to college the most I would even say they encourage them they expect it they demand it it's assumed it's the default choice this box is already checked for them at Birth if you get no benefit from college and it cost you money and four years of
(20:48) otherwise Career Development then you shouldn't do it the big caveat off the top is if you want to go into one of those careers that requires a degree it requires a degree it it is what it is but I will say this if you don't have a plan for what you want to do with your life don't expect that $200,000 in four years is somehow going to give you a plan you just need to confront the fact that right when you graduate you're still going to be looking at life with all the directions coming from your feet and being like well what should I do now
(21:18) because I can promise you even if you fell in love with a class there's no career path that's the class and so it doesn't even mean anything to get good to that and so once you get into the real world you're like well I loved biology well unless you're going to be a scientist or you're going to be a physician you're probably going to go into HR it makes way more sense to actually learn what the Departments of a business are and what those roles entail on a day-to-day basis and think well these are the types of things I like if
(21:46) I like talking to people I could be a recruiter for a company if I like talking to people I could be in sales at somebody who employs almost a thousand people now between our portfolio companies we don't care at all what someone's degree is you know what we do care about experience so if I had a 4-year college graduate who comes out with a Philosophy degree and I've got somebody who's been in sales for four years and didn't have a degree and they're the same age who do you think I'm picking for the sales job
(22:10) the guy who's been in sales for four years if I were deciding between going to college and not going to college this is what I'd be thinking about now if you're not going to college and you've made that decision let's talk about how to actually maximize that path number one is that you are still prioritizing education you're just not prioritizing formal education so you should absolutely take money take time and spend the majority of your day trying to learn if you play video games all day and you just watch Netflix and you smoke
(22:35) weed in your parents basement you're going to be the seven out of eight who lose but if you are the type of person who can work all day and work on themselves and get experience in the real world then you can learn at your job all day get paid to learn take that money spend it on learning more in the evenings and 4 years from now you will be so much better equipped than anybody who has graduated four years in a formal degree who just knows how to shotgun a beer really fast I will tell you how I've learned everything outside of
(23:06) school I pay people who already have the skill by the hour to learn now if I can't afford them I will see if I can buy a course or a book or watch their videos or whatever it is but if they don't have any of that stuff and you're just saying man I really want to learn how to do storage units from this guy well then you can ask to pay for 1 hour a week to learn what to do and I can promise you entrepreneur and people who have skills are always happy to help people who take initiative there's nothing that fills someone's heart more
(23:35) speaking from personal experience of somebody who asks you for advice and then executes on it and as long as you do that you will have more help than you know what to do with start one or two steps ahead of where you're at pay to learn the skills and then take one or two steps whether you're taking this path or you're taking this path you have to choose to invest in your ability to learn so that you can earn in the future more than you are everything that you make in the first four years of your career is not what you're trying to get
(24:02) rich on it's what you're trying to get smart on and the fact that you get paid for it is just bonus so don't get your ego caught up in the fact that you're making $30,000 a year or $40,000 a year or minimum wage I started at minimum wage after having a white collar job for two years and getting above Harvard's mid score and so you have to take a slice of Humble Pie to realize that I might have been really good as a Management Consultant but I didn't know [ __ ] about running a gym and so not coming in pretending like you know
(24:27) something that you don't and being willing to accept the fact that someone who might be less educated or less polished than you still knows more now if you get into the IV League school then by all means like I said go but if you don't get into one of those schools and you're just into the the middle of the pack that costs too much and doesn't give you anything extra then I think that you need to pull up to the table put the napkin in your collar and take a slice of Humble Pie and realize that you don't know everything and you have to be
(24:54) willing to suck and you also have to be willing to be doubted by your family because they probably won't agree with this decision because they're going to think well this worked for me my life is great and I want the same for you but remember they're doing this out of love for you because they want you to win but you just have to explain to them I want me to win too and I think times have changed when they came out hierarchy and tenure mattered a ton and pedigree whereas today because everyone has equal access to information for free on the
(25:23) internet and you can learn more on YouTube than you can from most colleges you don't need what once was required so big picture you don't need to stress you're going to win either way if you're a winner this will probably just get you there faster with less debt on the flip side if you are born in a bad zip code you have a family that the majority of them has not gone to school or any kind of formal education and you don't saddle your family or yourself with debt in order to go to school it almost always makes sense to go to school because all
(25:52) you're doing is you're getting a different network of people you will then change the trajectory of your progeny your family tree that comes after you and all you do is you start 4 years later and again you have all the earning potential benefits of going and getting a bachelor's degree but without all the costs and you got a real value ad from college whereas somebody who started with an advantage doesn't and so in that sense it absolutely does make sense to do that I'm going to as many credits as I can and I'm doing that so I
(26:18) can meet as many people as humanly possible all right so that's where you sign for the Social Clubs sign up for the sororities and fraternities go to all the things that you can your Lux surface area will increase with the amount of people that you expose yourself to and will also introduce you to a lot of diversity of opinion and if you're going to college cuz we want to change your environment and change what you compare yourself to then the best thing to do is get exposed to a lot of different things and if you find
(26:43) yourself in a position where you have a hard time not partying as much not to say that you can't party have fun but if you're slacking at school you're paying to go to school it is your job to learn and you need to treat it like that you're paying not even getting paid you're paying $1,000 a week to get educated and you're going to have to make up that ,000 later on with interest and so you better [ __ ] learn something while you're there and so the idea of the fifth year senior and taking 12 credits a semester the bare minimum
(27:17) required to be a full-time student what a joke take 18 take 21 credits and do it in four years you can gra graduate with a double degree I just graduated in three I cut a year off right if you can go to summer school you can also save money and you can still get the same benefits and so you can graduate in 2 years or 3 years if you absolutely hustle your ass off because you are a professional student act like one the tldr is in either of these paths you are choosing to learn not earn the money goes in different directions but that is
(27:49) the objective and in both of these career paths objective number one is being a professional and you're either being a professional student or you're being being a professional student that just happens to get paid for it but in either situation learning comes above everything else the side benefits are that you'll meet a few more people and your party a little harder the side benefits here that you're not going to go in debt and you're going to get paid to do it I want you to know that I am more impartial than probably anyone else
(28:15) in your life and I say that because I don't know I don't know you and I don't know anyone else in your life now they will get status based on their friend group who are older might not understand stuff like this video and so they want you to do that because one it probably comes from a good place but two because they're afraid of their downside of what if you become a failure but by the way you can become a failure if you go to college too so the one thing that you can do to guarantee this is that you have to decide for yourself number one
(28:38) and number two is that either of these paths is education and you have to understand that you're not getting into the workforce to go make money you're getting into the workforce to learn better more relevant skills and just happen to get paid for it as long as you keep that clear and that you're going to stay disciplined about it because you're not going to be more necessarily disciplined when there's tons of naked girls and parties around you and some I'm sold on College by that alone I get it but I promise there's plenty of time
(29:03) for both send this to anyone who is debating this decision right now thank you for playing the game of one of zero I hope you win
Brutally Honest Truths That Give You an Unfair Advantage in Life - YouTube

Transcript:
(00:00) Here are brutally honest truths that will give you an unfair advantage. I'm Alex Shamoszi and the founder of acquisitions.com. It's a portfolio of companies that generate hundreds of millions of dollars in revenue per year in aggregate. And a lot of my success in business has come from finding and exploiting unfair advantages. So hopefully this video helps you do the same. So let's start with number one.
(00:19) Pain is the price of progress. The fastest growth periods are often the most miserable. If you want to progress, get used to pain. If you think about what actually occurs when you grow, you stretch past your point of comfort. So even if you're growing a muscle, like you stretch it, you break it down, it's painful.
(00:39) If you have growing pains, like as a kid, it's like you grew too fast and your joints are in a lot of pain. If you're a company and you expand, this is technically supposed to be good stuff, but it doesn't make it any less painful. Elite athletes don't get stronger during easy workouts. If we want progress, we must accept the price of pain that's attached to it.
(00:57) You cannot both want progress and live an easy life. These two things conflict. Number two, happy but not satisfied. So, let me explain this. So, you're allowed to be happy before you hit your goal, just not satisfied.
(01:17) And so, there's a very big difference between being content with your life, content with your work, and complacent, meaning you're not going to take any more action. There's this great Haitian proverb, which is behind mountains are more mountains. It's kind of like after every peak, you can just see more peaks ahead of you. The work works on you more than you work on it. For me, I remember I had a year that I basically went into retirement trying to figure out what I wanted to do.
(01:36) And the thesis that I came out with was that hard work is the goal. And so, the fact that there's something that happens as a result of hard work is really just a secondary effect. It's a consequence, but the goal is the work itself. I, you know, I had a friend this morning who messaged me. They're like, "Why do you still work?" And I was like, "Because it's the thing that I enjoy doing most.
(01:53) " And when I looked back on my life, when I didn't work, I was bored and felt depressed. And when I do work, I am stressed, but I do have moments that I really enjoy as well. I took this as a kind of a foundational truth for me, not for everyone, that there is misery on both sides. So, I might as well be productive and useful.
(02:11) And the only way to be productive and useful is to be happy about the process, but not satisfied so you can continue to provide value to the world. Now, number three, ignore critics. Now, this is probably easy to say, hard to do. So, let me let me break this down a little bit more. So, friendly reminder that most people are fat, poor pansies. Don't listen to them when they try to deter you from doing whatever it takes to succeed.
(02:36) So, the average person will always try to keep you average. It makes sense that if you want to be extraordinary, you will do things that an ordinary person would see as extra, right? And so a lot of people, and this is this is the really hard part that I had to come to terms with, is that a lot of people want to see you fail because it justifies the risk that they chose not to take.
(02:55) We always have to think about listening to the people who are closest to our goals, not closest to us. And if you want a more violent version of this, your critics are going to eventually die and their opinion isn't going to matter then, which means it probably also doesn't matter now. So, might as well do what you wanted to do originally.
(03:13) Number four, selective productivity. Productivity comes from all the things that you choose not to do. I'm going to define two more terms for you because I think it's important. I see commitment as the elimination of alternatives. So, if I get married, then I eliminate all alternatives to the person that I'm married to.
(03:32) Right? That is commitment, right? Which is very similar to focus. Focus, if you think of the hypothetical extreme of focus, is that somebody does literally nothing but one thing. So they don't eat, they don't sleep. They would eventually die, but they would be 100% focused during the time that they were alive, right? Obviously, we have to put a couple things in.
(03:50) You have to eat food, you have to sleep, right? But the most focused person does the fewest things outside of the thing they're focused on. Focus is about the number of things that you say no to. Having this framework is, in my opinion, more powerful for productivity than just about anything else.
(04:09) Right? People are always trying to figure out like productivity hacks, but they want to add things to their lives to become more productive, which is completely counter to what focus even means. It's getting rid of everything that's not the thing is how you focus. Now, part of that also means environmentally, right? So, if you like have a window that you look outside of and you've got people who walk past your office and people can knock on the door and you've got Slack notifications, of course, you're not focused because all of those things are not the work. So, I'm going to give you an analogy here. So, imagine there's a wall that you have
(04:32) to get over. All right? In order to you have to get a critical mass to get above this wall, right? And so you start putting up, you know, these ladders against the wall to try and climb over the wall. All right, this should make some sense. But as you try to build up the the little rungs of the ladder, so you put four rungs up.
(04:51) Well, you're not going to get the critical mass required to get over the hump to actually get the success you want. But the idea, the fallacy is that, oh, I'll just do all three or four of these things and I'll see which one works. When the reality is that any of them work, but none of them will work unless you work on one.
(05:10) And so, we have to take these four rungs that we're able to build and say, you know what, we're not going to do that. We're going to put that rung here because I'm going to take that time that I'm putting for my second opportunity, put it here. I'm gonna take this rugg and put it right here. And then I'm gonna take this rug and what do you know? I can get over this hump on top and I can get to the other side of the wall, which of course is where all the money and all the happiness and all the, you know, the girls uh with, you know, beautiful, beautiful hair. Look at
(05:33) this beautiful hair, right? This beautiful hair. Now she's looks like a bug. Anyways, uh there you [Music] go. What's crazy is that this literally happens at all levels of business. Like people who are starting out trying to start five things, people who are at like their second or fifth year.
(05:49) I talked to a guy last night who has a really good business, really good margin, 50% margins, has great revenue retention. He was in cyber uh security. People stay with him, people pay. He has no problem getting customers. He has no problem delivering on them. I was like, "What's the problem?" He's like, "Me?" He said, "I just I get bored." He's like, "I just want to start more things." And I'm like, "Yeah, you got to stop that.
(06:06) " Like, it's like the thing is is think about how much more successful you'd be. So, zoom all the way out. Think of somebody who gets better every single year and works on the same project for 20 years. You'd be like, "My god, that guy's probably really [ __ ] good.
(06:23) " And what's interesting about this is that it doesn't matter what project the person works on. You do 20 years of reps and you do nothing else, you're going to be good. And so if you know that that's a that's a fact, that's a certainty that you're going to be good with 20 years of practice, then the objective is to just get 20 years of practice in one thing and stick with it.
(06:41) So, like your plans aren't working because the plans are wrong. The plans aren't working because you're not working on the plan. The hard part about the plan is not creating the plan or even following the plan. It's sticking with the plan. That's the hard part. All right. Number five, fear versus regret. So, change is scary, but so is regret. And so, the life you live depends on the one you fear most.
(07:06) The more successful version of yourself also has fear. is that that your fear of regret is greater than your fear of rejection. Think about that for a second. I'm going to say it one more time. Your fear of regret must supersede must be bigger must be greater than your fear of rejection.
(07:24) And so I remember when I when I when I quit my management consulting job, which took me six months, so I'm not saying this from a pedestal. It took me six months of I decided I wanted to quit. It took me six months before I actually quit.
(07:37) By the way, you can measure how powerful someone is by the distance between when they make a decision and when it happens in reality. So, if you want to feel impotent, then take as long as you possibly can between when you make a decision and when you act on that decision. Now, for me, it was 6 months. And all I did was I called my friends up every night. I was like, "I'm going to quit my job. I'm going to start a business." And I, you know, we talk every night, literally every night.
(07:53) And I would be pacing in my condo like, "I'm going to do it. I'm gonna do it." And I wouldn't do it. I was too afraid. I was too much of a scaredy-cat. But the thing that got me over the hump was this. Number one, I knew that when I looked back on my life, if I never took the jump, I would have been ashamed of myself and I would have felt like I was a pansy and I was like, I can't die a pansy. I have to be able to make a jump.
(08:12) Number two, I played out plan B, which is, okay, let's say I actually completely fail. What happens? I was like, well, I'm not really going to be homeless. I know enough people that I can get food, right? And I was like, okay, so I would probably just couch surf.
(08:29) I'd have a little bit of shame, but at the end of the day, what would I really do? Well, I could always apply to get the job that I had back, or I could just go to another place with an experience or a story that would set me up for something cooler later. And so, all of a sudden, I was like, wait, so my plan B is that I just have a cool experience that I can talk about at a job interview or to go to business school. Okay, that's that doesn't actually sound that bad.
(08:49) And so, there's this huge amorphous fear, but I've just noticed in my life that fear only exists in the vague. It doesn't exist in the specific. If you're afraid of something, try and break it into pieces and spell it out. play out the next two or three steps because all of a sudden if you're in the developed western world, the downside risk is not really real.
(09:07) Like the only real downside risk is the opinions of other people who will say that you failed who you don't care about anyways. But like you think you're going to die, but you're not. You're just going to learn some stuff and you'll be like, "Oh, maybe next time I'm not going to make that mistake." And that's it.
(09:24) And I say this and it's easy for me to say, but it took me six months to figure this out. But I do remember my final straw was the realization that I had at the time no girlfriend, no kids, and I had no real, you know, financial responsibilities besides like eating and having a place to live. I said, if I can't make the decision now because it feels too risky, I will never be able to make the decision because if other people rely on me, now some of you are in a position where people do rely on you and you're like, "Well, Alex, you know, I've got people who rely on me.
(09:51) " Yeah, I would say that it makes it harder and what now? Harder and so what? But for me, that was the thing that got me over the hump. Was like, if I don't do it now, I'm never going to do it. I'm never going to have fewer responsibilities. And to to play this out a little bit more, if you have people who depend on you, their dependencies on you might increase.
(10:10) And so, if you can't do it now, you still might as well do it, right? Because it's only going to go one way. Number six, persistence creates timing. So you can time everything perfectly if your intention is to never stop. I'm going to say this one more time. You can time everything perfectly if your intention is to never stop. So think about this visually.
(10:37) So let's imagine that this line right here is is the is your lifeline. It's life as time passes. Right? Now let's say that you have some special thing that's going to happen here and some special opportunity that happens here and some special opportunity that happens here. What most people try and do is they don't want to take they don't want to work at all and then they're like, "Oh, I'm just going to work here and then I'm going to work here and then I'm going to work here.
(11:01) " But the likelihood that you're there in these three moments is very low if you're trying to time it. But if you work the whole time, then the timing will always be perfect because you will be ready. And so perfect timing is a complete myth. But perfect preparation isn't. And that on a long enough time horizon, your opportunity will come. People think that they need perfect conditions to start when in reality starting is the perfect condition.
(11:19) It creates the perfect condition for opportunity to be capitalized on. And I can tell you this from firsthand experience with me, like the more you do, the more you see you can do. And so opportunities multiply with skill. And so the better you get at doing stuff, the more things you know you would be able to do and win at.
(11:42) And so the goal is to gain as many skills as possible so that you have access to the maximum number of potential opportunities. A lot of people were thinking that oh I'm going to wait for the right moment. But when you have unlimited skills like Elon can go do whatever he wants. He could build a city in the middle of the ocean. And so he could do that. He has the skills because the world of opportunities open to him.
(12:00) He also spent all of his younger years just developing all these different skills and becoming a polymath across all these different things. Independence political stuff. Put it away. The point is the guy's good. All right. And so the goal is to get good and then you will never have a shortage of opportunities. Number seven, envy versus effort. All right.
(12:19) Let me break this down. If people worked for their goals as hard as they envy others for achieving them, they would already have achieved them themselves. So think about the amount of mental effort that goes into the hate that people spew out, the envy for wanting other people's stuff.
(12:35) I'll give you a couple hard truths about this. Number one, no one is doing as well as you think they are. So by comparison, you're actually better off than you think. Number two, you don't win by beating people. You win by growing into your potential and then allowing them to shrink into irrelevance by consequence.
(12:52) Three, and guess what? Your biggest threat is not your competition. It's a mediocre version of you that never realized what you could become. And as pathy as that may sound, it's also true, right? A lot of people think it's like, oh, you know, that guy's doing really well. It's like his doing well changes nothing about your reality.
(13:15) Something really ironic that I noticed is that the people who get copied the most by their competition are the people who ignore the competition who are copying them. Fundamentally, you start by focusing on the customer. And if you always put the customer first, everyone will copy you because you're actually doing the thing that will work, which is focusing on the customer.
(13:32) And there's a lot of weird things in life like that where like it's the opposite is what you what you you'd think like oh I'm going to look at what everyone else is. It's like no just do what matters most and then people who don't know how to think will just copy you. Real threat is that no one copies you at all because you're doing nothing. If you take all this effort that you look that you put into comparing yourself to other people that you look to kind of like tearing them down sometimes even in your mind let's be real. Maybe you don't say it to other people, but in your mind you're like me that whatever that is, whatever that
(13:56) feeling is that just do that towards you not being good enough. What happens is that when you do that, all of that effort, all that energy goes into improving yourself rather than tearing down somebody else. And only one of those things will help you. Number eight, hard conversations create opportunities.
(14:13) Hard truth, everything you want is on the other side of a few hard conversations that you have been putting off. People either grow into their potential or they keep living the same six months of their life over and over again. And the difference is how many hard conversations you're willing to have and how fast you have them once you realize you need to.
(14:30) If you sherk away from this, and I get it. I'm somebody who like it for a very long time had a hard time having hard conversations, right? Like I literally traveled across the country before I told my dad that I left. All right? Like I get it. So if you think having uncomfortable conversations is hard, just wait until you see the result of not having them. It will be harder.
(14:47) Basically, the the struggle is that you have short-term pain versus long-term pain. And long-term pain, I call regret. Comfort is short gain. Regret is long pain. Fear is short pain. Fulfillment is long gain. You want to trade short pains for long gains, not short gains for long pains. It's not the safe bet. It's a guaranteed loss just later. All right.
(15:15) So, I'm I'm going to spell this out. This is short pain. This is long pain. This is short gain. This is long gain. You want to trade short pain for long gain. That's the goal. It's the best trade. Number nine, endure. There's a reason that when I gave instructions to some of the new business owners who were going to start, you know, putting a community on school, one of the sole instructions I gave them was learn to endure.
(15:58) And so, the fastest way to become the person you want to be is to put yourself in a situation where you have no choice but to become them. You'd be amazed at what you can endure when you have no choice. For me, when I signed my lease for my gym, I had $5,000 in my bank account. The rent was $5,000. I had never really made money before. And so I was like, "Oh, wow.
(16:19) How does this work? If I made 100% of the money that I had made in my job, I would have been able to pay rent and have no food or anything else." But one of my favorite flavor texts on Magic cards is necessity is the mother of invention, right? It's the constraints that create the innovation that is required to get you out of the constraint, to get you out of the hard time.
(16:37) And so when I think back on like human history, sometimes we think that things that were going through our heart, but they're certainly much easier than the things that other humans have endured. And how did they endure them? Well, when the only choice they had was die or endure, you tend to endure. Number 10, results. Excuses. This is not going to be a big surprise here.
(16:55) The thing with excuses that's interesting is that they may be valid. And I think that's the part that people struggle with is that they're like, "Yeah, obviously results matter more excuses, but insert special snowflake." The thing is is that like you might be right. And I just like this quote from Ila.
(17:13) She says, "It's not your fault, but it is still your problem. You still have to do something about it." Or you can just wait and say, "You know what? I'm going to continue to not live the life that I want until I die." And everyone will be like, "Oh yeah, he had an excuse. That's why." Right? Is that what like is that what you really want? is that people were like, "Yeah, he had an excuse." Like that's it.
(17:40) Like, like it's a weird thing to want a permission slip for mediocrity, which is fundamentally what excuses are. You just want permission from everyone else to still get respect without the outcome because of your extenduating circumstances.
(17:59) And the thing is is there's a ton of allure, but the only person who actually believes that is you. People might not along. The people who love you might say, "Yeah, you know what? You are special. You are a special snowflake. Your mama might still love you." But like, you're not going to earn anyone's respect. And I think you certainly won't earn the respect of the person that matters most, which is you, cuz you'll always know that you could have done more, that you could have done better. That's the one that keeps me up.
(18:22) I have a saying that I tell myself a lot when I'm doing something that I don't want to do, and it's I will do what is required. It's not about doing your best. It's about doing what's required because what's required might be better than your best is right now. But the good news is that your best can get better. So number 11, and this is this one's real. All right. The hard way is the easy way.
(18:41) You're like, how does that work? The hard way is the easy way because the easy way never gets you there. So think about it. People always are looking for the shortcut, but you have to accept a very simple truth, which is that the shortcut never actually takes you to the place that you're trying to go. And it's because it's rarely one big thing.
(19:01) And I would postulate, fancy word, right? That there are a lot of shortcuts that exist in life. Wait for it. Wait for it. And everyone already uses those. And so whenever an actual shortcut gets found, all humans immediately do it and it no longer becomes a shortcut.
(19:18) It's just a thing that everyone does and it's not really a thing anymore. Like we learned how to tie knots. That was a big breakthrough. And then everyone ties their shoes and they're like, "Oh my god, let me show you the shortcut to this." It's like, "Oh, you tie." Like, "Oh my god, everyone does it.
(19:29) " and it's like not a thing anymore, right? And so all the things that you want to have that most people don't have don't have shortcuts. But thing is is so many people waste so much time. They literally waste longer than it would have taken the hard way or the only way to get there in search of the easy way that doesn't exist.
(19:49) And so the reality of this is that it's usually a hundred small things that make days, weeks, and months hard. It's the neverending onslaught of [ __ ] And then you remember after going through that onslaught of [ __ ] that you signed up for this. But then again, you figured that it would be hard. And then you're reminded that this is what hard feels like. And so you keep going because it's the only choice you have.
(20:08) I want to remind you that a lot of times what we imagine hard to be is different than how we experience hard because the nature of hard changes too. And it's more of a limitation in how we describe hardship than it is and I actually think there's a big problem with this. So, just kind of like Eskimos have like seven different words for snow.
(20:27) I feel like I should have like 25 different words for hard, right? Like the amount of things that you go through. There's like lifestyle hard like, okay, so there's sacrifice hard of like you're giving up things that you enjoy. There's also like effort hard of like starting to do things that you hate doing that you're not good at.
(20:43) There's risk hard of the the fact that you could lose something that you currently have, right? That you have the chance of losing what you currently have. You have the uncertainty heart of the fact that you might be doing all of the sacrifice for nothing. There's lots of different flavors of heart and each one of them presents at different times and for some reason when it gets a new kind of heart, it's a new seventh type of snowflake heart, then you're like, "Oh, this is different." But it's not. It's just that the thing that you grow comfortable
(21:07) with, then you conquer and then you're exposed to a new level. And so, I love this quote from Paul Graham. He said, "If you want to make a million dollars, you have to endure a million dollars worth of pain." Fundamentally, in my opinion, the people who who who end up building building, not inheriting, building tremendous wealth, just have massive concentrations of pain. So, don't go looking for the easy way because it will never get you there.
(21:31) Number 12, don't, this is a big one, don't give away your power. Now, this sounds very like, you know, girl power or a little uh little like rahrh, but I will I will break this down in a little bit less raw way. So, what offends you controls you. Whatever you point your finger of blame towards is what also you point your power towards. Meaning, we talked about excuses earlier.
(21:56) I can't do it because insert X. Insert X is the thing that has power over your life. And I remember when I realized this was that I had this belief that I would never be able to be in a long-term committed relationship because my mother had hurt me as a child. I didn't get enough hugs. Who gives a [ __ ] Whatever.
(22:16) But I realized that by using that excuse and by saying it's her fault I'm broken. It's her fault I can't trust people. It's her fault I can't love anybody. Right? By by saying that over and over again, all I did was I said, "My mother controls how my love life will go." Oo, heavy real well. I don't want her to have control over how I choose to love or not love or how how content I get in a relationship or anything like that.
(22:42) So, I actively had to say, "Maybe all these things happened, maybe they didn't. Also, who cares? Me. I care. I'm the one who's affected by this." And what's crazy about this, it's kind of a weird thing with like parents is that you think by hurting yourself, you get back at them for hurting you. And you do hurt them when you hurt yourself, but you hurt you more at some point.
(23:04) And this is like this is like super real. Let's say that you were parented tough, whatever that means for you. You had lots of bad things happen, okay? And it was probably because you were a child trying to deal with the world without the skills of dealing with the world as an adult.
(23:23) But you had these things happen, right? And on some level, you might believe that you becoming successful, you making it work, validates the way that you were parented. And so you have this conflict where you're like, well, I don't want them to think that they did a good job by me being successful.
(23:45) And so then you want to keep not being successful to prove to them and to hurt them for hurting you. and you stay there as long as you want them to control you. And so the day that you choose to control yourself is the day that you choose to divorce your results from the very viable reasons that you have to not win. You are right. And so what? Number 13, rejection versus regret.
(24:14) At some point, everyone needs to choose whether they'd rather risk rejection now or guarantee regret later. And so, losers fear rejection, winners fear regret. And most attempts fail of anything. Failure is literally a prerequisite for success. And one of the one of my favorite quotes of mine is greatness rejects all first-time applicants. And so, it's kind of like that person that just is like, "Oh, I can't get a job.
(24:37) " And you're like, "Well, what have you done?" They're like, "Well, I applied somewhere." And you're like, "What do you mean?" They're like, "I applied somewhere." And you're like, "And?" And and they're like, "Yeah." And I and I didn't I didn't get the job. They didn't even call me. You're like, "You went to one place.
(24:51) " And you're like, and they're like, "Yeah." This is going to be a really good analogy for somebody who's listening to this only for people who don't have a business yet. A lot of starting a business is the number of reachouts that you had to do in order to get the path, the job, the career that you want right now. So, think about the amount of interviews. Think about the amount of outreach.
(25:09) Think about the amount of job ads. Think about the amount of resumes that you sent out. Think about all of that. And all of that work got you what I would consider one sale. You got one person to say yes to you and they would give you money for work. All right. Now, obviously within the context of an employee relationship, but fundamentally actually works the same way.
(25:26) All you do in a business is the same thing. If you can handle that level of rejection, then you can handle the same level of rejection in a business. It's not actually that different. The question is whether you can handle that level of regret years later for not doing it. And I'll say this, one of the things that I've noticed between champions and everyone else is that people everyone else is so excited when they win. They're so excited, you know, by the idea of them getting first place.
(25:48) But there's a reason that they never get first place. It's because they're excited about it. The people who always and very consistently hit first place and win the championships are relieved because they tend to hate losing more than they love winning. and they expected to win because of the level of preparation they had compared to everyone else.
(26:08) Which brings me very magically to number 14. Consistency beats talent. So listen to this. You can beat most people at anything if you just stick with it for a year. You can become competent at just about any skill in 20 hours. It's just that people will wait 10 years to get the first 20 hours logged, right? Like if you want to learn how to play the first few notes of a guitar, you can learn in about 20 hours.
(26:31) Now, are you going to be Jimmyi Hendris, which Jenzie, he was a guitarist, Purple Haze, you can look it up. Anyways, the point is is that people have this huge delay before they begin. And what make things hard isn't complexity, it's consistency. And so, as boring as it is, you just have to keep doing it before you get anything back.
(26:49) So, one of my favorite quotes from myself is, "The world belongs to those who can keep doing without seeing the result of their doing." You have to delay how quick you get a reward, how fast you need a cookie in order to keep going. I've been told that I'm decent at presenting and talking on stage in front of people. And what a lot of people don't see is that for years I spoke with a microphone in front of a group of people and I did it like multiple times a day. And I did that in the form of a fitness session.
(27:20) And so I had to literally stand on a box and shout around and tell people what they had to do. And I had to do that for years. And I remember when I had to get on stage for the first time. And I had in high school been very nervous to public speak.
(27:40) And as I was about to get up on stage, I was like, why am I not nervous about this? Like this is weird. Like I should I was like, I should be nervous. Like why am I not nervous? And I was like, I've I've done this so many times. Like so many times. And I'm not talking about, you know, Civil War history and Abraham Lincoln. I'm talking about stuff I know.
(27:59) Outwork your self-doubt through repetition, not affirmations. You don't do it through belief. You do it through stimuli habituation, which is just fancy words for saying you expose yourself to the bad things so many times they get used to and it's no longer a bad thing anymore. It's just life. If you want to get over a fear, the way they do it is habituation.
(28:22) So, if I wanted to get over, you know, being afraid of spiders, I'm not afraid of spiders, but some people are afraid of spiders, right? If you want to get over that fear, you literally lock yourself in a room with a bunch of spiders, and all you do is you just have panic attack after panic attack, and you pass out, and you wake up again, the little there, you pass out, you keep doing eventually, eventually your nervous system adjusts, and five hours later, eight hours later, you walk out of the room unafraid because you have habituated. And so the point of practice for all of these things is to habituate as fast as you
(28:49) can. And so we're trying to microwave that period of time. And the thing is, let's say it takes let's say it takes this many reps. You can have this many reps take you a year or you can have it take you a month depending on how dedicated you are to it. Number 15, have no shame. All right.
(29:09) Now, I have told this before, but my plan B was that I would drive Uber and strip. Now, I think part of that was because I wanted to, you know, thumb my whatever the the Shakespearean saying, I bite my thumb at you, uh, to bite my thumb at my my very respectable parents, uh, and say like, I would take off my clothes for money. Now, of course, they would be horrified by that, but I think part of the reason I was okay with it was I was like, I'm going to I'm going to do it my way.
(29:27) I want to be crystal clear here. If you have no money and you want to make money, you should have no shame. Knock, call, email, text, DM, ask. Life-changing doors do not open themselves. And sometimes I feel like shame was invented by people who have to prevent people who have not from taking action.
(29:47) Because all of this is just an illusion. What are you ashamed of? Trying. Like let's play it out. Remember I said fear only happens in the abstract, not in the specific. So if you reach out to a stranger, no matter what happens, you always come out better than before because you either have a sale or you have an experience. Both make you better.
(30:11) And so the crazy thing about trying is that it has an asymmetric riskreward return. So worst case is you get a no and you learn from it. You get better. Life gives you unlimited shots while you're alive. And so if you have nothing like you you're just basically cashing in lottery tickets and saying, "Oh my god, I lost. But what you're paying with is time." Fine. Pay more time. Get more tickets. Keep scratching.
(30:28) So do you know the difference between shame and guilt? Guilt is when you break your own rules. Shame is when you break other people's rules. So if you are gay and you're in a religious community, you would probably feel shame. If you also share that religious community's rule set, you would also feel guilt.
(30:55) If, let's say, you were in a very liberal progressive environment, you might feel neither shame nor guilt. And so the question is, whose rules are you following? If you have this feeling, this fear of being ashamed, then the question is, who's the one who wrote the rules that you're choosing to follow? And I can promise you it's not the people who are successful because they're the ones shouting on the rooftops telling you that it's totally different once you get in the pool. It's very different.
(31:23) It's kind of like you have the lights of the world turn on and like you're living in this mirage when you're not succeeding where there's all this all this uncertainty. There's all this ambiguity. There's this fog of the unknown in front of you. But as soon as you start taking action, things become very crystal clear.
(31:41) I think there's there's I'm sure some stoic analogy that said this, but basically like if you've ever walked through very dense fog, you can only see a couple steps in front of you. The only thing that you can do in fog is just start walking. And as you walk, more steps become available to you.
(31:58) And so there's this misconception that you're going to be able to see the entire path ahead of you. But it has two fundamental fallacies in front of it. Number one is that you have the right vision to be able to see that far with your current skill set and resources, which you don't. Because imagine today all of your conditions changed.
(32:16) you had more skills, which is hard to imagine because you can't imagine what it's like to have the skill, but maybe let's say you have resources that you didn't have before. Well, that would probably change the way you play the game. So, trying to play out and try and play 17 steps in advance when the game itself is going to change and you as a player are going to change.
(32:35) The only thing that you can boil all of this down to is to take the steps that you can see in front of you one at a time. And I would write this down of like what are the things that are stopping me? And more specifically, whose voice do I hear? Whose voice or judgment am I afraid of? Because usually it's people.
(32:55) It's society is what we say. But it's usually like two people. And I remember when I had this big decision that I had to make when I was considering selling gym lunch. I thought that $46 million was not a lot of money for the business. Now, some of you may hear this and be like, "Oh my god, that's amazing." But believe it or not, at before we before COVID happened, uh, gym lunch was valid 150 million.
(33:14) And so for me going from 150 to 50 or, you know, 46, it felt small, right? It felt like a really small number. And I remember there was a particular person, we'll call it a friend of me, if you will, that I thought would think that they were better than me if I sold for this small number. And when I was able to narrow it down to just that one person's voice, I thought to myself, am I going to give that person power over my entire life, which is literally what it was. I was choosing not to make a decision because of someone else. That person has complete
(33:48) power over me. And I was like, well, that's a terrible reason not to do this. And the crazier part is that even if you're right and that person does say that you suck, so what? Most people don't want you to win. And even if you do win, they will try and do a reverse excuse, which is called a justification for why you should be excused of the respect that you should earn for having won. He just has good genetics. He has great parents.
(34:18) He uh, you know, inherited his wealth. He had connect good connections. She was born in America. He speaks English. He's a man. He's white. He's whatever you want. But giving the person justifications in no way helps you. You might be right and so what? Like it's it's so funny.
(34:41) It's like let's say you have some advantage, whatever it is, right? Whatever whatever advantage you're born with, right? You might have one. It's kind of the thing same thing as the parent thing. It's like, well, I don't want to be successful because I don't want to prove that I had this advantage. It's like, would you prefer to prove everyone wrong by saying I had this advantage and I also wasted it? I remember I'll tell you a story and I think it'll probably that'll that'll round this off well. So, when I was younger, I didn't want to be a doctor, but that was pretty much the path that was laid out in front of me. And so, my
(35:05) father's a successful doctor and I I was like, it's it's it's cheating, you know, to to, you know, just assume your practice and just like immediately have a practice that makes a lot of money. and he said, "Do you think Shaq, when he was 7 feet tall, was like,"It wouldn't be fair for me to play basketball. Other people aren't as tall as me." And I always remembered that.
(35:28) He's like, "You play the cards you're dealt. These are the cards you have. Play them." And I remember thinking that as now, obviously, I didn't decide to be a doctor, but the reason that I didn't want to do it was because I thought other people would say that I would they would disqualify away my success as not earned by me.
(35:47) when the reality is that they're all going to disqualify your sex no matter what because it makes them feel bad and so [ __ ] them. But if you have some cards, for the love of God, play them. Hey, if any of these messages resonated with you and you're like, "Man, I'm too, you know, I'm a few months behind from my goals.
(36:08) " I made what I would consider a counterintuitive video on goal setting, which sounds so overused, but I don't know, it's got like a couple million views or whatever it is. So, people seem to have liked it. Uh, and so if you want that, you can check this video out. Um, so far it's I think it's the top video viewed this year.
I Built 4 Businesses In A Row To Show It's Not Luck - YouTube
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mqqbuM9sAk

Transcript:
(00:00) I started four businesses that cracked 10 million in a row I want to share the Frameworks and lessons I learned from the many mistakes that led to those four in a row so that hopefully the next business you have or the current business you're on and Achieve that level and Beyond so the first big company I built was called gym launch it was a licensing business for gym owners as in I had a model and I would license that model to them they would use those things they'd make more money the average would make an extra hundred
(00:22) thousand dollars a year in profit business at its peak was worth about 150 million dollars and then covid hurt that business and I ended up selling it for 46.2 million to American Pacific group which is a private Equity Firm out of San Francisco the first 10 customers I got from gym launch I got somebody to pay a VA in the Philippines to scrape crossfits database and then send me the list of emails I then uploaded them to Facebook made it look like audience off of those marketed to get a webinar which no one watched and then I had 80 leads
(00:51) from people who had opted in and none of them bought or scheduled a call and so I looked up every one of the emails manually and I like friended them on Facebook I messaged them and then I got a few of them on the phone to pay me 500 bucks to go out to fly to their gym and actually do the turnaround once I started the licensing version of the model which is the one that really gave me the scale I was able to sell something that had virtually 100 margins the first month I think I did like 120 000 in sales and the next month I did
(01:17) like 300ish and then High fours and then 780 and all I was doing was just selling more units and then we hit a million the next month we would look at whatever problems the gym owners that we were with were currently suffering from so it could be there suffering from churn or they could be suffering from margin issues they could be suffering from they're not getting enough lead close rates aren't as high as we want them to be we would then create a hypothesis around what we thought might work we would survey the community and say who
(01:37) has the best conversion rates if that's what we wanted to fix and then we'd invite 20 of them onto a call we would take all the notes to figure out what things they were all doing and here's the important point we didn't say great we're going to do all these things we try to see the few things that they were all doing then we'd say hey guys this is a big deal this is like worth the cost of change you're gonna have a demonstrated long-term benefit to the business for context my best gym did about 600 000 a year our average gym
(02:02) who's a gym Lord made six hundred thousand a year big picture is that the product has to be exceptional if your customers are in love with your product which takes more time because people are like oh you threw this thing together it's like it took six years for me to put all those pieces together and then finally be able to monetize that deliverable and like that little inch between good and great is yours but the return you get on it from the word of mouth that compounds is hard to Fathom one of the other big secrets of gym
(02:27) launch was that we had a very different approach to acquiring customers the traditional model of most businesses in general is lost leader you know you get someone in for some sort of free thing you lose money on the acquisition you make it up in LTV I came with a different model and I've since done that in every single business I have so this is one of the important Frameworks that I want to pass to you and it's something called client Finance acquisition so client finest acquisition basically means you get the customers to finance
(02:49) the acquisition of the next customer so all you have to do is have enough money to get the first sale and if you make more in the first sale then the cost to acquire that customer and the cost to fulfill that customer plus the cost to fulfill that next customer and the cost to acquire the next customer you eliminate Capital as a constraint in the business you can put a dollar in and get two customers back then that next customer buys you two more and two more and two more all my gyms were able to just Crush everyone else because we
(03:12) could outspend I've taken that aggressive acquisition perspective to every one of the businesses that I've had we had many many terrible things that happened during the launch I mean one we had coveted which was tough you know for gym owners uh in general a third of all of our clients went out of business another thing that we did that was really bad was we over hired for our support I had hired an inexperienced director of customer service she was a Frontline rep that we just promoted all the way through I work ethic but no
(03:35) experience and so she hired 35 reps and we only needed five so we had to lay off 30 people and then that became a thorn in our side for the next two three years because our glass door got smashed the biggest reason Jim launch was successful one is that it was timing we identified Arbitrage on Facebook ads before anyone else did and we created a turnkey system around how to monetize it I was running ads on Facebook in 2013.
(03:57) you could put a girl with a bikini and say click here now like it was the wild the second thing because of that Arbitrage the average gym was taking home an additional thirty thousand dollars in cash in their first 30 days that was the average if you take a business where the average business owner is making thirty six thousand dollars a year in profit and then you add thirty thousand dollars in the first month of working with them you don't need to worry about marketing technically my return on marketing was a hundred to one for the first 18 months
(04:23) in the business but it's because I probably could have just not marketed at all and I would have had the amount of people that came in so like who knows if the ads were doing anything but everybody from the outside was like this guy's ads are everywhere like he's killing it so many people who are copycats Mickey Mouse gimmick [ __ ] people who just used old versions of our stuff to try and sell out of like all the stuff you would imagine all those guys went out of business because they didn't have the deaf Prestige Labs was
(04:44) my second big company which actually was really a sister company to gym on you built the whole thing of an affiliate base that we acquired through gym launch and so like the first month of being fully operational did 1.7 million I didn't want to sell supplements for a very long time because I was like supplements you just need to eat eat right and work out this woman wouldn't leave my office she's like my friend says I need supplements like fine so I wrote her list like go get this stuff going she came back the next day with
(05:07) the things and she was like I just want to make sure I got the right stuff and I saw the receipt and it's 700 on the receipt and the thing that I had sold her was 400 Baht and I was like [ __ ] that I'm gonna sell supplements so I would recruit a gym owner and I would say hey we're teaching you all this marketing and sales stuff over here if you just sell every person's supplements it will cover the cost to acquire a customer just from the physical products and the Beautiful Thing with selling physical products is that there's no
(05:27) added fulfillment one of the problems is the more you sell the more you have to deliver right and so it's kind of this double-edged sword where the moment you swipe the credit card you're like oh [ __ ] now I have to deliver on this right they didn't have to do anything they literally just swiped the credit card and then we managed centrally we would ship it direct to the consumer I wanted to create a brand only gym owner sold no one else could sell it we priced it on our home site higher we priced at 30 percent higher on the main side so there
(05:49) were significant savings on top of that we gave them a very good selling system because I learned you know a lot about selling supplements I made it a recurring subscription so now they got to have two recurring subscriptions per customer I picked the first 10 customers from distribution base already I rolled out 10 locations and then the next month I rolled out 20 or 30.
(06:05) next month I rolled out another 20 30 and then we did the big launch to everyone there's lots of little things that we did that were gym specific that no other supplement company could do which has given us a nice moat in that space cost me four million bucks to start Prestige Labs about a million of that went to the tech so we created our an entire point of sale for supplements that was specifically made for Jim so every gym would get a retail kit so they'd have a full wall of products they would have a kiosk which is a stand with an iPad type
(06:29) thing on it apple-fi didn't really exist that we had to build this whole thing and then the other three-ish million went into just product biggest difficulties with it the supply chain so like if you run out of one ingredient on one product like you can't sell the product there are also legal firms that will buy all your products and try and test to find something that's off or unrepresented or whatever there's predatory law firms that as soon as you have a patent they'll just try and find people to Sue and they'll just like
(06:52) basically rev share all the amount of money they can get the end consumer is just not sticky and that's just because people don't stick with Fitness stuff in general for a long time so the biggest lesson I have for you guys mosination round Prestige Labs is that I probably shouldn't have done it that's the railroad it is a good business but I think that if I had allocated more time to just making gym launch better gym launch would have been bigger and because Jim won't stop growing the year I launched Prestige Labs I just became
(07:14) CEO of two companies rather than CEO of one the third business I started use allen.com still around today doing great I saw where chat was going and I saw where Ai and machine learning were going a few years ago and I figured if I were able to aggregate all of the data from every single type of small business all scheduling brick and mortar in-person appointments I'd be able to predictably show what days of the week what times of day what kind of follow-up sequences got the most amount of people to shop and
(07:40) since we were compensating on percentage of people that showed up we were highly incentivized to solve that problem and I learned a ton about how to get the most throughput for leads and I've used that in every one of the portfolio companies that we have and you can usually add 20 30 40 to the throughput on ads simply your scheduling process I first started it to solve the problem for gym owners because one of the biggest constraints is that people don't work their leads amazing I know um but the average gym
(08:02) was getting nine percent of leads in the door when they had to work them manually we were able to get just under 20 of leads in the door without them doing anything and the average front desk person costs 2 000 plus a month and we could do it for a fraction of that sold the first kind of customers of Allen by going to our distribution base and saying hey do you want to try this thing what was interesting is that we very quickly realized that we couldn't expand outside of our distribution base the Breakthrough was that I realized that we
(08:27) needed to get agencies on board rather than getting small businesses on board because they'd be like great I can work my leads how do I get leads and we're like oh [ __ ] they don't know how to get leads so then we started selling agencies which had another degree of Leverage because if you saw an agency they could have 50 small business owners underneath of them I did two webinars with people who had big agency audiences so now you go up another level I could make one pitch and in one pitch get a thousand customers that was when this
(08:50) thing really took off I did two pitches and within six months we were doing 1.7 also ironically per month through the software company Allen was the business that I probably learned the most lessons from I ended up selling that business as well 75 of it to a strategic buyer who's still running it and doing a good job with it and hopefully they'll have a big exit in a few years and that was an all stock deal so under NDA I can't tell you but I can tell you we did 12 million in the trailing 12 months before the sale
(09:12) that being said lesson one is that you need to have an in-house CTO if you're going to be if you're going to get into software I developed software for Prestige Labs I use the exact same development shop to make the software for Alan I regret that development shops honestly they're as close to a complete scam as you can come to because if you really are going to build a software company you need to build a software company like that's it like you need to build a software company it's like having a marketing agency and having a
(09:33) white labeled marketing agency doing all your delivery it doesn't make any sense number two is that you want to run pricing surveys early because we unlocked four times the pricing Power by simply repackaging how we charge exploring different ways to charge based on usage based on recurring fees different apis this is especially true with software because there's so many different ways you can charge compared to maybe traditional service the third thing is having aligned incentives with your customers often just makes you more
(09:56) money and so that business had a tremendous amount of scale because we had so much alignment with every single stakeholder the small business owner wanted people to show up the agency owner wanted people to shop and we got paid based on shops so everybody was aligned top down the fourth thing throughput on appointments when you're scheduling for sales calls or in-person appointments the amount of days per week that you are open the hours that you are open and the increments of time matter a lot like 50 to 200 percent would be like
(10:24) marketing doesn't work for me and they had one time sought for an hour per week that they were willing to take their customers on that's just stupid there's no other way to say it the people who made the most money who had the most throughput are the ones who gave the most availability gave the most flexibility their customers were open the most days and they unsurprisingly got more people to schedule and show up there's a reason small business owners stay small they make small business owner decisions so acquisition.com so
(10:45) this is the fourth business portfolio companies that right now does over 200 million dollars a year and I make these videos so that you can hopefully pass 3 million 10 million Etc and then we can invest in your business to help it grow from this I started with the question what can I do forever and then work backwards from there so it's like there has to have a lot of Leverage I need to have a capital company vehicle so the first 10 Investments that we found some people I knew from you know beforehand and I would say that the relationship
(11:05) had shifted more and more to like basically an advisory role anyways and the rest of it has been uh people who read the book who watch videos who listened to podcasts who come in who already are aligned with our values we'll always look at anything as three or more but most the businesses are over five the average business right now is doing 17 million so acquisition.
(11:21) com is the first business that was really like built on a personal brand and inbound with content so that's been like the biggest change compared to the other businesses there's pros and cons to it like it's a slower business overall if you are used to doing a transactional business where you're doing multiple sales a day going into a business model where you have one every month is very different and there's a lot of conversations that happen that don't amount to anything the thing that excites me most about acquisition.com is
(11:43) I learn more now than I ever have because I'm exposed to more businesses at a higher level I believe that the purpose of life is to learn um that is my purpose of life then enabling myself to learn in as many ways as humanly possible maximizes that so we co-own all these businesses because I want to learn how solar sales work I want to learn how mortgage sales work like knowing a lot about a lot of things allows you to cross-pollinate ideas that work well in one industry and then apply them to another one and then get outsized
(12:09) returns as we saw how quickly and how easily acquisition.com grew the biggest part of that was because we hired from the top down there was so much that we could automatically delegate to people who were better than us at their respective Things director of sales director of marketing director of people director of I.
(12:26) T director of portfolio operations as good as but better than us who are teaching us every other business I've had I hired from the bottom up this one I went from top down and I will always do that from here on out you can really only do that if you're well capitalized that's why Venture people raise money because you can get more Talent before the business can really afford the talent because at the end of the day every business incurs debt it's just what kind of debt so are you incurring financial debt are you incurring management debt cultural debt
(12:49) technical debt and the question is which one do you want to pick and have to pay down later and so for us being the bank was willing to pay down financial debt to not have to pay any of the other debt down in the future because ultimately on a longer time Horizon we'd move faster and the other thing is that we have made recruiting Talent the single core competency of the business most of the companies that we're bringing on the entrepreneur needs more talent and we have the ability to recruit Talent better than most people because one we
(13:12) have so much inbound that comes in two we as a private Equity Firm have more Prestige than most of the companies that are in our portfolio and so we can recruit and people respond to a private Equity Firm who has portfolio companies more than they respond to Joe's dry cleaning and then we have somebody at holdco who will help train them on our way of doing business so they get it right the first time a portfolio company when their managers are getting stuck or their director is still getting stuck they talk to our director of sales and
(13:37) if you're a business owner and you'd like to scale to 50 100 and Beyond we'd love to partner with you on it we have the track record that we have because we've done it multiple times and the biggest costs that you have in the business is what you do not know and so if we can help you pay down ignorance debt and we can drag what you might already do in 10 years and three years then for us that's a win for everyone so if that's interesting you can always go to acquisition.
(13:58) com go there apply through the site and look forward to hopefully working with one of you guys

Transcript:
(00:01) what is going on everyone uh today we're going to talk about a fun topic which is uh i got a message yesterday from somebody who said uh you know who's dead broke and was like what do i do all that kind of stuff and so um i think i've talked in the past i'll probably do another one about when i when i've lost everything um what i did step by step um to i think the after i lost everything the next month i did 110 000 in sales um and now sorry not sales that was cash collected in the next in the next 30 days so like you
(00:31) absolutely just need skills you can have nothing else in your life and a beautiful thing is that no government can take it from you no person can take your skills from you in a divorce um those are always your own uh which is something that i don't know for some reason feels magical to me and so one of the things that i've seen as i've kind of you know moved moved up i'm not saying that arrogantly just you know just developed progressed whatever um is that the people who i surround myself with now have more money than
(00:58) the people that i surrounded myself when i was early on in my career and what's ironic is that these people actually spend less money they they have they have less desire to spend money and they find ways to acquire things for less money out of pocket and that's always really interesting to me and so right now i think there's you know if you were to if you were to look at quote investment opportunities right um you could you could you know invest in buying a house so let's say let's say you've got i'll do two scenarios
(01:30) all right let's say you've got fifty thousand dollars all right and you're like okay i'm thinking about buying uh a house right and i think for first house you might only have to put ten percent down i'm not sure it's 10 or 20. i don't remember but anyways let's just say 10 for for sake of whatever so 500 000 house all right you put 10 down and then you get the mortgage right you get the liability of the mortgage payment every month yippee um now if you were to if you were to and let's say that in order for you to save
(02:00) that you've been making i don't know 60 grand a year and you've been saving that for you know five years something like that now let's look at an alternative scenario where you um are still making that same amount of money 60 and you saved up 50. and instead of buying a house you have a long conversation with your spouse and you say or maybe you don't have a spouse whatever with yourself and you say i wonder how much money i could get for this money ah interesting right and so you you you leaf through the businesses
(02:33) that are in your area and by the way the best way to do that is one you should contact brokers not necessarily to buy a business but to get an idea of some of the businesses that are in the area and what price ranges look like but if you buy from a broker you're going to pay retail you could definitely negotiate a deal and i'll tell you one of the deals that i did that was really good at the end of this but uh anyways so let's say you you know you reach out to some businesses things that you like or enjoy or feel like you have
(02:59) some specialized knowledge in and uh you find out that there's a business that's doing let's say i don't know 250 000 a year in uh in in profit right and uh because it's a small local owned business and you're not going to pay retail for it you get it for two and a half you know times earnings right which would be uh what's two and a half times uh it's 525 hopefully i think two and a half no that's 625 excuse me 625 000 is what a business you might pay for a business that's doing 250 000 a year in profit all right now here's
(03:38) where here's where it's interesting right so i had um an early mentor who who taught me this negotiation tactic that i've used pretty much for throughout my entire life since this moment and i used it in the deal that i'll tell you about in a second which is agree on price then agree on terms right and so when you when you would go to quote talk to this business right there's there's the price which you might say cool you know this business 625 and then there's terms right and so the term side once you've agreed on the
(04:06) price you negotiate down whatever and then you say okay well i'm going to need you to sell our finance meaning you're not going to pay anything you're paying over time right i need you to sell or finance uh you know three quarters of the deal all right and so three quarters of the deal man i'm doing some math today but like 400 and you know 30-ish 437 whatever thousand dollars um and you're gonna finance that for you know three years right and then on top of that or five years you can do whatever you want here i think
(04:42) i mean you could probably i mean you try and push it out as far as you can right and then what you have remaining which would be like in this instance 200 000 then you get a note from the bank right or sba loan which you have a 200 000 um loan for it and you put your your fifty thousand dollars down right so then that would be two hundred uh so you put fifty which would be twenty five percent of two hundred thousand so i'm going to recap this 625 is the cost of the business you know 437 you get seller finance meaning you can pay that over time
(05:13) and then you've got two hundred thousand dollars that you get a loan from the bank so uh which you put fifty thousand dollars for so if you're thinking about this the guy who's selling the business he sells for 625 but he's only getting 200 000 up front you're only putting 50 of that 200 and you're taking a loan for the rest of it right um and so when you're looking at this you've now acquired this business that makes 250 000 a year right so you upgraded your income from 60 to 250 000 right and within you know 24 months
(05:48) all of that you know income will be yours and maybe hopefully you'll grow it or you'll probably try and work extra hard and take over some of the some of the other positions or cut out some of the waste etc in the business and uh and and so that massively speeds you up in life right and if you compare that to what it would cost you to start your own business um in terms of investment and like existing book of business client lists all the knickknacks you have to buy that you don't even think of zoning permits and all the fees and
(06:18) licenses it's actually pretty decent deal so um i'll tell you one of the deals that i did that was pretty good so i had four locations at this point this is one of the gyms and i opened a fifth location so the first two locations i opened i opened the first one i think for forty thousand dollars i mean i put i didn't i put as little as i possibly could in this thing um and it happened to have been an old gym so there was like turf already in the flooring was already in it was painted like there was a bunch of things i
(06:46) didn't have to pay for so i lucked out there um and but the second one because i thought i was smarter i put 200 we put 250 000 into the second location and here's the fun thing it made no more money than the first location did uh which i always think is hilarious so like uh to the undisciplined everything looks like a spending opportunity uh and so i pretty much would empty my bank account and uh and so on my fifth location uh my next two locations were corporate locations which were actually pretty cheap um which was pretty cool those are those
(07:17) are good deals but the the the fifth location that i did i had a gym that went out of business or he not out of business he wanted to uproot because his it got divorced or he had some some family crisis and so he was looking for someone to buy his his gym and so it was beautiful it had all this equipment that was really expensive in it and i was like man this is like a dream come true and so i agreed on price because i had my mentor talk me through this i agreed on price which i think was 40 000 i think it was 40 great it was 40 or
(07:43) 50. i think it was yeah so that's what i agreed and then i was like cool i'll pay you over the next year and he was like fair enough and so i mean he didn't say like that we negotiated and then 12 months is what we what we came to and so i mean i tried to go for 24 months uh but he agreed on 12. and so the beautiful thing with that was i didn't i didn't put any money out of pocket so you know my first year i put 50 grand in second gym i put 250 000 in fifth gym smarter more experienced me puts no money in right and in the first 30 days we did 51
(08:16) 000 in sales so this gym in the first 30 days literally paid for itself period right and so this thing that is now kicking off profit right every month during this during this whole period of time and then 12 months later i ended up meeting russell and telling him how i was doing this stuff and he's like you should be teaching other people how to do what you're doing now and so i ended up selling the gym for one and a half times more than i quote bought it for right which i then had the gym pay for it on its own
(08:46) and so i basically acquired a cash flowing asset for nothing and then had just acquired a cash flowing asset for for no money and so i think about that um in light of the original thing that i i mentioned was just like i get i get people who message me all the time like what what happens if i don't have any money i don't know what to do you always have to just get skills or this is just my opinion is that because there's no one who can take them from you there's no divorce there's no government there's no revolution there's no financial crisis
(09:12) that can ever take your skills from you and that's why when entrepreneurs hit zero they can usually bounce back i've done it i had eleven hundred dollars in my bank account um at one point at my at my lowest point after i had six gyms right um after this so even when i had this experience and it sounds cool like i messed up and um you know that's why i think i love to say you only should only have to get rich once and um and that's why people who are wealthy are more risk averse because the downside risk of losing everything is
(09:41) always bigger right like you can reverse 30 years of great decisions with any number multiplied by zero any number multiplied by zero you could have a billion dollars if you make a bad investment it goes to zero right and so that's why when people are like i don't know why you're motivated and i don't know why uh there like it's just there's there's just always things that can happen you know what i mean and so just being risk averse is what i have noticed from the people who have the most money is that they actually have way lower
(10:09) risk tolerances than the people who have no money uh which is hilarious because it's like the people who have the least amount of money uh then go buy lottery tickets which are literally the worst investment you could possibly make and and and they they consistently invest their money in a terrible investment that has all the downside risk of going to zero whereas the richest people in the world find things that could never go to zero and they buy them for zero so think about that for a second people are using their money poor people
(10:38) use their money to buy things that have virtually guaranteed you know risk of going to zero right with tiny risk of of upside right whereas rich people buy stuff for zero dollars that have um upside potential but that doesn't that doesn't have a billion dollar upside potential they would rather have a guaranteed small return with no risk than a potential for huge return with guaranteed risk think about that so uh anywho i think if over time and it's not like you can shift your perspective on this overnight it took me a long time
(11:14) and i still am doing it now um in shifting how like because i still get excited about you know i see these you know these these these cryptocurrencies 20xing and stuff you know in like a month and i'm like man that's crazy um but then i also think like well the downside risk of me going to zero is far more upsetting to me than me getting 20 times more on some tiny investment that i would make um and so i i don't do it right and so anyways um i say all this to say uh agree on price agree on terms try and get something for nothing see if
(11:49) you're gonna if you're gonna make an investment in any kind or you're trying to start a business there's usually a business that's already for sale or has a motivated seller an owner who doesn't want to do it anymore who almost give it to you for free right and that's the thing is when you're new you're getting so excited but you're not patient right that's why you have to have the character traits of being successful before you will see the success because if you if you have that character trait you'll look and you'll
(12:12) say i can take six months because in the in the decade of my in the next decade of my life there's no rush but me making a good deal or a bad deal of like should i put all my investment in this thing or should i be able to get something that makes four times more money for free you can do that you can do that and i'm telling you i talk to business owners every day i mean guys making a million two million four million dollars a year who literally have told me they're like dude if someone came today and offered
(12:38) me like guys who are making a million dollar a million dollars a year in profit like if someone had offered me 200 grand right now i would take it i just i'm so tired of this business so like there are opportunities they're just not listed anywhere you just got to look for them right and that's the thing no one will do it because it's work so but the good news is that if you have a little bit of work ethic you can make a tremendous amount of money with very little risk and do it the way the rich people that i know
(13:03) do it so otherwise have an amazing day keeping awesome i'll catch you guys upside bye
Building a Frozen Yogurt Store in 11 Minutes - YouTube

Transcript:
(00:00) frozen yogurt stores make twenty one hundred dollars a day selling 500 cups at eight ounces each and it was the business that I almost started instead of starting my gym so I know a ton about it and I will tell you how it works and what you can use from psychology that I learned from yogurt stores that you can apply to your business today when I was 21 years old I wanted to be an entrepreneur and I was deciding between which business I should start either a test prep business because I'd done really well on my standardized tests
(00:28) Fitness because I was in shape I liked Fitness people always talk to me about it and the third was frozen yogurt I did an extensive amount of research on how to open a frozen yogurt store a couple quick things that you may not know about Frozen your stores in general they on average make between 750 and 800 000 a year I thought eight hundred thousand a year that means I make 800 000 a year I'm Gonna Be Rich doesn't really work that way the average store that we're talking about does 2 000 plus dollars a day means 328 dollars a day in owner pay
(00:57) they run margins between 10 and 15 percent the average Menchie's owner for contacts makes ninety three thousand dollars a year take home not as sexy as you might think you've got strawberries that are going bad you've got machines that are breaking in the back you've got hard cost of yogurt you've got a retail lease that's prominently located with good signage Good Foot traffic ample parking like there's lots of other things that go into this business and on top of that if you wanted to buy into a franchise most franchises have six
(01:23) percent ish of top line that goes straight to them now that might not sound like much but if you're running 10 margins that's 60 percent of your take home so they have figured out a way to take the majority of the profit from their franchisees and what most people don't know is that franchises will structure their fees so you make just enough that you can keep going and maybe if you're a good operator open another location but not so much that you're going to get rich on it so they're only looking to optimize to beat the return on capital
(01:51) of the stock market by a decent amount if the stock market gets you 10 they're going to try and get 20 to 25 and they're going to squeeze off the top and take the rest because of how good their model is the flip side of that is that if you are into a franchise you should be saving enough on bulk purchasing because they're buying for 200 plus locations that they can save you on hard costs of things like yogurt fruit spoons cups machines Etc the converse of that though is that many times when you're starting the franchise they will up
(02:21) charge you on all of those things because they're trying to make money too there's the theory and then there's the practicality because I went on a site called rasmus.com it's a business foreclosure site I got my first gym equipment from that foreclosure site 13 Grand I sat there and I'd refresh every week until eventually one came up and I bought it all the gym equipment from a gym that went under a franchise won't let you do that because that's where they make their money but there are ways to open these things for cheaper I did a
(02:45) cursory search on there before this video and there were three frozen yogurt stores that were franchises that went under in terms of I could buy everything inside the store the most expensive the three was 20 grand you're trying to get into this world you want to go open a restaurant you want to open a gym go find foreclosure sites now you may have heard of some of these places Golden Spoon Yogurtland Menchie's Pinkberry if you search frozen yogurt store near you you probably have 30 locations that open up because there's demand for it the
(03:12) average cup size is eight ounces that people will buy the average split between toppings and yogurt 25 of people's weight is topping 75 is yogurt it's best for the store owner to have as much yogurt as possible in the cup because the toppings are more expensive so toppings cost between 10 and 40 cents per ounce most places charge between 20 5 and 60 an ounce they can even break even or lose money depending on which toppings you're getting you get the fruit it's costing them money but they make up for it in the fact that yogurt
(03:40) costs them about eight cents per ounce and they charge 50 even 60 sometimes that's where the margin of the business exists when you're working on margins that are even like 70 that means that you have 70 left to cover everything out so if you want to run a 50 margin business for example then you'd have to take 20 of your top line and pay every other Bill very hard to do for that twenty one hundred dollars a day they're selling roughly 500 cups a day of yogurt on average with an eight ounce cup of all those brands most of them are
(04:11) commoditized meaning there's very little difference between a Menchie's and a yogurt land and a Golden Spoon it's been a poorly competed Marketplace solely done by franchisors who are trying to sell as many locations as they possibly could rather than build a brand there is no Chick-fil-A of the yogurt world because if there were they'd be dominating the underlying lesson is that if you look at any Indus history there is the potential to have an amazing business inside of it even if it is a commodity today you can out-compete them
(04:39) all you have to do is walk into any Yogurt Land and see that the floors are sticky the chairs are all over the place the cups are a mess sample cups are strewn on the side the girl behind the counter is on her iPhone when you walk in doesn't say hello one of the nozzles is out it says out of order everywhere it doesn't take a lot to win most times just to beat everybody you got to be better than the bottom 25 and you make money one of my favorite things that I learned from one of the big breakthroughs that I think they had was
(05:06) actually how they priced ice cream is usually sold by cup you get a small you get a medium you get a large they flip that and made it wait the consumer gets to pick how much they spend someone might fill up a cup get to the counter and see seven dollars and be like ah I'm such a fat ass rather than when you buy one off itself and then you see the seven dollars you're like wow this place is so expensive because there's an element of control on the consumer side they are the ones you to Bear some of the accountability or responsibility for
(05:35) that fact the second thing that they did that I thought was brilliant they used to have small normal sized cups at yogurtlands someone I will bet you a few years ago ran out of small cups and then people only had the medium and large cups left and they realized that at the end of the day their sales probably went up by 20 or 30 percent and they wondered I wonder why our sales went up when you give people a bigger cup they will fill more of it they're like oh I guess this is standard the power of the default option when selling
(06:02) anything that's why assumed closes and things like that are so powerful when you say hey do you want this or this you can even listen for this at fast food places they're like hey do you want a medium or a large coat they have a small option but they want you to pick between the larger ones Yogurtland and those ones went a step further just remove the small option because it is self-serve but if you got a small amount of yogurt in a bucket-sized cup it just looks weird they did that and by extension were able to raise the amount of yogurt
(06:28) that people bought probably by a large percentage every single time and not take the blame for it because they're the one with the hand on the nozzle you'll also note that the order in which they present the items are reverse order of the cost to them so they start you with the cheapest option this is exactly how buffets work too they want you it fill up on the salad and then they put the seafood all the way at the end because they want people to fill their plates before they get the most expensive item they'll attract you with
(06:52) the expensive thing but they'll put it at the end of your self-service line you have the yogurt which is the highest margin first and then you'll have your dry items that don't go bad crumpled Oreos things like that and then you have the fresh fruit that goes bad that costs more money by ounce and so they get people to fill up their cup in the beginning with the highest margin then they sprinkle on a little bit of slightly lower margin and then when you have almost no room left then you put your few fruit on top if you get a pound
(07:17) of strawberries it's like 10 bucks you put that pound on the machine ounces there cost you 60 cents they'd be pretty much breaking even on that corporate noted that the number one way that they are able to get more customers and the highest performing stores did so with better service cleaner stores more selection and the most important one word of mouth when you have an average ticket that's so low like yogurt cups and you have margin even on that tiny little cup the only profitable way to really acquire customers is either word
(07:47) of mouth or Affiliates meaning other businesses that send you business they double down on that now when they started years ago Google search was cheap enough that they could actually drive pay-per-click campaigns to get people to their locations but nowadays it's too expensive for most of them so they almost all have to rely on the quality of the product and the experience the way that I was going to open my store was that I wanted to create a better experience for somebody walked in I wanted to have floor-to-ceiling kind of candy
(08:15) see-through experiences and when someone walked in they were overwhelmed and they would just turn turn the nozzle on there which by the way I would have it so they'd be really clunky so too much would fall through so I get a little bit more water on it and I always felt like that you should have more selection people eat more the more options you give them then my promotional effort my plan was to go to the university so I wanted to be close to colleges and then I was going to partner with all of the fraternities and sororities and have
(08:42) competitions between them to see who could get the most yogurt and then give some sort of Swag or something for the fraternity or whatever that got the most yogurt during that period of time I could rinse and repeat that process with companies I could rinse and repeat that process with affiliations and that is the cheapest form of advertising when you don't have a lot of money is going to find places where there's buckets of people that you can give them some sort of promotion to bring them in I'd run the competitions to bring them in I'd
(09:05) have a crazy incentive to get the text number like hey do you want to save 50 today by joining your text list I just acquired a lead that I can get lifetime value on for two dollars I'll take it because I know that I'm going to be able to get them back or get them to bring a friend and I want to be able to remind them of my store on a regular basis so if you're looking at stuff that you can model from the yogurt businesses and also not do that they're doing poorly number one when you have the option to give a customer the
(09:32) ability to pick their own pricing by usage do it oftentimes people will blame themselves not you when they overuse or overspend think about minutes back in the day or text messages number two you want the most people to see the thing that makes you the most money first we want to use up as much of their spending power on the things that make us the most profit number three if you have a type of product or service where someone can sample multiple things the more things you offer them the more things that they will ultimately buy and
(09:59) consume number four if you are starting a business unless it's something brand new and completely radical there's likely somebody who started a business just like yours who failed and you can oftentimes buy all their stuff for 10 cents or five cents on the dollar and and dramatically decrease your startup cost if you can get a decent amount of actual equipment for that amount of money when you go to the right seller and that is a motivated seller number five the power of the default option the fact that they went from removing the
(10:28) tiny cups to only giving large and bucket sized cups for yogurt encourage people to use more yogurt themselves and they do that because it looks silly in comparison six when you're trying to promote something that costs very little money especially consumer products it's very difficult to acquire customers with paid advertising profitably that's why a lot of these places raise funding if you don't have tons of cash and you're not funded then the two most profitable strategies for acquiring customers you get Word of Mouth which is referrals
(10:56) it's not just having a very good product which is important but reminding and encouraging people to share it my podcast I just decided to say hey guys if you could leave a review and share this with somebody that would be great as soon as we did that we 20xed the number of reviews that we were getting and our growth skyrocketed just because I asked by the way click subscribe and notification Bell and all those things and share those fantastic
13 Years of Marketing Advice in 85 Mins - YouTube

Transcript:
(00:00) I've been marketing for 13 years I built and sold nine companies I sold my last company for $ 46.2 million to American Pacific group I've also written two books on marketing that have sold over a million copies here's 13 years of marketing advice that will make you more money piece of advice number one start with low prices or even gasp free the reason that I say that is because if you start there then you can go up it's very difficult to come down and in the beginning you want to get flow through the system and so it's totally fine to start it free and then start bumping up
(00:30) from there and so I'll give you three quick examples and then I'll show you how to do this tactically so when I started my first ever business it was a online personal training business since this 13 plus years ago and when I started I didn't know anything and I was so afraid to charge people money to begin with and so but I did want them to pay something because I wanted them to be invested because otherwise people don't follow through with their workouts or their nutrition plans Etc and so I said hey just donate to the charity of
(00:53) your choice whatever charity you want to in exchange I will then train you for 12 weeks and so people would uh donate I think it was $500 or $1,000 was their choice to a charity of their selection and by doing that I actually got my first 13 or so customers just by making posts and dming people that I knew and it didn't feel weird because I was like hey I'm doing this kind of nonprofit thing I want to help you out if you want to lose weight and you can feel good about it and it's a write- off and so we
(01:16) were like oh this is pretty cool but the thing is is like that was the first time I ever did it and then from there I said huh would you guys be willing to pay me now after we finish this 12 weeks and a lot of them were like sure I was like yeah I'm the charity now uh so after I did a good job they were willing to do that and refer me customers the next business that I did this with was gym launch when I actually started uh flying out to other gyms so I used to do turnarounds and I did that for two plus
(01:40) years so I'd fly out to a gym set up all the pricing do the marketing all that stuff and I did it all for free and I did it that way because I didn't know how I could sell those gym owners and what I the deal that I made was I only make money if I make sales and I'll front the cash for the marketing so like they took zero risk on and I would do everything including pay for my hotel My Flights my my my food my rental car everything and but being able to do that it allowed me to get way more yeses quickly test out the system in 30 plus markets that I had which then eventually led me to licensing that system to 5,000
(02:11) Plus locations and that was the company that I that I sold to APG the third uh time that I did this was when I started my software company Allen and so when I started the company I was like I need to get some case studies I need some testimonials I need some I need some stories to show successes right and so I think a lot of people in the beginning think this is only a beginner thing but even if you're a big business business owner when you start out a new product or a new division um starting with free customers just makes a lot of sense and
(02:36) it's for four reasons one is that free customers become customers you become paying after the period as long as you do a good job so it makes money in one way the second way it makes you money is that they'll also refer your customers because if you do a great job they'll just send you other people and that can be contingent on why you do it for free for them the third is that they'll leave you testimonials and reviews so those reviews and those testimonials also you advertise and you can get more customers
(02:58) from them and then finally when whenever you do stuff for free I do it in exchange for feedback I say hey tell me what I could do to make this better and again it's not saying like tell me all the ways I suck it's just saying tell me how I can make this better tell me how I could make it worth it for you to want to stay and continue to pay and ideally the easy test of knowing whether or not this works is that they actually stay and pay afterwards and so it's the easiest way to get going on any new product and I think so many people start trying to sell stuff too soon without enough proof and in the beginning you
(03:30) suck that's why it's a new product you're new Division and so I'd rather not ruin my reputation say I'm giving away for free give the reason is I'm brand new at this thing or I'm trying this new thing out and that way I'll get a little bit of Grace and then that way I can make the thing better in iterative process much faster with way more people because I'm giving away for free or at cost and then once I get those massive success stories that they feel like they owe me because I've done a great job
(03:53) then I can Market those and go at full price so here's how you actually do this tactically going from starting at low prices to moving all the way to where you want to be which is high prices with big premiums right and so what I'd say is after you have your first test case study batch so call it 10 or 20 people depending on the size of your product or your services after that every five I just go up by 20% and so let's say okay I started at zero and I have a marketing agency I might say okay the first the next five I'm going to do for a th000
(04:21) bucks right and then from there I might say okay the next five I'm going to do for 1,200 bucks the next five I'm going to do for 1,500 bucks and you just keep going up by 20% until the conversion rate times the price goes down so that way you can just calculate the total amount of money made off of X number of sales calls and by doing that you'll be able to see okay here's the sweet spot where I sell the most amount of units at The Highest Potential price so my company gym launch that I sold for $46 million that company you know at its
(04:48) peak before I was selling it we were taking home over a million dollars a month in personal income but that's what a lot of people think happened the whole time but it wasn't like that the actual very first business that I started in Fitness I actually gave away my services for free I actually did it as a nonprofit for Chari so that I could get clients in the door and test out whether my stuff actually worked and that I could deliver services and when you're having the conversation with those first
(05:10) few people whether you're doing it for free or you're going to do it for a big discount you say hey I plan on going to this price point but I'm willing to do it for free in exchange for X which is usually a feedback feedback for me and a public testimony if you're comfortable doing it and by having those two things then one you guarantee that you get the feedback which is the thing you need most but you also can get the testimon that you can leverage and then finally you can also tack on a referral if you
(05:34) want to again I'd say the testimony and the referral should be contingent on you doing a good job and you say hey if I do a good job would you be willing to do these two things if they say yes then you're good to go the fourth one which is do they actually want to buy at full price later which will be the real test of how good you were and I think the bottom line here is that when you start out you're not that good and even if your ego is like kind of convincing you that you are good which I think is silly just even imagine two years from now
(05:58) that you're going to be much better than you are now well that guy is probably way more experienced so give that guy a running start by starting free now and then building momentum into it and I have this saying that I I repeat all the time in my team which is create flow monetize flow then add friction and so it's like you have to run water through the machine you have to get flow into the system to see where it's going to break so that you know what real actually looks like rather than just trying to get rich on Excel the second is the framework that I use for scaling
(06:27) advertising or scaling Marketing in any Niche more better new when you're starting out more is almost always the answer and so I remember when I was uh thinking about getting into content I uh I paid someone who had made you know a lot more content had a much bigger brand and I said hey um what should I be doing I like what should I do to make my content better and he's like dude he's like you don't need make your content better he's like you're just not making anything and so what he did was he pulled up his profile on LinkedIn and he pulled up my profile on LinkedIn he was like I posted five
(06:56) times a day you haven't even posted and then you pulled up Instagram and he pulled at my Instagram and he's like I posted two times a day you posted once a week I was like man he's like okay let's pull up YouTube and then my YouTube and he just went platform by platform and he showed that he was doing 3x 5x 10x the volume that I was and he was like dude you just got to do more and that was just like like I felt embarrassed because I just paid all this money to have someone just look at me and just say do more but hopefully I can save you
(07:22) the money and just tell you you probably need to do more and the interesting thing about this is that I later on had um like at the point now when we had maybe this is be a year ago I had fiveish million subscribers across all platforms I had a friend of mine who's a billionaire who wanted to start getting into personal branding and he said hey man can you check out my Instagram and see what's you know going on and why why we're not growing as fast as I want to and so I said well before I look at it I was like how many posts a week are you making across all platforms he's like oh got that nailed he's like I'm posting
(07:49) once a day and I was like dude I was like we post 50 plus times a day and he was like got it he just was like you don't need to say anymore I understand because he had had enough experience in other Realms to know that like oh all of the things in volume that that that work in sales that work in customer success that work in product in terms iterations the same Concepts apply to advertising and marketing like you just need to do a lot in order to figure out what works so that you can do better later now what's interesting about this is that this also applies on the paid side so I remember
(08:21) there was a chiropractor chiropractor agency that approached me they were doing about 2 million bucks a year and he was like hey man I think I've saturated Facebook and I was like and this is when it was Facebook not meta and I was like what do you mean he's like I just think I've saturated the chiropractor Niche and I was like this is a 10 billion doll year industry and you feel like your $2 million per year agency has saturated Facebook I like how many I was like do you know of any of chiropractor agencies that exist he's like yeah there's loads it's like you know there's hundreds of them I was like
(08:51) okay so explain to me why every sale that is keeping all of them in business is somehow not sales that you should be making he was like got it I was like right you're spending 40 Grand a month when in aggregate all the agencies that are selling to chiropractors are probably spending 4 million a month and so all of the spend that those businesses are able to make in your Market is your opportunity is if you can outcompete them you can provide better service you can have longer LTV means you can spend more to acquire the customer than they can and then you can eventually price them out of the
(09:21) marketplace because fundamentally paid ads is actually an auction for attention and so people bid against each other for ad space and so if you can out bid your competition you can have ethical Monopoly by literally bidding more than everyone else while still making money and that's the crazy thing and that's what fundamentally what you want to build in terms of the mous trrap of your businesses how can I make more money from every customer than anyone else does so that I can spend more than anyone else can to acquire them and so I had a I had a portfolio company uh CEO who's a good marketer you know come up
(09:48) to me and he was like hey man I think we really need to scale our ads and I was like I agree um and I was like well how many how many pieces of creative are you putting out you know per week and he's like oh um well I just record once a month I was like okay fine then how many ads are you making per session he was like uh we do about 15 so we do about 15 new ads per month and I just kind of looked at him I was like dude when I was trying to go from your size to five times your size I was making 35 a week
(10:14) and like nowadays we make way more than that in terms of content and in terms of the ads that we do like because I make ads for school and then I inform the ads across our portfolio and so the big saying that I have that's like plastered on the wall that actually applies to sales and marketing is volume volume negates luck like if you don't want to rely on luck and rely on one of those 10 ads or five ads that you make to be amazing you just make more ads and I I can't tell you the amount of times that it just reset the bar and that's what I'm hoping to do with this video is like the amount of volume that the people who
(10:45) are ahead of you are doing is is not 2x or 3x more it's often times 100x more right even the the 35 time uh 4 I think 140 pieces the guy was making 15 it was 9x the volume of what he was doing right and some of you guys are making five ads a month or one ad a month and thinking that that's somehow going to be sufficient to get to your goals and nowadays and I'll explain later in this help my whole ad creation process but just the big headline is that in the very beginning you just need to do a lot more than you think you do the second is once you've done more then at what point do you start shifting to better and the
(11:22) way that you can figure that out is when the return on effort for better exceeds one incremental unit of more meaning if I've got one sales guy if I add a second sales guy then I think I have a high degree of certainty that I can probably double my sales by doing that but when you have 10 sales guys adding one more sales guys is the same level of effort as adding going from 1 to two going from 10 to 11 but it's only a 10% increase and so if I can increase the overall throughput of my entire team by 20% or 25% by tweaking some sharp rate stuff or
(11:53) doing a headline split test or or changing ctas on my ads then those are things that would make me more money money per unit of effort and so in the beginning you usually just need to blow as much volume through there as possible that's the create flow monetize flow then net friction the the optimization steps really only matter when you have flow going through and so you do more first and then once you're big enough better becomes a better return on effort but once you then go through the better steps then you usually have to go back to okay how do we do 10 times more than
(12:22) we are now how do we go from 10 sales guys to 100 sales guys and that's the thinking that you have to go through in order to start scaling in terms of orders of magnitude and when you have so much volume you're able to iterate so much faster like even us recently we started making uh more content on YouTube and we already noticed as a team we were like oh this is awesome we're learning so much faster again with like we're literally putting out four five videos a week instead of one video a week and so we're learning about headlines and thumbnails and there's less pressure per video because we're
(12:51) like cool learn that let's move on to the next one and so it allows you to just iterate so much faster without getting your ego and your emotions you know tied into it here's how I do it is I ask the question what would stop me from 10 Xing the business right now and if the answer is nothing then we 10x the business now most times there is something that would break like what would break first and so as soon as we identify what is the first thing that would break if we 2x 5x 10x we then isolate that thing put all of our Focus towards fixing it and then we do the increase in volume and that is how we
(13:23) continue to DEC constrain until we go to the next bottleneck and then DEC constrain that and then grow into the next bottleneck because we have a fundamental belief that all businesses will continue to grow until their point of constraint and then they will grow no further so you identify the constraint relieve the constraint and allow it to grow again growth occurs as an after effect of the inputs you put into the system now once you've done as much as you can more and you've done it as well as you can better when you can't do any
(13:47) more any better you start and trying something new and the thing that the reason that I have new last is because the cost of change of doing something new is guaranteed but the return on something new is not and so I like to say that is a big warning for the fact that the vast majority of entrepreneurs want to spend 80% of their time on doing new stuff when really they should spend 90% of their time doing more and better of what is already working for them the only time you do new stuff is when nothing is working so when you're starting as an entrepreneur everything's new and you keep trying and keep trying
(14:17) until something works once it works you have to unlearn the whole experimentation idea and then you have to go great I need to do as much as I possibly can and do it as well as I possibly can and so it's a different mindset that you have to get into but that's how you start scaling now what point do you start doing something new well if you've already said okay I can't I can't do more for a very clear reason or there's a big cost like sometimes there's a huge incremental cost past a certain barrier you're like okay I think
(14:43) we really are you know let's say you're a local a local gym all right if you're a local gym and you're spending call it $10,000 a month on ads you're reaching every single person in your radius multiple times a week and so that's on one platform and so you're like okay in order for me to scale this it's not really about doing more or even doing that better it's like I've saturated the crap out of the eyeballs here well that's when doing something new will yield a higher return you get a better return on effort and so that's where're like okay maybe I'm going to start doing an outbound or I'll start doing the paid
(15:14) ads but just on another Channel I'll start running YouTube ads I'll start running Google search ads I'll start running um I'll start running display ads I'll start I'll start doing Direct Mail pieces I'll start radio at like there's a number of things you could do in terms of other channels but they would be new and so this is the thought process that I have when I approach that which is if you could double the sales of your company and it would take a year would you do it but you had to wait a year before they doubled most people
(15:39) would say yes if I said you had to invest call it half a Year's profits in order to getting your business to double would you do it yes that'd probably be a really good return on return on investment if you put half years profits and you double the business you're getting a 200% return that's awesome right and so the thing is is that people start something new and they spend one month of AD spend and they say H it didn't work I lost money why like I'm going to stop but the reality is that it's going to take you 3 months 6 months sometimes 12 months to get the that return to actually pay off and what I
(16:11) Mark is progress not the dollar so it's like okay first are we getting clicks okay we're getting clicks okay are we getting optins okay we're getting optins are the optins we're getting the right type of people that we're looking for okay yes or if they're not then we start tweaking the messaging we start tweaking the funnel until we get the right people okay now we have the right people who are opting in great now can we can we get them on the phone can we get them in person can we get them to show up to some sort of conversion event some sales event that we can then try and sell them
(16:34) something right and so you keep walking walking the dollar over the bridge until eventually it comes to the other side but that takes money and that takes time and that takes learning but it's a return on investment because if you do double your lead flow in a year one it doubles the business two it more than doubles the value of the business because now you have two different ways to get customers and so it makes the business more stable because if one of them goes down then you still have the other one and so you have a more stable business that's also bigger Market advice number three how to
(17:04) do better and so this is double clicking into the better concept because this is especially for the bigger business owners so if you're at a few million dollars a year to tens of millions dollars a year like this is really going to start paying massive dividend so number one is optimize front to back when it comes to marketing so that's the 8020 so David oovi said famously after you've ridden your headline you spent 80 cents of your advertising dollar so he knew that 80% of people aren't going to do anything past read the headline and
(17:32) so he'd put 80% of his effort towards those first few words and the Really experienced marketers who are watching this are like nodding their heads right now the first 5 Seconds the headline the packaging in my history of the 13 years that I've been doing this has only increased I haven't even gotten to a sweet spot they just continue to become more and more important in my mind because it's the frame through which everyone contextualizes what they're about to consume so one it increases the likely they consume it two it introduces the frame that they consume the advertisement or the promotion through
(18:03) and like we now have such great data even across on the content side that like if we have two different thumbnails you can literally see the average view duration go up by two or three minutes sometimes simply by changing the thumb that people click before they watch the video it's wild and so how people the frame that people consume the content in has a massive impact on how effective it is now I'll tell you a quick story to show you just how how important this is so a friend of mine um Dean had this massive advertising campaign and uh he
(18:34) had written a new book and he went on a Larry King live and so he wanted to use the Larry King interview to uh advertise the book and so he shot the whole interview and he basically wanted uh Larry King to introduce him in a cool way to make him you know sound cool of course you know and like he would laugh if I was if I'm telling the story now um and so he knew that the ad was killer and so he ran it 250 Grand and nothing came back and he was like what's going on like I know this I know this ad's a killer like what's happening so he went
(19:07) back through his old history of ads and he looked at the top performing ads he'd ever done and as soon as he started watching he realized that he missed the hook that the hook was wrong and so he flew Larry King back out they he paid him again they set up a whole new set again just to re-record the first 30 seconds and so they re-recorded the first first 30 seconds with the hourlong interview and then reran the infomercial and did 100 million in sales and so when I heard that story I was like this is
(19:39) why that the first 5 Seconds the headline The Hook is so important and that's what I spend now a disproportion of my time on and people are listening to this and you guys are nodding along but you're not you're still not getting it because it's not real for you and it took me forever to figure this out when we make ads and I'll get in my ad creation process later um you have like I I I do 10 times the effort on the first 5 Seconds 10 times actually 10 times so if I have an hour I would I would spend 55 minutes on the first 5
(20:10) seconds and then five minutes on everything that's after that like that's the proportion of how much time I'm spending on just getting that first part right I'll give you a Content example of this so I was invited to this uh content creator thing um with all the you know top guys probably 10 guys there uh the lowest guy in the room was me and the next l guy was at like 10 million plus subscribers only on YouTube so they just had me there cuz for entertainment who knows um and and I remember one of the
(20:36) guys had about 15 million subscribers and he was pissed that this other content creator had basically copied his video and and the copied video had done better than his like three times more it got like 30 million views and he got like 10 million views and the main guy there who had several hundred million uh subscribers across all his channels was like let's pop it in let's let's roast it and so they press play on on the video and 5 Seconds in he stops the video he's like dude you didn't confirm the thumb he's like the headline and the
(21:05) first five seconds weren't confirmed and he was like I don't need to see anymore and he just walked out of the room and so this guy had spent weeks you know making this thing obsessing about every detail of it he had a 20 Page Plus brief on how he was making this video and he missed the first 5 seconds and that was the guy who had the multiple hundred million uh subscribers was like that's it and he just walked out and got lunch and so when I saw that I was like wow like it just reinfor fored how important this was and recently just at a micro
(21:32) level one of our portfolio companies this is an 8 fig plus business um we simply changed the headline on the landing page like we did nothing else we kep same ads just changed the headline we increased booking rate by 62% now here's what's crazy is the optin rate remained the same but simply because of the frame of the promise in the headline 62% more people chose to book calls for that business and so it just shows you that how you frame what people are then going to consume has a massive impact on
(22:04) how much value and How likely they are to take the next step so here's how you do it in terms of optimizing 8020 front to back so number one is assume that they have no idea who you are what you do how it works they're in a rush and they have a third grade education all right so clear beats clever deletion beats explanation and so what you want to do is you want to try and make it as short as humanly possible and then once you have it as short as possible put into a third grade reading calcul later
(22:29) look at the grade level and keep editing it down until it's third grade because the thing is is you're not going to attract Dumber people you're going to make accessible to everyone a smart person needs to use less brain power to to understand simple language and it makes it understandable to everyone else and as a reminder 30% of people can barely read and so this is like relying on them to have this skill it's like you want to meet them where they're at and there are some very rich people who can barely read and so it has nothing to do
(22:56) with intelligence has everything to do with how they're educated which has which may have no no connection with their purchasing power okay and tactically what I'll do is I probably I'd make about 50 hooks every time I start recording ads so I have 50 hooks that I've written down that I think are awesome and then I have three to five meat pieces of an advertisement and then I do one to three ctas meaning call to actions at the end and so that means I have way more on the front end in terms of effort compared to the one the 3 to five and the 1 to three
(23:24) that I do on the back and that's because I know that that's where all of the effort needs to go cuz that's where all the returns are and here's the here's the difference and this is why I say from you optimize advertising specifically from front to back because it's very rare that you're going to be able to double or triple or quadruple the amount of throughput you get uh in a funnel by optimizing the back end if you have a you know a 30 you know call it a call a 50% show up rate okay if you get it to 75% that's massive but it's a 50% jump and that would be a massive increase in show rate if you did that
(23:52) but I can absolutely get ctrs from 1% to 4% by just optimizing the hell out of the front end and then that's a 4X increase that's four times the throughput that goes through the entire funnel and so I put my effort there because you can achieve 100% 200% 300% increases on the front end oras it's much more difficult on the back end now for sure you want to optimize those things but if I'm going to allocate my effort I want to get the biggest bang for buck so when you're making your hooks I called a call out so I'm reading page 136 from my
(24:20) book a call out is whatever you do to get the attention of your audience call outs go from hypers specific to get one person's attention to not at all specific to get everyone's attention so let me explain if someone drops a a tray of dishes in a party everyone looks if a child yells mom then the mom's look if someone says your name only you look but again they all get attention and so I try to make my call outs as specific as possible to get the right people but broad enough to get as many of them as I can so pay close attention to advertisers use call outs especially the
(24:49) ones targeting your audience and so what I'll do is I'll look at all the ads from other competitors who are targeting that same audience as me and the ads that are running a very long time I know that that call is working well and so I will write down all the call outs that I see and then I will write out the words that I know my customers go by and I'll either start with a problem that I think that they're struggling from or a question that I think that I know that they'll say yes to or I'll simply State
(25:12) moms in Nevada homeowners in Clark County right very clearly calling out this is for you and that's exactly what you want the person to say when they read the headline or hear the call out this is for me and the more specific you get often times you'll be surprised you think that going as broad as you can is going to increase the number of optins but when you get really specific about the type of customer you're really trying to attract you will often find that they're like oh I wouldn't have responded to the broad thing but this one's just for me and you get more people in terms of qualified leads in
(25:43) the door by being more specific piece of advice number four LTV to CAC is the only thing that matters and if I had only one metric that I could find out about a business if I only had one that I could pick it would be the LTV to CAC ratio and let me tell you quick story that kind of drive this home so uh a friend of mine owns a bow manufacturing business and they do you know 23 million bucks a year so relatively large business established and he was like hey uh we're trying to get into PID ads now they had all these distribution relationship but they want to open up this new channel and he says hey you're
(26:14) the you know you're the marketing guy right so can you you know what would you do here and so as I was explaining the the process that I that the strategy I want to outline for him he was like well what's the Benchmark I should be looking at in terms of leads and I was like dude The Benchmark is irrelevant it everything just comes back from what's gross profit so it's like okay so what's the average gross profit on a bow I'm making this up say it's $500 okay so if we get leads for call it 20 bucks and we
(26:37) know that we can get one in five leads to buy a bow then it means it cost us our CAC is $100 and our gross profit from selling each bow is $500 so it cost us $100 to make $500 a gross profit 5 to one awesome and so fundamentally is $20 a good lead cost well yeah he's getting 5 to1 if it was at $10 uh then he you'd be getting 10 to one and that's assuming the same ratios and so it just depends on what percentage of customers you convert and at what price point you're converting them at CA to LTV or CAC to
(27:07) LT GP so I use ltp to be more specific lifetime value is just the amount of gross profit you make from a customer over the lifetime of them being a customer of your business CAC is the cost to require a customer which is the all-in cost including sales marketing software everything to get someone to give you money and so the cact TV ratio is simply how much money it costs you to make more money it's the foundational economic unit of any business and so making sure that you know how much money it costs you to make money that fundamentally feels like a very important metric in order to scale the
(27:37) business and over time as long as you don't have uh some big Capital expenses in terms of scaling your business that fundamental return that you get will reflect the compounding growth of the business provided you don't have other constraints to growth so for example if I have meals that I sell for $10 and it cost me $9 to package and ship them and deliver for them then I have $1 of gross profit per meal and so if someone buys 10 meals for me I'm not making $100 I'm making $10 in gross profit and if the average person buys call it five weeks
(28:10) of meals then I would make $50 in lifetime gross profit and so the only way that I would want to be able to acquire customers is that the cost to acquire customer in this example I'd want to have probably at $15 or less because you can't do it at even because then there's no money left over to do everything else in the business and so the rule of thumb is that you want have at least 3 to one on LTV to CAC but again LTV is not lifetime Revenue it's lifetime gross profit right and that's what people I think a lot of times mess up is they don't even know what their
(28:35) gross profit is and then they spend blindly so I'll tell you a fun one so if you've seen Starbucks advertise now a lot of them they just use their storefronts as they're advertising at this point but they make about $14,000 in LTV per customer and so they can spend absurd amounts of money to get customers in the door like even if it cost them $500 they're still making 28 to1 on the money they put in and that is why that company's been able to scale to the Moon in terms of the number of locations and so I will say that the all the money that I've made in my life that has been the crazy money has come from crazy LTV
(29:11) to CAC ratios and so the smallest ratios that I've made crazy money on is 30 to1 all the way up to 100 to1 to 200 to1 returns in some of the businesses I have and so those those windows don't stay forever and when you do have one of those you just want to dump as much money into that machine as you possibly can because a lot of wealth is made in very short punctuated periods and then sustained by long periods of Maintenance where you're getting 5 to1 8 to1 10: one those are fine numbers but most of the time when you're at 10 to1 as soon as
(29:40) you start scaling it it might drop to 5 to1 and so I actually end up seeing the bigger the ratio is at the beginning the more indication it is that I can scale profitably because if I'm let's say spending you know $1,000 a day and I can get 100 to1 then I know that I'm probably going to be able to get to $100,000 a day and get five to one right and so that's the idea is like how can I how can I scale this up and I care about absolute return not relative return but the CAC to LTV ratio gives me an indication how much room I have to blow this thing out of the water the easiest
(30:10) way to calculate what your lifetime gross profit is is look at all the customers that you sold over the last year look at gross profit and if you don't know what gross profit is it's just the cost of good so basically the price you charge minus the cost of goods sold which is whether it's if it's Services then it's the labor that used to provide the service if it's a widget then it's the cost of the widget and the shipping associated with it so the cost of good sold minus the revenue and that left over is the gross profit and so you say okay I had 100 customers this year I
(30:38) made this total amount of gross profit this year you divide that amount of gross profit by the total of number of customers that'll give you a broad brush stroke of what you make per customer now that'll always underestimate it especially if you have a recurring Revenue business because they're going to hopefully have some people who buy again and again over time but I would always rather be on the safer side and underestimate my lifetime gross profit or time value rather than overestimate and potentially lose money if I want to
(31:01) then take that number and say okay well what am I willing to spend per customer then at most you want to have a third of that number but for me specifically I want to make sure that whatever I collect in the first 30 days I want to make sure that I collect that back from customers so if I'm s let's say I sell something for 10 bucks a month people stay for 10 months and there's 100% gross margins to make this simple so I make a 100 bucks in gross profit I want to see if I can find a way to make $10 back or get my CAC back in that first 30 days and so sometimes it means having a one-time upcharge up front so they can
(31:35) offset the cost of acquisition so then the remainder of the customer relationship can be profitable and if these Concepts about scaling like LTV toac are interesting to you we just opened up a new workshops division at acquisition. comom for companies that were not invested in if you like us and my team to help you personalize kind of applying this stuff to your business you can go to acquisition.
(31:54) comom click the scale button and you can see if your business qualifies otherwise back to the video piece of advice number five my ad creation process so I've been running ads for 13 years and I'm saying when I say running ads I mean like I've been making ads or directly influencing ads that have been run across my portfolio or companies that I directly owned or founded for 13 straight years and so I have this process pretty nailed and I haven't really ever gotten too far away from it partially because I like it a lot um and I've gotten just pretty good
(32:21) at it and so this is how I do it so number one is that at all times I'm collecting data what I mean by that is like if see ads on Instagram I see ads on YouTube like I have no Premium Accounts on any platform because I want to hear the ads I want to hear the hooks I want to hear what they're doing to draw attention and I like using that stuff because I'm also a business owner so the people who advertise to me are the people that are going to try and hook my attention and so I can still use that stuff to get to my avatar and so if you are your avatar the ads count double
(32:49) for you and so I I I screenshot I record the stuff that I find interesting and I add it into one folder then when I get to my ad creation process which is I do once a week I then sit down down first thing in the morning and I do these the same day I record so that's just a piece of advice that that has worked well for me like cramming for the test I cram for my ad sessions because then everything's top of Mind as I go into the day and so I pull up all my swipe files of all the things that I want like my inspiration
(33:12) from the second thing that I pull up is all my historical best performing ads so I look back one years two years three years sometimes at all my best ads and I drink those back in and I watch the first 10 seconds watch the first 30 seconds you see okay how was I capturing what was the angle what was the hook here and then I start the actual hook creation process now 40 of my 50 hooks that I'm going to write out are going to be stuff that is tried and true I'm not going to try and reinvent the wheel we've already spent zillions and zillions of dollars I know that these hooks these entrances work well now 20%
(33:43) the last 10 is where I get to use all my inspiration and other ideas to try and experiment on but most people flip this they try and do a little bit of the stuff that worked and then they have lots of new ideas I'm telling you I've done this a long time it's way more efficient to just do more of what worked and then leave a little bit of experimentation so that if some of those things stop working over time you have this fresh batch that you've been trying out that then can become the control that you try and beat so siding back to
(34:06) the 8020 concept of you put 80% of your effort into the hooks and 80% of your effort goes into stuff that's tried and true and 20% for the things that are new all right so I make about 50 hooks so 80% of that is 40 Hooks and 20% of that is 10 hooks so 40 out of my 50 hooks I do for things that I already know have worked in the past 10 hooks I save for my new creative ideas is and so that's for the inspiration stuff that I see or anything that I come to that cram session that I want to get out from there I then have my three to five
(34:35) angles that I'm going to write that's going to be educational or some sort of value uh that I'm going to deliver or some sort of belief that I want to break or some sort of list or steps or stories that I want to tell as the core me to the ad some sort of proof I want to demonstrate and then finally just a quick CTA in terms of call to action but the majority of my effort is all on the 50 or so hooks that I'm going to write 40 of which being recycled versions of things I already know work and 10 being new and this sounds boring and it is
(35:00) boring but it's also what works and believe me I have tried to change this process a lot of times like this works let's say that you have your a mega winner and these happen and this is where you get this is the this is power law like that top 5% makes 95% of your income like you we run all these ads to figure out which is the one ad that can sing and just crank and print money and so what I do is I I use something that I call the collidoscope process I've never heard anyone El sell it so I'm owning that title all right and so the cloudex
(35:30) process this is how you do it is that let's say you've got a winning ad so I had an ad at gym launch that actually uh the now president kale made when he was a customer um of him in front of his gym the gym being full and his wife's next to him and he's like you know 6 months ago I was working a full-time job in order to pay rent at this gym and my wife was pregnant and we had a and I had a two-month-old and I had no idea how I was going to make ends meet and then here we are 6 months later the gym is
(35:54) full it's completely outsourced and I've already got an offer for $2 $150,000 on the gym if you've ever been worried like take the jump just follow the process it works right it very simple ad but it murdered it absolutely crushed and so rather than say wow okay well that was nice let's try and do that let's try and get somebody else to see that we took that we squeeze the living life out of it and so here's 10 things that I did to get more out of that ad so one is I changed the color of the backgrounds if I can do that right or backdrops is there a way that we can record that ad with a different background or a
(36:26) different background color like if you have a green screen second is are there different props that we can introduce that at all right so can we show stuff can we can we show visuals or we can show physical props three can we just reenact it just say hey kale can you just do it again just literally do the same ad different T-shirt If you want same exact thing just do it again and if you're the one making the ads you just do your best performing ad again you can four reorder it so we took the ad that was already the original winner and we just re rechanged the order up of the ad
(36:52) and it still converted the next thing we added visual filters so think black and white think sepia think High contrast low contrast these are all different things that made the ad look different than it was but it still delivered the same message the next one is visual effects right V effects like dudads and and whizbangs and things like that that you can add again make it look different the next is changing fonts and captions so it's like if we had a font style that was one way we just change the way the
(37:16) font style looks another is that you can change the pacing or the speed of the video itself you can actually do it at 1.2 or 1.5 and have it go through or slow it down at portions you can add music to it um there's another one right you can also also use the same hook which is like we knew the hook from that first ad obviously crushed and then just say hey re-record it again we'll use the same hook and use a different back right and so all of those are different ways that will take a winner and then 10x or 100x how much that winner gets us and
(37:41) I'm telling you if you if you take one thing from this video from advertising squeeze the living how out of the winners so Market advice number six is that there is only four ways that you can let other people know about your stuff and so think about this like a four box you've got one to one conversations and one to many which is broadcasts right those are the two styles of communic either communicate to a group of people or one person individually and you're either talking to people who know who you are or you're talking to strangers and so if you cross
(38:05) that you've got four ways you've got one to one to people who know you one to one to strangers one to many to people who know you one to many to strangers and if you look at that in terms of what that is in advertising it means this is warm Outreach cold Outreach making content which is one to many to people you know and then running ads which is one to many to strangers and so there's the only four things that you can do to advertise to let people know about your stuff and basically if not spending your
(38:28) day doing one of those core four things you are not advertising you are not marketing your business and so sometimes it gets you have to get it to that simple when you look at how many hours per day am I spending letting people know about my stuff most people spend zero zero zero per day letting people know about their stuff and then for some reason they're curious as to why their business isn't growing well no one knows you exist I was at a conference I was at jimc con recently and I asked the audience who here wants to grow their gym faster everybody raised their hand and I said okay and these are all small businesses so these are most of the guys
(38:59) here are doing I would say $500,000 a year to $3 million a year so these aren't massive businesses these are normal you know one location three location five location uh owner operators of service-based you know training businesses and I said okay who here is spending the first four hours of their day promoting their business either doing cold Outreach making content or running ads who is spending the first four hours every day on that literally no one in the audience had their hand raised and I was like this is why you're small like this is it like it
(39:30) was mind-blowing to me that that was what it was and so if you're if you're making less than call it a million maybe $3 million a year like all of your effort the the first four hours of your day which if you have to wake up early awesome if you have to stay up late to do it awesome I don't care but you need four hours that you're dedicating because you got to you got to do the job of promoting and then you got to run your business but if you're just running your business you're never going to get ahead so if you want it to grow you got
(39:55) to force it to grow you have to force people to find out about your stuff and you do that through advertising I recommend this so violently because small businesses need to do more and in the beginning they just don't get enough leads so fundamentally like most businesses if you just had more leads you would make more money now realistically and I'll get to some of the some of the specifics on this is that in order to get more leads you need to be able to do so profitably which then comes back down to the business and building the business back to front we
(40:23) advertise front to back we build the business back to front and I'll get to lots of details on that in a second but big picture you just need to get especially when you're starting out you're at 500 a million you know Less Than 3 million and those are big numbers so I don't I don't mean that to demean it but I want you to build massive Enterprises that make huge impact you have to get more flow through the system so that you can learn how to improve the product so that you can build a better back end and then you basically you promote and you stay at
(40:51) that level of promotion until you tweak this and nail it then you go back and scale it and so one of our sayings internally is nail it then scale it so nail the back end you do enough promotion to get flow in right then you monetize then you create friction that's when you tweak the hell out of it and then you can go back and say hey turns out we can spend five times more to get customers then you scale so I'll give you my quick back of napkins scaling framework for this so when you're at 0 to six figures you sell one product to
(41:18) one avatar on one channel that's it no shiny object no multiple channels no trying to scale yourself out of it you're just selling one product to one Avatar on one channel when you go from six to seven figures you scale you sell one product to one avatar on one channel consistently because in the beginning you're super volatile right you're not you're making a sale this week not next week then this week again or then next month whatever it's super volatile when you get to Seven Figures it's more consistent you just you you get it to be reliable so when you go from Seven figures to eight figures you go one
(41:48) Avatar one channel two products that means you have an upsell you sell something else and then you do that consistently right that's what gets you to eight figures that's what gets you to 10 million bucks a year and if you want to go to you know multiple eight figures then you start going two channels one Avatar two products consistently and so over time this is how I've seen I've just seen this pattern now can you find somebody who disobeys this pattern sure ag1 has one product one Avatar a zillion channels right so yes there are ways to
(42:21) break this rule but when I look at by and large the vast majority of businesses they follow this structure and they mess up along the way until they follow the next step and you'll notice that scaling up to eight figures and even sometimes a little beyond that you're still only focused on one Avatar and I'm going to talk about this in a lot of depth in one of the later advice points because it's super important and this may be one of the bigger unlocks you could have in the business Market advice number seven State the facts and
(42:44) tell the truth this is probably one of the most repeated phrases besides volume negates luck that I have internally to my business and so I remember when I was at that same little Meetup with uh the super creators and I was I was talking to the guy who had the the most you know subscribers there and I was like yeah you know like we don't really like this whole clickbait title thing and he looked at me with disgust he was like you absolutely make clickbait titles he said you just back it up with truth he's
(43:10) like so it's crazy click baity he's like but it also happens to be true and I remember when he said that to me I was like that's that's real and it's funny because that was a concept that I have in terms of uh paid ads but I hadn't thought about it in terms of content and so it's so interesting how some of these principles just apply across across domains but like sometimes you have to relearn the same lessons which I hate doing but I did it anyways and so the problem is that most businesses don't track results and it's because if you don't track you don't
(43:39) care now they don't track partially because if they it's kind of like ignorance like they know they don't deliver good results and so if they track it then they'll have facts and truth that they will be proven that they're delivering bad results but the first step is tracking it because once you start tracking it you can improve it and measurement as intervention is actually a scientifically proven method to lose weight to improve sales to improve anything you want you can literally simply tracking it not trying
(44:02) to do anything else but simply tracking your weight simply tracking your close rate simply tracking your ad performance will improve it because you're just putting attention on it and so if you don't track you don't care now once you do start tracking it you can start doing things to actually improve it Beyond just measurement as intervention and so when you do that loan and behold your stats get better and then you can State the facts and tell the truth and have that truth be wildly compelling and so Real Talk part of the reason that Jim
(44:32) launch to this day has still not been beaten or dethroned as the the the largest company in that space is because we still have better stats and better results than anyone else does the average gym who goes through 12 months of gym launch makes over a 100 plus thousand a year an added profit by using the systems we have that's just what it is and so like if someone if it makes sense for somebody to Triple their money then they make the they make the the purchase right it's it's I like to take a lot of emotion out of the sale like if this makes sense for you if this return makes sense for you then do it if it doesn't make sense then don't do it now
(45:04) the risk they take on is what about the bottom 20% and so the nice thing is that we track that so the bottom 20% averaged $40,000 in additional Revenue so they basically broke even and so it's like that's the bottom and so like if if if that's you then it's like yeah you worked and you basically broke even that kind of sucks now I'm not talking about the top 20% because this gu had 500,000 plus per year but the thing is is that if you track the stats then you can promote the stats and you can do so truthfully they go from unsubstantiated
(45:28) claims to substantiated claims like one of the things that I'm most proud of in school uh school.com which is the platform for people who are trying to start their businesses this video is mostly for people who already own a business but if you're trying to start a business um 3.
(45:41) 44% of people who finish their first month make their first dollar online like I'm super proud of that and we just rolled out this massive new thing um to basically make it even easier even faster to do it right now we have 35% more people actually succeeding there so I think we're going to be at a little bit over 40% now um so I'm super stoked about that but like unless you measure like if you don't track you don't care here's the Tactical steps collect data first so you implement a data step where you collect data from people day one day 30 day 60 day 90 at the end of the program or whatever your implementation is you track data
(46:11) throughout number two is you keep improving things until the data becomes compelling and number three is how do you actually present that data so there's four variables that matters when you're presenting the data number one is the percentage of people whether that's the median the average or the percentage overall of people that's number one who two achieve X outcome three in ytime or after X attempts and four under Z conditions and so it's like we get x% of gyms so it was whatever is the average average gym so right average gym owner makes an extra $100,000 per year in
(46:44) profit so that's the outcome after their first 12 months in gym Lords or Gym Legacy which is the the program that we have at gy launch right and so those are the conditions right and so it covers all four of those so when you're making these you want to you want hit all four of those things when you're explaining the data publicly and I will say that the fewer conditions you have the more compelling it is because for example if I said uh the average gym who spends $10,000 a month and has 10 employees and uh has two two methods of acquisition
(47:15) and a large group training and a small group training achieves that like by the time I even get that you're like whatever right and so you want to you want to strip away and really like I would rather have a fewer condition statement that has lower results me personally than a higher result one with more conditions marketing advice number eight say what only you can say show what only you can show and this is one of the other isms that I have internal to my business and so if you're the only triple black belt in Ohio for Mu Thai
(47:46) then say that you're the only triple black belt in Ohio for Mu Thai right this is talking about the things that you have done rather than telling people what to do it's how I versus how to and so my my concept for making amazing ads and making amazing content is two steps do epic stuff talk about what you did and so you can out outcome people or you can outwork them so it starts with the outworking and then the outworking creates the out outcoming and the out outcoming is a much shorter headline but
(48:16) the outworking them still works right I can start by saying hey I uh I I wrote These two books writing two books would be an outworking thing like anyone could do it there's no outcome but hey I wrote These two books but then if the books are good then I get the outcome which is that we sold over a million copies they're still number one and number two in marketing to this day multiple years later and so the idea is that first you do the work and then you get the outcome but most people want to say epic stuff
(48:39) having done none of it and so you can get past the Judgment of other people because you're not saying hey you have to do anything I'm saying this is what I did and so the idea is that everybody wants a return on their time all right and I remember hearing this first concept from arak who's a a YouTuber and he said dude I made this thing where I went on 100 dates in uh basically I did an entire season of The Bachelor but I did it in 16 minutes he's like what a steal and he said that to me I was like man such an interesting concept like he
(49:09) just took something that was really long and made it really short and he crammed it in there so value per second was super high and I'll just give you this one is that it's not about seconds of value it's value per second that's what matters like everybody has access to infinite information so you just saying I'm going to give you more stuff is not helpful what you want to do is curate it and pack it and distill it and crystallize all the value in as tight a package as unly possible so that their value per second skyrockets and you can do that by saying hey I spent 10 hours
(49:37) editing you know uh you know I spent I spent 20 hours making a summary of This Book and you can read the whole thing in 10 minutes that's why summaries still always work right because people want to get a deal on their time if they get the same result for a fraction of the time it's always a good deal by the way if you ever want to sell to rich people just promise the same result in half the time for twice the price and even if you think about video overall it's like well I spent 13 years doing all this stuff
(50:00) and I'm trying to compress those lessons into whatever amount of time this video is certainly less than 13 years and so this is a great deal for the right person for the right business owner who's actually trying to scale so how do you actually do this so if I had an marketing agency showing what only I can show I want to demonstrate and so I do say hey I'm going to get you leads what I want to do is get on a sales call and I'm going to play with a live lead that I got for one of my companies one of my
(50:25) clients sounds like and I'd be like hey listen to this call it's a minute long do you think you could how could you take 50 of these a month wow so much more compelling than say I'll just get you 50 leads they're actually getting a a fractionalized version they're getting a taste of what it looks like to be in the future right they're experiencing the result vicariously through the other person and fundamentally that's what a good testimonial does is they they put themselves in the shoes of the person who got the result and then they account they they put a discount on that and say
(50:50) okay how How likely is that for me and that's what I'm willing to pay now if it were guaranteed then all money-making opportunities would be worth it because hey if you spend $1,000 to make $100,000 a year by buying this course then everyone would buy it if they knew for sure it would happen that' be an amazing deal the problem is that people apply a discount to it because of how unlikely it is for them and so we want to increase that likelihood by showing them rather than telling them right and so agency example that was that one the
(51:14) software example that I have is this is why demos are so effective right you want to see this hey you have a a video clipping software great do you have a video on you cool send it to me we're on the phone great I'm going to pull this video up this is what we do to put the captions on and and shorten and find those moments click click click click click okay so normally how long does that take you well it takes me this long well watch me do it click click click wow would that make your life easier yes cool boom they go in right you're demonstrating in advance and I'll give
(51:40) you a final one when I was at my gym in Huntington Beach my first location I ever had I remember this I had a door to door sales guy who came up all right and this guy was a clear S pro he was really good um and he sold me cleaning productss he really did like it's it's probably the only door to- door thing I've ever bought and it was just cuz it was such good it was such a good sale and he had it down it's so tight I think he was in and out in like 13 minutes like it was stupid and so he just said
(52:04) hey I've got this stuff it'll take care of any stain that you've got on this floor and I had Turf and so I had gum that had got in the turf it was really black and like gone in there and so he just took that thing and he poured it on the gum and he just got on his hands and knees he scrubbed it and it actually came out and the gum was actually impossible to get out and I was like wow like he I didn't have to think will this work for me he just did it in front of me on a stain I actually had he's like cool looks like you got 20 other stains if this is worth it it's 100 bucks for
(52:28) this stuff so I paid a 100 bucks for some cleaning supplies but it was totally worth it right and I ended up using that stuff for actually Years cuz I had to you sold my huge gallons of it right um and so again it's whenever you can and don't say oh this doesn't work for my business try and imagine how can I make this work for my business show them what what they will experience and do it in a way that no one else can do it and so for example me I the reason I say like do epic stuff and then talk about it is that you continue to live life every day and so things continue to happen and so you can
(52:59) use the things that happen that you're doing as the content that you're making and the content will always be shorter in the amount of time it took for the thing to happen and so we have a portfolio of companies and so I share case studies on this channel of like hey here's how we added 40 sales guys here's how we you know increased you know we cut cut refunds by 2/3 here's how we XYZ it's because we're doing stuff and then we just talk about what we did and so the key Point Step One is do stuff and
(53:22) then step two talk about it everyone else is stuck in the step where they don't want to they want to figure out what to talk about but it's because they haven't done anything if you do stuff you have more than enough to talk about marketing truth number nine how and when to expand your Market there's five ways now big picture the vast majority of people need to do way more with their current market so just to give you context on this I had a guy who came out to a workshop and he said hey I uh I'm a coach who coach coaches right I was like all right fine and he said I'm spending
(53:47) you know I'm making two million bucks a year it's a really saturated space so I think should I go broader to General business and I was like dude how many coaches coaching coaches exist he was like zillion and I was like dude I think you just need to get better because if you were the best coach of coaching coaches then you would be able to take all of the market share that all of those guys have and it would come to you right Winner Takes all if you're the best and so just to give you an example and this is the one I gave him I said
(54:09) gym launch everyone knows there a gym company but you don't know how Niche it really is so one we didn't work with personal trainers number two we didn't work we do now but we didn't for the first four or five years work with big box facilities so large you know facilities where you pay you know $10 to 70 bucks a month to have access to those the pool the rocketball thing the cardio area the weights basketball whatever we we didn't work with them at all I call this facility leasing we didn't use those we didn't work with yoga we didn't work with spin we didn't work with Pilates we literally only worked with
(54:41) micro gyms that did before and afters of weight loss and Transformations they had to do Fitness and weights or some combination of those that was it that's a niche of a niche of a niche and that business still cranks out 30 plus million dollars a year all right and so the idea here is that you want like the market if you are the best is still massive you just need to solve the thing that matters most which is being the best now if you have solved being the best there's five ways that you can expand and so I'll tell you what we did
(55:13) because Jim launch has expanded I told you now we do do big box but there's five ways you can expand one I think about it like a pyramid so let's say you're in the middle you can go up Market meaning you go to higher value customers so for us that would be health clubs the big boxes like our I was talking about multilocation owners or franchise ORS those would be going up Market more valuable but fewer of them like the pyramid on the other hand you can go down Market I could go after personal trainers I didn't go after them
(55:36) we don't go after them but if I wanted to that would be a move that I could make I would have to sell a lot more volume at a lower price and build the infrastructure to support that kind of volume I could go adjacent which would be okay I've got gyms I'll do chiropractors I'll do or I've got gyms and I can do weight loss uh clinics right or Med spas or something like that so something that's adjacent that serves a similar Avatar but a slightly different business model that would be adjacent and the fifth way you can do it
(55:59) is that you actually go narrower so that was the fourth way so the fourth way is you can go narrower which is say Okay instead of all gyms or just micro gyms that service uh before and afters I say I only do you know uh ones that do weights or I only do ones that only do cardio right or I only do boot camps or I only do semi-private like I Niche down even more the alternative is that you go broader and I say anyone that's in health and wellness and so those are the five ways that you can spend you can go up Market you can go down Market you can go Jason Mark you can go narrow or you can go broad now despite me saying these
(56:30) five ways of expanding and everyone gets their juices you know their jollies off by thinking about how they're going to expand most time I'm going to start with that original story which is that you can make 10 20 $50 million a year just serving one very specific Avatar and the vast majority of businesses this is including portfolio companies that we purchased I would say I would say more than half the portfolio companies we've purchased we did this exercise and we made the Avatar narrower we got more
(56:53) specific not broader I learned this process from Vista private equity so if you don't know who they are they're hundred billion plus private Equity one of the most successful private Equity of all time they focus on software companies and I talked to their head of pricing and packaging and he gave me this one line and it changed my life and he said you want to know how we get the crazy returns that we do and I was like yeah obviously I want to know what you guys do now obviously they do lots of things but the one thing that he pulled out he said we just know the company
(57:15) that we're buying customers better than they do and so we get we go into the data room so whenever you do an acquisition there's something called a data room you put all the data for your business in there so people can analyze it and make a decision about whether they want to invest and so we go into the data room and we analyze all their customers and we say okay we order them by who pays the most and who's worth the most and we say this is the 20% that does 80% of the revenue and what they do is they look at what channels those people come in on what offers what
(57:39) marketing those customers do and they basically stop doing the rest of the 80% and then they expand that 20% to be 100% of the business and so by doing that they can have the same siiz business but 5x the revenue and arguably even more on the profit and so just power law the the prto principle 802 and they just apply it to the customers and so right now this is how you do it for you is you look at all the customers you have up to this point you look at the top 20% and you say okay what do these people all
(58:05) have in common and so I like to think about this in terms of psychographics what do they think Geographics what do they live demographics what do they look like and then I would say like actions like what have they done or what did they do to get this result and so when I look at each of those frames I try and eliminate as many variables as I can so I get to two or three variables that that Clump all the best customers together and then I make that in my marketing and I tell my sales team we only sell these people going forward because I know that these people are
(58:29) worth five times more 10 times more and then guess what's able to happen we run ads for those people and then our LTV skyrockets so we can spend more to Aire customers and this is what allows you to scale by going narrower and so the problem is that most business owners can't say no to fast money and so they never get the big money and so I had two companies that came out for a workshop uh that we had and um one they're both agencies it was a very simple example so one was a generalist agency they just did anybody who knocked on the door they would they would take their money the
(58:59) other one just did Professional Services so that's Legal Financial Insurance like those types of services and the the generalist guys I said okay you have this big list of customers I'm sure that there's a Subs segment of those customers that you do exceptionally well with they're like oh my God we crush it for it people and I was like okay cool so what percent of your customers are those they're like 8% I was like but are they more profitable about percentage he's like oh by a mile they're by far the most profitable I was like okay so
(59:24) if your entire business and they were really string in terms of infrastructure they're like super stressed out you could see it I was like if your whole business was just those do you think you would like that business and he was like oh my God that would be a breeze and I was like well then we can build that business and so that means that from here on out you only sell those people and over time the slight the percentage of the pie that's those customers is going continue to increase until eventually you can cut the customers that are not your main thing and then in a year or two years you've completely transformed your business to something
(59:48) that's been productized you get really efficient you get even better at it because you only serve those customers you get better at acquiring them get better servicing them you get higher margins and you actually like your life and so the same happened with the second agency where I said what are the customers you have and they're like actually we're really good at specifically family law attorneys so like divorce attorneys and they had all these other things I was like but divorce attorneys you're really good with they like yeah I was like then just sell divorce attorneys and because the thing is if you just sell divorce
(1:00:10) attorneys it's a multi-billion dollar pre- industry like there's no reason you can't do $100 million a year or $200 million a year just selling those people and the same with the it so the idea is like people start taking on more avatars because they think that's what's necessary to grow but and I've said this before but but better creates bigger bigger creates bloat and so if the goal is to get bigger you want to focus not on getting bigger but on getting better and then getting bigger occurs growth occurs as a result growth is not a goal
(1:00:40) growth is an outcome of inputs and so I'm telling you like it took me a very long time to understand this so I'm I'm trying to get like every entrepreneur has this ego goal of like I want to hit this a month and I hit that a month and I hit that a month but the thing is just that you don't want to make the income the goal if you do it gets really hard to get out of that game because sometimes you take the wrong steps you artificially inflate revenue and then you increase cost to sustain that Revenue but it was the wrong strategic move and but then you can't go backwards
(1:01:04) you stay in the cycle forever you don't want to do that you have to think okay how do I make the core thing that I do better because fundamentally If This Were twice as good as it is now would I be bigger yes because your customers would demand it you get far more leverage by doing the same thing a 100 times than doing a 100 things one time and so the vast majority of businesses especially when they're starting out are doing a 100 things one time rather than the same thing 100 times and you get a hell a lot better when you do something
(1:01:27) on the 100th time and so that means that you drive up your operational efficiency you drive up your gross profit you get better at your acquisition because your marketing messaging your sales scripting the results that you can promise all those things get better and now you're competing in a smaller pond so you can dominate everyone but when people think small pond they think that somehow that means that they're not going to make a lot of money like I said gym lunch makes a lot of money and it's in a very very very very very narrow Niche and so you just got to be more specific most times
(1:01:51) and break the limiting beliefs you have around the idea that like okay well I just need to go from you know I've saturated chiropractors right I've I've saturated this with $2 million a year in revenue of course not right every single other business that exists that serves your customer the fact that they're allowed to be alive and breathe shows you how much opportunity you have if you were better than them number 10 provide value now everybody talks about providing valueable what does that even mean all right so in in this book I talk about something called the value
(1:02:16) equation it's probably the most cited chapter in this whole book but I break down what are the elements of value and so there are four number one is the dream outcome which is what does somebody actually want so if I were to offer like uh Daniel who's behind the camera right now I said hey you can get in shape or I can make you a million dollars right making money for most men is more valuable than getting in better shape and so the relative opportunity or the relative outcome will dictate how much money you can charge that's why in general B2B offers are higher ticket now there are also fewer people who buy making money than people who buy
(1:02:46) consumer products so you have about on10th so 9% of people are business owners uh so you have a much smaller Market that being said does this the size of the market really matter based on the thing I just said probably not but again number one is dream outcome that's what differentiates now let's say you have got two products that offer the same solution so let's say the the the the weight loss example or the getting shape example if I have a PDF for that and I've got a lipos suction both of them promise the same thing which is that you're going to get in better shape you're going to lose weight okay well then why is Lio suching so much more
(1:03:14) expensive than a PDF that I could buy on the internet for 20 bucks they both promise the same outcome well there's three other variables so variable number one is the perceived likely of achievement or the risk associated with the purchase so risk would be the negative perceived likely of achievement is the positive and so we want to increase the perceived likelihood as much as possible so if we had that Lio section and we've got one surgeon who's his first day out of medical school and we got another surgeon who is done 10,000 surgeries which of these guys can price higher well obviously you'd want to take the 10,000 one even though it's
(1:03:39) the same procedure and the same outcome the perceived likelihood of you actually getting what you want the risk associated is lower and so you're willing to pay more for that guy because he has more experience the third variable of this is time delay the equal opposite of that is speed how quickly between when someone buys and when they get the promise that you now if you do lipos section it's like great you make the purchase then you go to sleep and you wake up and you're thin very very condensed which is why it has a lot of value right whereas if you have to do all this eating and this
(1:04:07) exercising and not drinking and changing your diet and all this waking up early and being sore all this like there's a lot of there's a lot of there's a lot of delay there in terms of how much time and effort it's time specifically it's going to take to get the Alem you want So the faster it is the more valuable it is and then finally you have effort and sacrifice or equal opposite ease how easy can you make it and so if you're trying to think about this in in in simple terms it's how risk-free can I
(1:04:31) make it how easy can I make it how fast can I make it and is the thing that that I'm promising the outcome that I'm promising something they actually want and so if you have all four of those you have something that people really want they have no risk of doing it it comes immediately and it's easy it's easy as pushing a button you've got an incredibly valuable thing and so when people say add value what you want to think about is what does my customer what does my avatar want to accomplish or what do they want to avoid so you've
(1:04:55) got towards good stuff and away from bad stuff and so you say okay I can help you avoid this bad stuff risk-free faster and easier than otherwise and the dream outcome the good stuff same thing again is how can I help you get that good stuff faster easier and risk-free and so every time you make content or every time you make a PDF or every time you make a lead magnet whatever it is or you make content the whole goal should be to be useful the whole goal should be to provide value and you do that by helping them achieve their goal which hopefully with this video I'm helping you Market better your business by making it risk
(1:05:26) you don't have to make the mistakes I did get to your goal faster and get there easier so the easiest way to think okay got it well how do I find the problems that people are suffering from so that I can make it faster easier and risk-free for them great question so one is any comments that you get in in response to content that creates more content this is the endless content wheel it's like you make content people have questions about the content you make content about the questions they have questions about those questions the good thing is that problems never end and people never stop complaining and so
(1:05:50) as long as people stop complaining people have problems you're always going to have problems to solve which is one of the nice things about being an entrepreneur you like Humanity if if you told us hundreds of years ago that we'd have the internet in our hands and we'd have air conditioning and Wi-Fi and all this stuff we'd be like oh my God all of our problems are solved but we have more problems now than we did before because we're more aware of the problems that that we didn't know existed before and so whenever you solve a problem you
(1:06:09) create another one it's the problem solution cycle that never ends and so one is you can look at that the other is you can look internal to your business which is what are the what are the things that people struggle with internal in terms of implementation for whatever the thing that you do is whether it's a product that you sell or a service that you sell there's some friction points along the way and you think okay what are the friction points and how can I make it easier number 11 is a fairly well-known marketing saying give away the secrets sell the implementation the way that I think about this is make your free stuff
(1:06:32) better than their paid stuff and that's an easy ISM to say but the real real is like you actually have to think if I give away something for free I have to be willing to charge for it and if you were willing to charge $100 or $1,000 or $10,000 for the thing that you give away for free my God must that be valuable yes and what that does is it increases the likelihood of conversion increases the likelihood the person consumes the thing and then buys the next product because what a lead magnet is or what
(1:06:56) content is it's a complete solution to a very narrow problem and that's fundamentally how I think about this a lot of people are very afraid of giving away value but you shouldn't be give away all the secrets give away all the things that you do and then if someone wants help with implementation they can call you up and this allows you to provide value to the masses build your brand up and then they use results in advance as an approximation of the results they're going to get after they purchase all right and so even when you're Marketing in terms of making content I like to think of being okay
(1:07:24) with narrow Because deep is where the dollars are all right so let me tell you let me tell you a couple stories about this so there was a lady who I just recently met who was doing just $ million a year in profit profit from 5,800 followers on Instagram she had no other platform she sourced 100% from Instagram and this blew my mind I mean like I say this stuff but having having that level like it was such an extreme example of tiny audience big money it it broke my beliefs even further than I already had them broken and when I looked at her page here's what's crazy
(1:07:57) it wasn't like she had crazy deep engagement either it was like the post you would get would get you know one five maybe 10 comments on a great post and she would get you know 10 likes 20 likes 30 likes if it was a crazy one but 100% of her content was about how registered dietitians can more accurately Bill Insurance to make more money it was a niche of a niche it was literally like registered dietitians who Bill insurance and how to Bill Insurance more effectively to make more per hour that was her offer and that's all she talks about her cheat sheets are on that
(1:08:34) and she talks about different Insurance uh companies and how to build each of them the codes that you go that you plug in like like all this jargon I had no idea when I went to the page but for her Avatar I'll bet you that of the 5,800 people that follow her 5,700 of them were restor dietitians who were trying to find out what they needed to do to make more money by building insurance and so she was selling 5 to 10 uh little cheat sheets a day at like 99 bucks plus two to three High ticket people per week into her thing into her Association of
(1:09:07) reg dietitians that followed her process for billing and so I say this because I've also learned this personally we used to make some wider content for about six months we did this we did this experiment we got the data back it turned out we got lots of views but we didn't get lots of business owners and so we switch back to hardcore business stuff which I love anyway so I'm very happy about the experiment and because of that all of our stats are up so we have more opt-ins more people buying books more people you know going to
(1:09:30) workshops whatever it is more people apply to the portfolio so we can invest in their companies all of those stats were up despite the fact that the general views per video went down and again I'm here for the money not for the fame and so I encourage you if you can break your attachment to the ego metrics like the likes and the views and things like that and just focus on the bottom line just get really specific on the Avatar that you want to serve and make content only for them that's useful so I've got a buddy of mine who runs a multi9 figure Pere uh marketing company and he makes content online he has a
(1:10:01) personal brand and he was like oh dude my personal brand makes no money he's like but and he goes Super in-depth tactical like stuff he's an SEO and so all of his stuff is like how how to make SEO content blog content things like that and his content gets like so few likes and engagement and he has like charts and graphs and all this data support all he does he's obviously really really good at this but the thing is is his lead quality that comes from him he's like they're all Fortune 500 Fortune 100 CEOs Executives that are like hey you obviously know the stuff
(1:10:33) can we just hire you and that's exactly what he wants he wants he he makes it so complex he gives away everything and he says it he's like I give you could just follow all my stuff and do it most people are like man this is too much work and so they can I just hire you which is an exceptional way to get customers so here's how you do it in three easy steps one is you just give away your best stuff give it all away if you have a low ticket thing that sells to lots of people and have a high tiet thing I would encourage you just give
(1:10:58) away the low ticket thing too you're probably not making that much money on it anyways and those customers are probably paying the butt so just give it to them and you can even show hey I used to charge for this I'm give it to you for free because I love you all right and by doing that you make an exceptional thing and you put really heavy uh effort into followup and calls to action within the within the content itself all right so within the thing that you're giving away you have ctas and you follow up with your team to try and to send them in the next thing if
(1:11:21) they're qualified and I'll give you a pro tip on this when you want to make the CTA make it about personalization not about more instead of saying hey if you want more stuff like this go here say hey if you want me to help apply this stuff to your business or apply this stuff to your body or this stuff to your life then let me know it's personalizing it because that is significantly more valuable than just more stuff and what's crazy is that a lot of people use the things they give away as an afterthought it's the last thing they think about but here's the crazy stat is that 99% of people who
(1:11:50) consume your free thing will never buy from you which means that your reputation is getting made by the 99% of people not the one 1% and so if you want to improve your reputation in the marketplace make sure the stuff that you give away for free is awesome also make sure the stuff that you sell is awesome and if both those things sound like a four-letter word which is work welcome to business and so I talked earlier about going up Market or getting narrower on the Avatar that you want to serve a lot of people have down cells and I think over time I've gotten less
(1:12:14) and less into having down cells and more along the lines of like if we have a lower Avatar and we're downselling 10% of calls into this thing that's paid if 10% of people are buying something that's on10th the price cuz it's a downsell then it's going to change my Revenue by 1% I don't really care it's not even worth the headache I'd rather just give that away to hundreds of people for free because if the cost is free way more people will consume it and then get a higher percentage of people to buy my next thing and I allow my
(1:12:38) marketing messaging to attract the higher quality customers so this allows me to go up Market or narrower and give away all the other stuff so I can create my more qualified customers the amount of businesses that I know that one that we've invested in or do that we've helped simply make way more money by just giving away the thing that was their big headache that was a low ticket thing just so that they could focus on serving the best customers most times you'll make money going up Market marketing advice number 12 all advertising works it's just a matter of efficiency I'm really I like I want to I
(1:13:08) want to drill this down people so the amount of time I've said Facebook ads don't work for us Google ads don't work for us Tik Tok ads don't work for us Direct Mail doesn't work for us radio ads don't work for us content doesn't work for us Outreach doesn't work for us fundamentally if you have a qualified person on the other side and you make an offer to them that solves a key problem for them if you can get them on the phone you can make money period so if you can rephrase the problem is I don't know how to make Facebook ads work for
(1:13:31) us I don't know how to make Tik Tok work for us I don't know how to make content work for us I don't know how to make Outreach work for us then that becomes a problem that you can solve now this is really important so I talked earlier about optimizing your advertising from front to back and that's true but when you optimize a business you optimize it from back to front and so the back the LTV how much you make per customer enables how much you can spend on the front end and so you optimize the throughput on the front end obviously
(1:13:57) because that's where you can get the highest returns but the engine that you can spend on that depends on how much you make per customer and so you can either be really really really exceptional at lowering CAC or really really really good at increasing LTV and if you do both you have huge Arbitrage and that's where you make Stupid Money And so let's go through hypothetical let's say that you sold something that was a billion dollar thing okay if you had a billion dollars in gross profit that you'd make from one sale you could reach a lot of people on Earth and just to give you context on this if I wanted
(1:14:29) to become a aess celebrity uh I've back calculated what I believe it cost to become an aess celebrity it was about $50 million and the way that I calculated that was I thought what person went from complete obscurant so no one knew who they were obscurity to omnipresence or some like that everybody knew and so the simplest example are people who were noname actors who become the star of a big Marvel hit and so what I did was I said okay how many of these have I seen what was the movie budget now you have to divide that by the other characters in the show or the in the movie and between the big Blockbusters
(1:15:03) where we had you think about like uh The Hunger Games girl I can't remember her name right now but that girl like the marketing budget for those types of films you think okay with $50 million she went from no one knowing who she was to being famous and so for $50 million you can reach so much of America and so I use this as hypothetical because if you had something that you sold for a billion dollars you could spend that and still make 20 to want and so the idea is yes we optimize our advertising from front to back we put our effort on the front but in terms of where our our our
(1:15:32) LTV comes from we work from back to front so that we can spend more on the front end a big problem in terms of efficiency is that often times if you are if you do start running ads profitably for example you reach some sort of ceiling you're like hey we can't we can't get past $1,000 a day hey we can't get past $10,000 a day hey we can't get past $100,000 a day whatever it is right usually it's because the ads that you have aren't good enough to reach the next level of awareness so Eugene Schwarz in breakthrough
(1:15:54) advertising talked about they called five levels of awareness and so they go from unaware somebody has no idea who you are what the problem is or anything they're just unaware the next level is problem aware that's where you see ads that are like having trouble sleeping at night do you have back pain when you lean over like things like that they ask open-end questions that make someone aware of the problem underneath of that is solutionware have you tried this before have you tried this before this
(1:16:16) is where someone knows the solutions that potentially exist then you have product aware which is them advert you advertising your own product like okay have you tried like my product before and let me talk you about this and then finally you have most aware which is usually past in existing customers and so there's a five levels of awareness and so most times smaller advertisers beginner advertisers get returns marketing to most aware right if you email your list or you make a post or you send out message an email right
(1:16:40) those are three most aware people so you can make sales from that for almost no money one degree above that is like okay well other people in the market that's product where they're looking they're looking for something uh to solve a specific problem right uh and they're aware of the options that are out there and you Market to them so you have to be a little bit better to Market to those people than to just your existing customers now if you go one level above that right solutionware is that they know that there are people who are solving this problem they don't know how
(1:17:02) they're solving the problem they know that there is a solution that exists and so you have to have another order of magnitude Improvement of your ads and the hooks to call out those people and so most times the problem isn't that your Market isn't big enough it's that your ads aren't good enough and they're not specific enough to hit this next massive trunch of the audience and I say this with our largest company um in the portfolio is about $100 million a year and we spend millions of dollars a month
(1:17:26) in advertising and we go to the most unaware people we go to people who have no idea that uh you know this product or this problem exists we actually have to make them aware of the problem and then we make them aware of the opportunity to solve it and then we have to make them aware of the problem we have to take them through all the stages of awareness in a very short period of time and that is comes from a very well-crafted ad and so I have this saying that I have internal which is that the size of the plane is directly correlated with the length of the runway the bigger the
(1:17:51) plane the longer the runway and so if you want to sell a very expensive thing or you want to to sell a very cold person so the price and the the coldness or how aware the person is so the longest sale possible would be someone who's completely unaware for a very expensive thing right the shortest sale possible would be someone who's very aware for a very cheap thing and so the amount of Runway the amount of selling the amount of advertising that you have to do to get someone through these stages is directly proportional to those
(1:18:15) two things and if you're having trouble scaling it usually means that this is mismatched you're trying to you're you're sending a warm message to a cold audience or you're getting people on the phone who aren't prepared to SP a huge amount of money they haven't been warmed up enough and so it's making sure that we're hitting each of these boxes for the audience that we're starting to Target and so as you go to a new trunch of let's say you go from solution Weare to problem Weare so it's it's a bigger
(1:18:38) area right and so think about these concentric circles like a pizza like the area of the pizza you know like a pizza that's this big if you could take an inch off it's almost the same size as a as a 2-in pizza in the middle like the the diameter circumference whatever that is I probably failed geometry the point is is that um it just gets bigger and exponentially bigger as you go out and so this is a weird visual that I have for this but if you think about a watermelon slice and at the tip there's lots of seeds and as you go down there's fewer seeds but you still have to pay the same amount to reach all these eyeballs to find the few seeds versus in
(1:19:09) the beginning when you have lots of seeds so your density of sales per thousand eyeballs goes down as you go to more unaware people because you're going to go to people who just simply don't care and never will care but you have to and this is where the LTV matters so much and the optimization matters so much but you still if you can be profitable in a larger trunch that's 10 or 100 times as big that's when you start really printing money right and so if you have call it 20 to1 LTV to CAC in the beginning when you have lots of little seeds lots of density of potential buyers because it's really warm really problem Weare or really really solution or product Weare right
(1:19:40) like really high-end as you go down you might drop to 5 to one in the middle you might drop to 3 to one at scale but you're at a 100 times the spend and so in that case you're still making way more absolute return on the investment another way to think about this is like a golf of course and so if you could only putt then you're going to only make 6in putts that's only the top Little Seeds of the watermelon but think about how much more area if you learned how to drive and you learned how to hit a three
(1:20:08) iron I'm not very good at golf you can obviously tell then you hit learn how to hit a wedge there's so many more shots that you can make if you have these other skills in Your Arsenal and so think about each of the levels of awareness as another club that you have to learn how to hit so that you can get more balls in the hole from any part of the course marketing advice number 13 we need to be reminded more than we need to be taught and I think this is one that's going to break a lot of your beliefs and so I'm I want to really emphasize this one because it's
(1:20:31) important once you start making content once you start running ads and you start putting stuff out publicly you start advertising you're going to get to a point where you're like I feel like I've said everything that I was going to say now remember you continue to live life every day you continue to do stuff and you can talk about what you did so that can break that but my mom said this to me once and I I always I always remembered it she said the news never changes just the names and I really thought about that it was like the there's always a rape there's a war
(1:20:56) there's a murder there's a car accident like the actual story doesn't change only the names and so if you think about that with content like there is no new content like The Human Condition has not changed for thousands of years like the older the problem the older the solution and so we are making content and we're putting stuff out there and when I think about myself the things that I follow like I follow philosophy Pages because I I'm okay rereading epic titus' stuff like I read his stuff before and I read it in quote form again and when it comes up again like to be reminded I like to
(1:21:26) keep this stuff top of mind that's why I follow those pages and many people follow your pages for that exact same reason is that the stuff you talk about is stuff that they want to keep top of mind they want to be reminded of that stuff and getting taught is much more difficult than being reminded but they're equally valuable because if it changes their behavior then you still did teach them again you just reminded them and what's crazy about this is that like the friend show right now if you've ever heard of it is being watched more
(1:21:50) now than it was a few years ago so reruns like people watch reruns because there's Nostalgia or whatever reasons you want to pick to it but people are willing to rewatch the same thing because they know how it ends they know they liked it and so you can make the same thing again because also your audience who's new a year later hasn't seen that thing and so if you make something new to them even though it's quote old or reminder to your existing audience your existing audience doesn't mind their reminder and the new people never saw it to begin with and if you
(1:22:21) want to have different ways of creating variety even around the same topics I would would encourage you instead of thinking of getting into Trend hacking and talking about the news talk about your news so it's about what are the new things that are happening now this is the do epic stuff talk about what you did and so this is where we tell new stories to explain the same concept because for that specific audience you'll reach a different type of person or different Avatar that still might be within your Market with a story about a
(1:22:48) mother and a daughter versus a father and a son versus a military vet versus uh a small business owner right there are different avatars and you can tell the same story but it happens to a different name just like the news and people still watch the news every single day and then what we want is them to watch our news you can tell the same concept like the value equation the value equation I explained in my book I also have a course on my site that I explained the value equation in a different format so think about it in terms of formats this is written I have an audio I've got videos that on my site
(1:23:17) that in a course format I'm mentioning it here now I have it on whiteboards that I've explained it I've applied it to Services I've applied it to education I've applied it to uh physical products I've applied it to software and so you can take the same idea and think how can I display it in new formats new mediums and new contexts and so when you have that and then you extrapolate on top the news of your life even though you feel like it's saying the same thing the amount that it takes to create something
(1:23:44) novel is very small and so I'll tell you the story that I think will wrap this up it's the story of Henry Ford and so Henry Ford had uh in his office he had his marketing person right next to him so he walked past the marketing Department over and over and over again and this is back in the day when they like they didn't have computer screen so it was just like they had mockups and like big posters and things like that for whatever their next ad campaign for a new Ford car was and so he walked past this guy's office for three months at the end of the three months he was like
(1:24:08) hey John when are we going to stop running this ad I'm so sick of it and John the marketing director looked at me he said we haven't even started running it yet and the thing is is that we get so much sicker of our own content before our audience even remembers your name and so the thing is is that we assume that every person consumes every piece of content you ever put out we put out 50 plus pieces of content a day I'm grateful if somebody watches one a week right and so the idea here is that like you put out significantly more but we have this assumption that everyone's paying attention and no one is and so we
(1:24:35) put out tons of volume with the hope that we catch one person on that one day and you might have make I might have made four things about the value equation actually you can give me good feedback so this will be good if you haven't heard about the value equation whatsoever in my content up to this point drop a comment because I want to I want to prove that this even though I've talked about it in a zillion formats some of you guys didn't even know how to book right um like people need to be reminded more than need to be taught and
(1:24:58) for those of you who don't know the mission acquisition. comom is to make real business education accessible for everyone and I spent the last four years plus making content and hopefully giving away all the stuff you need to scale your business and I love getting the messages and the stories that we do but it would mean the world to me if you just shared this video with another business owner who that can hopefully compress 13 years into however long this video ends up being uh to save them all the scars and so they can just have the lessons thank you

The Best Student Side Hustle in 2025 - YouTube

Transcript:
(00:00) the best business to start for students where you can earn 1120 per day in profit not Revenue you can do it while you're still in school and for anyone who's not in school you could still do it only four hours per day and at the end of the video I'll tell you the Super Saiyan version of this that can make you a million dollars a year was one of the three businesses that I almost started before deciding to start my gym and the business was test prep and or tutoring most people go about test prep tutoring the wrong way
(00:29) you don't want to sell tutoring you want to sell the outcome of tutor which is to get into either a job that's going to pay more or be able to pass a test of some sort or ideally the standardized test which in my opinion are the most valuable tests that you can help some prepare for because when you get into a better school either college or business school that has a material difference on the network that those people hang out with the companies that recruit from those schools and the average salary and earning capacity of those people College
(00:54) was the original Biz op it was anybody can come in and you will make more money as a result of going through this training here's the same simplest model that works very time constrained that anyone can do number one is that you don't do one-on-one you do one to many but you don't do unlimited because you're probably not good enough to do that yet but you can do semi-private the reason semi-profits is one of the most profitable service models is that you can charge two-thirds of what you can do one-on-one but you can do it with eight
(01:19) times as many people if you have a group of eight students it's still a small group setting they still get the personalized attention but when they're taking problems you can have them take turn doing the problem versus teaching someone on the property if you charge 60 an hour and you're doing one-on-one which is the typical model that most people will do you work four hours you would make a total of two hundred and forty dollars versus doing one on eight and charging thirty five dollars with eight people there you make Eleven
(01:40) Hundred for the same four hours this is when we talk about opportunity Vehicles four and a half times more money per unit of time because you have this model and not the 101 model from a money math perspective you charge 35 bucks it's cheaper than the 60 that someone would charge one-on-one you might be better but you have eight people you're making two hundred and eighty dollars an hour you do four of those hours a day you're making 11 500 a day for four hours of work you're one of those people who was a really good student didn't know what
(02:06) to do you could make more doing this than you being a doctor not have to go to school not have to take loans and still have your entire day and just work from six to ten not bad what's cool about this you can do it at free libraries I got tutoring I did it at Free Library she didn't have to pay for that I got to do it just at Cost all you have to do would be to get students that would pay you three times a week and you would need 50 students to do that 35 a session would be a very nice sweet spot that most people could afford and you
(02:32) price that again based on the fact that they would make a hundred thousand dollars more a year if they go to these better schools in terms of packaging this I would prefer to get people to prepay because I don't like transactional one-off things because it ties it too close to the time I'm spending but I would work it out so that it would be 35 a session I could probably estimate in order for us to increase your child or student or your own score every thousand problems statistically gives you an extra 20 points whatever that math would be that
(02:58) would be obviously a core part of my selling pit we have to get you to do this many problems which is going to take this much time and so I would sell the goal which is how much do you want to increase your test score from a curriculum perspective you have a three-day curriculum that you teach the class A and Class B separately and then the last day you do is the makeup for those people but they would still have to pay the same rate but that way they don't fall behind so you literally don't have to do anything during the day you
(03:20) could work a full-time job you could play video games all day and then just do tutoring four hours test prep is extremely repeatable if someone does the work they did a research study the test scores that people have on sats and GMAT is directly proportional the number of problems they solved before taking the test it's a very clear input output equation the more problems someone does the better their scores are when I learned that one research graph I bought every single GMAT phone book that I could find at Barnes and Nobles and I
(03:47) did all of them and that's how I scored above Harvard's GMAT and it took me four months to do that I worked personally four hours a day doing problems on Saturday I would do a test to test my score to see if I got better kind of like chess where there's pattern Wrecking initially I was more motivated to be good at this test than any test I'd ever taken which is why I got so motivated to help other people do it too which is why I started thinking about that business so if you are somebody who was pretty good at school was pretty
(04:10) good at standardized tests this is a really great opportunity that you could make top one percent earnings with no Capital out of pocket no rental space no build out first thing to do is hit up your network all the people that you know go knock doors but also dming people that are in your high school you can say hey do you know anybody who needs test prep Services I got this score and I moved my score from X to Y just doing this I'm walking people through it so that they can get the same test scores because I was able to get
(04:34) into a better College as a result of this course here's where I was here's what happened here's the method I used here's the outcome of the Improvement I would also be edming parents and adults because I have no shame if you want to start a business you should probably get rid of your shame because you're going to get embarrassed so you just ask lots of people and if you ask enough people and say hey I'm giving a free session to show how my whole method work and I'll do it for free and if it makes sense for
(04:53) them awesome and what that is is really more of a half assessment into a sales pitch you do a little bit of at the beginning show them one easy win they they can have they see an improvement and then you transition like this is how I teach do you like that you give the first five to ten for free and you do that you say you have to do your homework and every day you don't do your homework I will bill you you have some skin in the game and then they might even like that where they're going to be way more motivated to actually do the
(05:14) work and then in so doing they will get even better test scores at the end of that there's three things you're going to ask for them feedback on things that could be better your testimonial and you're going to ask them for a referral there's the big three that you're going to do in exchange for doing the work for free if you get more than 10 people who really want then guess what you can just start charging once you have the referrals and the testimonials posts the testimonials let me know if you're interested too very simple they post
(05:34) anybody who engages you can DM them with better offer if that was my first ten my next 10 I'm doing for half off those are not super hard ride hooks because they're inspiring for a lot of people people think it's cool and then you have call to action switch drive into your DMs and then you can upsell them from there beyond that the other two ways would be reaching out to people who you don't know not just people you do know and then running ads most people could just do people they know referrals going to sports teams where they need tutoring
(05:59) and saying Hey I'm know some of these guys are worried about getting into school I know they're not trying to go to Ivy but they need to get above an X to get in with their sports scholarship or whatever you can go to the teams it spreads really quickly and then all the lacrosse dudes or all the hockey dudes could come at the same time after practice you do a good job the word of mouth will spread that's it it doesn't have to be a complicated amount maybe it takes you six months to build up your student base to be at a thousand bucks
(06:19) or 1100 bucks a day would you rather do that than spend four years in college go into debt and not make money the entire time and have to work full-time to do that your fault so you could do all that stuff that I just said on your own with basically no help and get yourself to a top one percent earning income which is better than anything you're going to get after college anyways you could do it in six months without risking the money the time and the debt but if you wanted to go Super Saiyan you can have other
(06:41) people do those things for you because then you just get really good at getting the students to sign up and say yes and then you templatize your process for how you get them to do more problems because that's the most predictable way of increasing their score and so then you have a teacher who you can pay 50 bucks an hour you make the spread between the 280 and the 50.
(06:58) and many teachers will happily work for fifty dollars an hour and if you really wanted to run really crazy margins which I prefer to I like to have my service based margins to 80 or higher which means that my cost per unit below 56 so 50 works there that means you can pay good people they could make more than they're making with the real job they're happy to do it the students are happy to pay it because it's less than 101 and then all the while you get to scrape everything off the top without ever having risk and then those four hours you get back what
(07:23) do you do you promote more you Market more you sell more you get more people in and you find other teachers so then what happens is you start getting a development pipeline for getting students in and a pipeline for getting teachers in hey teacher at set 50. do you have any other teacher friends who you think would be good at this yeah I've got 10 friends who would love to make twice as much money in half the time great send them my way then you get a line of teachers who are waiting for you to find them students and a lot of
(07:42) students that are ready to come in groups you want to go God mode you can do four teachers rather than one and they're now getting paid 50 bucks an hour you're still making your same 280 but you're making 1100 ish per hour because you got four guys working so at the end of the day just that half day of four hours with four people working you're making 4 400 and you paid each of them two hundred dollars each eight hundred dollars off Forty Four Hundred you're looking at thirty six hundred a day does anybody know what it takes to
(08:07) make a million dollars a year in income survey says 3 300 a day you're at 36. guess what you now make a million dollars a year you're more than above the top one percent and you do it with four employees that are part-time and some Hospital
14 Money Mistakes to AVOID in Your 20's - YouTube
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q6SdmgIji30

Transcript:
(00:00) there are 14 massive money mistakes that people make in their 20s that you do not want to repeat and this is one of those don't buy an iPhone buy an Android [ __ ] like if you make these mistakes early you will have to pay for them for years the good thing is is that you can avoid them very easily number one underspending on education and overspending on status when you're in your 20s you probably aren't balling and the amount of people on Instagram I see with their check mark that they bought in front of a Lambo that they would ever
(00:24) like we all get it they're full of [ __ ] we understand the people who matter are not impressed if I were a $200,000 watch all the buddies that I have don't give a [ __ ] the guys who are ahead of you they want to see you eating [ __ ] living poor learning and hustling you driving around in your new rolls or bends or whatever and you're maxing out all of your expenditures so you can Flex to other 20-year-olds is stupid now you should take that same money and plow all of that into your own ability to earn more
(00:50) money and that's what somebody who's ahead of you is going to look back and give you that status and respect for like you can get status in your 20s from people who are ahead of you if you're doing the right stuff if you show that you're on the wrong path they automat think they're like he doesn't get it or she doesn't get it they'll never associate with you until you understand the lesson number two taking jobs to earn rather than to learn and this is one of the biggest ones we had a thousand people who applied for a
(01:12) YouTube editor so for editing videos like this so we offered somebody very good pay and the guy said I want an extra $3,000 a year missing the [ __ ] plot what he didn't understand was that he was in a season of learning not a season of earning he might be able to to go somewhere else and get 30% not even 3,000 30% higher the people who are going to pay that premium are paying the premium for everything you know and have nothing to add to you if you're taking your jobs right now in order to earn it's not the right season you're trying
(01:44) to cash in early the earning potential of you getting extra $10,000 a year or $25,000 a year in your 20s is so inconsequential on the long time Horizon of the skills that you should be learning right now three is that you save money that is a mistake hear me out you want to save money in your 20 but not actually save it you want to not spend it or blow it on [ __ ] and you want to put it into a separate account but that money you want to invest not dollar cost averaging S&P or whatever it is you can do that by all means it's a great
(02:12) way to like have some money later but if you want to become Filthy Rich which is hopefully you know what MOS nation is here to do you want to invest that money into you and your earning capacity right now you make so little that the money doesn't matter so like if you save $500 a month ,000 a month you can put that into the calculator and look what it's going to be in 70 years and like cool one it doesn't factor in inflation so when people see that they're going to be worth $4 million $4 million in 60 years
(02:35) is also worth like a million doll today think about how much more you'll get back if you spend $10,000 this year and then you double your earning capacity or you triple your earning capacity instead of saving money to invest in assets invest in the number one asset which is you and increasing your earning potential number four decide how much you're going to invest first before you spend money prioritization comes from taking that's literally prior it comes first right is that you take the money off the top and you say this money has
(02:58) been prioritized for my learning my education and then whatever you have left that you can spend all that money that account you can let it stockpile up and then you see something that you want to learn and then deploy the capital not what do I have left at the end of the month can I afford it you've got this big pile of gold over here that every month you plan on to and then when you when you see the opportunity you make the decision you pull the trigger number five automate the investing and you want to manualized the spending you want to
(03:22) lubricate how easy it is for you to invest in yourself and you want to make it harder to spend on [ __ ] that never comes back to you Dave Ramsey talks about people having cash rather than credit cards you actually feel pain when you buy things in cash compared to using credit cards the harder it is to buy something the less you buy like the only one that even hits your account is the money that you're allowed to spend the other money you've already allocated out to the other things like you have your rent account maybe and then you've got
(03:43) your personal investing account me you've got your food and your car money whatever number six don't go shopping let's be real you don't need another set of sneakers the idea that someone says I'm going to go shopping like they have no agenda it just means like I'm going to waste money today stick with the lists that you already have pre-approved in terms of your budget this is my list these are my groceries this is whatever and if it's not on the list you don't buy it it's a very simple habit but that will pay dividends for the rest of your
(04:07) life number seven get takeout don't cook your food very contrarian I know as soon as you make more than $15 an hour it makes more sense for you to work that day get the takeout food and get the time back it makes more sense financially most people can like if you're not being a weirdo you can eat out for 10 bucks is a meal and you eat out twice a day is 20 bucks a day $600 a month maybe if you went to the grocery store it be what 100 bucks a week versus $150 a week is the net $50 a week can you not make that up for the meal prep
(04:36) going to the grocery store cutting cooking cleaning you're saving the pennies rather than investing in the Mega Millions which is you number eight people live with the wrong people they have terrible roommates who break things who go out drinking who are late on rent like these are all things that'll distract you from the thing you're trying to do that's like level one worst type of roomate above that you've got people who are responsible Etc but they don't have the same goals as you they will speak over you their limiting
(04:57) beliefs and they will often times not actually root for you and they will kind of undercut you when you're on this path which is probably different than them and the thing is in the beginning what becomes success looks like failure you're learning you're not earning they're already pulling their earning trigger they're bragging on the fact they make 70 grand a year whatever because you have a different goal and so never listen to people who have smaller goals for your life than you do making sure that you're living with the type of
(05:18) people who are trying to do the same thing as you are in your life will encourage one another and you guys are kind of like in the game together that's what will shape the way you see the world I do think it's worth living with multiple people in your 20s cuz one your 20s can be lonely but two it's also just a lot cheaper I lived in a house with seven people in California and I was able to only pay 400 bucks a month in like a nice area which leads to number nine your micr community matters a lot I would overpay for convenience in terms
(05:41) of being close to stuff close to the highway so I can get on and off and right to places I need to close to a gym and close to cheap places to eat if I can do those things and ideally if I can walk to them I save time and gas I get outside if you live in the middle of nowhere and it takes you 25 minutes to get to the gym and 25 minutes to go back there's all this time that gets eaten up I'm willing to pay a premium to save all of the ancillary cost it would go with living somewhere less convenient less safe I would live with more people in a
(06:03) better area than fewer people in a shitty area number 10 say you model the wrong season of life sometimes younger guys will look at what I'm doing they're like oh I'm going to do what Alex is doing the thing is just like you don't have the track record and reputation is built on two things it's built on what you've done and what you say you're going to do and having both of them come true the thing that builds the reputation is not modeling what I'm doing now but modeling what I did before you want to make sure that you model the
(06:22) right aspect of someone's life at the right time flying private doesn't make you rich it means you spend a lot of money sequence matters number 11 measure money in how long it took you to earn it let's say you make 20 bucks an hour if you want to go buy a shirt for 100 bucks you have to think to yourself okay I make $20 an hour 20% payroll tax I'm actually going to have to work 6 hours to buy that $100 shirt with tax whatever so if someone said I want you to work all day and I'll give you this shirt would I do it probably not I worked at
(06:49) Smoothie King way I was 15 15 years old $725 an hour a 6-hour shift right so I was making 43 bucks people would go next door I remember noticing this and they would spend 15 bucks on lunch I was like so you have $36 after taxes for coming to work today and 15 of that is you going to lunch next door so you're working 6 hours for 20 bucks number 12 get competitive with money around what you're saving not what you're making so I told you this is a season of learning not season of earning to know what you're going to learn you have to budget
(07:17) towards your investment rather than thinking I'm making $5,000 a month and spending $5,000 a month meaning I'm profiting personally zero say I am saving $2,500 this month to invest in me I've had people who I know have been making hundred, even millions of dollars a year and have nothing they blew everything and so make your PR your personal records around what you're able to put into that bank account every month number 13 check your account every single morning until I started doing it I stayed poor I didn't want to look at
(07:43) my bank account cuz it would hurt my feelings seriously I just I would look at it and I would just feel poor but that's okay you have to confront reality in order to change it man money's pouring out of this thing left and right once I got a pulse on it I knew Tuesdays when I pay for this Thursdays is when I pay for this it's a habit that once you learn it it's hard to forget and I promise you just like losing weight if you get someone to measure the weight every day get someone to measure the bank account every day it'll improve
(08:04) number 14 when is it okay to spend money if there's one thing that I probably could have done better is I could have spent money on onetime experiences and what I mean by that is not going to the club and popping bottles going to Europe and doing a you know sleeping in hosts for 3 months that's a cool experience that you're not going to be able to do when you're 40 you're just not going to do it so there are times of Our Lives that are optimal for certain types of experiences and those windows close and so if there are experiences that you can
(08:25) only do in your 20s I wholeheartedly support them but you want them to be things that when you're you're proud of giving yourself permission to spend on an experience in a limited fashion you don't want to drain your entire investment account right you want to go see the Grand Canyon for 3 days go to the Grand Canyon if there's some things that like are a little unique to you I think these are the times that you can do that and it's worth spending the time and the money to do it even if it's not financially make sense because at the
(08:47) end of the day like you're going to die it's not going to matter anyways
10 Different Ways To Break Down Making $1 Million - YouTube
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sLXhCDRaV8

Transcript:
(00:00) I want to break the myth in this video that you need to go make a million dollars that you need money to make money one two three four five six ten different ways you can make a million dollars for little or zero money down and you can apply this to a thousand dollars a hundred dollars a hundred million dollars you can do any of these things and add or to track the amount of zeros that you feel comfortable with the first thing that you can do if you want to make a million dollars you can sell something for a million dollars and as
(00:25) crazy as what I'm saying sounds you absolutely can sell something for a million dollars if you go to an e-commerce store and they're doing a hundred million dollars a year and you say hey if I can increase your conversion across your entire site rewrite your emails redo your landing pages and I can get you a five percent lift can I get one percent of that so you make them an extra five million a year and you get one do you think you can do that yes why are you gonna be able to do so much not because of you but because of who they are you make a
(00:51) million dollars by selling someone else five to ten million dollars of value and you're like I don't know how to do that that's fine but accept that you don't know how to do that and then say I want to learn how to do that and then go get this skill of doing that and then you can go sell it you can't say that you don't have the money and that's why you can't make money the second one is that you can borrow a million dollars and then buy something and have someone else pay it back it's fundamentally what real
(01:12) estate is you borrow money to buy an asset you put tenants into the asset they pay off the money that you never had that is what real estate is and I'll tell you a quick story on this so buddy of mine got into real estate was flipping houses didn't think there was a lot of money in it was like oh this sucks there's so much work and there's all those 10 you know so he ended up buying a 14 unit apartment building with someone else's money he didn't have any bought the apartment building and then sold it four months later for 500 000
(01:36) more and you made 500 Grand in one transaction and so then he realized that the more expensive the building he sold the more money he made then he started getting into commercial real estate which is even more expensive he's like wait a second I can buy something for 10 million and then I can flip it to somebody for 13 and not even hold on to it for that long he started flipping 30 or 40 of these a year with just Him and a couple of va's number three is you refinance something for more than you bought it so if you're like but I don't
(02:00) know if they'll do that they will if it's priced low enough so if you have to go talk to a thousand building owners you will probably get one of them who's willing to depart for their thing for significantly less than its worth and a bank will loan the difference and you don't have to put any money down out of pocket let's say you have a hundred thousand dollar house and you get it under contract for eighty thousand dollars from them saying that they're willing to give you the house for eighty thousand dollars and then you say cool I
(02:23) can give you 70 and then you gotta seller finance me the 10 over the next five years and they say sure and now all of a sudden you just got to get the bank and the bank finance is eighty percent and now you actually just made the difference if you wanted to and you can take that number and you can do it at 100 million dollars you can do it at any of these levels but that's the concept does that make sense number four is that you get a contract for something for less than it's worth and then you sell that contract an option is a contract to
(02:47) say that you will be able to buy something at a future date at a price that is agreed upon today that's what an option is if I agree upon a price to somebody today then I as the person who's getting the option is hoping that it is worth more than that the first news selling the option is hoping that it's either worth less than that in the future or doesn't think it's going to change significantly it will just get paid for that tiny option for the contract itself let's say you've got a million dollar house now you call a
(03:09) bunch of houses you're going to be offering 20 below what the market rate is that you believe the houses were eventually you're going to get to somebody who's like you know what I've had this house for 30 years I bought it for ten dollars and now it's worth 800 Grand you know what I'll take the 800 Grand you think it's worth more than 800 and you say thank you I'm going to send you a DocuSign they sign the DocuSign that you have an option period to flip the house you could go to a real estate investor and say hey I have a house for
(03:31) nine hundred thousand dollars on sale right it's worth a million the guy says okay sure I'll sign for 900. this guy's gonna put 900 in you're going to pay 800 to this person and then you make the 100 in between and you put no money down the next one you can do is that you can sell something that's really expensive and get a commission sounds really simple you sell a skyscraper that's a 100 million dollar skyscraper you'll get three four percent of that deal three or four million dollars on a single transaction if you sell a 20 million
(03:53) residence and you might be like that's crazy they exist look on Zillow the realtor gets five-ish percent of the transaction that's a million dollars they never owned the asset the next one is that you can find somebody who has an audience buy whatever they're about to launch early and then sell it later now that one does take some money it's less but the the value of the thing later that's how it balloons this is how the entire nft thing worked is that you have tremendous demand for a scarce resource they have the scarce resource and then
(04:19) it balloons the price because there's so many people bidding against each other to get it and so getting in early on those types of things which is why if you buy into something pre-ipo it tends to almost always go up simply by the fact that there's way more eyeballs that are competing for most times the next one is selling units of stuff super simple but people don't do the math behind this I don't even like confining it to a year but you know we do live in time and so I will explain it that way if you wanted to make a million dollars
(04:41) you've got 52 weeks in a year about twenty thousand dollars a week is what you got to make 20 times 52 it's technically a million forty thousand for the internet trolls how many different ways can you make 20 grand in a week well you can sell 20 people a thousand dollar thing two people a ten thousand dollar thing one person every four weeks an eighty thousand dollar thing on a weekly basis 20 people who have a thousand dollar lifetime value for example if you have 100 a month membership and the person stays for 10
(05:04) months on average then if you sell 20 of those every week over time those will stack up and then you will cap add a million dollars and the only way to grow from that new million is either you got to sell more units or you got to make the thing that you're selling worth more that's it the next one is that you can get people to give you their businesses for no money down good friend of mine actually did this and he combined four different information businesses into one business and they were all small businesses they were all doing about a
(05:26) millionish a year I get Small's relative but like and so he combined them all to be a four million dollar Top Line million and a half bottom line business for no money out of pocket he literally said hey I know you don't want to do this business anymore just give it to me and I'll pay you the income that you're going to make for this business for the next two years and they said sure and so you combined all those businesses together and then overnight he owned an asset that was doing a million and a half a year in profit and four million
(05:47) in Top Line and it cost him nothing to do it he owns the asset now and so if he turned around and went to say hey I'm gonna go sell this he could probably sell the thing for five million dollars put together it might cost him two million bucks and he makes the three he made more than a million dollars with no money out of pocket understand that the people who are making money don't constrain themselves by time they're not thinking how do I make X dollars per hour x dollars per year they're thinking how do I provide the most value to
(06:09) somebody so they'll give me a percentage of the value I provide here's another one is that you can go find stuff that you really like and go promote that so you don't have to go find and make your own products you go find products that you really like from other companies and just become Affiliates of those products and the nice thing is that I just recommend you be honest be like hey I tried 100 different soaps this is my favorite one and here's why people don't want to go through the time and the money of figuring out which soap is
(06:32) the best for your audience and if you make the rack after you do that they're like oh well shoot he just saved me time and so then I'll go buy from him through his link or whatever and so you can affiliate other people's products and make money in that way without any money out of pocket and then finally Arbitrage in general which is a fancy word but it just means that you sell the same thing between two different markets because they're priced differently if Bitcoin is nineteen thousand dollars in Japan on
(06:55) the Japanese Market is 19 100 in the US market you buy the nineteen thousand dollar Bitcoin over in Japan and you sell it in the American market for 1901 and you make a hundred bucks that's all Arbitrage is and it happens with physical products it happens with lending money between two parties if you can get money for one percent and you can sell the money for six percent you make five is the difference all of these are different versions of Arbitrage which is just same thing two markets two different prices you make the difference
(07:21) and so if you're looking for ways to make money look for Arbitrage opportunities because that's where you can make tremendous income

Transcript:
(00:00) what's going on everyone really pumped to tell you one of my strongest and most powerful tactics in persuasion that allows you to use integrity to increase the trust in your prospects by owning all of your deficiencies with a single statement all right so uh many times if you're thinking about how you're selling someone the degree to which they will buy is directly correlated with how much they trust you especially in a b2b scenario where if i said hey for every dollar you give me you'll make 10 back if i if someone truly believed that then
(00:34) every single person would buy from me right because there's no logical reason not to so underpinning that is whether they believe me or not and that could be within the context whether they believe in themselves versus the system versus the world there's other sub beliefs there but fundamentally if those three things are aligned and they truly believe in their core then they're going to buy which is the same reason that when you have a referral that gets on the phone with you it's so easy to close them because the
(00:57) person who referred them has already imbued you with trust they've already vouched for you and so the person comes in with sky high trust and really just you just need to get out of their way so they can make the purchase and so i learned this tactic from eminem in eight mile um and uh you can see it at work and i'll give you a couple of prominent examples but it's using the word but all right and this is the concept of damaging admission which is probably my single favorite uh technique to use in persuasion because
(01:27) it allows me to be even more honest than i otherwise would be in a world of like charlatans where people are always making huge promises and making huge claims and never kind of being real and authentic with people you stick out like a sore thumb in a good way right and so let me give you a statement really quickly um and then we're gonna i'm gonna show you how to how to reverse it in order to make it more persuasive so let's say i said um i'm going to make you uh you're going to make a ton of money if you work with me but it's going to be
(01:58) a ton of work there's going to be hundreds of hours of videos you're going to have to go through um there's five hours a day that you're going to have to spend you know to execute each of the things that i'm going to tell you to do right what happens is in that statement i directed your attention to all of the things that you're going to have to do right now if you noticed it was positive statement but negative statement now if you reverse these things and go negative statement but positive statement the butt acts as an amplifier for the
(02:32) second half let's try it on listen if you sign up for gym launcher you sign up to work with me you're gonna have to go through hundreds of hours of videos you're gonna have to take five hours a day you know to work and do these things but you're gonna make more money than ever in your life the thing is is that but and then the statement when i say something negative if i was on a date for example and i was trying to persuade a young lady you know back in the day before i was married i might say something like
(02:59) listen you know sometimes i have a temper um i can be i can be short at times i don't have a ton of time to get dedicated to a relationship right now because my business is taking up the majority of my time but i'm absolutely fantastic in bed right if i said something like that the thing is is the more negatives i can say in the beginning the more believable the thing that i say right afterwards is right and so if i own all of my negatives which is why i love this because be truthful in the things that you're saying that are negative and the
(03:33) more true they are and the more damaging they are the more believable the thing that comes after the sentence all right and so the way to use but because everything that happens here after the word but is amplified all right and everything that is before the word but is diminished so you have so the good thing is you can actually control where your prospect's attention is going so this is where we're where we're directing them it's after the word but and so i do this sometimes um you know the word because is actually really similar too
(04:12) to this in a different way i'll use it in another video but uh if if i say something really horrible um i'm trying to think of something else uh let's see here uh i'm i'm really hard to live with um i i absolutely do no house chores whatsoever but whatever i say right now is something that you're going to believe right and so when you use this to your advantage and you weave this into your copy especially as you get closer to your call to actions people will believe you and fundamentally this is what will make your copy
(04:49) so much more persuasive right like for example gym launch has tons of one star reviews we also have but we also have thousands of five stars right and so the question is whether you want to eat at a restaurant that has 4.7 you know stars with 3 000 ratings or you would need at a place that has five stars with 19 right i would rather you the 4.
(05:13) 4.7 star same thing would you buy on amazon right because the damaging admissions the reviews that are negative give credence to the things that are positive so let me give you a really famous example that viagra had and some of you guys may know this commercial but it's literally it it crushed for them right some of you guys may remember that they had a warning label at the end of their advertisements that said if an election lasts longer than four hours you know must contact a medical uh you know professional right and so the beauty is there was a genuine
(05:44) risk right but in making the risk they amplified the power of the product every single guy heard that warning and was like i could have an erection for four hours like sign me up right and so it would be like the same thing as saying like um you know warning uh you know when you sign up and start working with gymloc you're gonna massively increase your tax burden all right so like like we we are not liable for the amount of taxes that you're gonna have to pay as a result of the amount of money we're gonna make
(06:10) right so it's it's the negative consequence of the positive that amplifies the believability of the statement if we're warning people that the extreme adverse effects of the of the of the result that we're promising in an extreme fashion then it makes the the the underlying believability of whether or not they're going to achieve it seem assumed right and then it makes the entire set of of sentences or the preceding argument um more uh persuasive right and believable and so ultimately um this is one of my favorite persuasion tactics
(06:46) and i love it because it's so based in integrity right you're just saying all of the things that someone is going to find out eventually you might as well use those things to increase the persuasiveness of your argument right and so i wanted to leave this with you i hope you found it valuable keep keeping awesome try it in your copy try it when you're presenting something in a sales presentation and i guarantee you um you will have a prospect who believes you much more and is more likely likely to buy so lots of love and i'll

Transcript:
(00:00) i was asked to speak at the war room mastermind which is a thirty thousand dollar year mastermind i think it's a two or three hundred person program run by ryan dice perry belcher and roland fraser and it's a it's a great program and i was asked to speak on sales i have given versions of this sales presentation a handful of times but this is the best one that i think captured the audio and the visual and everything kind of put together and it's condensed into a 30 minute video so i think you guys will absolutely enjoy this so if you're building your first sales script
(00:25) if you're scaling a sales team and you want to make sure that you can onboard new people and get them selling at the same percentage or better than you are right now which for many people is biggest bottleneck especially when you're coming to for your first million or first three million per year scaling the sales team is one of the most difficult tasks and so i've broken this down into three frameworks that i've used very successfully to scale lots of different sales teams i say that the the company i'm referencing in this video has 14 that one company already now has
(00:49) almost 30 sales guys so this process continued to work past when i made this presentation so if you're trying to scale sales you want to close a higher percentage you want to get more guys closing at that same percentage or better than yours and if you don't know who i am my name is oxford mozzie on acquisition.
(01:05) com we had a portfolio at this moment of six companies to do 85 million a year keep being awesome love you and enjoy the video what i'm going to be breaking down today is the scripting process that we've applied for calls right and so as the world's worst marketer i set my first email this year i was very excited about it we've been in business for 10 years uh pretty big stuff and it was because i couldn't get webinars i couldn't get vsls i couldn't get all the fancy stuff that you guys get to work um and so i went back in time and just was like if i can just get them to give my phone number i'll be able to get them to like buy [ __ ] from me and so i went and
(01:35) called back all these webinar leads that never showed up or never bought or whatever and ended up doing like 100 000 in sales in a day and i was like wow this is so much easier and so over time i've consulted with sales teams i've uh trained and owned four high ticket performance teams i think we have 12 or 14 sales guys now it kind of rotates and so what i want to do is kind of show you what we've done to consistently replicate the skill of sales in another human being would that be cool all right so if i can add like 10 to your conversion rate in terms of how you attract better closers how you
(02:07) script the process out and how you should close more deals and scale them to incentivize them would that be valuable for you guys all right sweet so these are the uh three frameworks that transform losing funnels into cash machines that was my real life that was a picture of my actual first funnel and that's what it became and so these are the three fails uh the frameworks number one closer framework how to ask questions prospects to say yes adding this to a funnel instantly can make it profitable alright this is my personal experience number two is a conviction framework all right how anyone who
(02:35) believes can outperform a seasoned sales rep by simply learning control their tone really important this is one of the biggest things that most sales people miss number three the scaling framework how to easily duplicate this process across sales people in any niche in seven days or less so seven days from now we can do this would that be cool all right let's rock so number one the closer framework after going through hundreds of scripts i've bought grand stuff for about the wolf of wall street stuff i bought all that stuff and going through my own sales processes i learned that the the scripting process
(03:04) even was simpler i think than it's portrayed it's not that it's something to be sold against but um every sales script that has been absolutely gangbusters has been a question-based framework that is based on this process all right and this works for b to c sales works for bsb uh b2b sales it works for 500 tickets it works for 100 000 tickets the process is the same and so this is the acronym closer framework as i said world's dumbest marketer so i made it nice and easy to remember all right so c clarify why they are there when i look at creating a script the first thing we ask is like
(03:37) why the hell are you here what made you reach out to us today what was the thing what is the goal you're trying to accomplish right two label them with a problem we can't cure cancer unless they admit that they have it right has anyone had that situation like i just wanted to find out more information you ever had that right well it's like well i'm assuming you're not hopping on sales calls all day just running for fine information is there a problem you're trying to solve oh you're fat got it all right boom see
(04:00) that's a problem we can solve it after that i'm sure i'm assuming i'm not the first guy you've ever dated right so is there anything else that you've had happen in the past that got you here that didn't work i'd love to know more about it s once we've gone through the pain we saw on the vacation right there's a process that i'll walk through e we explain away there are concerns because obviously same people don't make decisions on the first call unless you're a closer in which case they do which i'll talk about and then finally
(04:23) and this is something that we actually added in my original framework for my first couple years was close and then we added the r because when you do this it actually transitions into the onboarding process that will get higher ltv per customer lower churn lower refunds or chargebacks which are sales guys and you will be happy about cool all right let's rock so we'll examine each one more closely clarify why they're there these are the questions that sounds like what made you come in today what made you reach out what's your goal right now why is that important to you why that number specifically what does that what does it
(04:53) resonate for you right why is that real l the questions that we're looking is like okay so what i'm hearing is xyz usually does that sound about right right really simple but very important it's a milestone that has to be hit in the process all right then we overview all right this is where we're gathering all the intel and for some of you guys my goal is that you can take this to your sales team or your sales director and run your script through this framework and then see where you can plug it you probably have some of it but if you're missing one or two of these questions with milestones you're losing
(05:22) conversions on the call like you're closing people who already had those obstacles covered but everyone who didn't have two of these questions covered you lose them and you don't know why you watch the sales call and you're like what the hell happened here right so what have you tried so far to accomplish that how this is what we call the pain cycle it's a four-step process what have you tried so far to accomplish this how long did you do that for how long ago had that worked for you what else have you tried right so we just do that cycle until they're like oh yeah that's it now that you think
(05:50) about it i've tried everything under the sun like i can't imagine what that's felt like wow right it's not your fault you're so close you're six inches away right and i think you've had this one thing which i'm about to show in a second we could be able to help you wanna hear about the program fantastic that's when you transition to sale right so sell them a vacation the number one thing that people mess up our sales pitch on the call is under three minutes three minutes 180 seconds when we talk about um i think someone was asking about what are the bullets on the page
(06:23) we don't say anything about that because what we're trying to do is get them to understand what they're going to experience not how they're going to experience it right and so when we have a sales pitch just about every time we sell three things right and it doesn't matter what industry and i was training a mortgage leads team and they were selling leads right it was like the leads are exclusive they're timely and they're qualified right so we talked about hey you've had leads in the past ah well the zillow leads my real estate people right the zillow leads are not they are timely
(06:53) but they're definitely not exclusive these are people just window shopping right our leads are different three things you can always find them you're selling fitness you're selling fitness nutrition accountability right and so what we do is when we say the three bullets get them to understand yes that takes five seconds cool fitness wise we get the commitment this is what i need you to do fair enough let's be like and you should work out three days a week can you do that awesome if we see any hesitation you have a 30-second story that's memorized most of this script and this is what makes it scalable is a
(07:22) question-based framework which means if you get lost you can find your way back again if anybody here have scripts that are like paragraphs and stuff anyone okay like no no one has a script that's paragraphs and pages please we all know um but if you have those things it'll totally mess it up because then the sales guy gets lost and then he's just free balling and he has no idea where he is hot dog in the hallway no idea what's going on right and so the point is here little visual anyways is that when we're telling the story
(07:52) like with the fitness example i would say hey when you failed in the past like right now do you have a do you have a favorite tv show game of thrones that's awesome do you feel like like you got to get motivated watch game of thrones you're like oh man i've been wanting to watch it but i just can't get up the motivation to watch tv they're like well no i don't have that it's like right and so that's exactly how we're going to make your fitness program so if you look forward to you don't need the motivation and the willpower because
(08:17) that's why you failed in the past they're like oh i didn't talk about the workouts the heart rate and the calories they're going to burn and they're going to sweat because all that [ __ ] sounds like work right but what they do get is exactly what they want which is wait so you're telling me that if i actually like something i'm not going to even have to try and it's going to feel like watching tv because i look forward to it it's exactly what i'm saying and if you can deliver you make tons of money and
(08:41) that's the point so each of those points your sales guys should know what that anecdotal story is right if i was selling accountability anywhere of kids anyone here tell their kids to brush their teeth and we have their kids who brush their teeth say they don't want to brush their teeth anyone tell their kids even though they want to brush their teeth to brush their teeth anyways and now you're an adult did your parents do that to you do you brush your teeth that's an example of external accountability turning into an internal habit that's exactly what the accountability we're going to do in this program just does that make sense
(09:14) great done next bullet that's how you transition the pitch right so if you think about this process why are you here i have cancer i think we might be able to help you out but i don't want to get into that because i don't know about you like i don't know what your situation is tell me what you've done ah that sounds that sounds great that makes sense okay i think we might be able to see a little bit about that all it is i tell three stories that make complete sense to everything you just told me and then we transition and so um i pretty much just covered this um but we call it selling the vacation
(09:45) not the plane flight right and so we're not selling tsa we're not selling your modules you may plan your macros you work out your support team your urls your whatever right we're selling maui we're selling the final destination and it doesn't matter what level of service you are selling you're always selling the same thing it's always maui it's just how do you want to get there you want to swim to maui right do you want to take a boat to maui do you want to take a normal flight or do you want to take a private jet to maui
(10:08) right it's your call you're getting them out either way because we're a man of our word and i'm not going to sell you something that's not going to deliver right but it's going to be a little different a little bit rockier but we're going to get you there all right so everyone gets to maui the variables are the squeak the speed and the quality of the journey all right the likelihood of arrival is assumed so since it's always the same thing you probably have multiple levels of business um but it's always the same process right and so once we have that
(10:30) they're like got it and then we just make the ask all right from this point going forward it's explaining away their concerns like any human being would normally do i could drill price over comes with you but i think it's more valuable to explain the thought process behind price stall and decision maker objections alright so the first and obvious one is i can't afford it anyone get this one right a couple people two people have gotten this you guys have the best leads give me your leads um and so the easy question that i use to
(11:01) explain to our sales team because it's really about breaking their lease beliefs is if we were giving away ferraris right now for five grand do you think they'd find a way to get the money yes so that simply they do not understand the value you're trying to provide and if you can get your team to believe that then they understand that it is always their fault if someone cannot afford the program does that make sense fantastic second decision maker clothes one of the hardest things to overcome right i gotta have my business partner i gotta have my husband my spouse my
(11:32) whatever right so we give a specific process that we go about this and so what we do is in the very beginning we just say we circumvent then we go over past agreements and then we ask for forgiveness all right this is the best way that i've seen to overcome this so the first thing we say is well what if they say no one out of three times they'll be like i'll probably do it anyway so we're like let's get started boom it's done you'd be amazed how many times that actually works it's hilarious if they say well then i wouldn't do it then we divert we say well what do you think their biggest
(12:03) objection would be about it because now they're just using a foil even the person's not there and it's no idea what the program is because they're not involved with the call right they're like well i think this and at this point we can attack the actual obstacle even though the decision maker isn't there now if they still if we still can't overcome it then we go to past agreements we say well does your business partner know that you guys are struggling on sales well yeah does he approve of that well no then why would he be against something
(12:26) that he already doesn't approve of that doesn't make any so why would he being it's a business partner solving a problem what you do well it's great you're being a great partner let's go right and so we try and rely on past agreements that are obvious and use those to project into the present right and then finally you know sometimes it's better as for uh forgiveness and permission right and so we'll tack that on to then you can put that at the end of any of the closes and so when we're dealing with this with price it's value with decision maker we go on past
(12:55) agreements and with stalls we just teach people to make decisions people are so afraid of making the wrong decision they're petrified and so we do is we literally teach them on the call here's how we make a decision these are the variables you should be considering x y and z right can the product meet your needs do you think that if you work with us you have a greater or lower likelihood of losing weight greater fantastic i think we're halfway there do you want to work with us do you think it'd be fun to hang out and see me everyday because believe me this stash i had i had to work 12 months to get my
(13:26) wife to say yes to that so i understand if you're hesitant does that make sense would you be willing to do that all right let's rock right and then do you have access to funds or know someone who does right because it's not just about you because if it's something that's amazing we can find other ways to finance this so do you have access or know someone who does yes well then great let's get started and if for some reason we haven't closed them at this point we say how about this let's take a card
(13:51) down we'll delay the payment to friday you go to your husband go to your business partner right you go to your i love this one you go to your husband right and he says baby i want you to live a shorter life i want you to i want you to be a terrible example of our kids i want you to not have generational health in our family to be passed down i want you to sit in that corner i want you to pull those sweatpants up take up a bag of cheetos rub your fingers on there right and just get comfortable with the fact that you're never going to look better than you are right now it's like if your husband says that to you you call me
(14:19) back and i will tear this contract up fair enough right you close them all right so we explain away their concerns and then finally we get the yes we reinforce the decision this is stuff that we started doing it helped a lot so personalized video from the ceo hey welcome aboard so happy to have you thank you for trusting us with your business hey we're so happy to have you thank you for touching with your weight loss journey and our personal licenses we're gonna do everything in our power to absolutely amaze you right little things like that because the customer is usually deciding whether or not they like your business in the first
(14:47) 48 hours after the sale i learned this later so how you hand off from sale to customer experience and activation is where this all happens does that make sense is that cool was that nice framework to work through okay so that's the disclosure framework that is the first thing that's what you can run your script through all right how to ask the questions to get the prospects to say yes check one down two to go you with me you're still good all right let's rock so conviction framework number two how anyone who believes can outperform a season sales rep by simply learning to
(15:19) control their tone all right so um after i reworked all of our scripts using the closure framework um some of my guys were really successful but other ones still blew and i was like well this sucks right i was really excited i had a little acronym and everything i was like that took me a long time to come with the acronym right i was like what gives and so i talked to my friends um and they recommended this book which was awesome and the biggest takeaway from this book is the is the concept of tone and this was something that really helped take us and give an extra edge to our sales training ourselves process and
(15:55) the coaching that we give people right and so in the book he talked about the hidden dialogue which i just love and i just i just never want to take credit for an idea because i got over man but there's two dialogues that are happening right because the words are the logic right what you're actually saying is talking the logical brain how you say it is talking to the emotional brain right that's the ones making decisions that's the one running the shot all right and so how you say what you say is what you say
(16:24) so here's an example that's my wife she's going to be here with me soon but if she were here if she said alex right or alex right or alex very different meanings very different afternoon for me in each of these scenarios right based on how she said it because there's so much communicated and that's just one word imagine a 30-minute dialogue where each word can be chosen to have packed with the meaning that you need them to feel does that make sense okay so we need the words for the logical influence we need the tone for the
(17:03) emotional influence we need both okay and so once you become a more seasoned like sales prep you can learn to control your tone on purpose right you can raise your voice at the end of the statement make it into a question right it's a question this is john right i didn't need to ask him i'm saying you know to answer that as a question i didn't ask you that but you know that based on the tone right or i could lower my voice right now see that what i'm saying extremely important right tone matters and so it takes time to develop this level of unconscious mastery so there's two ways to develop this
(17:39) and i believe that you can either trick yourself into it or you can train yourself into it and since i don't have enough time in 30 minutes to train on the influence of tonalities here's the trick is that all right let's give you the hack conviction will correct your tone if you believe in what you sell you will say it the right way and that's why some of you guys have a sales rep that comes on crushes it and then tanks because they did believe and then they saw your reviews or they got customer support feedback or someone called them
(18:08) up after buying it was like [ __ ] you i can't believe you did that and they're done and then all their tones off because they feel like out of ethics right and so i'm lowering my tone right now so you know that this is really important right and so i'll go upbeat kiss the boo-boo bring us back up all right and so real estate sales team consulting this is a great story so i was flown out paid way more money than i should have been paid um to fly out and consult with the sales team all right they were selling mortgage leads the example i was given earlier and they were really excited they wanted
(18:38) me to give this abc always be closing chat like this huge pump up chat so i spent the first half the day on the script and the second half of the day was supposed to be drilling the sales team right so i get on the sales team they got they got a nine person sales floor and uh they're like we're having some problems with this guy john i was like alright cool so i was like john how good are the leads he was like well you know there's kind of and i was like i'm good thank you and i was like because if you [ __ ] thought the leads
(19:07) were good you would say dude they're unreal i can't believe it right now i'm getting my mom to pass her real estate certification so i can start sending her leads i'm studying for mine i'm a couple months behind but i'm telling you as soon as i [ __ ] get this thing passed i'm out of here i'm gonna start buying these leads myself because i'll make more than i make right now as a sales guy that's what you'd say if you believed right the way you say and what you'd say would be entirely different and so one of the hacks on this by the way has anyone ever gotten hot or has a sales
(19:32) guy got hot start just closing closing close it close it anyone that becomes the sales training for that person because the way they ask the question at what point how they closed that's how it's perfect and so they should study the best game footage when they're on a streak and that's when you can replicate it much more easily because it's like in the wild you'll witness it and that's when they're masters right in those moments all right and so these are the actions that we do so i'm transitioning into tactics for you guys who have teams all right re-read the testimonials out loud daily
(20:03) in front of your sales team if you got fresh ones which you should read them it makes their day makes them feel like they're making an impact right you're getting the [ __ ] kicked out of them every single day getting hung up on getting cussed at getting to [ __ ] off every day right and like the best thing you can do is give them a cup of coffee that says hey man you're [ __ ] doing good in the world right so they need so do it every day number two fix everything you can about the product this is obvious but i want to say it directly like don't blame the customer for a lack of success
(20:30) because it doesn't help anyone right doesn't help them doesn't help us if we can take ownership then we can fix the product right three never stop improving it so you always know what's up to date this is a good one for the sales team if your sales dip take your head of customer support bring them to the sales meeting and say erica tell these guys what you do for our customers they're like oh well the first day what we do is we send this text and we send them this letter and then we give them swag and then we follow up with them and then we like write them a handwritten card and leave them a back massage and a foot massage and then we
(20:58) find a wife for them it's unbelievable you know what i mean and then the sales guys are like god this is [ __ ] awesome i'm like i know let's go sell it right and so these are the actions that you can do on a daily basis to get your team to be excellent all right and so that's how you can hack conviction and get your team's tone unconsciously correct by just truly believing the product is that cool you think you'd sell more if you did that sweet thank you all right conviction framework number two check all right number three scaling framework
(21:26) how to easily duplicate this process across sales people in any niche in seven days or less all right so we've talked about closure framework we've talked about conviction framework and this is the oops i think i'm gonna skip one i don't know where you're at great so when i showed my sales team to the stuff they didn't do it every time all right because you're probably going to come back from here all gung-ho you might show them this video and they're like yeah they go rah-rah for two to three days and then it's like back to normal right no one wants that
(21:49) so piece by piece we implemented processes to get the same outcome over and over and over again because of the 110 million dollars we've sold which is crazy it's been 100 over the phone no one over the age of 20 no we got one guy who's 40. but beyond besides him everyone's younger than 27 27 27 years old all right like these aren't like crazy you know i mean like crazy veterans right you just do this process over and over again and get the right thing as a total aside find people and educate them about your
(22:21) prospect not your product because that's a big [ __ ] up because like they shouldn't even be talking that much about the product they should be knowing everything about the prospect and so right now if your sales training is focused on your product you're doing it wrong these are the six c's that i use to scale teams from little guy to lots of guys all right so this delta you know we used this to build a 3000 person affiliate base in our physical products company it added 35 million in sales which is cool which is awesome and so i will show you how this works all right
(22:52) and so um we've used these sales teams and this is how we kind of these are all multi-figure teams and i'll show you what we did all right so closer sequence is the first c which we went over earlier the second c is consistent daily training and conviction and i'll show you how to do each of these call recordings you got to record them communication cycles cuts and competition there's the six c's all right so number one make sure you have a question-based framework that follows those steps in the script it should just
(23:19) be questions it's so much easier to just follow questions because if someone's out and you know out in left field you know wandering like onto the highway you're like whoa hey come back over here this is the next question in this process so thank you so much for sharing that that must have been so hard for you so what do you think that brought you right i think you go right in the next question the sale all right number two uh consistent daily training this is the number one thing if you take one thing away from this besides
(23:43) conviction because that'll do more for yourselves than anything this is the second biggest thing all right is that daily training our team trains 60 minutes a day five days a week we actually do twice a day stuff but that's okay anyways for right now if you just do this you'll already be way better than everyone else in your market all right so we do talking and listening because the salesperson needs to know how to speak the right tone you know to listen right so we draw both scales for talking we have them read the script out loud and the questions with the correct tonality
(24:11) for 25 minutes and if they [ __ ] up they start again simple five minutes we drill obstacle overcomes i need to think about it i'm not sure i don't have the money can't afford that right now i gotta talk to my partner right i know what's gonna work in my market or whatever your specific obstacles are because those when they're in the red zone they shouldn't have to think about those so the only two things that someone will ever truly memorize will be those 30-second anecdotal stories i mentioned earlier and your optical overcomes it makes it much easier to get new people on the
(24:39) team listening so every day we'll listen to a 30-minute recording and we'll go with what went right in this call what went wrong what do you do next time very simple right you play the call everyone watches it's game tape review we're like man you got kicked in the balls on this one right but you had great rapport in the first five minutes right um you're like what went wrong and that was about it um and what you gonna do next time i'm gonna transition from the report of the question asking without sounding a douchebag fantastic all right next day
(25:14) and you continue to improve i know this sounds crazy simple but it's so simple no one will do it so number three sees is call recordings if you don't call like record your calls one you're not compliant but two like how are you going to study game film you know i mean everybody's got all their data and you've got your mouse tracking on all the pages i'm like where's the mouse tracking on the calls right that's where that's where you're going to train your team this is like every nba team they play the game and
(25:37) they watch the game footage right why are we not doing that with the sales team and so you should have to record it if you use zoom gong is absolutely the best highly recommend it it's been awesome we'll use it for two years they'll tell you exactly how many minutes people are talking versus someone else they'll tell you who's talking the most where how many questions were asked if the ai they have there is unbelievable it's expensive but it's worth it four calm cycles and feedback um i don't know if you guys have heard the story but if i were trying to uh fix
(26:02) your golf swing right and i said okay so i take a swing looking like i do like a like an idiot right he's like all right man well first off lose 40 pounds so you can rotate all right after you do that uh change your wrist by two degrees turn your other hand over put your thumb underneath i need you to take your first foot put it forward and then point it the other way and then put this foot back and try again i'm [ __ ] no chance of swinging right but if he just said hey take another 20 swins and just put one thumb under the other one
(26:32) i'd have one thing to work on and i could probably get better and so when you're training and this is for the sales directors if you're helping them out with that call what went right went wrong that what am i going to do about it is the one thing does that make sense and so in terms of communication cycles we do weekly with the team we've got daily training we've got daily wrap-up at the end which is really just to pump up and kiss them on the forehead good night to make sure they feel okay right because they do get punched in the face all day so it's worth being like hey you see derek's overcome this
(27:02) morning is [ __ ] awesome he killed it let's watch that as like highlight footage like watch him say he's gonna have to talk to his wife overcome right and then and then they're like dude you killed it and then it just makes them feel like they're part of the team right and so that's where we do the feedback and the communication cycles and then we do one so once a week if they're new we'll do one-on-ones if they're a little bit older we'll do once every other week does that make sense can you use this right now what i'm giving you for your sales teams okay sweet
(27:27) number five cut the fat cut it fast um randy probably knows this better than anyone when you hire salespeople at least in my experience like it's sink or swim like if guys if guys can't close in the first week to two weeks unless it's some sort of crazy complex thing they ain't closing right and then i've got somebody who now came in neutral now they feel like they suck right they're actually worse than someone who's new because now i got to overcome all your beliefs and then bring you back up and so in my experience it's
(27:56) been much easier to take a six and get them to a nine than try and take then try and take a two and get him to a five it's more work and it's not good for me or him right does that make sense so in most cases does anyone have a sales person that you've been waiting for them to turn the corner for the last like six months they're not going to turn the corner unless they've come to jesus moment which does happen but it doesn't need to happen on my team you can do that and come back right all right number six competition and career path all right it's a big one so sales people are
(28:28) competitive right as they should be right they are hunters and they should go hunt and so having competition on regular basis what we have found is that six week cycles tends to work best it is long enough that they believe they can accomplish something but short enough they believe it's going to happen soon and so we run our competitions on six week cycles um for us i think what you said uh whatever ryan said about the percentages 10 to 15 percent actually works pretty well as like a group goal um when we have those
(28:51) as like top sales person would like we did like weekend to vegas so we'll split all the guys that way like four teams of four you know what i mean they're all comp so it's like you get the the competitiveness but you still get the camaraderie because if it's just one you know one versus everyone sometimes they can get um a little bit too you know teethy uh and so having like little mini teams helps too because then you can you can kind of like make it an adjusted draft you put the best guy with the worst guy and then he helps him out and he speeds him up does that make sense
(29:15) and then career path this is one that i probably learned later but it's really good is that you can have minor minor road uh milestones like 50 deals closed 100 deals closed 150 deals closed right and they just get a little just a little you know they go from 500 a deal to 525 a deal right they go from 525 to 550 a deal just the fact that there's this this road map of where they're going and there's actual progress because sales is one of the most repetitive positions in the world just the fact that they're doing this and they're something is changing on the outside i think just helps relieve
(29:50) anxiety and help the guys focus so that is one of the things that i would recommend doing with the career path and then obviously if you have roles like depending how big your team is manager etc and you can move up something that i don't have on here that i will add is that this seems to be common practice but remember dumbest marketer on earth outbound and inbound keep them separated and we also have setters and closers for both of those teams so outbound sets are different than inbound sets which go to different enclosures on
(30:18) either side right because the prospects are a little bit different right and so if you if you have lots of different types of leads going to the same person you're probably losing a lot of efficiency if you don't have that much lead flow that's another issue but it's as soon as you can separating them out will get you a lot a lot higher conversion rates all right so i'll recap this the 60s for scaling our closer sequence make sure that's in a question-based framework daily trainings and conviction so you're reading the testimonials every day you're training them every morning on talking listing the most valuable skills
(30:45) that a salesperson can have call recordings to make sure that they're actually doing any of gamete footage to actually look at communication cycles to actually improve on their skills based on the game footage that we just had you cut the bottom people who are just dragging the team down that probably just don't have the makeup for this and then you keep it competitive and you give them a career path so they have something to look forward to in the future all right and so uh now you can understand how anyone can sell expensive life paper pro even if you don't think
(31:07) you're any good which is completely normal yeah that sales


The anti-routine...[what billionaires use to win] - YouTube
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRyGIzW9d9k

Transcript:
(00:00) in this video I'm going to walk you through the exact anti-routine that took me from broke to taking home over seven figures a month in income not revenue and income by the time I was 28 years old and that may sound totally unbelievable to you that's okay you can Google me my name is Alex ramosi I'm a business investor out acquisition.
(00:16) com which is a portfolio company so it's about 85 million a year and the reason I'm making this video is because I see stuff on the internet all the time if people talk about their million dollar routines all the stuff and all the guys that I know who are like me are like worth nine figures and up don't do it that way all right and so I'm going to walk you through what people actually do and the things that I had to go through uh in those seasons of building that are not commonly talked about as additional note there's uh for some reason there's
(00:39) like a half second uh freeze that happens like every so often on the video uh it's something we're fixing on our side uh but my audio continues to go throughout so don't sweat it and we are fixing it either way um welcome to MOSI nation and enjoy the video all right so what I want to do is actually walk you through the a paradigm shift that happened in my life when I went from looking at bankruptcy lawyers to 18 months later taking home over a million dollars a month when I was 27 years old all right this is half a
(01:03) decade ago but there was a very distinct process that happened that that transformed my life and it did have to do with a routine which is like the most fodder thing ever that most people uh ask me for which is like hey Alex what's your routine but what I'm going to do in this video is break down to you why the questions that people are asking were wrong because they're asking them the wrong way the first thing here is that most people have the assumption that and they say hey Alex can you tell me your routines can you tell me your rituals
(01:30) that you do every day they think to themselves there's something that Alex is doing that I am not doing and therefore if I do those things I will get that resolved and I will tell you that you were wrong and here's why most people most Champions do not have something that you do not have they they lack something that you have for a champion in the Physical Realm a lot of times it's they don't have an off switch they just keep going you have an off switch it is your lap their lack of it which is what drives their success right
(01:57) and so to the same degree you probably do things every single day that you should not be doing and so what I want to introduce to you is a concept of the anti-routine as the most productive routine that is humanly possible for you to accomplish what you want and so during this 18-month period of time when I went from almost bankrupt to taking home a million dollars a month when I was 27 years old was the following change that ended up happening and mindset shifts I'll walk through the mindset shifts and then I'll walk
(02:23) through the tactics that actually changed my life in a real way the things that I stopped doing rather than things that I started doing that ended up yielding the results that were outsized so number one is obviously just shifting the perspective of I need to do more things and I need to add more things to my routine when in fact you need to stop doing things that you're currently doing all that remains is the work to be done and then you become very clear about why you are not being effective so number one is that priorities mean two things
(02:49) cannot be equally important and here's the mentally challenging thing about this is that when you work on something and let's say I spend 30 minutes on this thing and I spend 30 minutes on on Item B if I spend 30 minutes on both things and I say this one's more important than this one I can say that but that's not reality because I basically just said they were both important which means neither of them are which is why most people cannot get done because they cannot say no and so the theme of this entire video is the word no all right
(03:20) and so this is the this is the word that I will give you that you can tell yourself you can plaster it on your wall is the season of no and I'm not saying it's forever I'm saying it's just for right now a lot of people don't need new things to add to the routine you need to have a routine of saying no and an anti-routine and that is the thing that's going to yield those those outsized Returns on productivity you can't say yes to everything and therefore it means that you have to you can't do two things with different
(03:46) levels of importance it's either important or it's not important if it's important it means you mean to say no to everything else all right so if you say this is the priority then it means you do not do other things besides that thing that is how it is a priority that is how you literally prioritize number two is that from a communication perspective one of the things that I had to really understand and I'm a pretty people-pleasing person I enjoy I enjoy other people like I'm social is that when people communicate with you when
(04:14) people reach out to you when people text you and people email you they actually have an implied ask within the communication from you it's actually a take and what that takes says is that there's a request to reply are they're asking you to do something which is to reply to the message and to illustrate why you can't do this at scale is because let me imagine right now that 500 000 people text you do you owe them all a reply the answer is no because you couldn't literally do anything else in your life besides reply to those people
(04:44) if that's what you did and so here's what's crazy most people have the time to reply and conflate the fact that they have time with the fact that they are obliged they are obligated to reply and so when I show you that 500 000 text example it's to show you that if I can remove the time from your brain that means it would be physically impossible for you to reply you realize that the obligation or reply never existed to begin with all right and so during this season of no during this this anti-routine period of time what I did
(05:13) during that 18 months was I stopped replying to people and not only that I'll get to the taxes of how I did that in a second but I just stopped replying all together and this is a huge thing for me it was very very difficult for me and I'll give you the actual taxes around what I said the next thing I realized that all of the events and masterminds and coaching programs mostly served other social they were mostly for social needs they were not because I had a problem that needed to be solved and so I ended up going to a mastermind
(05:41) getting what I needed and then I didn't show up to that same Mastermind for the next 18 months and then from there 18 months later I was like a huge success story in The Mastermind and it wasn't because I got what I needed and then I spent the rest of that time executing and there was no point to me going back because I knew what needed to be done and it needed doing and that was it here are some of the tactics that I ended up implementing during this period of time that massively changed my life because it got me to stop doing everything that
(06:08) I was doing so that all that remained was the work to be done all right so number one is that I changed my phone number I changed my phone number because all these people uh were always asking me to reply and so there's the actual time of communication of the the constant texting back and forth all the interruptions but also the hey you gotta sex hey can we have on a meeting hey can I bend your ear hey can we talk about this thing hey do you want to jam on this topic right and as somebody who likes to give I was always literally
(06:34) when I looked at my schedule half my day was like one-off calls that I was like well maybe this is an important thing but you would be amazed at how much Blank Space appears in your calendar when you say no to everything I like I really want to like you would be amazed at how much Blank Space shows up on your calendar when you say no to everything so number one is I changed my phone number what I did is I actually gave my phone number to my yay and I got a new phone number and the only people that I would choose to communicate with
(07:02) were people that I realized that I needed to and then I would find their number rather than ever being responsive to every single person who had mine whichever the years was a lot so that's the first thing I did the second like I said is I stopped going to all of these events because I knew what needed to be done so I didn't need more information I needed more execution right so if you look at your own self it's like do I need more information or do more execution now if you're ignorant in terms of knowing what you need to do to
(07:24) succeed you need to go like what needs to be done is you need to find out that information but once you know what needs to be done anything that is you not doing that thing is getting in the way of you accomplishing what you want number three is that I stopped taking meetings from 4 AM to noon every day I worked for the first eight hours completely uninterrupted and it was because during that first season when you're you know zero to one million one million to three million sometimes even at 5 million sometimes you're still you
(07:49) don't have enough leverage because of your team or maybe the the number the level of Talent on your team that you need to still be doing a lot of doing like you can't look at what like my routine might be now because I have teams of people that if I if I say hey go do this and do this and do this I have 20 people who can execute and those 20 people are going to amount to more work then I can do possibly on my own and that's because I have leverage but until you have leverage leveraging your time appropriately is what is going to
(08:15) move the needle the most and so from 4 AM to noon every single day I accepted no meetings and only worked on the priority which meant I did the thing and I said no to everything else the next thing that I started saying no to was I said no to bedtimes that were different on weekends versus weekdays I stopped treating weekends different than I treated weekdays and I had the same bedtime so I had the same wake-up time so that every single day I could say no to everything during 4 to 12.
(08:43) all right now once you say no to weekends as a different day to weekdays the next thing is like well what are the other things that you changed about your life in terms of allocating your time what about your health well during this period of time I only worked out about twice a week and that was because that was my minimum effective dose for working out right because that was all I needed just to maintain I wasn't trying to make progress on multiple fronts because it was not the priority and I'm saying this again because people always want to make
(09:08) you know progress on 100 fronts sometimes like you have so much growth Juju you only have so much and you have to allocate it to the things that are highest priority and if it's a priority then it means saying no to everything else the next piece is like what about what about food stuff so for me it was actually more productive for me to fast one or two days a week because then I could work and not be interrupted by the eating preparation thinking cleaning of food two days a week I would just have caffeine and bone broth and that was
(09:35) what I did for the day and it was super easy and that way I stopped you know I started starting a little bit lose a little bit of fat while I was at it the next thing I did was I deleted all social media from my phone and that is because I realize is that I could have an accurate time on my calendar which was just to post and I could do most of the apps from my computer so if you're actually just going there to post not to consume and interact you can do most of the the Social Media stuff from your computer and that's what I ended up
(10:03) doing so I deleted all that stuff from my phone and you'd be amazed at your like ghost thumb of how addicted you are because most people spend like three to five hours a day on their phone consuming social media it's literally the new age of watching television and we're like I can't think about how I can get stuff it's like if you got those three hours back you would have so much more stuff done which goes back to the anti-routine it's not what you are not doing which is causing uh it's not like there's some secret magic routine that's
(10:28) going to get you there it's just that most of the stuff you are doing you need to stop and you need to enter into a season of no those were the the primary tactics that I changed during the 18 months of going from almost bankrupt to taking home over a million dollars a month when I was 27 years old and I know I just went straight into the rant here but if you don't know who I am my name is Alex ramosey I own acquisition.
(10:47) com it's a I'm a business investor we do we have about eight six portfolio companies at this point we do about 85 million dollars a year I make these videos because I two was once broke and I don't want other people to go through the same stuff that I did and so if I can provide value to you and make sure that my pain was not in vain all right so uh enjoy the videos I appreciate you Mosey Nation if you're new welcome and I'll see you in the next videos bye

Transcript:
(00:00) I hit a $100 million net worth at age 31 but before that I lost all my money twice and the difference between me losing all my money the first few times and now are these rules so this is nobs advice for making money and keeping it number one passive income is a lie if you think about how money is made you make money during time because every minute we're alive a minute passes time passes and we make money over that time period which means every single person on planet Earth has a dollars per hour that they make and so it's not that
(00:34) passive income doesn't exist just as much as active income doesn't exist it's a spectrum where it's how active is it or how passive is the activity that I'm doing relative to the time that I'm investing and so I would eliminate active versus passive and simply say what is my return on time or how much do I make per hour it's just that most people get really scared of that like no one should trade their hours for money everyone trades their hours for money it's just that when they receive the money it's just not denoted in hours and so I think there's two Downstream
(01:07) impacts in terms of changing your behavior around this that I had to apply number one is that I was obsessed with trying to find quick easy low you know effort money things and so I ended up spending tons of money on things that I was obsessed with hoping would cost me no time to make and I would put not nearly enough time to the things I was acting ly making money with and thinking how could I just make my active income significantly higher and I would get obsessed with the idea that everything I did actively had to be scalable or it
(01:43) wasn't worth it because if it's not scalable then why why should I buy I shouldn't trade my time for money but if I looked at what I was making over the last year and divided it by the amount of money I made per hour this activity was 15 times what I was averaging per hour so I should absolutely do as many hours of that until all of my hours are that and then I should find something else I can trade my time for that's even higher and so if you want a very humbling experience look at how much you made last year and then divide it by
(02:15) 2,000 if you want to know how much you made just in a 40-hour work week now if you want to look at how much you made per actual hour of being alive you can divide it by around 8,000 or just take that number and divide it by four and that's actually how much you make per hour and so when you're looking at is this worth my time if it's more than that number it probably is and so what I should have done and what changed for me was that I stopped trying to invest my money from my active into trying to find more passive things and try to say how
(02:48) do I invest my money more into my active to multiply my active that I know is working number two if you can't buy it twice don't buy it once or even buy it three times or four times or five times over don't buy it once and the way that really shifted how I started spending money or rather started saving money and not spending money was when I started looking at how much time it took me to make the amount of money post tax to buy whatever I wanted and I remember this clear as day I was working at Smoothie King as a blender tender and I was
(03:20) making 675 an hour and I had just gotten a raise from 625 an hour uh I'm dating myself anyways and while I was there the cooworker that I had and I would always go to lunch next door at Coy which was like a sandwich shop and it was like 13 bucks for a sandwich right and a drink and chips and whatever right and so I remember looking at my check and my 675 an hour after taxes and fees was like six bucks an hour and I was like man I gave up 2 hours of my 6-hour shift every shift to go by lunch and I was like I'm literally giving a third of my earning away for lunch every single day if I
(03:59) knew that I had to work the first two hours just to get the sandwich I don't think I'd ever make that trade and yet I was making it every day and then I started thinking I'd go to the mall and like oh do you want a new shirt and it was at the Gap and it was 30 bucks and I was like okay well shoot that's a whole shift and I was like would I work a whole shift if someone just held up a shirt that I didn't need to do it and I was like I don't think I would and so all of a sudden it started shifting how my buying happen because I I started feeling the pain associated with what it
(04:28) would take if I had to do do that before getting the thing I was going to buy and it it completely changed my buying behavior and to be very clear saving money won't make you money but saving money allows you to have money and having money allows you to look further out and when you look further out you can take on bigger risks which absolutely will make you more money and when you're looking at the price of whatever the thing you're trying to buy is obviously when I was a teenager looking at a shirt I was looking at okay I'm making six bucks an hour a shirt's
(04:58) 30 bucks but when you're adult and you're making $100 an hour and you're looking at a $500 or ,000 purchase would you work two days in order to do that I don't know would I probably not and sometimes you think hey is uh would I work all day for two days to go out with the boys for three hours on Saturday I I'd probably be like guys I'm I I'm not going to work for two days just to go have three hours of fun right that feel like I'd rather just not work the two days and that was the thing is whenever I had the well I'd rather just not work
(05:30) than do that thing then I was like I shouldn't buy that thing for example when I was poor I only spent cash and so my easiest way of actually creating a budget was that I had a personal training client who paid me $2,000 a month in cash and so 100% of my money that came in through the business and credit cards and everything else is just what went into my bank account and the only thing I knew I could live on was was was inside of my wallet and so as that got replenished and the thing is is that I'm so scared with money or I was
(05:56) so Frugal with money that I would always make sure that I had more than that to make it for the next payment cuz sometimes the guy would take a day or two you pay on Wednesday rather than a Monday or whatever and I need to make sure that I had food forb life three most people overestimate what they can accomplish in a year and they underestimate what they can accomplish in a decade and every new employee that I have at walks into acquisition. comom the number one thing that they say they want is growth and I have this talk with
(06:21) them which is the 10year million doll contract but it's less about the million dollars and more about take whatever your net worth is now and add a zero to it or add two zeros to it you can accomplish that in a decade if you look at the biggest companies in the entire world who were worth multiple billions from their Inception until the time they were worth multiple billions many times it's under 10 years but it's still more than five more than seven and so you can accomplish lifechanging crazy amounts of
(06:49) wealth in a decade and so if you could write a contract to yourself and say I will make no money for 10 years but on the 10th year I will add a zero or two zeros or three zeros to my net worth would you do it and if the answer is yes which it almost invariably is with every person who comes into my business then I say great now act like it and so if you knew that you would make this amount of money over that period of time you would stop this Obsession myself included this is me giving my advice to my S who lost it twice when I was able to shift to
(07:24) okay what would I have to do that would make it unreasonable that I don't 10x in 10 years then all of a sudden I started making very reasonable bets that I knew would compound unto itself over that period of time and then winning became inevitable rather than a game of chance and so often times you have potential earning and then actualized earning and usually as you're realizing the potential earning you have you're usually losing out on your investing into that potential right you're realizing the potential and that's kind
(07:56) of like the kid that learns one skill and then immediately says I'm going to start a business opportunity around this one skill that makes me $5,000 a month or they have this one skill and say hey this this company is willing to pay me $100,000 a year to go do this skill where I have this other company that will give me a free internship where I could 10x my potential earning in three years but I'm going to make $35,000 a year for the three years which one would you take the problem is most people will take the $100,000 now and forgo the
(08:27) investment itself and that's the thing is we the asset that we invest in and the currency we invest into ourselves in is time experience and skills right skill is the outcome the time and the effort is what we put into it to gain the experiences which ultimately give us the skills but if you're in an environment where you're not compounding your potential earning then you're actually losing out long-term you're ripping up your million doll or your 10x or 100x contract for a decade from now so you can get the short fast money today and that's why in the early days
(08:58) when you have limited amounts of money but put lots of time and energy instead of putting your money in the S&P 500 I like to say put in the 500 because the asset that is you will always beat the stock market number four you should only have to get rich once in other words don't bet what you have and need for something you don't have and don't need and some of the gravest mistakes I made manifested in for example me getting into a partnership that I shouldn't have gotten into because I want it even more faster now when you get into a
(09:31) partnership which is usually the time where you put the most risk on the table one is you guarantee the largest decrease in your earning power you pay what the most expensive thing you have which is equity to somebody else and so people get obsessive about what they're they're you know 5% 10% later when we're making money but day one they're like all right we cut the pie in half oh we cut the pie into thirds right up front before anything's really happen if you work with a partner or decide to partner up with somebody one of your friends one of your co-workers this is coming from somebody who has nine failed
(10:02) Partnerships before I met Lea and then that has now worked and now I have successful Partnerships a partner needs to have one of these three things that you do not have either have to have money that you don't have and then the clear contribution is that money they need to have experience you don't have and the clear contribution is that experience or number three they have time and energy that you don't have and the clear contribution is that time and energy and so I added that second part on is that just because someone has it experience if they're not contributing
(10:31) it to the partnership clearly then you're still not going to get the benefit from it if they have the time and the energy but it's not clearly defined how they're going to invest that time and energy into the things you both get a return then it's not going to be a good partnership and I've lost so much money in Partnerships especially early on one of my two big losses was from a partner and a big part of it was I was insecure and I thought I just had to have somebody else cuz I was afraid to do it on my own real quick if you're trying to make your first dollar online you can go to school.com games we've got
(11:00) a whole system that's set up it's a platform you can start it for free I've got instructional videos I take a call every single week and so if you do do that you can hop on the call on Monday and I'll say hi to you just let me know that you're brand new if you are a business owner and you're trying to scale and you're doing a million bucks a year and you want to go bigger go to acquisition.
(11:22) comom hit scale and uh we'd love to see if we could help you out at one of the workshops we run here in Vegas which brings me number five if you never learn to manage your time you're never going to learn to manage your money and so the thing is is that all of us obviously have equal amounts of time that we're given not necessarily in life but at least every day and so the people who get the best Returns on their money are the ones who learn how to best invest their time and so a big misconception around money is that money in my opinion is an encapsulated version of time and since all of us trade time
(11:53) for the money that we get then it means for each person money represents a certain amount of time and the wealthier you get it's just that the denomination of money represents less time for you and so for someone else $100 may represent 4 hours for a wealthier person $100 may represent 4 minutes and so it's a constant appraisal that you do on a regular basis looking on your calendar and saying what things do I have here that I could trade my time for for more money and so again this video is about making money overall I'm not saying that you can't spend time with your girl but there is a transaction cost for that
(12:30) time and as long as you're willing to make the the trade then trade it all day but the bad trades are the one that when you actually think about it in terms of what it costs you'd say I wouldn't do the trade that's a bad deal and so over time if you continue to trade up how much time you invest for what it makes you you will always make more in your income year after year after year number six check your bank account before you check social media first thing in the morning and if it hurts you to check your bank account first thing then you
(13:00) need to do it even more because for me I started not knowing where my money was going and so I had a friend who was like dude just look and I honestly had anxiety looking in my bank account looking at what money was going out and all that kind of stuff and so I started making that habit and I had to confront it but the crazy thing is is as I started looking at my money as I started paying attention to my money my money started paying attention to me and hanging around and so Peter drer said what gets measured gets managed and so one of the most fascinating things that I found with human behavior in any kind
(13:38) of change is that the first thing that you can do to improve any metric for any skill is to actually measure it and so if you want to lose weight if you weigh yourself every day no how matter how painful the number is that intervention alone helps people lose weight you don't even have to talk about diet you don't have to tell someone to exercise if they look at the scale every day they become aware of it and when you become aware of a problem you start consciously or subconsciously making moves to change it you have that hesitation before you put that food in your mouth you have that
(14:07) hesitation before you take your wallet out when you're looking at your bank account every day it doesn't matter what it is whatever you're trying to improve but look at it confront reality and then reality will start to improve and if you're curious how long do you still check your bank account every day and I the honest truth is I stopped checking when we had about 20 million bucks um and so that started when I had in the hundreds to thousand dolls uh and continue to check every day and when I stopped checking it was that I realized my daily fluctuations in in Market
(14:37) movements and things like that across my assets uh it like I didn't I I basically wasn't able to really see it on a daily basis so I had to start extending my time Horizon for when I would check it so it' be monthly or quarterly that I started checking it uh because that way at least I know I should have some movement upwards and that is something that if you've done checking your bank account every single day four years you start to already have developed some of those disciplined skills which then you can delay gratification of having saved money for a day to having saved money
(15:08) for a quarter number seven learn how to make money before you start trying to learn how to make money make money so I see so many guys especially young guys who are like I've got a th000 bucks how do I invest $1,000 they're trying to figure out a way to get that $1,000 to compound they put it into a compounding calculator and they're like man if I get 50% returns for the next 40 years I'm going to be a billionaire but the thing is is that one it's most likely that you're going to buy a [ __ ] Dogecoin
(15:36) and then it's going to tank and then you're just going to lose your ,000 and be like wow think about this I just worked for two weeks or one month to save that ,000 and I lost it in seconds so alternatively if you take that $1,000 and you put it into how do I make more money how do I actively improve the actions and skills that I have that will get you far more and that is where you invest time rather than how do I make money make money cuz let's be real you don't have much so take the money you have into the skill the flow of making more money rather than trying to take
(16:09) this tiny thing and going from a 10% return to a 20% return because the hundred bucks extra that you yield on that ,000 I promise you if you learn how to add 50% to your skill set it'll take whatever your annual earning is up by 50% and that's going to be a hell of a lot more than 10 and that's assuming everything goes up this year which one out of four years it doesn't when you say you don't have time just immediately think to yourself I'm lying this is [ __ ] because every single person has between 5 to 9:00 a.m. and 5: to 9:00
(16:39) p.m. every day of the week even if you have a 40-hour job even if you're a full-time student because everybody has those eight hours per day now the thing is is that we're not willing to make the trade-offs because we have these things that make us comfortable cool if you reframe that thing as the thing that makes me comfortable today is the thing that's going to make me uncomfortable for a decade all of a sudden the cost of that Comfort goes up and so then it flips to if I can become uncomfortable for to day I can be comfortable for decades and so then you can seek out
(17:08) those eight hours and say you know what I'm going to flip this thing and here's the crazy part about work work makes you money in two ways one you work and you make money and secondly when you're working you're not spending money and so when you're starting out you literally have a double effect the the money that you're making the whole way through is stacking up because there's no drains on it either and so one of the biggest advantages you have is that you stay busy one of the keys to investing is
(17:33) patience what is patience patience is figuring out activities to do in the meantime think about it for a second unpack that patience is figuring out what to do in the meantime so then if the goal is to get rich and we know that that takes time and it takes time for money to compound and grow then what you do in the meantime is that you work so that you have even more money to invest and that money has the time to invest in compound while you're working and I am so passionate about this because this isn't something that I didn't do right like when I had my job in the beginning
(18:10) I just wasn't really taking the time that I should have and then I was like you know what I don't want to do this thing forever I got to get ahead but I couldn't stop doing my job so I started spending my mornings and my evenings every day and both weekend days working on what I was going to do next and in the beginning that was studying for the GMAT cuz I thought business school was going to be the next move but after studying for the GMAT and crushing the test I came to another realization which was I'm going to go to business school
(18:34) cuz I want to start a business well you know what it's going to cost me less than two years and $180,000 plus what I didn't make during the two years of not working I could probably net $10,000 a year of income which is what the average business school person graduated with when I was looking at business school and I was like I think I could get to 10 grand a month if I had 2 years to work and didn't spend 180 Grand and I took that money and just put it into a business now you're like well you didn't even have 180 Grand you're damn right I didn't I was able to save up 50 and I was like I think with this 50 I'll be
(19:03) able to spend it to learn enough to make 10 grand a month and that's what I did nine if you don't know how you can lose money in something then you're going to lose it think about this for a second if something looks amazing and you're like dude there's no way I can lose money on this you're absolutely going to lose your ass because of how little you actually know and so you have to figure out one what is my downside and all the different ways that downside can occur and then attach a reasonable likelihood that that happens and then probably multiply it by three because whenever
(19:35) you have your rosecolor glasses on you're an entrepreneur or you want to be an entrepreneur one of the quintessential traits of Entrepreneurship is optimism we are optimists we think it's all going to work out and you have to have that level of optimism to start but when you start you can't continue to have that optimism around every other opportunity because then you are going to lose your ass because you're going to be split between multiple things and so if you don't know how you can lose money you absolutely
(20:01) will because it just is an index of how little you know 10 the biggest cost that you have is ignorance so every single month you've got your rent you've got your food you've got your clothes you got your car you got whatever else you spend and you think that's my fixed costs years ago I was sitting in the audience and I saw a man write a million dollars on a whiteboard and he called someone from the audience he said how much do you make per year and they said $50,000 a year and he said would you like to make a million dollar a year and the person said yes and then he put a
(20:32) minus sign he said did you know that it's costing you $950,000 per year to not know how to make a million dollars a year and it was such a light bulb moment for me that I realized that the cost of ignorance is the difference between what your goals are and what you have today because if you knew how to achieve your goals the difference is the value of that education and conversely the difference is the cost of that debt debt of ignorance and so the number one priority in my life has always been to pay down ignorance as fast as I possibly could using whatever currency I needed to so if that was relational Capital
(21:10) that means using my network or doing favors for people or paying money which is the least efficient way of doing it I would try and find a way that I could pay down ignorance to achieve the things that I wanted so I could get the information so I could get the learning when I started um I paid to get into room so I paid $25,000 $35,000 and you're like wait I don't have that right now I get it well you pay $110,000 was the first thing I ever bought that was information based that's what I was the first thing I ever invested and how was I able to do that because I had save for two years and I'd save 50 Grand up and
(21:37) so for me I was like okay this is the direction I'm going in I'm going to invest in learning and when I got in that room the first room I was in was a gym owner room and I didn't have a gym and I paid to be in that room so I could start the gym the right way when I paid to the $25,000 room it was an internet marketing room and guess what I didn't have an internet marketing business but I paid there so I could try and learn how to do it the right way rather than try and start at the wrong way and have
(21:59) to fix it and so I think a lot of people wait too long to try and learn I always want to grab my future and pull it towards me and so I was willing to spend as much money as I had available to me to make those bets because it was a bet on me and I knew I would never lose that you can't lose you you always have Diamond hands on you like till the day you die you've got you and so the thing is about investing in education is that sometimes the lessons you learn aren't the lessons you expect to learn but you learn them nonetheless and so sometimes you go into an education thing and you don't get what you thought but you still
(22:29) get something and it was still more than what you paid and so when I went into those rooms I'd already used up all my money to get in the room so I was like okay what else do I have and so at the time I knew how to sell and so I just went to every single person in the room and was like can I help you sell stuff and so they'd be like well sure my sales team sucks or sure my my script sucks or sure my offer sucks or I don't know how to overcome these objections and so I would spend an hour two hours three hours on the phone with these people
(22:54) training their teams writing scripts and they were like dude thanks so much this is wait I can't can't believe you did all this and the thing is is that if you're going to pay for help from someone pay in full don't half ass a free gift and so if you're good at something you're good at a skill you're an accountant you don't do one page of someone's taxes if you're going to do a favor you do the whole thing you treat them like they're a paying customer and then they will respond as though you have paid them and
(23:24) so it will be like you've given them money and then you will get that reciprocity and at the time when I did those favors all those people I didn't know what I was going to ask for I just knew that I would need someone's help in the room and I'd rather have more phone numbers I could call for help that owed me one than none and when I wanted to make a webinar I called one of the people who's good at webinars when I wanted to run ads I called the guy who's really good at running ads when I wanted to uh figure out funnels and landing
(23:48) pages stuff I called the guy who was really good at funnels and landing pages CU each of those guys wasn't good at what I was good at and so we are able to barter which by the way still to this day is the most efficient form of trade because Uncle Sam don't take any piece of it for us or them everybody wins 11 there's two types of things that you can learn and so if you're trying to pay down ignorance you got to know what you're buying so you can learn about something something that exists that you didn't know existed and then you can learn how to do something and so one is
(24:20) called declarative knowledge knowledge of existence the other is called procedural knowledge which is knowing how to do it and so if I explain to you that private Equity exists and this is how you can buy package and sell a business for a lot of money now you know about it which is a prerequisite for learning how to do it and so when you buy into access to networks to people to relationships the primary thing that you're learning is learning about things that exist they're going to tell you Tax Strategies investment strategy marketing strategy sales strategies business
(24:50) models that you haven't heard of that is what you learn there but if they tell you those things you leave and you get excited but then you're like well shoot how do I do it which is the second thing that you learn how to do which is the how part and so when you're going into any kind of investment whether you're investing time you're investing trade you're doing some work for someone so they do work for you back or you're investing money you better be sure what you're buying and the interesting thing about those two types of knowledge is that the declarative knowledge tends to
(25:18) teach you things that you didn't know existed it's the unknown unknowns that is why some of these are the biggest breakthroughs when you get into those rooms with someone making 10 or 100 times more than you they see the world in a different way whereas when you go for how to it's more predictable what you're going to get because you're specifically trying to learn how the skills you know it exists and you just need to clarify the steps to getting there and so just delineating what you're trying to learn will help you actually learn it so the first time I learned declarative knowledge was that
(25:47) Facebook ads existed that was in 2013 and so I learned how they how they worked and I learned just enough to make them work so I learned declarative knowledge that they existed and I learned how to do them in one weekend super valuable now I was able to ride that skill set for a couple years until I was like you know what I need to learn how to do this at a bigger scale I wanted to go National with started gym launch do the turnarounds and so I was like I need somebody because I had only run local ads which by the way are much
(26:12) easier than National style ads and so I tried to go all around asking people for help and at this point i' probably used up the relational Capital that I had before so I called a bunch of agencies all of them said they were going to charge me too much money that I could afford and then finally I just asked one guy hey instead of your monthly rate of $5,000 a month which I couldn't even come close to affording at the time I was like can I just pay you per hour now of course he said I don't trade my time
(26:36) for money except of course he works over time and then he gets money later but sure anyways he doesn't trade time for money when I said it's America everything's got a price and he said you know what 750 an hour I'll do it and I was like done now mind you 750 an hour was still a ton of money for me and so I showed up like it was Harvard on steroids for these calls cuz I I would prep for the call I had my notes out I recorded it I was like I had two people in the room be like make sure I don't miss anything right and so I would go and I had him first document the process
(27:06) of what he did to run ads as though he were me then I had him demonstrate it so he clicked the buttons so I could see what he was doing and I had him stop and explain to me each of the steps so I could put it into my little checklist too and then finally I duplicated in front of him which means document demonstrate duplicate I then did in front of him to make sure that I was doing it right and so once I did it right and I did it right multiple times in a row and I didn't need him to to to correct me while I was doing it that's when I had mastered the skill it took me eight sessions so it took me 8 hours and
(27:37) whatever that is times 7:50 in order to learn 12 a watch isn't going to replace work a Rolex isn't going to replace reality and so what happens a lot of times when you're coming up is that you want to get status right you feel downtrod and feel like no one respects you and that's normal as a young man that's what you do you don't have any status that's what you come into the world as and you got to go make it and so the thing that you want to do early on is get status as fast as possible the thing is a lot of times you trade shortterm status at the expense of
(28:08) longterm and so as somebody who has lots of young men in my audience and middle-aged men in my audience you'll never impress someone who's wealthier than you with assets you'll only impress people below you so you have the wrong target audience because to impress poor people you outspend them to impress rich people you outwork them and once I understood this I was like oh the guys who are at the top of the game give me respect because they know I'm a future one of them because they know when they were my age they doubled down on the hustle not the Highlight Reel and that overspending on status happens at every
(28:45) level so in the beginning it's a watch right and a little bit later it might be a car payment and a little bit later it might be a really big expensive car payment and then it might be a really big condo and then it might be a really nice house and then it might become a yacht and then becomes a jet and the thing is is that you add zeros to it but again you only impress the people underneath of you not the people above you and if you want to impress the people underneath of You by all means do it but know that that's what you're about by time like a rich person buy
(29:16) stuff like a poor person and so when you're thinking about time being the most valuable thing if you've already dedicated yourself to working and earning an income and learning the skills then you just want to pour as much time into that as you can and so fundamentally you're buying your time back your lowc cost time or low income time so it's prepping food going grocery shopping cleaning your house whatever else you do with more income earning time I remember the first time I closed a $500 sale at my gym I realized that that sale took me 30
(29:51) minutes and I knew that for me to buy groceries for the whole month four times would take me $500 and far more than 30 minutes and so I thought to myself my God if all of that time I was grocery shopping and and food prepping and and and and cleaning up after myself and then doing laundry if all of that time I could just sell more in a couple hours I could do all of that stuff for free and my poor mind was like Hey That's wasteful you could be doing that stuff on your own but you buy time like you're
(30:21) rich you spend money on stuff like you're poor so buy time not stuff because when you buy time you can replace the money you bought it with and some let me put some real numbers to this so the average American spends $1,500 a month on 96 hours of work and that breaks down roughly to cleaning their house cleaning their clothes buying food preparing food and cleaning food I'm not even to get into the 4 hours a day that the average person spends on social media and watching television you're going to keep doing that so I'm not even going to try convince you not to but if you just replace those things that you probably
(31:01) don't want to do it cost about $1,500 per month and so as long as you make more than $15 per hour because it cost about 96 hours to replace those activities which means if I can replace 96 hours of work for $1,500 and it's also 96 hours of draining work like it expends energy it's not like you just sit there for 96 hours you're actually getting actively tired from doing that stuff if you took that same thing and if you make more than $15 per hour in your active job it makes sense it's The Logical decision for you to buy that and
(31:33) then go make more cuz you're also going to make money twice not only are you going to save the time and then work and make more but you also get better at your job because all of those extra hours aren't just making you more money you're also becoming more skilled so you get better faster and so if I have a year-long guy where he spends $1,500 a month to replace all of those things at the end of that year not only does he have more money at the end of the year but because he had extra 100 hours of high energy time that he didn't have to spend per month he's getting 50% better
(32:08) per year and so that assumes that he doesn't get rewarded in his work for getting better which by the way in reality you typically do as long as you ask who you compare yourself to not who you spend your most time with will be the highest predictor of how much you make and so we are motivated by the things that we lack and so if you are very hungry it's because you lack food if you lack sleep you're very tired you're very motivated to sleep and so if you want to be motivated to make money it's not enough to not have money you have to have a desire to make a lot more
(32:40) money and the strongest way to create that desire is to visually see the people who are making far more than you and so it's about who you compare yourself to not who you spend time with fundamentally the richest man in the world only spends time with people poorer than him but he continues to get richer because he's comparing himself to the the future version of himself that's his reference point that's his reference grip and when you start out there's real people as you evolve it becomes imaginary I heard this quote from one person to another when I was walking
(33:09) through the street and it was talking about buying something that was a no a no return investment let's call it a big toy and he said there will always be time to make money later and I remember hearing that and thinking that's what someone who's poor says and so to be clear I think if you want to enjoy life by all means do it this video is about making more money that's the stated objective and so that's what I'm talking about and so the idea that you're going to spend now work later is the fundamental Crux of poverty and so you have to break that with all your heart and when you have
(33:52) those people around you and this was a toy but it could be let's go out we it always comes under the guise of YOLO we have to live life but everyone who says that assumes that getting better and learning is not life and is not living and for me the purpose of my life is to learn as much as I can and pay down ignorance as much as I possibly can and squeeze the last drop of potential out of me that I can and the way that I do that is through learning and so for every person that asks you to sacrifice working now so that you can have fun now just make sure
(34:28) you know the trade you're making I'll be real with you there's no perfect way to live your 20s or even your 30s you either end up an under skilled 30-year-old or 40-year-old or an underlied 30-year-old or 40-year-old and so fundamentally it's not either or but knowing the trade-off and living with the consequences because you can't do them over and on a personal note I sacrificed or said differently invested my 20s in in order to have lots of skills and underlied but in that same time period I built to where I am now and I genuinely am very happy with where I am now in
(35:11) life and I would not redo those years to have quote lived more because the real secret is as I was doing it I loved the game and so some of the best moments of my life when I look back were some of the moments that I felt like I was struggling the most because it was when I underwent the most growth and so it's interesting because the pain that you go through in the moment often becomes the purpose that you look back on in your life and so the idea that we want to avoid pain so that we can live today I
(35:37) think conflates reality because when you look back on your life a lot of times those are the things that define you and so we should be seeking those out not running away from them so if you're not sure who you compare yourself to versus who you spend time with when you're about to make a big decision the people who come up in your mind who you're weighing their opinions on your decision those are your reference group people the people whose opinion you care about and so if all your friends for example
(36:03) are billionaires and they all sacrific their 20s got rid of their friends got rid of their material belonging spent all their time working for free so that they could learn this big skill set and then double down in their late 20s and then made it big by the time they were in their 30s and 40s those people if that was your reference group if you're thinking about leaving home what do you think that reference group is going to say for sure and because of that you're out the door and so whenever you have these moments where you are like I think I should do this but whoever that person
(36:32) is whoever that voice is if they don't have what you want don't listen to what they say only listen to other people's opinions about your life if their dreams for you are bigger than yours if they're not disregard invest then spend the rest so the idea is that you invest first and then spend what's left over and so an interesting thing is that Switzerland has the highest per capita millionaires in the world without having the highest GDP or even GDP per capita and so how are they able to do that that means that they have different rules around money which is what this video is about and so
(37:06) if we adopt those rules we can get those outcomes which means these are just decisions that we get to make and the easiest way to do that is you take what you need off the top and then you spend the rest on what you want and so it comes down to saying that you need your future you need your future self to be bigger than your current self today and so you invest first and then you spend the rest and so the way that I like to think about this is 16 this is how we operationalize this which is automate investing and then create friction
(37:37) around spending and so you want to take the money off before you see it if your job for example has a way that they can automatically skim off your paycheck and put it into some sort of investment stuff do it if they don't have that have one of these apps that does segmentation or has multiple bank accounts that you can say this automatically goes here this automatically goes here and and I don't touch this and if you want to get real crazy the advanced version of this is that as you make more money you keep what you're living the spend the rest
(38:08) part instead of making it a percentage make it a fixed amount and then as you make more you're just investing more and more and more into the future now you're like well how do I invest in the future if I'm just starting out the future is you but you're making sure that when you're investing that money you know whether you're buying declarative knowledge or you're buying procedural knowledge you're learning about stuff that you need to learn or you're learning how to do it and the longer you do this the easier it gets for the
(38:34) record I have zero Lamborghinis zero Rolexes zero Jets while also being able to buy multiple of these every single month and so the idea is you start to become addicted to getting good and once you get that first little reward of seeing an investment that you made in yourself start paying off you see your income go up you start making more money you're like oh my God this game is awesome and so that flow of investment that comes to you is one of the best games that you want to win for yourself you want to just keep seeing keep making cash flow PRS keep making that investment account
(39:13) PR and hit records in that account and if you get addicted to that game if you can just do that from everything in this video you've already won and so you want to automate deposits and manualized withdrawals so everything that is automatic in terms like your rent you want to write it as a check if you or drop it off as cash if you have payments that you make like a car payment as much as you're like wait this is going to cost time the value that you get back for knowing exactly where you spend your money is going to make you more money
(39:45) than the one hour a month that you have to pay your bills that is a promise and so that may also mean if you make it difficult to buy well then maybe you delete some of the apps on your phone maybe you don't save your credit cards on the sites that you tend to spend money on you want to make it as hard as you can to spend money and make it as easy as possible to stack it number 17 it's easier to make a million dollar than it is to make $100,000 and let me explain if I told you to go down the block you would go at a certain speed if
(40:17) I said go as fast as you possibly can at some point you'd run and then you'd improve your form and you get better Footwear and then You' change your clothes but at some point you wouldn't be able to run any harder or any faster to get there but if I said I need you to go five blocks you might be like huh okay now some people will then try to walk or run that but the Smart Cookie then says huh I could take a car and I would go a hell of a lot faster and if I'm speeding in my car I'll probably get to the fifth block before the other guy gets to the end of the first block and so the magic of thinking bigger is that
(40:55) you change your solution said meaning you use different tools to accomplish the objective the reason $100,000 per year is the hardest amount of money to make is because it assumes for most people that they will trade their time in terms of hourly wages or salary and traditional work in order to get it and so they have to spend all of their time in order to make $100,000 but if I said make a million or even 10 million before the world explodes you would know that you would have to use a different way of solving
(41:25) that problem and so the reason it's easy I to make a million doll or $10 million is because you can do it in less time with more skill if you start solving for the skills required to make a million or $10 million you don't want to love money you want to learn to love making money so there's two misconceptions and then one truth around this the first misconception is money is the root of all evil and then that obviously is a quote from the Bible 1 Timothy 6:10 the 2011 version someone says no it's not money that's the root of all evil it's the love of money that's the root of all
(42:04) evil but that's just the 2011 version the actual translation there's five translations for it and four of the five are the love of money is the root of all kinds of evil meaning if you desire money more than anything else then you will commit the other sins in order to attain it and so the idea is that it's only a pathway that has a high likelihood of causing you to do things that are unethical or immoral and so there's this huge terrible Paradigm in society that money is somehow good or bad it is just potential energy it's just bottled time
(42:47) and that bottled time can build bombs that bottled time can build hospitals it can build Wells and can build schools it can make YouTube videos that educate and so the idea that you're afraid to make money means that you're afraid of having power and maybe you should be afraid of having power because maybe you'd misuse it but if you do want to help the world then all it's going to do is amplify your ability to do that and if you have that mission on your heart or in your mind then it's your duty to remove
(43:20) everything else in your [ __ ] way to go get it the more money you make other people the more money you make and so the amount of money that you will be able to make in your career comes down to three variables number one is the value that you're able to create in total for all of the people you create it for times your ability to negotiate how much of that value you're able to get times number three which is the amount of other people who can also create that value and you have to have all three because for example if you develop a skill of sales and you can
(43:55) create millions of dollars in value for a company and you're really good at negotiating then in theory you'd get millions and millions of dollars from that company but if somebody else is willing to work for a few $1,000 a year in order to make that value then your position disappears and so that gives us the blueprint for making money is that not only do you want to be able to create that value you want to be able to create a value in a way that no one else can and the way that you do that is not by in my opinion learning some
(44:27) incredibly secret unique skill what makes skills unique is the skill set it's the stack of skills together that create the uniqueness if someone else has to try and recreate something I could do they would have to have lived my life and so your life and the time you spend becomes your competitive Advantage it becomes your asset it becomes the moat that other people can't chip into they'd have to go through being a competitive Fitness person and then go through owning lots of gyms and then go through doing turnarounds across the country and then go through doing a licensing business and then go through
(45:04) making a supplement business and then go through launching a meal prep business and then also starting a software company and then going through an exit for both and then starting a private they'd have to do so much stuff there are so many skills that are required your time is your weapon if you invest it wisely and the one thing that I would leave you with is that money loves speed wealth loves time poverty loves indecision if this stuff was valuable for you and hopefully it helps you avoid losing all your money twice like I did uh I have a video on Leverage and wealth
(45:39) creation that you can check out it's I think the number one video on this channel and it's one of the fastest ways to compound wealth if you poor and you're just getting started or just want to start in a business I have brutally honest advice to my younger self that a lot of people seem to have really found value in

It's Actually Pretty Easy to Get Ahead of 99% of People - YouTube
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFxT3G5jwtU

Transcript:
(00:00) it's actually pretty easy to beat 99% of people because most people do the wrong stuff and for me personally I have a portfol of companies at acquisition. comom that does over $250 million per year and I make these videos because I am really just shouting at my younger self of all the mistakes that I was making by working a lot on things that didn't move my business the vast majority of growth isms for the most part are wrong because if they were right people would do them and then grow but most of growth is counter intuitive
(00:31) so I want you to imagine your business as a tree okay so let's say you've got this tree and it's planted in the ground and you're like where's the top of the tree don't worry we'll get there and the height of the tree over time let's just imagine is your Revenue okay so as the tree gets taller your Revenue goes up okay now the problem is let's say that you have these little offshoots right that's these little these little these little these little growth hey the these are B+ problems hey we should add this thing to our email sequence hey we
(00:58) should do this thing for our fall what happens is the resources from the tree from you from the ground that are going into this thing are getting shot out to the side and so you are growing you feel like you're solving problems but you're still here at the same Revenue as you were last year but once you cut these things off then all of the resources go right into the trunk and they just keep growing and then your business continues to stay focused on the one thing that is going to move the tree up the most so
(01:34) it's not about the amount of tasks that you finish it's the amount of growth each task gets you and this is why even biblically they talk about the way to keep a tree healthy is to prune it and pruning literally means you're cutting things off commitment is the elimination of Alternatives which means commitment is literally the recipe for growth is that you focus all resources on on the one growth path that you get the most for right now you have a big list of things that you think you should do and what often happens is that you will do
(02:10) number five number three maybe number two because those are the ones that you're like oh I can knock that out pretty quick oh I can knock that out pretty quick but what ends up happening is you get to the end of the day and you still have that number one thing that's sitting there on your list and that number one thing you probably know is the most important thing that if you only did that one thing it would make the rest of the things on that list irrelevant by comparison but what ends up happening is that we do
(02:32) the B+ problems all day because it makes us feel good because we know how to solve them the A+ problem is usually one that's a little bit hairier it has more variables it's more complex we have to get into systems we have to do more analysis and then we have to iterate to figure out how to solve it and so because of that we prefer the fast the fast dopamine or whatever you want to call it of solving the quick problem rather than solving the most important problem so fundamentally most people want to do a good job I have found this
(03:02) from the people who work at my companies is that they want to do a good job and so what they're afraid of is that if they have this problem that's underneath of their purview that you are going to yell at them and say oh my God ah look at these fires right but the thing is is that if you just say dude there's this massive fire right here that's burning and by far will burn everything to a crisp far more than these itty B fires will that means that it's okay that these burn and so when I do a prioritization meeting especially
(03:36) if it's a big turnaround thing or we got to turn an apartment around something like that like this is the most important thing in the business I set the agenda up front and I say hey as of this point nothing that has happened before today anyone is accountable for I will blame no one for anything and so if I ask you in the future of this conversation who made this or what made this happen I am not asking to blame you I'm asking so that I can understand the problem better so that we can solve it together and by saying it's like as of
(04:04) this moment there's Amnesia from the past no one here will be responsible and so by doing that the pressure in the room they're like okay we're on the same team and going forward if you get and like I think you have to be specific with this it's like John if you get complaints from CS about this stuff your turnarounds being slow that's okay you can tell them I said it's fine hey Sarah in legal if you're having this issue and people are like hey we got to get these contracts signed tell them I said it's fine and remember I pay everybody's
(04:37) paychecks and so at the end of the day I'm the one who's got to sign it and I'm telling you it's okay as hard as it is for you because you guys all want to do a good job to let these fires burn we have to flex we have to focus on this one otherwise this one's going to burn us to a crisp I was on a call with one of my portfolio teams and it was a paid ads team and they were having issues with pixel tracking and this issue had been going on for three weeks and it was because everyone was distracted everyone was looking at all these different
(05:02) funnels and pages and followup sequences and fundamentally if the pixel is not bringing in the right traffic none of the conversion re optimization ever will matter ever again if the pixel gets worse and worse and worse because we're seasoning it with worse data and if you're like what the hell is Alex talking about it don't worry it's just payad stuff but fundamentally if you're on a payad steam and you know what I'm talking about if that is wrong Nothing Else Matters and so the the difficulty and this is what's tough is that you
(05:30) have to look at all the other problems and be like oh yeah all this stuff sucks we're going to ignore that because if we don't fix this none of that matters and even as I was going up and pulling up some of the pages I was like God this is ugly and I told her I was like this is so ugly we should fix this but we're not going to today because today we're going to fix this problem we're going to fix the pixel that's it and once we fix the pixel in all of these seven funnels once it's fixed then we can go on to the next
(05:59) thing but the next thing because if you reassess you might find out that once you fix the pixel issue some of your conversion rate issues might go away because maybe you're getting the right traffic in there which is why you have to always reassess after doing the solution rather than trying to force Fe like I think these are the top 10 would you put eight above seven who cares you're not even going to work on it you're just going to work on the one and then get that done and then you will see with this new reality in this new
(06:24) context which of these now will move the needle the most and so Frank slutman who as a three-time IPO uh entrepreneur talks about this in his management book where he basically focuses every company on only one thing and so he says some companies have five objectives some companies have three objectives his companies are only allowed to have one because once you do that one thing and this is something that I have found from my experience is that let's say you had that list of five things to do you have those five quote priorities if you do
(06:53) the one that matters the most what you will often find is that number two through five sometimes one become irrelevant other times something over here actually all of a sudden becomes the next most important thing which means that if you had done number three number five number two on your list and then done number one then you figuratively would have wasted all of the time doing 2 three and five Because by the time you did number one it actually made those Solutions IR relevant everything that I'm talking about right now is based on a concept
(07:25) that we call the theory of constraints which is that you have one thing in your business that that is limiting your growth it is the constraint of your growth and once you deconstruyendo million a year so it's a decent sized room um 25% over 5 million 50% over 1 million and so it's for legit business owners we talk about this type of stuff that really moves the needle for businesses in a big way fundamentally the goal of strategy which is the big fancy word that people use is to prioritize limited resources against
(08:17) unlimited opportunities there are unlimited things that you could do to grow your business you could run Tik Tok ads you could run LinkedIn ads you could run LinkedIn outbound you could optimize your site you could improve your sales conversions there's a million things that you could do to grow your business but there is one thing that can grow your business more than the others and that one thing would pale or make everything else pale in comparison and so when people are considered excellent strategists translate that into their
(08:46) excellent at prioritizing but the real best strategists see all of the moves and probably some moves you don't see that maybe the number one thing on your list gets you a 2X but there's another move that has a number one that's a 10x and and so fundamentally you have to prioritize against all things you could do known and unknown and the people who move the fastest in terms of distance covered are the ones who get the most for every unit of effort which is not about how fast they do things but at how much speed they cover with the things
(09:15) they choose to do and so let me give you a different analogy that you can think of with so a lot of people have a little wheel on their car and they're thinking how do I make this thing spin faster right they've got this little wheel and they're like I just got to go around and around and around and around right but what they don't think about is that you could have a wheel that's this big and if you just do one revolution you get more than this one does in 10 and so we want to just think what is that one big wheel that if I just roll
(09:49) it once it makes all of the wheel spins that I have on this tiny wheel irrelevant so let's imagine you have your to-do list right you've got your one you've got your two you've got your three that's a three there you go you got your four you got your five the thing is is that most of the times these are B and C Level problems because you know how to solve them yay but this one is the A+ problem that you have no idea how to solve and so we spend all day every day just crossing these things off and then we are happy at the end of the
(10:24) day but then we're sad at the end of the month because we still haven't solved the one big problem and so you have to be comfortable with the idea that you might not solve it for one day or two days or 3 days or four days but if you do solve it on the fifth day you get the A+ solution that gives you it takes your wheel from a wheel that's this big to a wheel that's this big and from that point going forward when you're rolling you're getting that much more for every Revolution and so I want to make this super Tactical for you
(11:00) once you've identified what the priority is what the one thing that matters most is then typically humans us and your team will likely not want to do it it's very much in our human nature to just continue to work less and less because it's easier and so these are some tactics that I have done to pull the future forward so number one if you change the meetings from end of week to end of day or twice a day you will communicate how much more important it is you to get those things done so so if you have a weekly Cadence for something
(11:31) that is the priority for the business then you should be meeting far more than once a week probably more than once a day number two once you've determined that that is the priority and you have a Cadence and deadline Associated that because you're getting feedback loops that are installed much faster then you want to eliminate everything that's not that now they might sound obvious in retrospect but it it isn't in reality especially if you have a team and so the way that we eliminate is by saying everything that you are currently
(12:01) working on is not as important as this thing which means you need to let some of these fires burn once you have set that deadline and you've eliminated everything else then we increase the frequency of communication so obviously the meetings set little mini deadlines because you want to get things done by then but in between communication also needs to ramp up so if you check in on someone after an hour after meeting and say hey where are you at that that communicates a very different idea of the urgency around the priority or the
(12:32) problem that you're trying to solve now once you have that communication Loop in there what you want to also do or that I have found effective is to make winning obvious Clear and Present publicly so that means that if you have a dashboard if you have a progress marker a thermometer something to show anytime someone sees it the progress that is being made it acts as a reinforcement Loop for the entire team to get things done and if you want to go real advanced mode put a pot of gold at the end of the rainbow saying once we fix the
(13:07) conversion rate on our page then we will all get this thing together and it could be we all go out to dinner it could be hey everybody gets the rest of the day off whatever day we finish it like you can make the pot of gold whatever you want but it also shows what's in it for them so it's easier to say committed than to stay committed which is the only thing that matters now as the boss for first in the beginning you're boss of you but over time if you develop a team you become boss of other people and so what I have found is that you can't just
(13:37) increase the priority you need to also increase the commitment and so commitment I Define it as the elimination of Alternatives and so let me give you a simple example marriage the ultimate commitment relationship wise means that you eliminate every other person from your life literally who's not your wife or your husband that you will ever date again so you say you were the only person I eliminate all others and that is a commitment if you're in health if you want to commit fully to something then it means you
(14:09) have to eliminate everything else that is not that thing so that's where you throw away all the food in your kitchen that's not aligned with your goal you pour out all the alcohol you eliminate the alternative so that the only thing left is to do the thing that you committed to and within the context of business you have to eliminate everything that is not the priority and the thing is is that it's very easy to say you're committed and I've noticed with my teammates a lot of them are like I'm committed but it's very hard to show
(14:36) that you're committed so if you want to teach this process to your team this is how I think about it number one is you prioritize you say there's lots of things we could do but if we just did this one thing this would be the most important the second thing that I do is I create urgency so I say this is very important this is when we're going to be meeting about it we have to get it done by this time but you can't do that without all also eliminating everything else that they have on their plates it's not fair to
(15:04) say hey we're now just going to make this incredibly important thing that's due tomorrow but you also still have to do your normal work it doesn't work they're just like it's not going to work especially on a continuous basis and if you do one two and three then what's going to happen is that you will solve it and you will solve it significantly faster than you thought because everyone will be focused on solving it and everyone will get out of the way to make sure that it gets done and then you look at your list and you
(15:30) reassess and then you rep prioritize you set the new urgency you eliminate everything else and you keep going and the difference between a bad strategist and a good strategist just comes down to the thing that they choose to believe is the most important so this is how I applied this four-step process to the paid ads team that I was talking about earlier so first off I said okay here are all the things that are wrong with our marketing and then I said and we're going to ignore all of them except for the pixel issue then I said okay we're
(15:59) going to meet end of day today because this was first thing in the morning and people were like well I have a I have a meeting right now and I was like oh yeah is it with me they're like oh no and I they're like well should I I was like yeah don't be on the meeting and I was like and if someone gives you a problem tell them they can talk to me then I said that also means that whatever you're regularly doing for the day it's not that it's now this and then we went through every single line item of what had to happen for the pixel to
(16:29) get fixed and we assigned every single line item to each person and I said how long do you think this will take how long do you think this will take how long do you think this will take and by the way I'm asking I'm not asking for days here I'm asking for minutes and hours all right and by the time we're done it's like great so it looks like we can get all this stuff done in the next six hours so we're going to meet again at 4:30 today so that all of you guys can show off your work and I can tell you how great of a job you did then at
(16:53) the end of this I said okay now every single person tell me back what you're going to do next now and so here's what's interesting people came back and they said something and it wasn't what I said so I said let me say it again you're going to do this you're going to do this and this is going to reroute here say it back to me and they said it it's like right write it down and then I go back to the person ask him again once everyone gets it right great we're going to meet in a few hours I'll see you then at the time of me making this video
(17:21) right now I'm between the calls all right which is why I'm so fired up so once we get on the call once the pixel's fixed guess we're going to do we're going to look at the next thing on that big old list and say all right we had 20 other things we need to do but tomorrow we're going to work on this one and we're going to solve that and the thing is is that so many businesses what they have and there's this great analogy for this is that they have this graveyard of half built Bridges they never get to the other side of the river because they
(17:54) never finished the bridge and so the thing is is that the company is spending resource ources building all of these Bridges putting These Bricks here but they never get one of these dollars across to the other side into their bank account and so this is honestly where most businesses lose all their money is building these half built Bridges because no one focuses on completing their work so we had a portfolio company that had a show up rate issue and so they had uh call it a sales event that they ran regularly in order to turn
(18:27) prospects into customers and so we noticed that they were getting a very low percentage of their prospects to show up now they were complaining about lead quality things like that and so we said okay if we only got the industry standard Benchmark of leads to show up to this event we would increase the revenue of this business by 35% and given the margin of this business let's say is 10% we would more than triple the profit of this business is there anything else we could do with the resources we have that would give
(18:59) that kind of a return a tripling of profit for no risk in the next 30 days and since the answer was no then we said great everyone in this company the only priority that you have is to get this number to go up and so then we did a number of things to make that one percentage go up and as a result of that Focus the business did grow by more than 35% because every single person in the company was aligned with it and guess what also happened other things fell by the wayside other things that were not as important started to burn we had
(19:36) little customer service issues we had little issues in the sales department these were all little things that normally would have taken away from the team's focus on that one thing but because prioritization is so powerful if you get the one thing right it makes the rest of it irrelevant the thing about doing easy problems is that they're so tempting because we all want to have that quick win we want to have one or two wins hey I want to get my momentum going but what ends up happening is that you you eat half your day and then you
(20:06) get a couple calls a couple interruptions and then the day is gone and then the next day you still have that number one that's sitting at the top but you filled up with two or three more easy wins and you never get the big wins to happen that continuous parade of little wins never moves the ball forward you never get the breakthroughs you never get the growth a big part of why those A+ problems are the big hairy problems is because they are soaked in the unknown we don't know how to solve them and so I want to give you this
(20:40) Frame of understanding that I have which is when you have these other things underneath two through five on that list you typically know what you need to start doing how it's going to go and what it's going to look like at the end the number one problem you typically don't know where to start and you don't know what to do and you don't know how it's going to end but you know that if big picture if you solve that one thing everything else would be irrelevant and so part of beginning to solve that problem is learning to understand the
(21:09) problem itself and so you can't feel like you're not making progress when you're trying to understand it and wrap your arms around it and so there's an old saying with how do you eat an elephant you eat it one bite at a time and so you just have to start pulling the thread which is how that's my term it's like I just start pulling the thread and see what comes and then as I pull the red my next pool becomes more and more obvious to me but you don't know what the next pool is you don't know what the next step looks like until
(21:36) you take the first step and the reason we don't is because it's unknown long term you want to make sure the team understands what the priority is and that's what you're doing as the boss but if you want to have faster communication cycles and more people immediately aligned with the priority of the business then what you and this is something that LE I've worked a lot on is increasing information transparency across the company that's a lot of big words but basically just means that you want everyone to know the same stuff
(22:02) because if everyone knows the same stuff the financials the conversion rates how we make money the profit margins then everyone else has the same information now that might freak you out as an entrepreneur but I remember when I was listening to Sam Walton's autobiography he talked about one of the big fears that he had was like showing all the financials but guess what the biggest companies in the world are publicly traded and every single employee can see every single thing you could possibly imagine about the company and yet they
(22:29) still function and so it is 100% a an irrational fear that entrepreneurs keep by thinking that no one should know and so I have over time continued to loosen up my my my you know White Knuckle grip on information because the more people who know everything the more people can help me solve the problems if you were to come tomorrow and say guys this is the priority like we're got to do this a lot of people will get overwhelmed because they don't know because you also told them something last week and the week before was also a priority and
(23:02) they're not done doing that yet and so one of the practices that I'd like to do is to pull up their agenda and say show me everything you're working on right now okay because you'll find out that some things you ask them for two months ago that they might still be working on and even if they're not working on it's taking their attention because they know they're not working on they think they should be working on it you're like oh I totally forgot I even asked you to do that oh uh we solved that other problem
(23:26) already in that other department which makes this problem now relevant so sorry about that if you have more frequent Loops where you can look at that list and say oh no this is more important than this don't worry about that don't worry about that this one we can deal with next week table it this is what I want you to work on and this is how i' start you can give someone so much less anxiety around the work so much Clear Direction and it gives you the opportunity to give out adab boys the moment they do it and if this is going
(23:52) to help you make more money in your business here's two more videos like this that'll help you make even more

Transcript:
(00:00) i'm probably gonna piss a lot of people off in this video and that's not my intention but you come here for the uh unaltered you know raw truth uh and so that is what i'm going to try and provide you just fyi my name is oxford rosie i own acquisition.com we do about 85 million a year in revenue one of the biggest things that i talk about all the time on this channel in terms of how to grow is that there are three different components to growing your business right you have your skills as the entrepreneur you have your character
(00:25) traits as the entrepreneur and you have your beliefs and what happens is most people continue to add potential to their business but do not grow their business because they're not focused on the thing that is the constraint and that's kind of the fundamentals of the theory constraint is that a system will grow to its constraint and no further basically you grow until you are bottlenecked and then that bottleneck becomes the weak link in the chain so to speak and then you cannot grow past it and so people do all these other things
(00:46) which add potential they add strength to the other aspects of the chain they add they re-fortify other aspects of the bridge but not the weakest point and so they actually never make more money and they stay because they have not attacked the constraint and so last night i was at a dinner um with a couple of entrepreneurs young doing a couple million bucks a year and their constraint was so evident to me that i figured i would make a video about it because i think it will be helpful for you as well and so there's two things that i want to
(01:15) bring up uh and what's interesting is that as i you know when i talk to younger entrepreneurs i would say younger being with quotes less experienced whatever entrepreneurs their out points are clearer and what i mean by that is the red flags the things that are limiting them are clearer to me than say people who are further along right and so with this particular uh couple of entrepreneurs the limiter were two things they were both based on character traits and so i thought that you know a lot of times i'll talk about skills i
(01:41) talk about beliefs but i don't talk about character traits as much and i thought this would be a useful example for this a couple of the statements they said throughout the dinner really rubbed me the wrong way not personally but just in terms of me looking out for another entrepreneur they made i am statements which are in my opinion some of the most powerful statements that you speak over yourself about what you believe to be true right and so they said uh we are high anxiety people we uh have lots of anxiety
(02:10) and i i don't even like saying it like myself to make this video for you because of how much i i hate that type of statement the second thing uh i heard later on in the conversation they said something to the degree of um i'm an all or nothing type person like i either have to you know go full send mode when i go out or uh i can't drink uh or a different example of that same concept would be like i either have to you know train really hard and and you know take take all the supplements right in the in the meantime
(02:38) or i or i just sit on the couch and eat oreos right and when i heard both of these things and there were other traits that they brought up but these are the ones that i'm just remembering off the top of my mind i paused and i was like do you believe that that do you think that belief serves you they're like what do you mean i was like do you think that that belief serves you that you are all or nothing that you will have to go full send mode or you have to stay in they're like well hadn't really thought about it like that the thing is is that
(03:03) when we make these statements and the thing is maybe the further on in the game you go and this is why i think mentors and having people outside of you uh to speak into your life that you trust is very useful because they can hear you speak these limiting statements over yourself right um and i've told this story before in the past but i'll say it again i used to tell people that i was bad at math most people now would never can say that i was bad at math people would say i'm pretty good at math right and i thought i was bad at math
(03:28) until 26. think about that for a second like 12 26 i thought i was bad at math like is that crazy right and i say this because there are so many beliefs that we we speak over ourselves these traits that we claim to have we claim them right as though they are ours but they are not in order to grow your identity must be whatever is required to grow period that's it so if this season of your life requires you to be more assertive then you would say i have a tendency based on external circumstances to be more assertive in these types of
(03:57) conditions right and so the language has to change towards i have a tendency towards right or i have a proclivity for rather than i am which is definitive certain and end of case meaning nothing can be done about it and so if we can change the way we speak we will change the way we live because we change the way we think number one number two thing that came up so one was obviously all the i am statements the what i would say you know limiting character traits is they talk about their own traits but the traits are not
(04:25) things that serve them and so if you have traits that you speak of yourself you have to ask yourself does this serve me does this serve me is this going to help me accomplish the goals that i have and if it doesn't then stop saying it so here's the second thing they did that was kind of the red flag for me i'm partially making this because i'm sure they're going to watch it crutches are dangerous superstition is dangerous what i mean by that is that we have these things that we do on these routines that we set and the thing
(04:54) is is if we become dependent on the routine we actually become weaker as a result of it and so that is why i am always so sensitive to religious and i'm using quotes here i'm using it in the literal word of religious religious adherence to routines religious adherence to you know how i have to wait like whenever you use terms like i have to i must i should we should i need to these are all things that you're making statements about how the world must be when you have no control over it and so if i wanted to conquer somebody who is a competitor of
(05:28) mine i would hope i would pray that they have crutches and superstitions that i can exploit for example if you have to drink a bottle of alcohol every night to go to bed that is a crutch if you have to smoke a blunt every night to fall asleep that is a crutch if you have to take edibles every night to fall asleep that is a crutch if you have to take pills every need to go to sleep you had as a crutch and i told you at the very beginning of this video i know this is going to piss a lot of people off but believe it or not there were humans
(05:58) hundreds of years ago that had none of these things and they slept just fine hundreds of years ago there were humans who did not have coffee in the morning there were humans who did not have pharmaceutical drugs there were humans who did not have orange glasses there are humans who did not have these weird rituals that we try and convince ourselves uh we must do we have to do we need to do we cannot live without and all they end up doing is weakening us because the thing is is you have a level of maintenance right of how you look and
(06:28) feel whatever and so what happens is it's like when you start drinking coffee in the beginning you feel better and then over time you need to drink coffee just to feel normal and so then the benefit that coffee confers is gone and so if you really want to get benefits from things then you need to cycle the things that you do which means inherently you're not going to have a routine because the things that you're doing are constantly changing which give you the temporary flux or benefit that it will confer to you as a result of it
(06:53) being novel if you're going to do it but most people don't do it that way instead they become dependent on these superstitions about how they must go to bed every night how they must fall asleep and what they must take and what the hell they have to have their mornings or what or they create a punishment for themselves or i can't be productive or i can't think of straight or i'm i'm really really agitated all day right that's so weak it's so weak it makes you so non-resilient that i would hope to compete against you you
(07:23) know i mean i would hope that because i would just hope that something interrupts your magical routine and then [ __ ] you for the day right i've always had the belief that i'd like to be able to sleep on a cot somewhere and be just as effective in a cot with you know in a corner in a closet as somebody who has to have every single aspect of their life completely dialed in i see it as the difference between the rocky cut scene of him versus drago and rocky iv drago's got all these fancy science things that he has to do and all
(07:52) these supplements he's taking all the stuff and rocky's just doing his thing outdoors getting it done and so as entrepreneurs the two takeaways for this video for you number one be incredibly cognizant of the things that you speak of yourself when you make i am statements they are the strongest statements that you can make because they are deeply embedded beliefs about what you believe about yourself and so if you say i ha i am this way when you describe yourself when you meet someone new you meet a girl on a date
(08:21) and you're like i am i have a short fuse right i have a temper i am disorganized i am not good with time i am not good with money i hate even saying this [ __ ] right but just to give you the types of things that people say all the time that do not serve them does this belief serve me if it does not stop [ __ ] saying it period and say something else right or at the very least if you feel compelled to have to describe this thing then say i have a tendency or i struggle with behaviors that are this way rather than i am number one
(08:57) number two be incredibly weary of the superstitions and routines and religion that you adhere to that you claim is the source of your productivity creativity alertness mental well-being subject you know happiness whatever it is or the converse of that if you lack it the threats or the punishments that you speak over yourself if i am not i am agitated i have a short fuse i can't focus i'm not productive i don't have energy all of these things are just weaknesses that you literally build into yourself so stop that's all i've got for today guys so
(09:32) moseynation i make this channel uh because a lot of people are broke and i don't want you to be one of them and a lot of people speak limiting beliefs over themselves they claim traits that do not serve them and they make superstitions and crutch that make them weaker rather than stronger and if you want to survive in the world of business you want to build a huge enterprise you want to make the impact that you have you have to be able to know exactly who you are you have to speak beliefs that serve you and you have to be able to
(09:56) succeed independent of circumstance that you create you are source not reaction lots of love keeping awesome catch you guys soon bye

How to Sell Better than 99% Of People (4 HOUR ULTIMATE GUIDE) - YouTube

Transcript:
(00:00) this is all my best presentations and videos on sales you could call it my Ultimate Guide enjoy selling with logic to make lots of money and so this will either be the best presentation on sales you've ever heard the worst presentation on sales you've ever heard or somewhere in between that is a promise all right and so I thought it would make sense to start with this we have a high this is Charlie Monger who's probably like my number one hero in this season of My Life um we have a high moral responsibility to be rational and I think that getting
(00:34) someone to rationally decide is important because emotional buyers often times get excited they'll buy and then who's had somebody who calls him two days later it's like I don't know why anybody raise your hand just so you know you're not alone okay and what happens is it's just like dating I think Lea talked about it yesterday if you have a rational foundation for a relationship or a decision when the emotions fade the logic will continue and so it's good to to answer both sides of the decision-making process the short-term side is the emotion that gets you to
(01:04) decrease your astion threshold and take a step right but the logic is what makes it stick and actually makes a great customer all right and so for me and I think that the further along you get in business and the higher up you get in business the more you'll see people who tend to make more logical decisions more logic first decisions and fewer and fewer emotional decisions all right so what does being a rational sorry what does rational logical have to do with selling well you have logical buyers and you have emotional buyers in general
(01:33) right most people sit on this Continuum one way or the other and emotionally people want to believe you people want to buy you must help their logical brains justify to decision that they already want to make think about it that way they want to buy from you you have to help them all right so who here identifies actually I'll skip through this emotional logical you're probably in between anybody in between these two anyone all right then you'll love this so before we get started I thought I would give you a few beliefs about selling that have served me very well
(02:12) throughout the years number one people want to believe you they want to buy you must help their logical Brains Brains justify the decision two selling happens before you ask for the sale closing happens after so you're selling for a lot longer period of time but the moment you kind of like take your pants yourself and you're like this is what it is that's when you're closing right you have now solicited now you close three it's easier to handle obstacles than objections I'll get to what the difference between those are in a
(02:48) second that being said expect and plan for no it is not failure it is expected so stop being surprised it's one of the first things we talk new sales guys into is expect no that's not like that's a part of this if they already were going to say yes then you are not necessary no is the job right if they could make the decision on their own they would just send you the money right the reason they're struggling is because they can't and they need your help which is why sales is actually the first step in
(03:22) coaching and I see sales as power if you can have the ability to direct or influence others that is power and I feel like it should be made much cooler than I feel like it is five if you didn't get a gasp from a price tag you didn't go high enough this is another belief so for those of you who are afraid to raise your price if you're not getting gasps you're not going high enough straight up and when you do it that way you can always walk down and have a beautiful price anchor right when you say $100,000 first a grand feels like a rounding error it's true but when I say $10 first like I'm saying right
(03:59) now $10 and I say a thousand sounds way [ __ ] bigger doesn't it so you got to get the gasp and you got to train your guys if you have a team they have to be comfortable with the no and they have to be comfortable with the gasp they got to go for the gasp be like dude you should have heard the gasp on this one right there we go seven selling properly is the first step becoming a coach right your first impressions the expectations you set dictate the relationship how you sell the fact that you use logic in the sale will set you up for success and
(04:29) your client for success in the long run eight selling is helping prospects make decisions to help themselves like you are helping them help themselves that's where the power comes from you are not helping them you're helping them help them see the difference it's nuanced but it's real nine keep the prospect not the sale as the priority it's not about us the more you can vanish in the sale and and magnify them the better your selling conversations will go because it's not about us they don't care about you they
(05:01) only care about them and they will talk about themselves as long as they'll let them this is a really important one especially when you starts getting into closing seek to understand not to argue and the way that I train our sales teams around this is childlike curiosity so when someone says when someone objects to something it's like ha that's so weird I wouldn't have thought that tell me more about that right and you get to be able to maintain that childlike curiosity the same way they train fighters to not breathe too
(05:32) much during a fight through exposure the more more times you get into these uncomfortable high stakes closing scenarios the less weird and high stakes they become because they become what you do every day and the good thing is you get to have this conversation hundreds and thousands of times and they only get to have it once so you [ __ ] better be better at it than them closing is a dance not a fight it's seduction not rape I mean I'm being super serious about this the goal is not to beat them into
(06:06) submission the goal is to sell from your back foot it's like I'm good I want to help you help you and if that means not doing this then I [ __ ] love it I'm with you I'm on your team and I'll give you a bullet around that in a second selling is a transference of belief over a bridge of trust therefore there are two things that are required You Must Believe so that you can transfer it and you must have trust to make the transfer because if you truly believe and a lot of times you anyone been on a hot streak when they're selling anyone anyone who
(06:41) just had their hand up ever been on a cold streak most times you go from hot to cold not because you forgot how to sell because you stop believing in why you're selling you have the same skills as you did the day before but sometimes you get a text you get an email get a pain in the ass customer you ask for a refund whatever the hell it is right and then you question yourself and so that bridge might have been created but there was nothing to walk across it because your cup wasn't full and so that's why especially it's you in the beginning but your teams over time the process of
(07:11) filling conviction is one of the easiest and best ways to increase someone's closing percentage better than any of the training in the world if you get someone to believe they will sell the right way because they're doing it not to make the deal because they want to help the other person 16 you can only build trust if you genuinely want to help and humans are exceptionally good at sniffing out intention is a survival mechanism you have to know if someone's trying to double cross you we're very good at smelling it out and the reason a lot of you guys can't close is because you only care about closing belief and
(07:42) Trust are a Continuum not binaries so it's not you believe or don't believe it's not they trust you or don't trust you but how much do they trust you how much do you believe how deeply do you believe because anyone ever been around somebody who just believes balls to Bones something that you think's batshit crazy like I mean all the way so much so that you start to question what you believe that's what real conviction does 18 closers ask hard questions and it's because you genuinely care that's why you do it it's why we're here who here wants to impact thousands of lives and
(08:16) help people then you got to [ __ ] ask hard questions because it's the only thing that's going actually Pierce someone's hard and actually get the transformation to happen if you can't make if you cannot have transformational conversations you cannot coach and this is the first step the person who cares the most about the prospect wins the sale that includes them so if you care more about their well-being than they do you will win and if you are more convicted they will question their own excuses because you are so
(08:46) certain little TI Little Nugget for you record all your sales by the way because when you do get on that hot streak right when you get on that hot streak and then you get cold again watch your hot streak see where you pause what jokes you made when you asked for the sale when you didn't how you overcame it and it'll get you back in the flow much faster than trying to question yourself what do I do what do I do always record all your sales it's also the easiest way to train new people and then lastly 21 power is the ability to direct or
(09:17) influence people if you want to be powerful you must understand this skill and that's what we're going to talk about cool awesome when does selling happen does it happen when they're a lead does it happen when we're qualifying them does it happen when we solicit the sale does it happen when we close the sale when does the selling happen all the time the entire time selling is happening but what are we going to talk about today just this just closing everything you have to do after asking someone to buy why are we doing
(09:52) that rather than the entire process beyond the fact that we'd be here all day the other reason and I love this is that closing has one of the highest predictors of success in business and here's an analogy for it everyone familiar with the NFL yeah great so here's an insane statistic the top five Red Zone offenses in the league now last five years made the playoffs 90% of the time here's why this is interesting and crazy there's a million other stats they could have horrible defenses they could have terrible coaching they could have a terrible whatever it is right they could have all these things that are wrong with their they could have Terrible
(10:30) Special Teams whatever but just this one set if they're in the Red Zone they [ __ ] close and I can tell you if you have this ability if you have this skill it will make up for a tremendous amount of deficiencies in other areas of your life and business and it will buy you time to learn those but if you can't close it's very difficult to grow in business especially in the beginning because it's probably you that's why we're talking about closing why is this important from Money Getting perspective well first off if you have 100 people walking the door 10% are
(11:05) never going to buy just accept that right problem is you don't know which 10% it is but 10% are ever going to buy 10% are always going to buy you just got to not [ __ ] it up and most of you guys these are the only sales you're getting they're like well I already I'm already here my friend told me about you I have my credit card out and some of you like well you know let's make sure you're like just shut the [ __ ] just take the card you know what I mean like shut up right that's like hey my friend's so
(11:31) awesome you got to meet him and she's like oh my God he's great and then the guy starts talking and she's like oh just kidding you know like terrible right but this is what we fight for this is what we train and if you want to make a big impact that's what we're fighting for it's the middle 80 why this presentation will make you money if after this presentation you just have one more bullet one more play In Your Arsenal to close where I get you one more deal a month I'll feel like my job was done all right and hopefully if you just do that it'll pay for your
(12:02) entire weekend all right that's my goal for the presentation that everything that you guys have done for this whole weekend is paid for is that cool Fair outcome all right so this is one of my favorite sayings you're only one decision away from changing your life forever and whenever I feel overwhelmed or I feel like I'm decreasing like I feel powerless or I feel like I have less power than I want to have I always say this to myself because it's like I can take one decision and change [ __ ] everything you know what I mean like I can I can drink a bottle of Jack get the
(12:29) car I can change everything with one decision right I can make a step to to invest in something I can buy something I can invest in myself I can I can have a terrible conversation with Laya or I can have amazing conversation with Lea but just one decision and that's always given me power but the thing is is that instead of changing our lives we blame when I say blame I want you to think give power to sources outside of our control and this is what you and this is what your prospects and your customers are doing and this is why so many people are Weak and Powerless and so we're
(13:02) going to do a fun activity today because I want you to be involved so you can learn it and we're going to do this so that one you can help decisions to help yourself with whatever decisions you're facing two you can use these Frameworks to help prospects help themselves and then three become more powerful so but rather than keep this hypothetical I need you to visualize the decision that you need to make all right can you do that for me fantastic and this is why I want you to actually think through a decision together because this is a statement from confusious I hear and I
(13:30) forget I see and I remember I do and I understand so my goal here isn't for you to take screenshots of every picture of every slide that's not my point here because the thing is is when you do that and you kind of I mean this is why I do it I take pictures so that I don't have to remember it but I don't want you to remember it I want you to understand it if you understand it you won't have to go back to your notes because let's be real half the time you're not even going to open these notes up again you're here
(13:54) now with me try and understand if you do that it can change your life because what we're going to do is not going to be some scripts that you have to understand but the logic behind the arguments that people will give you as to why they are not choosing to become more powerful and if you can unlock that you people will feel more powerful talking to you and they will want to buy from you because of the feeling they have does that make sense and so that's when you're using logic to create an emotion so you here here's an easy one
(14:19) for it anyone here presented with the decision last 24 hours yes great fantastic so who thinks the a decision could change your life for the better great for the worse knows all right let's go so here's my goal I want to show you as though you were Prospect how to think through a decision and help others using these Frameworks right what you want what you don't want maximize the left minimize the right so here's what this is translated to if you decide to buy the offer you feel more certain about your decision if you decided not to buy the offer you feel [ __ ] certain about the decision and if you're undecided you make a [ __ ] decision
(14:52) all right and you feel good that it's the one that has the highest likelihood of you getting you close to where you want to go and this is what we have to walk through with with our prospects when you're looking at them you have to be like I don't want you to buy I want you to decide for you not for me I'll be the same either way right you're like I'm going to be ripped and in shape it's not going to change me right like that's not going to change but like it will change for you right so quick note on
(15:17) sales ethics and then we'll dive in helping someone make a decision to help themselves does not mean buy from you that's a reiteration you have to keep their goals at the center of the decision and you should be happy I mean this because if you can shift this truly if you can be happy when someone decides to own the power and not work with you then the pressure around sales disappears it evaporates there's no stake the stake is did I help them does that make sense and that means that you can win every sale because you change the metric you're measuring Yourself by that's the superpower like and that's
(15:48) where you do make the most sales because you don't care about the sale because you care about the person and the people pay the people who pay the most attention so what I call it paying attention they pay for it they pay for you to pay attention rather than talking about yourself right CU they don't care about you cuz they're thinking about 100 other things and this is why most importantly make high stakes decisions to help your prospects in order to best serve them okay so I told you earlier I was going to talk about the difference between obstacles and objections couple of you guys raised your hands about the
(16:18) differences I'm not going to ask I'll tell you what it is obstacle is a thing that blocks one's way or prevents or hinders progress when you disagree with them that is an obstacle this happens before you solicit the sale someone says some [ __ ] before you even get to the sale that's an obstacle a simple example I hear all the time hey why'd you hop on the call today hey why'd you walk in the gym today whatever it is right them I just wanted to find out a little bit more about the program first 10 seconds obstacle you're not here to find out
(16:50) more about the program I'm here cuz you're fat but they got to say it so you're like oh so you finding out like do you do this all the time do you go to lots of different programs it's find out information or is there a problem you're trying to solve they're like oh well you know I'm trying to lose weight like oh got it so you're not just hopping on 100 calls a day cuz I was like that would be a very weird existence right you just hop on for information all day ha great fantastic I've had this conversation
(17:14) before right so that's an obstacle right and the thing is it's easy to confront and Destroy obstacles before you ask for the sale once you've asked for the sale you switch to objections objections is when they disagree with you do so it's much easier to be on the other side disagreeing and helping them break their beliefs before the stake has been presented after after the after you're in the Red Zone it's all closing it's all objection overcomes right example that's like I don't want to buy right now and you're like totally understand
(17:45) what are the main criteria you're thinking through which is always funny because people are like I need to think about I've never had someone like leave because they need to think about it I'm like cool what are you thinking about and they're like oh I'm still here right like so learning how to talk through these high stakes decisions with yourself or others is the purpose of presentation and as a result you'll become more powerful okay so before I dive into these AR each of these arguments I have to make this one
(18:08) statement is that the person must really want the goal and believe three things one which you'll get to it there we go the product will get them the goal comma the way they want to get there and I learned that second half the hard way because we found out in gym launch that people would say no sometimes to buying memberships right or buying challenges or whatever but when we offered them the ability to come back the next day help them for free we'd sell them $400 of supplements and they just said no to a
(18:38) $100 down service thing I'm like what the [ __ ] it's because they want to lose weight but they want to lose weight their way and so that's when I started learning like oh not only do we have to make sure that they want the goal and they believe that the product's going to get them there it has to get them there the way they want to get there this gives you ammo for the questions that you're going to ask does this make sense okay the second thing is that you and others will support them like are you telling me the truth is this really what's going to happen will other people around me support this decision and the
(19:11) third is that it will work for them and not just everyone else sure I've seen the people who step on the stage but they're different than me I'm a snowflake I have metabolic thyroid keto osis right whatever I have zero influence oler whatever you know what I mean like I have no following is itis right whatever it is right whatever [ __ ] you tell yourself and what you have to do in this situation you have to Pride proof so that it'd be more unreasonable not to believe than to believe and this is a logical close this
(19:43) is not a this is not an emotional close this is when you look at someone and say how many people would you need to see for it to be more unreasonable for you not to believe than to believe at what point is it 10 is it 50 here's a thousand tell me when to stop okay okay okay great so that's not the real reason and then you can confront the real [ __ ] all right so otherwise if they're not sure of those things if they don't actually want to lose weight if you don't actually want to make money doing online fitness then it doesn't matter what Jason says you don't want to
(20:14) make money doing online fitness then you're not going to buy right if you do want to make money doing online fitness then you go down you go down the Train the train tracks that make sense okay again this is why you expect no at first because if people could make the decision they would have already made it all right out of the main course Richard feeman besides Charlie one of my favorite thinkers of all time he was like the second guy on uh the atom bomb sounds negative brilliant teacher he's known for this understand don't memorize learn principles not formulas and that's what the rest of this presentation is about is the principles behind
(20:45) overcoming these distortions that people have and so this is me asking you for your own sake don't take pictures of the slides it's because all the stuff's going to be in the recordings but you are here now so be here now so you can understand it okay so there are three sources this is a huge breakthrough for me so I'm going to share it with you this first time try share to life there are three sources that we cast our power to okay and it took me a very long time to get through this because I looked at
(21:11) Grant and he had his you know you got stall decision maker money then you talk to Barry who owns Sage she's like you got time fit uh money fear shame right those are hers and then Jordan Belford's got his and so everybody's got like these are the only overcomes right I was like there has to be an actual truth here like there has to be something that's true that's uned and so trying to figure this out I actually went back to Dr Albert Ellis anybody who know who he is no one great um who here knows what cognitive behavioral therapy is CBT he invented it
(21:47) smart dude and so what he noticed is that he originally had 11 distortions of reality then he dropped it to nine then to seven and then he came to three and the three stuck and the three are what I'm about to share with you and you're like why is he talking about this about sales because the objections that people offer you where they cast their power to are distortions of reality they are the things we use to upset ourselves these are the three circumstances and this is the irrational statement that people make I must get what I want when I want it I must not
(22:20) get what I don't want if I don't get what I want I can't stand it that's when people blame their emotional disturbances on emotional disturbances on circumstances two others other people must treat me fairly and kindly and if I if they don't they are no good and deserve to be condemned and punished it's like your animal brain right three self I must do well or else I am no good these are the three core distortions that upset people this is like mental illness right and so I'm not saying anyone has mental illness if they don't agree with you it's more so that these are distortions that are not real and if
(22:56) you can understand not memorize if you can understand this then you can have these high stakes conversations understanding exactly which Distortion they're suffering from and I'll show you how to overcome them okay and so I like to consider like the onion of blame people this is like one of the bigger breakthroughs I had they start with the outside they blame circumstances time money other [ __ ] and then the step next to that they start to blame other people my spouse my kids my employees and then finally they say like
(23:25) it's me it's my fault and so you might have to overcome multiple layers as you peel back and based on the objection they give you you can know where you're at you can know how close you are if someone just says I have to think about you're like great I'm talking to the person who's in power and the decision maker and I just need to get them to say yes if they're like I don't have they're casting the power away and some of you guys are probably casting your power away on decisions you need to make which is why I'm making this presentation even though that these are the things that distort people's realities CU you're
(23:55) like no one's ever said circumstances are getting in my way right like no says that right they manifest in five ways that I want to equip you to deal with all right for yourself and others so these are the five most common excuses scapegoats that people use for circum and if you find other ones these are the biggest buckets because I didn't want to have a hundred things here but the big three buckets are circumstances others and self right but they manifest with time in multiple ways and I'll show you how value price money Etc fit I'm a
(24:25) special snowflake others which is I don't have the authority to make the decision and then finally self which is what if I just don't make the decision let some let life make it for me right avoidance stall you go from surface level to core and as a side note you should never get stuck on the stuff near the top and ideally you really never get stuck anywhere on this equation if the person wants what you have and you truly believe in what you have to help them and I mean that like if you understand this thoroughly you can walk someone towards helping themselves okay okay
(24:59) this is what they look like or this is what they sound like in reality not a good not a good time right now I'm really busy right that's time can't afford it too expensive fit not sure if it's for me I hate broccoli I can't do a plan with broccoli right can't do a plan where I have to DM people every day it's against my brand I'm poor but it's against my brand right Authority have to talk to my partner spouse I have to talk to somebody who has more power than me it's funny because when you start thinking this way
(25:26) it sounds silly and then avoidance I need to think about it clearly let's think about it now all right and so I told you I want you to think about the principles Behind these things not memorize you've got circumstances you got other people and you have yourself and we drill down so quick test who here is physically in the room raise your wonderful arms are working we're rocking so here's my ask raise your hand if you or your prospects present with this Distortion so who here is a Time person I'm busy it's not a good time maybe in the future anyone deal with these
(26:02) sometimes it's yourself totally so I'm also going to tell you a secret about this I think the reason I got pretty decent at logical arguments is because I am inherently skeptical and I will paralyze myself from not doing anything unless I have really sound reasons to do it and I realized that I couldn't move forward to make any progress in my life until I had these Frameworks to think through these hard decisions through so I could start taking steps to where I where I wanted to go it took me years to
(26:27) get there and so so hopefully I can give you some keys that help me unlock my own head to get out of my own [ __ ] way so that you can too and help your clients all right so the way I think about time and there's a lot of overcomes for all of these things what I tried to do is Bunch the three biggest ones that I like to use most frequently and if I uh Veer from like the the bullets on the screen it's because I'm riffing with you and I'd rather just kind of stay in the flow is that cool okay fantastic so when
(26:54) you're overcoming this one each of these is kind of a specific angle that you're attacking it from so macro is like I'm this is a busy season for me got lots of stuff going on right micro is like I don't have any time in my day so you're one person is saying I've got lots of [ __ ] going on one person's like I can't find the time it's different sounds subtle but it's both about time but in different ways all right and then the the last one is well when when I have time I'll start right everyone know this [ __ ] horeshit but whatever okay so as
(27:25) always we never disagree with prospects because you're not in a fight totally get it totally understand do you think like do you want this to be something that lasts for the long term right it's a question you're like yeah do you think that you're going to be busy again in the future well yeah so you want this to last in the long run and you do think you're going to be busy again in the future well then don't you think it'd be best to start now when you are busy because if you learn how to do it when you're busy you'll be able to do it forever if you can only learn it during a perfect circumstance then
(27:54) you're going to fall off when it gets busy again and isn't that the time you'd want to have the most support goes for you guys too that's just number one we got so many lore right and so when you knock that out the goal is that the person says well [ __ ] that's not a good reason and you take one step towards the truth so when you're thinking about it's not like oh I've got to overcome this one thing and then they'll buy you got to keep peeling and if you have this framework you understand the direction you're going in and you can start listening for the oh they're talking about themselves now I've gotten two
(28:24) layers deeper right so that's seasonal micro you can't tell someone in a sale hey take out your phone take out your hours by week pull it up oh look 22 hours on social media this week you've got time so you say it differently you say you know what I had the same issue and I used to complain all the time about like how I didn't have time to to be successful and do things I needed to do and my wife got so sick and tired of me saying this she pulled my phone out and she was like look I guess I just found your time didn't I I was like ah [ __ ] and you can say it that way and then a prospect feels better does
(28:55) anybody here feel like they don't have time right and the first thing that any program is going to do if it's a good program is going to cut out the 90% of the [ __ ] that you are doing which is causing you to feel overwhelmed which is probably the real reason you feel like you don't have time Jeff basil got the same time you do right it's just what are the things that you're doing that he's not it's not about adding [ __ ] to your plate it's about removing the stuff that's not working because clearly everything
(29:19) you're doing that's filling your time is not making you more money so you're doing the wrong [ __ ] so there's going to be plenty of time because all the stuff you're doing now is not working right not simple but that's the reason right so we went mael when then hey in the future when I've got time I'll totally sign up for your program right anyone heard this one anyone say this one right and again you want to you want to empathize you don't say like Ah that's [ __ ] you say totally understand that's I was stuck like this for years if you can step in their shoes you're not attacking them you actually go from the inside out you step into
(29:56) their self and then you walk them through the Epiphany that you experienced and it doesn't feel judgmental it feels helpful that make sense I used to feel the same way right and I found this out actually from Jason Flatley and he was the one who told me this it's a it's a logical fallacy it's called the when then fallacy which is why that's how I remember it and the onein fallacy simply States when I have X then I will do y but it flips sequence so it's like when I get better I will go to the hospital sorry there's just so many like
(30:26) hilarious ones about like money and stuff like I start saving money once I'm rich like all right but the thing is is that we do this right we do this I'll pay for the program that'll make me more money when I have more money that's the point of the program I'll pay for the program that'll help me get a sixpack once I have a six-pack once I have more time which the program is going to help me have you know what I'm saying like it's just it doesn't make it's a fallacy and so what that means is it's a distortion it's not
(30:55) real and so the goal of having these high stakes conversations is simply showing people we're not attacking we're just walking them through it and be like do you realize that this is holding you back and I know this better than anyone because I'm a skeptical [ __ ] the reason I can do all these logical things is because I'm the first person I'd overcome right and you might be too so once we attack time from these three angles it depends which one they present with if they present with one and then move to the next you can knock all three out you'll probably find some that that make the most sense to you but the thing here is it's not about
(31:26) memorization you just got to get it macro you're always going to be busy once you want the most help when you are busy so that it can stick forever yes time my wife showed me my phone turns out I got [ __ ] time but the reality is it's not about what I am doing it's about the stuff I got to stop doing and that's what I'm going help you with right this isn't scripting this is just understanding it right and then when then it's a fallacy it's a distortion it's not real and then just use two crazy examples like once I have money
(31:53) then or I'll save money when I'm rich right it's just like ridiculous okay so what do we do one reason down and we're getting closer to the core right right so who here is somebody who's like I can't afford it it's too expensive or has heard this from a prospect I like I better see everybody's hand especially if you're selling High ticket which hopefully you get a gasp so these are the four Frameworks that I think through there's a million like money closes but these are the ones that I like the most and that that to me
(32:24) resonate the best right and so why a lot is good is kind of like my my my first one here and so the reason that if someone gasps or think that this is a lot of money you just ask them is this a lot of money to you and they're going to say yeah if they say no then you're like awesome buy it and if they say yes right and if they say yes then you're like that's the exact reason how you're going to be successful because there's other people who buy this thing and you know what they're not all in on it but the question is do you want to draw the line in the sand and go all in do you want to
(32:53) step over the line and be the person you want to be because I can tell you that this is not about what whether this works or not I've already proven that the question is whether you work or not and so if you put more on the line then you have a higher likelihood of being successful so you should be the last person to be worried about this I'm more excited because the best stories are always coming from people like you in your exact situation so don't let that be a reason not to do it that should be the reason to do it so the next one is
(33:17) like why is this not a lot so first is the fact that it's a lot for you is good it means you're going to try hard the second one is like well it's a lot in terms of absolute amount but relative amount very little right because if all this does is ADD $10,000 a month to your income is it worth it if all this does is get you into a bikini is it worth it yeah and so then what happens and the reason that this is a stepping process right is that we're we're just taking these objections out of the way so we
(33:47) can get the person to confront reality not a distortion they've created because the reality is the thing they're afraid of and so what happens is when they say yeah if it did that it would be worth it right the problem is they don't believe you right and so it's like great then it's not about the price it's about whether you believe me so you can sidestep it does that make sense we're taking a step closer and then obviously you can use a comparison you know depending on what you're selling if you can price anchor with like well here they don't have a four-year degree for
(34:16) doing online fitness that's why the alternative education industry exists and it's because the formal education has failed most of us right anybody graduate with here with a 4-year degree anyone immediately be able to use that for degree to get leads make sales no me neither right and what's crazy is that some of these degrees are 501 $200,000 and take four years when you've got something that can help you make make that entire amount of money in half the time right for a tenth of the price when you think about it like that frame it's actually a great deal does that make sense so you just frame it you have
(34:54) to give context all right so number one is the fact that it's a lot for you is good means you're actually going to try number two is if it does what we say it's it's going to do the value is there so that's not actually what you're opposed to which then we can take the next step all right number three is what's money good for anyways this is actually one of my favorite lines of reasoning for a variety of reasons and I'll get to it when you're looking at a prospect or looking at yourself you're going to spend this money either way over the next 12 months you're going to
(35:25) spend it right and in fact not only you're going to spend it you're going to buy the program the question is whether you're going to pay for it in money or pay for it in time and so like you can learn every single lesson that's in this program whether it's losing weight you know uh getting leads selling online whatever it is right you're going to learn these lessons but do you want it to take 12 weeks or 12 years and the question is are you going to be able to live a thousand lifetimes because of the thousand people that we've helped just like you and gathered all those lessons
(35:55) and put them together so you don't have to do the trial and error for that entire period of time so the question is not whether you're going to buy it or not it's just how do you want to pay and so for me this is a personal note and I I'll probably say it at the end but like the reason we've been don't move quickly through life is that I will buy other people's mistakes because it's just it's the only way you can buy time in this life is to buy the knowledge to take less time from other people who have taken their time and like if you think
(36:19) about human civilization in general Edis took however long to make a light bulb and then we just bought the lesson from him and now we have light bulbs right and the next guy figures out the next thing and then we just buy the lesson from him and that's how we have to move faster so you're going to spend the money either way question is 12 months from now is it going to be on [ __ ] that didn't get you anymore or stuff that is going to get you somewhere and no matter what you're buying you're buying the program just going to pay time or you're going to pay with
(36:42) money and if you're being real you've probably been paying for time the last six years how's that working for you do you want to do more of that this is also this is a this is a classic one it's very easy one to remember but like who here knows the difference between a self-made billionaire when they had nothing and where you're at right now if you have nothing zero they both you're both broke they were broke you're broke whatever it is if that's where you're at right now the only difference is that that proves that if they were successful
(37:13) it wasn't about the resources they had is about how resourceful they were so I'll tell you a quick story about this so anyone here read uh shoe dog right story of Nike so in the story he talks about how he was about to lose everything multiple times it's a crazy story and this time it was like it was it was going to go down like it wasn't going to happen and he needed a tremendous amount of money and he just didn't have it he' extended all his credit lines the banks wouldn't do it and the next lenders said they they canceled on him and the company was
(37:43) going to fold because it was growing too fast at that point he could have just given up and said there's nothing I can do I maxed out all my cards I maxed out all my Banks there's literally nothing I can do and his people had already worked for free they were like we can't do this anymore he went to his vendors and said you need need to pay my payroll for me he went to his vendors anybody use like landing page software anyone or anyone use something from a vendor right it's like going to that guy like going to your videographer and be like listen you got to pay payroll for me this uh this month
(38:12) because otherwise I'm not going to be able to keep doing business with you because I'll be out of business resourceful not resources and the reason this is so important is because when you have nothing it's the easiest excuse to give yourself is you're like well I have nothing that's why I can't it's like of course but every self made millionaire and every self-made millionaire was self-made and they started with nothing which puts them in the exact same seat you are so the question is do you want to have power or do you want to not have
(38:37) power you want to have power you're resourceful not resources right and so if we want to make these decisions that are going to help ourselves we need to step into that and so when you're talking to your prospects it's the same thing right does that make sense okay rocking I mean and you can drill deeper into this as like do you think there's anyone else who's been in your situ situation who's achieved this or maybe worse than your situation the answer is yes and if they can why can't you right so we're taking steps closer is are you
(39:06) guys digging this okay cool oh thanks thanks I wasn't sure if it was WRA attention or sheer boredom so we're not you feel you feel we're progress are making like the person presents this say I don't have time shit's busy blah blah and you're like nope Noe we're going to take one step Clos they like you know what but I I don't have the money or it's too expensive you're like well if you don't have the money you're going to be successful it's worth it right yes I understand why it's worth it well you don't need money to begin with right you
(39:40) got to be resourceful and you can find the money cuz I'll ask you this is a fun one for business owners who here has had an unexpected bill ever come up taxes right yeah and then all okay so everyone here is still alive who raised their hands who here was able to magically pull money out of their ass and figure out a way to do it raise your hand here's what's crazy you have the ability to be resourceful when it's for someone else and not for you it's because you choose to be powerful when someone else needs it but not for yourself [ __ ] up right so stop doing
(40:25) that if you function like you you have to make payroll tomorrow and like you you're back on rent you're going to get kicked out you think differently and if instead of paying your landlord you're paying you because that's what you want to do it shifts internally because everyone here just Prov the fact that you can be resourceful when you choose to be so just choose to be so number three is it's not not sure it's a fit for me so be besides the obvious ones which is like I don't want to work out broccoli
(40:55) sucks I I can't do a program where where I I can't do cardio whatever the [ __ ] right um like I said I don't want to do DMs I don't want to post on Instagram I don't want to have a Facebook group whatever right whatever the [ __ ] is all right I'm not sure if the vehicle is a fit for me so usually you can overcome the easy ones but if someone is just really sticking hard these are the three that I use to to shift perspective okay so this one is new identity new priorities so it's good to have cues for these things which is like we vote with our dollars about the things that we care about and if you show me what someone is spending their
(41:29) money and their time on I can tell you what their future is and I'll tell you an interesting story so um I had somebody who was just like you who was like you know what I don't want to do this either and I told her this story can I tell you it yes and this is what you'd say to the prospect right so I was with Lea and we went to Sephora which is a makeup store and and I show up like this um I feel welcomed and so we're we're standing there she's doing something and I usually stand in the corner like this
(41:59) um and I saw these two little girls it might have been like I don't know girl age so like 12 to 15 this like this this and they were like giggly and so excited and they had like the girl with the smok came over was like helping her out helping them out and she was like okay this is like eyeliner and this is lipstick and this is whatever blush um I'm just like using words I've heard uh this is how you paint your face and the thing is the girls were like so excited and then they were like right before they left she was like girls she's like you have to remember like now that you're getting older and you're becoming a woman you need to start
(42:35) budging for this stuff all right so you're going to start buying this every month all right so like remember you got to save some money for this so you can have it and the girls were so excited that they were like yes like we're becoming women now and these are the things that women do it's because when you have new identity you have new priorities and so you've had priorities that are aligned with your old identity right there's the you that goes out the you that drinks the you that does the BL blah blah blah blah spends money on [ __ ]
(42:58) you shouldn't do spends time on [ __ ] you shouldn't be spending time on and there's the you that you want to be and so right now we can draw the line in the sand and be like do you want to keep walking down the road that you have been walking and if you don't then you have to step into a new identity and with that new identity comes new priorities because people who want to be rich spend money on themselves they spend money on education they invest in their skill sets because I want to align my identity
(43:22) with the identity of those who came before me who've done the things I want to do right and just like those little girls stepping into that identity we too must step into the identity we want to be does that make sense and so when you're talking to somebody who's trying to lose weight and they're like I can't afford a gym membership and you're like girl you're spending 200 bucks on your nails and you've got a $1,000 outfit on do you think another $1,000 outfit would make you look better or your high school weight
(43:54) right do you think another ,000 outfit would make you look better or being rich as [ __ ] and I say that for those of you who are thinking about on the money side right like who waste like some of you guys have bigger shoe collections than like it's like Fitness like Fitness people and shoes it's like the weird like and Lululemon and the you know spandex it's like a hundreds piece of SP anyways so it's like your whole wardrobe could be Consolidated into a skill that could buy you as many wardrobes as you want if you chose to right okay rocket I don't like this
(44:26) certain aspect this is one of my favorite easiest ones to hit which is like you got to change the change right what you have been doing it's been getting what you've been getting and you got to change the change cuz like I remember I would go through meal plans with people and they'd be like well can we change this because this is what I eat for breakfast can we tell can we make that the breakfast and I'm like that breakfast makes you look like you that way you spend your first four hours of the day makes your bank account looks like what it does look
(44:58) like ooh right right taking steps right we're getting closer to the truth and so the thing is is that it's going to hurt to change because change hurts and you've heard this one probably from Tony Robinson if you haven't the question is whether the pain of staying the same is greater than the pain of change and that's we just ask someone and this is in the help part if someone's like the pain of staying the same is not worse than this Chang it's like then girlfriend like gain 50 more pounds and come back you know what I mean like get there you I mean hit rock bottom this
(45:31) isn't it for you I'm being real some people Rock Bottom is 12% body fat some people it's 500 lb but everyone's got one you just got to know where yours is and all you really got to do is just move what rock bottom is for you which is kind of interesting because you start making a change here which is kind of Interest like interesting as a thought but are you in enough pain is the question you ask the person so for those of you who are unwilling to make a change because it feels contrary to like I don't want to do I don't want to seem salesy I don't want to I don't want to
(46:01) help people like whatever right like is your current situation more painful then the change that you'll have to go through or experience to get to where you want to go and so the last one is hypothetical I actually really love this this is a great framework overall for overcoming lots of different obstacles um or objections that present themselves but the hypothetical and there's lots of ways of phrasing this which is like you've probably heard the Unicorn clothes you probably heard like if this were perfect would you do it on want a
(46:24) scare from 1 to 10 where would this program be if 10 was amazing one was terrible you know where is this they say a number and you say cool what would make it a 10 why isn't a one like you guys heard this scripting before so you guys are like no please talk slower um the reason I said we have to learn the principles behind it rather than memorizing the script is that it all is based on one thing which is hypothetical which is if this were perfect would you do it because you get a hypothetical agreement and they say yes if it were
(46:48) per the thing is that if you're like if this were perfect would you do it if someone says no then you're like girl okay like let's take five steps back this my breath smell because the thing is they've actually told you a lot there it's like it has nothing to do with the stuff you're talking about they don't trust you and now we can talk about that right so it's a great question to frame like where are we and so it's like if this were perfect would you do it sometimes they'll laugh if you ever poor they'll laugh they'll say yes right and so then
(47:14) you get to flip it and say then what's difference between Perfection and what we've got and the thing is is that people are very hard they don't actually know how to generate making a program cuz they're not going to like know all the things you can deliver on the spot right and and so they're like most of the time they'll be like I don't know you're like right well because it sounds like it's nothing to do with the program it's all about to do with you so let's talk about that right and then all of a sudden boom one step closer to the truth
(47:40) does that make sense yeah all right and that's why we do hypotheticals so if it were perfect what's missing and then if you can if it's if they do give you an answer and they're like I just don't want to do broccoli and you're like I do green beans would you do it they're like yeah you're like great green beans it is sign here right like some you would be [ __ ] amazed how many times [ __ ] like that happens it's like one crazy thing it's like well if we didn't have that would you do it like oh yeah
(48:08) sure where were you 10 minutes ago right and that's how you do hypothetical okay we're making we're making progress you still with me still digging okay cool Authority all right this is one of my favorite F and so this one instead of having three I really just have like one very good statement of reasoning that you should understand okay this is real [ __ ] so this is more of a process than it is anything else but the spouse or decision maker is not there right now note for you guys a lot of you guys have had the opportunity to go talk to a spouse but a lot of you guys don't have that in your business right like spouse
(48:47) ain't there and they leave they're not coming back right or they are but very small percentage don't wait for it okay so what we have to do is try and sidestep it by isolating the objection and casting aside the partner because the partner is not there so how could they object anything they don't even [ __ ] know who you are right and so the idea is and again this is assuming if you have a really long-term thing then you want the partner to be there right like ideally that's what you have but if you don't have the opportunity
(49:11) then you got to go through the next step all right which is what do you think they wouldn't like and then they will tell you and then you just overcome the thing which has nothing to do with the spouse because spouse isn't there right very easy s side step does that make sense this works really well it's like why wouldn't they It's like because they don't want me to fail o they don't want you to fail let's talk about you and so this is the process that I walk through do they approve of your current struggle they happy that you're struggling no okay then why would they
(49:45) not approve of something that's going to fix something they already don't approve of right they're not happy with how you're currently doing why would they be against something that's already making them unhappy right right well let me ask you this and they pause like if the rules were reversed and your husband needed this to make what he wants his dreams happen or your wife needed this program to make her dreams happen would you support her then why wouldn't you support you right right and I think the real problem
(50:19) that we're dealing with here and this is the kicker this for everybody is that you're asking for permission instead of support because it is your life not theirs and what happens is if you give that power to them and then two years from now you're still fat you're still poor whatever it is who are you going to blame them and so that's when you have a resentful marriage because you didn't own your [ __ ] and so I'm not saying you shouldn't like explain the decision to them but the way you explain it to them is what I just said which is if I don't do this for me I'm going to end up
(50:57) resenting you and I don't want that and instead of me bitching to you every day about how we don't have money or about how I don't like my body I'm now doing this and I'm joining a group of support of community of people just like me and crazy enough for some reason doctors go to college right right that makes sense they go to medical school lawyers go to law school but where do entrepreneurs go there's no entrepreneur school no one teaches the stuff but it turns out there are people who teach it just for this specific industry and I can take failures of a thousand people in pack
(51:27) into a year and it's one10 the price of a 4-year degree right and so instead of whining to you what I commit to is I'm going to show up and be a better husband a better wife a better partner I'm not going to [ __ ] to you about this the stuff because I'm going to take this seriously I'm going to go all and I'm not asking your permission I'm just asking for your support all right that's how you can overcome it because I'm going be real with you it is about them and you have to believe that like you can't say this unless you believe it because like you
(51:56) will you save marriages by showing people that they are the ones in control because if they keep saying my husband's not going to let me buy a weight loss program what do you think she's secretly saying can't believe you won't let me do it right if that's real if she's using it as a foil you sidestep you get yourself right but that might be the real thing and if that is the thing then you have to let them step into that and that's where you know having that's where like having a three-day no sweat guarantee or something like that is also helpful it's like hey sign up and I use
(52:28) I use a lot of aapor and humor in my selling and so I'd be like hey Cindy if you sign up and you tell your husband and he's upset you have and and when he sees you he's like girl I don't want you to get in shape I want you to stay overweight I want you to put those sweatpants on I want you sit on that couch reach your hand a bag of Cheetos put the the Cheetos fingers on there I want you to create generational unhealth I want you to live 10 years less long I want you to see our grandkids I don't want that right I want to marry a younger better you sooner because you're going to have a heart attack if he says that to you you have him call me and
(53:02) then they're like cracking up and you're like okay okay listen sign up three-day no sweat like if he if he does tell you that he just wants you to be out of shape and never leave him because uh because he doesn't want you to get you hot cuz he's insecure if he says that um yeah just let me know all right so like the whole time you're just joking and stuff but the 3day guarantee helps like nudge a lot of these people over is that cool you guys get that one okay sweet and so that goes for you right like it's it's about support not permission that's the bottom line right support not
(53:34) permission because otherwise you're going to blame them for your lack of Dreams being realized rather than blaming the person that should which is you all right so this is avoidance now we're getting to the core we've gotten rid of time we know that you've got time and the best time to do it is today because you're going to be busy forever right value we know that you can't afford it if you can't afford it you'll buy it if you can't afford it's a great great reason to do it and if the value is there then there's no reason not to do it because it'll pay for itself right
(54:02) what's money good for anyways you're going to pay for the program regardless you want to pay him less time or more time value is not a problem fit you got to step into new identity right you've got to be willing to change and the question is just whether the pain that you're experiencing is less than the pain of the change that it takes to experience the next thing right if they step into that they're good because it's not about resources it's about resourcefulness so the fit's not an issue Authority they
(54:29) have to own it it's about support not permission we all here do you feel like we've peeled the layers back on your prospects and they're just laid bare naked there just you've solicited the sale now you got to close all right avoidance so now they're like wait wait I need to think about it so now that we've exhausted I'm putting this as emphasis we've exhausted all outside reasons now we are finally talking to someone in power and that is what a good coach does we don't make decisions for people we help them make
(55:02) decisions so here's I have to think about it not sure give me a hand who's dealt with somebody who say thinks that way all right at least one person here no I'm kidding all you guys that you guys are great so this is how I divide this up past present future and so hopefully this should already before I I dive into these give you simple Frameworks to work through time you've got macro micro when then right you've got you got value you're thinking about it's not a lot of money even if if it were a lot of money it's not a lot of money you're going to pay for it either
(55:28) way like you have the simple Frameworks that you can walk through you might just hit them with one and if they hit it with again you hit them with the other angle because they're logical Frameworks they're not scripts that's why I made them bubbles you don't have to memorize it just got to understand it past so like I need to think about it and so the thing is is and this the first bubble there is if someone's like I feel like this is happening so fast any we get that one like I just I just got on the phone with you I don't really know who you are and you're like hey this is not a fast decision right you've been making this decision for the last 6
(55:54) years you continually make the decision we're doing to say is deciding you're actually going to do something about it right how long you wanted to lose weight a long time so this is not a fast decision at all but the thing is is that and this is where you go sunk cost so if I were talking to you guys I would say you you know you bought tickets cuz you saw some ad you registered there you got your flights you got a hotel you blocked the time you flew here you listen to this whole thing you're 6 in from gold
(56:24) this isn't a fast decision at all you did all these to get here because it's important to you so don't let that Distortion stop you from getting what you want right it's fear right let's face that what are you afraid of having happen which by the way I took the slide out but my two favorite questions to ask in a in a sale that I feel like are the fastest to cut through is what are you most afraid of having happen if you buy what are you most afraid of what's the worst thing that you envision in your mind and if they're not sure I just fill
(56:54) in the blanks I'm like I take your credit card I swipe over as as much as I possibly can I go to Vegas I put it all on black and then I go to Monaco where they can't extradite me fair enough and they're like I was not thinking that and you're like right so what's the worst you know like what's what's the real thing they're like and then they're like you know I just hav bought so many programs before you're like right let's talk about that right and so I'm going to skip one forward and then I'm going to go back to
(57:19) it this is one of my favorite obstacle or objection overcomes it's I call it don't let it burn you twice and this you can see the date it happened yesterday this girl texted me or me April 6th she said it's crazy to think that I had a sales call with you 6 years ago and I'm kicking myself in the butt for not jumping on this is yesterday right like I don't even own the company anymore and I said you let a bad decision burn you twice once when you made your poor investment but a second time when you let that bad investment stop you from a good investment it would be like anybody ever have a boyfriend or girlfriend in
(57:48) middle school or high school that they're not currently married to anyone just like just come on help me out here okay it would be like having a bad eighth grade boyfriend or girlfriend and being like you know what men aren't for me all coaches suck right there's good coaches there's bad coaches there's crazy ass [ __ ] and there's crazy ass dudes you know what I mean like there's also good ones and so the things is if you stop if you let the bad one prevent you from the good one you get burned by being with the bad one and because you
(58:20) let the bad one control your next decision right and so when someone has had a bad experience with do doing keto or whatever the [ __ ] right or you had a bad experience with some program that you did or did not do or they didn't fulfill whatever either way don't let that burn you twice because no matter what you're going to have to do you're going to have to do these actions whether you're part of the program or not you're got to do these workouts where you're part of the program or not doesn't matter you're going to have to do it so you might as well do it but somebody's going get you there faster right let me go back one real quick so
(58:51) it's not a fast decision and this is another one that I love which is do you think that you're maybe in this position because you have struggled to make a decision in the past you have waffled when it came time to make to make the hard call have you been in this conversation and said no before yeah do you think that's why you're here yeah do you think that might be the reason you should change that yeah okay let's change it one decision change your life and the last one is like are you tired of another year of almost right tired another year
(59:21) of almost hitting your goals of almost getting to 10K a month of of almost you know Hing the team that you wanted of almost retiring your your wife or husband or almost moving into the neighborhood that you wanted to move into or almost being able to pay for your kids Recreational Sports rather than not being able to because you can't afford it you're tired of another year of almost well if you're tired of another year almost then we can't do what we're doing to get here for another year because we're going to get another year almost and so the question isn't
(59:45) what it cost you but how much has it cost you to not decide up to this point right the cost of inaction and I think that when we think about our lives in Reverse we never never regret the things that we did we regret the things we didn't do the opportunities that we let pass by and I think that if you can let that person step into that power they will make the decision to help themselves like this person did not all right present so depends on who you're talking to someone's talking about past stuff then you do with the past stuff the second frame for avoidance is present which is
(1:00:16) they just don't know how to make a [ __ ] decision right and so you have to help them make a decision and so this one the rocking chair is one that I just for some reason have used a tremendous amount of time especially when I was selling weight loss is to be like I just really really need to think about it like totally understand well let's walk through like what that looks like you're not going to like go home sit in the rocking chair you know smoke a cigarette because of course you're not healthy yet right you'll quit when you're healthy right you're smoking your cigarette and you're
(1:00:41) like H am I going to do this weight loss program right you're just sit there and stare into the clouds like I wonder no of course now you're get in your car and you're going to realize you got to pick up Timmy from soccer practice you got to get groceries you got to cook you got to clean you got to pick you know go do the laundry got to do all these things right and then 3 four 5 days from now you're going to put on that pair of jeans and it's not going to fit you be like [ __ ] and just there you'll have made the
(1:01:02) decision you'll keep living your life and so let's just make it now because the reality is that it doesn't take information to make decisions sorry it doesn't take time to make decisions takes information and I'm the only source of information you got so let's talk I'm here I'm here for you let's do it right because that's the fallacy is that people think they need more time to make decisions because they assume they will get more information in that time but if you are the source of the information then time does not help them
(1:01:32) and so let's confront it now and let me answer the questions you have to make the decision one way or another does that make sense yeah all right and so then they're like well then [ __ ] how do I make a decision you're like glad you asked so there's three things that we got to understand do you believe that this product or service is going to help you achieve what you want yes or no they're going to say yes right and if they don't you can confront it note all of these are confronting decisions so we've moved all the way down the onion
(1:01:59) right we're at truth now and all like the theme of the of the last bullet is confrontation we have to confront the decision we got to peel it back and be like are we going to do this or not right because we already got out the time we got out the fit we got out the SP we got everything out of the way it's just you do you think that this is going to help you get closer to your goals yes or no two do you trust me to fill to fulfill my word that I said I'm going to help you I'm going to do these calls I'm going to do these workouts I'm going to do whatever right three this is the mo
(1:02:28) probably the most important one do you think it'll work for you and if they say no you say why not and then they have to defend why not and then it's very easy at that point it's a 6inch putt right and once they say yes to all three which is usually what'll happen be like cool we'll make the decision together do you know how to make the decision they'll say no you go through the three and the last question is they said yes yes yes it's just do you have or have access to the amount of money to get started do
(1:02:52) you have the MX do you want me to help you enroll in an MX cuz I want to I want to help you I'm good either way but if you believe that this is going to help you get closer you believe that what I'm saying is true and you believe that you can be successful it's my moral obligation to get you going and do everything in my power to help you get the money or get access to it because the real R is if I was giving you a Ferrari right now for $5,000 you'd find the money if your landlord needed you to come up with $10,000 because you had background and payroll you'd find the
(1:03:16) money so find the money let's do it right three who wants to make informed decisions yes how can you make an informed decision if you haven't even tried it huh so this is when you have some element of trial in the program or some sort of guarantee which is why I'm a big fan of guarantees it's like well you can't make the decision to buy that's informed until you're on the inside so I'm not even asking you to make a decision right now I'm just asking you make an informed decision which you can only do on the inside and if after 30 days I'm not what I said this product doesn't do what I
(1:03:52) told you I didn't fulfill my promise and you don't think it's going to work for you you let me I'll give you the money back low pressure you get someone to decide by not deciding even easier does that make sense think that'll help you close yeah all right and then uh this one is uh it depends on who you're selling to but sometimes if you a logical person it's like do you know what deciding even means like where the atmology of the work comes from it's dcad which is Latin which means to cut off to kill off and so the question is which future are we
(1:04:24) killing off today are we killing off the future of the dreams that you want are we killing off the future sorry are we killing off the future of of not doing anything and the life that you've lived up to this point because indecision is a decision inaction is an active decision right and so it's just which one are we killing today we killing your dreams or we killing your past second and last one future so we talked about past so if they're thinking about the past the things that hurt them don't let it burn you twice Etc right they don't know how
(1:04:56) to make a decision rocking chair this is how you make a decision three things you have access to money great let's get going you want to kill your past you want to kill your future right awesome we're talking about the future this is actually magnifying pain which is cool you got here it's been 5 years you've been struggling how's another five years sound what if we just keep doing let's go with indecision let's look at it what does five years of you doing what you've been doing look like and is that a place you want to be no you got to change the change let's do it
(1:05:25) right and then you go right into let's consider the options which is like like this is logic right so let's consider the options option one you do the thing get the result life is awesome option two you don't do the thing you don't get the result because you didn't do the thing option three you do the thing but then you don't get the result all these are the options that can happen in front of you because we have a guarantee they're all risk-free except for one of them only one of them has a true guarantee of not getting you where you want which is walking out the door so which risk-free
(1:06:01) option do you want the one that's risk-free that guarantees that you're not going to get there or the one that's risk-free and has the potential to get you where you want to go right that's not an emotional close it's logic and if you have an offer that's set up that way you should be able to close most people as long as they don't think you're an [ __ ] right okay this is one that's more around urgency because again this is avoidance if someone says I I'm still not sure I want to think about it more whatever you say well you're not going to struggle forever right like you don't want to struggle forever you're going to do
(1:06:32) something about this whether it's weight loss business whatever they're going to say yes you're like well if you're going to fix your business eventually you might as well start fixing it now so you can start enjoying the fruits of that labor sooner would you prefer making more money faster or slower what's your preference great so if you're going to do it eventually you might as well do it now does that make sense it's a little nudge this is a final one that I just really like from a framing perspective which is instead of a like this has to
(1:07:00) be my savior this program has to get me to an ifbb Pro bikini body and I'm 100 pounds overweight probably not realistic right reframe the question is do you think that making the decision is going to be help you get closer or further from your goal that's it because if we keep making decisions that keep getting us closer we will get there eventually but if we make decisions that get us further away we will not get there and so do you think that this is going to get you closer to your goal than what you're currently doing yes what are we waiting for we don't need to be snipers
(1:07:32) we need to be directionally right we do that long enough we'll get there does that make sense that helps you too because we have this fear of perfectionism is this going to be the one probably not but it will get you [ __ ] way closer right because I can tell you there's no one program that changed my life but the the decision to buy education changed my life forever does that make sense yeah all right boom and so let me let me look at the top we have no reasons left not to own the power that you have it's just you all
(1:08:05) right and here's bonus number six and you can use this as one of like there's some closes that you use all the time you always go back to right the reason you are telling yourself not to do this is the reason you to do it how long do you want I can't afford this to be on your list of problems in life the fact that you don't have time is the very reason you need to do this the fact that you're so dependent on your spouse is the reason you need to take this decision and own it right the fact that you're not sure about the person that you want to be is the very reason that we're going to help you get it in this program so whatever the reason is is usually the biggest chain
(1:08:37) that you're holding on to is the thing that you're enslaving yourself to is the thing that you're casting your power to if you break that chain power comes back to you and so the very reason that you're holding yourself back is typically the very reason that you need to do it so hopefully this helps you realize that you and your clients are always in complete power did I accomplish that awesome thank you and like I promised at the beginning My Hope Is that you become more powerful by making decisions rather than letting
(1:09:08) life make them for you all right so here's a few final thoughts fortunes are created by taking a lot of risk with a little bit of money fortunes are maintained by taking a little bit of risk with a lot of money and every one of those people that was self-made takes a lot of risk with a little bit of money and sometimes you need to take that step because it's the only way to build the fortune all right and if everything that I've ever made in my life all right sorry everything that I've made in my life is a result of investing in my own education it has
(1:09:38) gotten me far higher returns than any stock any real estate any crypto right any whatever buy a mile and people say like it's all about investing yourself like I just I think it sounds a morphus it's like Buy experience and skills because no government can take that from you no divorce can take that from you nothing can take that from you and I come from a family where so we're Persian and so my my parents had to flee Iran During the Revolution and so they had land and houses and other stuff right and my uncle was uh the brother to a guy who started the lottery in Iran he
(1:10:22) owned the lottery because you can do that there right very rich rich and so my dad and him he went to London my dad went to the US he had no skills and he was able to just forge enough money to buy a print shop and he lives above the print shop in London and still to this day that's what he does and went to visit him it was incredibly sad seeing just like well once once incred and his wife my dad gave her a scarf and it was like a nice scarf apparently and she just baled she's like I used to have rooms of these and now I have nothing and blah blah blah blah right my dad came to the United States
(1:10:56) with $1,000 but because he had skills he built it all from scratch and so I mean he was a doctor as all Middle Eastern and Indians are um right doctor lawyer accountant engineer anyways um the only four approved paths but when we say invest in that we come from a place where like it was literally all taken the government was like that's our house now that's our land now that bank account is our bank account now and so that was why it was so and like that might be a benefit for me I had somebody who was always like it's the only thing no one can take from you and
(1:11:33) so why would you not invest in the one thing that can never be stolen can never be taken and compounds with time and it increases your capacity to make money increases your capacity to live and so I like to think of the Investments that I've made in myself as bricks on a bridge and so if I'm on the bottom left here and where I want to be is the top right is right looking like The Nightmare Before Christmas now um you're going like there are many skills that it takes to cross the bridge right and just like you have an arithmetic teacher in high school once you learn calculus you're not like that
(1:12:08) guy was a load of [ __ ] calculus is what no you have to learn things in sequence right and so the thing is is that when we build this bridge it's one brick at a time and I always come back to the same question which is is this going to get me closer to where I want to go I don't need it to get me there I just need to get closer and if I get better I'll get there eventually right as long as I don't stop moving and so that's why that's that what I've dedicated my life to education my mission is to document and share the best practice building world class companies because when you realize that
(1:12:38) you are the source you realize that Superman is not coming it's just you and every decision that you make is a vote towards or against the person that we want to be and so the question for you is that are your decisions voting towards the person that you want to become or just more of what you already have and so people ask me all the time how do you move so quickly and the answer is I know how to buy time and the follow question is how do you buy time you buy Time by buying the time took other people to make mistakes that taught them
(1:13:07) the lessons that's how you do it right that's that's the heck and so right now the ignorance of not knowing how to create a million dollars a year is costing you a million dollars a year the fact that you don't know how to make a million dollar a year is costing you a million dollars a year think about it right and so therefore you should always be willing to invest money to increase the capacity for your income because once you have it that capacity pays you forever you're increasing your ability does that make sense we're widening the pipe and so when I thought about this I
(1:13:39) just added zeros to it and I was like it's [ __ ] costing me a billion dollars a year not knowing how to make a billion dollars God right but it's true because the thing the number one tax that no one appreciates or no one respects is not the tax of the government it's not capital gains not income tax it's the time tax of ignorance someone asked Lela yesterday what's the number one thing that people from 0 to 10K are messing up you don't know what the [ __ ] you're doing that's what's messing you up you're ignorant you have no idea you're eating an orange like an apple no clue right and it's not because you don't
(1:14:15) have the processing power it's not because you don't have the ability to reason it's because you just don't know and so the goal is to pay down the time tax of ignorance fast as humanly possible and the only way you do that is by educating and investing yourself right specifically investing in experiences that build skills so make the decisions that to help yourself Implement like crazy take ownership because we just discover that all the other [ __ ] is not real is literally a distortion of reality that anything that you give your power to that's not you is
(1:14:49) fake you're making it a false god in your life and your prospects are too and you now you know how to confront those when your mind tries to play tricks on you and realize that there are no silver bullets no program is going to save your life all right but some things can move you close to your goals and when those rare opportunities present themselves take them all right because either you win or you learn and both of those get you closer to wherever you want to go all right and so a wrap up with this 10
(1:15:21) years ago I had to that was me a Swanky uh you know when I was a consultant looking cool was actually after I don't even have a good picture when I was a consultant but there's me in a suit um and I I knew I hated the job that I had um I made okay money but I just like I just really wasn't happy um and I emailed 40 gym owners and I was like hey I think I want to get in Fitness can somebody like help me out one guy was like sure you can work for free I was like awesome uh that guy was standing back to y and anybody know who Sam backr is raise hand jeez okay well seven
(1:16:00) figure Sam is what he used to be known as he actually died during Co um which is really sad for me because I really looked up to Sam and the thing is is that when I got to his office I literally drove across the country from Baltimore to LA or Chino Hills which is where he was and I showed up without notice and he was like you're a psychopath I just met you from the internet and I was like I'm here I'm ready to learn he was like I'm going to lunch and um but right after he came back from lunch uh he was like all right so you should
(1:16:30) join my my Mastermind and I was like I don't have a gym he's like that's okay it was a gym Mastermind um and I didn't I mean like I was 22 like I did not have a lot of money um and he was like well it's 10 grand and I was like I I don't know and he's like you need a [ __ ] commit man he's like you've been waffling back and forth I had had multiple phone calls with him before left um he's like I think you need to draw a line in the sand and thank you God you know thank God he did cuz I did take a step over I had no idea
(1:17:04) what the [ __ ] I was doing but I was trying to start paying down the time tax of ignorance and I got around a whole bunch of other Fitness professionals and I learned way more from all of them than I ever learned from Sam but because of that my belief started to change the ways I saw the world Chang the traits I started to embody change and started taking steps The Mastermind I got from Sam is not what made me $100 million but it got me on the right path towards making it over the years of having hundreds of salespeople work for me I've seen these nine things that the best
(1:17:33) sales people do differently than everyone else and so if you boil it down a salesperson has three jobs to do they have to maximize the number of opportunities they have they have to convert the highest percentage of those opportunities and and this is the important part they have to do it consistently for a very long period of time and so the nine things they do differently will fall elegantly into each of these three buckets let's start with the first one which is maximizing lead needs or maximize the number of opportunities that a salesman
(1:17:59) has so right off the top I've never seen a salesperson who does the most in a company have the lowest amount of hours worked I've yet to have it you know what maybe there's a special snowflake out there but every company that I've owned and every company that I've looked at the guy who works the most hours is the one who sells the most deals and so maximizing opportunities comes in a number of different forms so number one is that they have the total most hours available per day because you should be available when the prospect is available and that means sometimes working long
(1:18:30) hours it sometimes mean working weekends and yes businesses also pay rent on Sundays and so you can make sales on Sundays so my software company Allen scheduled 4,000 plus appointments per day across a number of different Industries and so we got to see all the way from click to close which companies were selling the most people and we looked at all the different data so times of day number of days per week you know speed between text responses number of characters and text response all these different variables cuz I had two data analysts that looked at this to figure out how could he maximize
(1:18:59) throughput for any business and obviously sales a big component of that and the single greatest lever on throughput across all companies was the number of total available time slots which means availability was the strongest predictor of total sales and let me give you a tactical example of this when Leila and I were traveling the other day we went to a different city and she wanted to get her nails done or something and so she she just pulled up Yelp and looked at the one that had the top reviews called them up and they said oh I'm sorry we don't do same day appointments and they're like we can book you in for 2 days from now and she
(1:19:33) was like yep don't care called the next one same thing called the third one and then they were like yeah we can take you right now and boom she went in and the thing is is that both those other business owners the first two business owners that said no lost money and the next time she comes to that place she'll probably go back to the one that she went to as long as they did a good job and so trying to be egotistical about it rather than accommodate customers it's like well we're so great you just lose money now if we
(1:19:59) maximize the total number of time that's available for the salesperson to sell then the next part of maximizing their opportunities is getting as much of their day as humanly possible filled with the best opportunities and so the second subunit of this is they will pull up calls and so the first thing is if you see a call that gets booked or you book a call that's on Thursday and today's Monday if you have a time slot that's open you grab your Thursday appointment you drag it into today because today appointments always have higher show up rates and if you pull it up then they're even more
(1:20:31) interested and you can close even higher and you can have two or three calls by that same Thursday time so you increase your sales velocity now a correlator to that is if you look at your calendar and you've reached out to a prospect and that person has not responded back and now it's the same day and they're coming up in a few hours well what do you do well the best salespeople pull that time slot and say hey sorry I didn't see that you confirmed why don't we do the same thing for tomorrow you can push it out one and then try and fill that time slot
(1:20:56) with somebody who is responsive even if they're later in the week and that increases your total number of calls per day and so fundamentally the perfect day for a salesperson is that they have call back to back to back to back to back with the best possible leads that are the hottest that day I learned that little tactic about pulling up because we had one of our companies uh was in solar sales and they had one rep that massively outperformed everyone else and I was like what is this guy doing and so what he was doing was he would whenever a new appointment would book he would
(1:21:24) immediately call the appointment to qualify the lead cuz that checks two boxes one is he says okay is this person qualified to buy if the person was he had two decision paths if they had the time right then he would just go straight into closing because he was in offthe callop and then by getting in contact with the lead became on the call in terms of his sop and if they said they had time right now he just went for the sale that maximizes his time on call if they said no then the reason for his call was that he had an opening later that day that he was trying to fill up
(1:21:52) and so he either takes the moment now that he's working the lead and turns it into into a sales call or he fills another slot later in the day and turns that into a sales call both of those things maximize the number of sales that guy was having and this guy was selling like four times more units than the second best guy on the team and then they obviously saw this and then adopted it companywide and then of course I saw it and adopted it across all my entire portfolio and let me double down to why that's so powerful because not only does the salesman have two opportunities to
(1:22:17) sell now or later that day he also opens up the slot later in the week for availability for another customer that can't make it today to to book that time then because what I have found and we saw this with the software was if you have fewer time slots people may still book with you but they are not booking at the most convenient time for them you'll see schedule rates but then show rates will drop because it's not the time that works for them ideally and so you want to make it the most accommodating so it's not just are is it convenient or inconvenient it's how convenient is it if I have a a tight
(1:22:47) deadline and a hard stop and I've got something that I'm stressed about afterwards I might be able to schedule a call then but I might not be in a in the mood to buy high but if I say you know what Sunday afternoon I'm free I'll have all the time in my world I'm going to have zero urgency to get off the call I'll listen to you and I'll be in a completely different Zone and that might be when I'm in receiving hands in terms of prospect brain mode for buying and so one of the things that the best sales people have and this is something that companies should provide
(1:23:15) but often don't is that you have two Sops meaning standard operating procedures you have an on thee call sop which is what you say when you're talking to prospects and you have an offthe call sop which is what do in between the vast majority of companies don't have an off-the call sop and they're losing tons and tons of money because they just say yeah just work the leads in the meantime when the total amount of output that a salesman has is so correlated with the amount of opportunities they have and they get those opportunities by the time they have when they're not on the call and so
(1:23:44) they should have two separate checklists if they don't have them in front of them and this is what the best sales people do is this is what I'm doing when I'm on and this is what I'm doing when I'm off and you can just switch hats as soon as you're off you start at the top and you're like I'm following with this person I'm following with this person I'm dragging this person forward I'm canceling this appointment and they have high Activity one of the things that we do across all our companies and I learned This Acronym from my friend shiron
(1:24:09) bamfam which is book a meeting from a meeting which is that the best salespeople never finish a call with a prospect not knowing when the next time they're going to talk to the prospect so that Prospect should never fall into no l they should never fall between the cracks where they're like I don't know and so if you get to the end of the call and they're like yeah let's uh connect offline we'll you know we'll Circle back up and we'll find another time no you have to address it at that time because if for whatever reason like a Time obstacle is still an obstacle and you
(1:24:33) can resolve it right then you both have your calendars up you can both make the decision if someone's like well I'm not sure then you actually address the concern like isn't this a problem for you how much you losing every day not implementing this solution in your business how much like how much of a problem is this in your life and why isn't it this something that we'd be doing sooner right and so you want to address those things because that is these are obstacles and so if you just get off the call Jolly then you actually lose more sales so you always book a
(1:24:57) meeting from the meeting here's three more things that the best salese will do number one is that they don't take rejection personally because they're going to reach out in more volume than the mediocre salespeople and so you can see on a CRM how many Outreach attempts and how many follow-up attempts that A salesperson is having between calls and it correlates with the number of calls that they take and so they work their leads harder and that's because if someone before they've scheduled a call you know say has something mean they're not like oh my gosh I can't believe this
(1:25:27) or if someone no shows they're not like well I'm not going to work the rest of my leads no one really cares about me like wo is me it's no they know it's a numbers game and they just keep plowing something that I've noticed the best salespeople do is they have something called a kill list and so those are those prospects that you're like this is a whale or this is a really good Prospect and they they sure they have in the CRM sure they have them in the place that they're supposed to have them but they also have it somewhere else that's visible so they can always think about
(1:25:52) it and like that's like an everyday list it's like I got to get back to these two guys I got to make sure that these ones I'm going to put extra attention to because they're high value deals now the last element of what the best salese do for increasing their number of leads is that they create their own opportunities so sure they're going to get the inbound leads from marketing they're going to get the people you know the leads that are handed to them but the best salese know the value of referrals and so the way they do that is at the end of the call or at the time that it makes sense
(1:26:22) they say hey do you know anybody else or my favorite way of asking is who do you know because it forces the prospect to answer the question with a not yes no but with a name you say who do you know who is as awesome as you now it's a compliment who would also benefit from this so now I'm giving them a compliment by by by asking them for the referral so I kind of like have a like a nice guy sandwich there so like you're amazing who else do you know who's like you who would love to do this with you or with
(1:26:47) us who could benefit from XYZ right now sometimes if they say no one then sometimes like this is where Rapport is important but you could say say something like why do you hate me so much and they're like what do you mean it's like well I only can assume that you hate us because you don't want anybody else to know about this amazing thing and you probably hate your friends because you want them to suffer as well right and if it's because you don't believe me then let's talk about that but otherwise like why are we not
(1:27:11) getting your friends in here because I can promise you you'll be far more successful if you have more people you know who are in it so in the spirit of bamfam book a meeting from a meeting if we consider this to be a meeting if you would like us to help you more with your sales process acquisition.
(1:27:23) just started a workshop division where my sales director my team will talk to you specifically about your sales your process your scripting so we can Implement some of the things that we know work in our portfolio into your business ASAP we do other stuff at the workshop but we also talk about sales if that's at all interesting you can book your next meeting by going to acis.
(1:27:41) com clicking the scale button and following the steps and if you're qualified my guys will reach out when I had a team in a different portfolio company we had one guy who was outperforming everyone else by a huge margin this one wasn't as big as the pullup thing that was massive this was was about 50% higher than the number number two guy and we were like what is this guy doing he was brand new and that was what was interesting is like brand new going to the top leaderboard is not very common because that means that they're doing a different process right
(1:28:06) and so he was following the script and we listened to the calls like this is the same call and so when we called him up we said what are you doing differently and the thing is he was multiplying his leads and so what he did was at the end of the calls he was just asking who they knew who would also benefit from this thing and I think they were they were selling um some sort of uh tickets of some sort and so he was saying who else wants to come with you who else would you like to bring and it's just a simple little thing that he
(1:28:30) was doing but by doing that he was increasing his sales by 50% because the referrals even though only one out of three or one out of four people would refer the referral close ratees like 80 or 90% And so if you think okay I take you know four calls and I close one and I ask for referrals in all all four and only one of them gives me referral but then that referral then closes then I take my one sale out of four and turn it to two out of five if you're a business owner thinking about how valuable just implementing that is consistently is
(1:29:02) that your cost to acquire a customer you just you cut in half by taking one customer and getting a referral from that customer and if one out of three customers refer someone then you cut your cost to Aire customer by a third and this is the type of stuff is advertising becomes more expensive because it always will become more expensive that the businesses that do this the salesmen that do this will be the ones that win in the future so now we have a Salesman who has the max maximum number of hours the maximum number of days they're pulling up appointments so that their time on call
(1:29:30) closing with the best people is maximized they're following up before they're following up after they're doing personalized reach outs and saying like hey voice memo hey video hey I've got this thing for you that I've got set up for the call um what size shirt do you want I've set aside uh thing here was one of the things we did at the gym hey what color shirt do you want hey what boxing gloves hey what you do a tiny little thing hey I've got three gift cards here I got one for Amazon one for Starbucks and one for whatever which one would you prefer right you ask a
(1:29:58) preference question prior to the call and more people show because the thing is is you're like well shoot this guy's doing this thing the least I can do is show up and so they're maximizing the number of scheduled appointments they're maximizing the number of shows they're maximizing the number of opportunities they're getting from those opportunities and now we get to the call so now we got to close them understand the value of preparation you would be amazed at how much of a genius you sound like if you just do 5 minutes of research before a call and so
(1:30:30) my rule of thumb for research is that if it's something that you do all the time it's about 10% of the time that you're going to be on a call or meeting that you can do in prep so if you have a 2-hour call then you've got 12 minutes of prep if you've got a 60-minute call then you do six minutes of prep now this is something that if you do it all the time if this is like I'm doing a quarterly meeting then it reverses it's like 6 hours of prep for 1 hour of presentation if it's something that you don't do often and so sales people do the same call over and over again but the thing that's different the tiny bit
(1:30:59) of difference is the prospect they're speaking with and so like this applies to everything like if you're picking a girl up at her house if you do 5 Seconds of research in the car before you go in and you look at what her dad does and look at the company of the of the father and say hey so Mr so and so really nice to meet you so I see you work at you know whatever engineering like do you like that stuff I see that they just had a a press lease coming out do you have any involvement in that this guy would immediately see you no matter how you're dressed what you look like as it's a
(1:31:24) it's a check they're like whoo like I will respect this person because he did me the honor of actually taking some time to look me up and figure out more about my business he didn't show up like everybody else does not knowing which way is Sunday trying to figure things out as they go I'm telling you the best salespeople take those five minutes they do that tiny bit of research and the amount of Rapport that you build in that first one minute from having those Secrets the person is then like oh wow they know about me think about what it takes to close someone no like and Trust
(1:32:00) well all of a sudden you feel known because they did it you like people who know more about you and what else do you do you trust people who know more about you because you approximate friendship you approximate a relationship and you do and you get to do a ton of that at the first second of the call rather than taking the five first minutes the call to show that you don't know what you're doing right as I started selling gym owners rather than weight loss when I was selling my turnaround business I started getting leads but I didn't have any like methodology so like I had a
(1:32:31) webinar it didn't work and so I just started finding people on Google using their emails and so I'd find their social profiles and I'd liter have to piece together like a profile of who this person was cuz the only thing I was collecting was an email for this webinar and so I'd find like three or four social profiles and then I would connect with them and I would do some research so that I could make my reach out not look sketchy as hell and so when I would do my reach out that I would have all this data that I put as almost like a
(1:32:55) little profile together um about them and so when I hopped on the phone they were like whoa like you know a lot about my gym and I was like well yeah and I saw that because I look at the images like so I saw your square footage layout I think if you move this here this might actually be able to allow you to double the amount of usable square footage that you have for the sessions and that would help me sell more people into your gym so I don't know if you're open to something like that but now I'm coming
(1:33:18) with like I see the problem I also have the solution cuz I thought about it before we got on the phone cuz I don't want to waste your time trying to figure things out now I want to figure them out beforeand come with you with Solutions and this is when I was starting out so I didn't have a reputation yet so I had to build the reputation by showing up and providing more value than other people were ahead of time and this is where like if you're new and you're coming into a space you win through prep like the big guys have the reputation the
(1:33:42) small guys went through preparation the best sales people take notes this is one of those things that is just like prep but it preps you for the next call and so you do your public preparation with what you can find and observe you do your second call preparation with what you find out on the phone and I'm telling you if you hop on the phone and say oh yeah so you've got your daughter Sarah and Jessica and they're at you know Colorado and they're finishing up and you've got X Y and Z happening in the business is that correct okay cool just making sure just reading over some of the past Nots got on the call they're
(1:34:17) like oh wow I don't have to resay my whole life story again this guy now when this guy makes recommendations I assume he does it within the cont context of my business because one of the big things when you are selling something is that people want to make sure that it not only that it works but it's going to work for them and so you can address that concern before it ever comes up by proving that your recommendations are contextual this is also what switches you from being a Salesman to a consultant this is what switches you from somebody who's just trying to close to somebody who's trying to
(1:34:49) help the most brilliant salespeople listen more than they talk and this is one that people get wrong all the time is that they see super talkative people I mean moms in high school are like you should get into sales cuz you don't shut up uh no that's not not always the case that's what that's what bad sales people look like uh and unfortunately the thing is is the best salespeople don't come off as salespeople they just close and so people don't feel sold they feel like they bought and so everybody buys stuff every day all the time and
(1:35:22) they're buying from companies that have salespeople and they don't know it so when you go to a restaurant and they ask you if you want dessert that's a sale they get commissions on those things and if they do it in a weird way you're like uh I don't want to be sold if they do in a great way you're like oh I'm so glad that person made that recommendation and so you never felt like you got sold you felt like you bought and so the problem is that the reputation of salese is terrible because you only remember the bad ones we actually did this big study
(1:35:45) because we have a huge amount of sales calls that we can look at across the whole portfolio and we use software that analyzes the calls with AI and all that stuff we can see what's talk time versus listen time and the best best salespeople listen twice as much as they talk and so the little isms that I have for this is that the person who's answering the questions is the one getting interrogated you don't want to be the one getting interrogated and whenever you answer questions you give the other person something to attack and so you want them to be answering so that
(1:36:11) you have things that you can pick apart and move around if you're the one answering questions then you're the one who's getting picked apart and has things that they can disagree with I want to be like smoke right they can't they can't catch anything that I say and so if someone says you know hey well tell me tell me what makes you better than your competition I'd be like well what things you're looking for right back to them right it's like it's like hot potato it's like right back to you well I would want this this
(1:36:36) and this and this I'm like why are those things important to you right back to you right like I I can do this all day right like I I cannot answer because the thing is is that they believe nothing that you say they believe everything that they say and so I need them to say that it's a good idea not me when I started selling weight loss I realized really quickly that I had an agenda of what I wanted to tell people they needed to do and I realized that I didn't have time in 15 minutes to re-educate someone
(1:37:03) their last 10 years of life of all the experiences good and bad that they had prior to me what I needed to do in that moment was get them to buy and then I could spend the rest of my time trying to do the real education stuff and so I wanted to Simply align with where they were coming from to get them to make the sale and so that was why I started asking what have you done before for what did you like what did you not like rather than picking apart the things they did and then they like I actually really like that about that other thing lost the sale only takes a few times of doing that to be like I'm going to shut
(1:37:34) the [ __ ] up and just let them tell me what they liked and then I'll say we're like that and not like that and so the whole concept here is you want to educate the prospect so that they can come to their own conclusion and so the only gaps that you're filling is is hard information and I only give that information after I already know it's the right answer and so just like lawyers don't ask questions when they're on the stand that they don't already know the answers to should never ask for the sale unless you already know they're going to buy and so there are times and
(1:38:04) this is where pattern recognition is helpful for salese this is what the brilliant salese do is that if they're like I don't think he's ready there I don't think he's ready yet and it's like you don't you don't go for the kill you just ask more questions like I feel some hesitation like what are your main concerns right now like I'm feeling some hesitation around price talk to me about that there's two ways by the way if you're weirded out about asking questions is that you can both give commands or ask questions and so you can
(1:38:27) change the the Cadence up in the script by saying so instead of saying for example hey how's it going it's an easy first thing a lot of people say on the first thing of the call but if I say tell me about your day it's a very different thing because it it people have automatic responses to questions they hear all the time and so if you want to break a pattern with somebody and then get them more present you say tell me about your T and then like oh uh I mean it it was good I had a couple calls before this
(1:38:51) and you're like oh that's fantastic was that related to this thing cuz I looked looked you up online totally different perspective on that salesperson the first 30 seconds right so they listen more than they talk they are like smoke you only answer questions with questions unless you already know that the statement that you're going to say is in alignment with what you know the person wants and so if they're like tell me why you're different then I'd be like well what have you done in the past because then it'll give me more context so I can help explain it now they're going to say all these things they be like what did
(1:39:21) you like about that what did you not like about that and so when I get to the point where I actually have to say what what are things about I'm going to highlight all the things they liked about the other stuff and I'm going to not highlight the things they didn't like about the other stuff and all of a sudden they be like this is perfect i' be like what do you know I just asked you the question of the things you wanted and as long as they are the things that we can actually provide I highlighted those features about our thing because I already knew which piano keys to play cuz you told
(1:39:45) me they breathe the script and so the reason I use that is because that is the best description I can give is that they can they can say it without thinking just like you breathe without thinking they can say the script without thinking because you can't listen to a prospect if you're waiting to talk because you're trying to remember what you're going to say next you need to know all of the script like the Bible or like something that you've memorized in the past so that you can be 100% present with the Prospect and listening and so my favorite ISM around this is again and
(1:40:18) the first time I learned this was I saw an exceptional sales trainer training a rep and he was just drilling them on the opening 30 seconds of the script and so they did the script and I heard and I and I was watching him listen to them while giving them visual cues and so this is this was a huge advancement in terms of my understanding of selling happened because before this I knew how a sell but I couldn't transfer the skill but this guy was sitting there and he was like yep yep yep pause harder on this word do it again nice do it again
(1:40:49) nice one more time nice keep going and so he would get them to drill it three times in a row the right way after making the correction and then he would keep going in the script and so the point was is that if you're a salesperson you need to be able to do it again and again and again because the word concision matters a lot you don't want to be one of these salespeople that takes a hundred words to say something you could say in five it'll also make your sales way longer so again the best salesperson can take more calls because
(1:41:20) they shorten the call required a medoc salesperson will do the script in the beginning and it'll close and they will have coughed right before they asked for the close and then the person closes and so they get reinforcement for coughing and so the next sales call they take they add a cough in and whether that person closes or not they're like well it worked on that other one and so all of a sudden they add coughing in right before they close now the next time on the time that they close let's say on their fourth call after this they also added a second question in before the
(1:41:50) close so they add the second question in and then you see where this happens is that they cough and add a second question to every single call that they do and by doing this over time the length of the script and the length of the things that salespeople do continues to expand because they get positive reinforcement but the reality is that that person might have just been willing to buy no matter what and so the script gets longer and longer even though it might not have nothing to do with what was required to close and so you want to
(1:42:14) be as concise as humanly possible and this is with the best sales people do in order to close the most sales per day per unit of time because the less time you're on the phone after make the sale the more time you have to fill your calendar back up and close more deals and so the three tactics this is the sales managers is that you rehearse the script every morning they do role plays meaning let's pretend like I'm a prospect like you got to you got to get over whatever your weirdness is with role playing like I don't know what it
(1:42:40) is but so many managers like don't want to role play like Get over yourself you have to role play in order for them to get good and when you do the role playing you work on one specific part of the script because if you're doing every morning you're going to be able to work through things pretty quickly but you're like today we're just going to focus on the intro today we're just going to focus on the close today I just want you to focus on how we're overcoming spouse overcomes I want you to overcome I have to think about it issues I want you to
(1:43:05) give me two or three bangs in a row to overcome that obstacle because you seem to be struggling with it right and so by and you just keep hitting it again and again and again so that when it comes up they just breathe it out rather than thinking about it also because no one can improve multiple things at the same time so when you say hey there's nine things you did wrong one it's a incredibly discouraging second they can't improve any of them and so if you look at any good skills coach whether it's a basketball coach or it's a painting coach or a sales coach they work they might see you have a hundred things wrong with your game they're just
(1:43:35) going to focus on one at a time until they clean them all up and then all of a sudden you become an exceptional sales person so I said I had nine but I have way more than nine so enjoy so here's number 10 they kill zombies up front now that's the term that we use internally you can say diffuse the bomb which is one that I did earlier in my career is what I used to say but I'm Middle Eastern so you know we had to change that the formal definition that I use is you've got obstacles and you've got objections an obstacle occurs before you've mentioned
(1:44:00) the price and so if someone says for example um you know I have a special snowflake thyroid issue right and you're trying to say like you need to do this thing to lose weight you know that that's going to blow up on you in the sale see we're doing bomb references so you have to address it up front and it's much easier to address things before you ask for money than after if you do it after it's called an objection all right so I say obstacles are up front you want to avoid them you want to move around them right I mean you have to Crush
(1:44:23) through them realistically but you get through those and then objections you have to handle but now the the time is ticking on the bomb like now you have a short period of time before it blows up on you right uh or the zombie is about to bite you whatever analogy you want spouse for example or decision maker or I'm not going to have time to do this thing or there's elements of this you know program or implementation that aren't a fit for me you want to address all that stuff up front so that you've handled everything before the stakes get lifted When you mention price and then
(1:44:53) you go for for the close and the obstacles and objections that you handle are always the same and so they're going to Bubble up to three main things one is going to be circumstances so circumstances is going to be time it's going to be money it's going to be things about this specific program or implementation those are all circumstances those are outside the next is going to be other people it's going to be my wife my employees my kid my some my business partner somebody else has decision-making Authority and the third is going to be myself somebody who themselves doubts that they can do it or
(1:45:24) that they will be successful or that it's the way they want it to be done the good news is that most of the time when you're diffusing these bombs they start with the outside because time money fit is what I like to call it are things that are really easy to cast blame to and it's and it's almost a it's a it's a response right it's like they don't have to think about like I don't have time I don't have the money I don't have I don't have the card I want like I don't have the you know whatever if they talk
(1:45:47) about an authority figure then it means that like I would do it but this person's in the way and so now you're one step closer to the decision maker once you handle that if you have somebody who says I need to think about it that's actually great cuz it means you're already two layers of the onion deeper to just like you're talking to somebody who's in power who can make the decision great now you just have to help help them make the decision and so you should know all of the key fundamentals of how to overcome these now you can
(1:46:14) memorize each of them which I highly recommend but I think it's also good to understand the fundamentals and so this is what the best salespeople do is that they have key stories or metaphors to break the belief that the person has around that obstacle so for example if someone says hey um I can't decide today because you know my husband and I make all of our decisions together right now this depends on the nature of your sale if you're in a transactional sale and I would say like a consumer based sale that's under 1,000
(1:46:45) bucks maybe 2,000 bucks usually you have to do that right there if you have like a B2B sale that's going to be a multi you know multi call sale then you might have to bring in stakeholders and so this is one of the nuances that depends on the thing you're selling in the price point but the way that the best sales people do this is that you play out something in the past and you play it out in the future okay so with a decision maker you'd say hey so let me tell you about this girl Susan she was just like you and um she actually had the same issue come up where she was
(1:47:15) like I don't do anything without the consent of my husband and you know what happened she walked out her husband said I don't want you to spend the money I actually saw her a few years later and when I talked to her I said hey so how's how's things going with the you know the fitness stuff she was like oh they're they're not and I was like oh why she was like well my husband never lets me do anything and I was like oh geez um that's got to be kind of rough and she's like yeah it sucks and so the thing is is that if you play it out into
(1:47:42) the future like you're going to end up resenting that person because they're not letting you do what you want and so I think what you're asking for is permission when you really need support that's how you how you like you go from past to Future right and so then you can play it out with this person so so let's play it out five years so over the last five years you've gained 5 pounds a year so you're 25 pounds heavier so 5 years from now if you're 25 pounds heavier than you are right now they're like oh my God if I'm 25 pounds heavier than I am but that's just the track you're on
(1:48:08) and so let's play it out it like what if they say no and so sometimes they're like well then I would do it anyways then you're like awesome let's sign you up now one out of three times that's actually what happened which is crazy I still am blown away by that but then the two out of three times then I go you want permission not support now if you're looking at time or money for example then you say hey we need uh we need resourcefulness not resources so it's like you have your little isms that you can remember if it's time then it's well is it a seasonal thing because if it's a
(1:48:37) seasonal thing means you're busy right now uh and you might be you know less busy later that assumes that you'll never be busy again and so do you want this thing to be long lasting this implementation or do you want it to be just like only for the time that you're not busy and then you'll fall off again when when you get busy well shoot I want it to last forever it's like okay well then you should probably start when you're busy cuz that's what I'm going to be giving you the most support is now so that when you get to the the free time
(1:48:58) it'll be easy coasting and when you get busy again you know how to stick with it because you had the support right and so again it's like you have to be able to dismantle these things because you understand all of these there's a fundamental underlying fallacy of giving away power to something else because people don't want to make mistakes they don't want to fail and so they come up with all of these excuses they come up with time they say like that's the seasonal thing you can have time in terms of the money micro which is I don't have time in my day I'm like well you're here so when were you imagining
(1:49:28) this is why you do this up front when were you imagining how much time can you dedicate to this implementation to this SEO agency to this weight loss program whatever it is right if you ask that up front then if they say oh I don't have time with it then you can say well what changed between then and now just so I have understanding did I ask the question in a weird way that made you like not understand it um and again this is where tone matters a lot cuz now you're in the red zone right now it's like the bomb's way more sensitive cuz the the the the time ticker is going and
(1:49:56) so we want to be extra this is where Rapport is so important in the beginning because I I'll add this in this is a bonus one I call it the ghetto tone okay and I learned this from Sam back so he had a personal training business and that's why I I shadowed underneath when I got into fitness he let me just work for him for minimum wage uh and so I learned how the gym business worked but anyways I saw him have this you know rich white lady doesn't put her weights back right and he was still training at the time like he was training sessions a little bit um and so he was like girl
(1:50:28) he's like I know you ain't about to leave my gym without putting your weights back and he's a Persian dude right but he would get into this kind of like ghetto like whatever you want to call it way of talking and she'd be like fine I'll go put him back and I thought about that and I was like man if I had just been like hey Susan can you put your weights back like she's like I pay for personal training you can put my weights back like that could get really bad really fast but when you say it like that all of a sudden it's like I'm communicating
(1:50:59) the same thing and I get the desired result and they think it's fun and light-hearted and so in the same sense when you're in the clothes I use a ton of humor and that tonality to diffuse hard conversations so I say like girl I was like five minutes ago I was like you had four hours a week I was like what happened to my four hours if I say that no one's going be upset with me they' be like ah well I mean I didn't know that it was going to be X Y and Z and then I'll be like fine I know like and then then then
(1:51:29) tone switch and you're like what's really going on and then you get the real stuff because guess what closers ask hard questions right and they're the questions it's the place where you don't want to go versus where you need to go which is you want them to diffuse the bomb in front of you not when they get home right and so you don't want them to sit with the decision you want them to confront it's like you might be wondering this is a lot of money let's talk about it right you might be wondering if your husband's going to be against it well let's talk
(1:51:59) about some reasons that he might not be against it let's talk about uh what your business partner will say if you buy this without their permission let's talk about that right and so you want to confront those ugly things you don't want to cuz like you're not like if I if you take anything from this the best salespeople want to confront it because they're better at selling them than they are at selling themselves so you want them to confront the obstacle in front of you so that you can help them through it so don't wait for like you're not going to avoid it I promise you you
(1:52:29) think you're avoiding the landmine but like CU sometimes you hear that thing in the beginning of the call and you're like that's a bit I don't know if I want to blow the call dude it's going to blow up in the close if you can't even can't even confront it before you've mentioned price it's definitely coming up after you mention price so like confront it now so one of my favorite ways to get to the hard question is asking what are you afraid of happening and then I follow that with let's just play it out a lot of times
(1:52:53) it's like people don't even want to look at what's going to happen it's like no let's play it out right like I remember I had this this sale that happened where I had a lady who was like I follow Dave Ramsey and I have envelopes of cash and if I give you this envelope that's my grocery money for the week uh if I do this program and I was like okay well what are you afraid of and she like paused and I was like is it that you won't be able to afford food I was like would you be afraid of that and she was like well yeah CU she thought she was going to win the sale day but it was a trap um and I was like but you're trying
(1:53:27) to lose weight I was like worst case scenario don't afford food you lose some weight I was like whenn win now I did that with a good tone so she got a laugh out of it right and I was like but let's be real I was like have you ever bought anything in the past that you weren't sure you could afford I was like and where are you now you still survived you're not on the couch right I was like we always make it work in the end right and you have to you cut somewhere else I was like this is something that's going to last with you forever like you have all these clothes I was like you want to make all of them look better in 6 weeks
(1:53:52) I was like just lose 20 lbs what are you afraid of let's play it out best case worst case when you do that you can basically take away the emotion from the decision and say okay worst case scenario you're on your friend's couch and you know what you were poor before this and you were happy then too so worst case scenario is you're in the same position you've been in before and it was fine best case scenario you change your life forever so does that feel like a bet you're willing to take right and so if you if you just you want to confront it and then walk into
(1:54:20) what they're afraid of and just say let's play it out so this happens here this happens here best case worst case and I can tell you like I've probably closed more sales on best case worst case than any other close I have ask for the sale again and so this is a big one if you do not ask for the sale you will not get it that is a promise once you ask if you ask again you'll increase the likelihood that they buy now there's a right way to do this and a wrong way to do this if you just ask again when someone says no bad look
(1:54:49) if someone says no and you ask why and then you resolve the why then you ask again and that makes sense says hey I can't make Tuesdays and you say no worries if we're able to do it on Thursday would that work for you and they say yes they say awesome so you want to move forward you ask again right so all you're doing is resolving the concern there's terms in the industry called looping or you know uh obstacle overcomes whatever whatever wording you want to use is that you resolve the concern and you ask again and you can do this literally unlimited times as long
(1:55:19) as you resolve the concern and then you ask again I mean Lila will tell you that like if it was either a Sunday sale cuz I usually had way less calls on Sundays um or it was the last appointment of the day for me she just knew that I would always close that sale because I would just have unlimited time because I was like I will just keep going and so I ask again and again and again and I had um I had a partner back in the day I don't know if I like the visual but he's like he's like you're like a pit pull on someone's ankle he's like you just will not [ __ ] let them leave and I was like it's cuz I think I think that they
(1:55:50) need it they came in cuz they're trying to lose weight we sell weight loss what's the problem like we just have to figure it out and usually it's just like it's mounds of stuff you have to UNP of all these excuses of all the times that they've been unsuccessful in their lives it's like they came in because they want to solve the problem and when then they get confronted with the decision they get freaked out again because they reli this past traumas of the things they've tried and then feeling like a failure
(1:56:13) and then they associate that failure with you in the moment you're like hey Susan calm down we're just going to have you eat some [ __ ] chicken and walk a little bit it's going to be okay and so the best closers come from the frame of helping the Prospect and so I will tell you this right now the best salespeople care more about the prospect than they do so whoever cares the most about the prospect wins the sale and so if they care more about themselves then they will win now you're like well of course they're going to care more about themselves ah if you have more context than they do which you should because
(1:56:41) you know more about the product than they do you should be able to have the best perspective to say no I'm not going to let this guy's limiting beliefs get in the way cuz I really want to help him or really want to help her and I can see that today it feels safe to retreat back to not taking action on this huge pain that they have but I can see how this is going to play out cuz I've seen a hundred other people just like them walk out the door and I see them you know a year later and they're the exact same
(1:57:04) position or worse and I don't want that for them and so if you keep the human at the Forefront of your mind when you're making the sale you'll never come across pushy because you they can hear the intention they can hear the tonality in your voice about you actually just trying to help them so when you ask for the sale again having key stories and metaphors that you can use to break beliefs is what allows you to then ask again and you can do that literally unlimited times as long as they have time and you have time and you address
(1:57:33) the problem now if you don't address the problem and ask in they go annoy so you just want to make sure that you have an answer and you should have an answer because you've had this conversation before there's nothing they should be able to tell you that should surprise you if we zoom out we have a salesperson who has maximum hours maximum days they have as many time slots per day filled up with the best Prospect effect CU they work them well they have a plan before and after to come prepared to the call
(1:57:56) and take notes and follow up with them bam famam the whole thing and when they're on the call they're completely present they breathe the script they know how to handle obstacles they have they have analogies and stories and metaphors memorized so they can help people overcome their issues they stick to the script they don't add to the script they keep their word concision as tight as humanly possible so they can maximize the number of sales they have per day and maximize the conversion rate of those sales fundamentally sales by
(1:58:20) the way I should have defined this earlier is increasing the likely that the prospect buys that's all it is so everything that has to do with sales like if you had the perfect sales process it means you would account for every single variable that could ever happen to any human and you would get 100% of people who go through this process to buy that's what a perfect sales process would be and so it's a percentage conversion that's all it is and so with that we have maximum opportunities maximum percentage conversion we have an amazing sales rep but what if they can only do it for a day that gets into the third bucket
(1:58:50) which is what I would consider meta skills which is traits of the best salespeople the things that most sales people struggle with are trait issues meaning they are on and then they're off again they're on and they're off they get motivated they get demotivated motivated demotivated if you feel like this then it's a skilled deficiency you just don't know how to sustain performance for a long period of time and I promise you the difference between Champions and everyone else is they can sustain performance it's not like I don't know if sales is for me um I don't
(1:59:18) know if I'm growing enough in my dude here's the cleared deficiencies you can't stay consistent there's some growth that you can tackle right now being consistent another kind of meta skill around this is enthusiasm like they're enthusiastic one week they're not enthusiastic the next week being able to sustain and maintain a high level of enthusiasm for with the role and when you're on the call is a skill it's a skill you whistle while you work you got to learn how to do it you got to learn to like the stuff you don't love so you can do the thing you really love which is
(1:59:47) sales the best sales people kill for sport so let me tell you this a little analogy huh notice a little iies so I heard this from uh Mike Ary and I just love this he said there's three types of sales people there's dogs horses and tigers he like dogs you got to feed them and if you don't feed them they starve to death and you got to you got to give them all this attention you got to rub their belly every day and the moment you stop they die horses they will Gallop as long as you keep whipping them but the
(2:00:10) moment you stop Galloping they just go down to a trot he's like but Tigers he said a tiger can eat a full meal but then if a bunny walks across his line of vision we'll kill the bunny for sport he's like you want tigers and I love that little analogy because the best sales people that I've ever met in my life they love sales they love the thrill of the clothes of the hunt when I was selling weight loss I would sometimes have homeless people and things like that that would come in who would respond to my ads it would happen right I had two ways to take it I could
(2:00:40) try and not take it seriously try and just like basically just get through the sale so I could move on with my life or I could see it as free practice and what's crazy is the amount of times where I judge someone as poor and turned out that they just dress different I don't know anything about that was more times than I can count and a lot of them were like hey I appreciate you're just like you know Trea me well I was like of course I was like this is a business your money spends the same and so you either practice the skill or you close either way you win it's a lot like
(2:01:13) lifting weights where if you have your warm-up reps and they look different than your heavy reps you're actually not practicing at all so you're wasting all these opportunities that you could be practic practicing your skill sharpening the sword which is what we call it in the sales world you could be sharpening your sword but you're actually making it duller CU you're practicing the wrong way you're learning bad habits by not taking the sale seriously so the best sales people kill for sport and so I had
(2:01:38) uh I'll tell you a Jacob story which is my my young my young you know started with me at like 15 and now he's been with me however many years seven he started as a low man on the totem pole and so when we would have lesser qualified leads they handed all of them to Jacob he's like I'll be the garbage man he's like take anybody's leads he's like I just want to get good I just want to practice and so he's trying to take as many reps as he possibly could and guess what happened he started taking more reps than everyone else did and guess what happened after that he got
(2:02:02) better than other people did cuz he took more reps and he took every one of these as a [ __ ] gift which is what it is is that someone's going to give you the time to learn the skill of sales the business paid for that lead maybe it's less qualified they paid for it just the same and you have the benefit of learning the amount of people who want to learn how to sell better and are unwilling to take quote unqualified leads is ridiculous to me it's free practice with stakes and you still have the possibility of winning and closing a deal track data the best salespeople
(2:02:33) track data and so they're meticulous about the data they track and so let me explain this so you can judge and I've just seen this across my portfolio the skill of any person in any Endeavor that they practice by the quantity and quality of the metrics they track and so if someone says oh I'm good at sales i' be like cool tell me about the metrics you track now if if they're like ah just you know close rate it's like well there's so many other metrics that you could track to understand how good you
(2:02:58) are at sales because the close rate is really just an outcome it gives you no leading indicators it tells you nothing else right I want to know what percentage of leads you're booking I want to know what percentage of of scheduled things are showing I want to know of show rate what percentage are you offering of offer how many of you're closing how many how many what's your average call to close are you doing one call two call 1.2 like what's your what's your average number what's your average number of cash collected like
(2:03:21) there's so many other metrics that you can track to know how well you're doing as a salesperson and yes for everybody like shout this from the rooftops if you can get their schedule rate up by 20% it's just as good as getting their close rate up by 20% and so there's so many other things in the funnel that the best sales people know about closing about how to increase the total number of sales they get by controlling all of the other variables that are under their control now the bad guys the dogs are like I only want these times and I want
(2:03:50) them to be spoonfed to me and if I don't get them fed there and you don't pat me on the head I'm going to starve to death and die right that's what the dogs do and if you've got sales people like that they're dogs I don't care how many how much experience they have they're dogs right tigers are like I want to be available to kill whenever because I just love the hunt I would do this for free I'm just happy I get paid to do it pro tip if you are somebody who's running a sales team if you want to increase the close rates across the entire team even more give the best
(2:04:18) closers the best leads and the way you do that is that you have to start by scoring your leads first which means you actually have to track data so you can say these people have the highest likelihood of closing when they have these three characteristics they close at a way higher percentage and then you give those leads to the best guys so fundamentally you'd want the worst leads to go to the worst guy the best leads to go to the best guy and everyone in between and so by doing that you actually match the org and so I actually
(2:04:40) had a Salesman that I knew who was the top sales rep for a time share business and it's exactly what you think it was so it's a billion dollar plus company this guy was making 3 million a year in commission selling time shares and I had with him and I was like what do you do you know differently and he said well I won the sales competition and so I got one hour with the CEO and on that one hour with the CEO which is the prize for winning the sales competition it was 3,000 sales people it was number one he
(2:05:05) said I just said if you give me the best leads instead of wasting them on these guys who are new he's like I will make you so much money and so the guy experimented with his little Division and he 5x his income as the sales guy and then they took it and they rolled it out Nationwide and they 5X the business and so there's a huge opportunity in every business to give the best closers the best leads because you make more money and what happens is is that the best guys will actually make more and more and more money which then creates a survivorship bias for new guys coming in
(2:05:39) and so if you know that best guy used to make 200,000 a year as the top closer but now can make 800,000 a year the amount of sales people that you will attract your opportunity will 10x now even though the entry level guys now make less than they did before the opportunity just like the lottery the same reason people buy tickets is they assume that they're going to get there and so by having it this way you'll have people come in willing to make less because they know that if they if they perform well they'll go to the big leagues now the other benefit of this is
(2:06:09) that you train your new guys on the worst leads so you lose the least money as a business but they also develop their skills because they've got to learn how to Big borrowed steel and squeeze blood from the stones from the least qualified customers and so when they get to somebody who's got a 700 credit score and actually has intent to buy they're like oh my God this is amazing because they practiced on somebody who's like missing an arm and missing seven credit cards and they are in bankruptcy and they're actually in the middle of a divorce and the real name isn't Al it's actually Larry and
(2:06:39) you know it's complicated I'm a little liquid right now I'm between thing you know whatever right and they're closing those people for lunch money uh and so when you learn how to do that when you get to like qualified prospects you're like oh my God this amazing but at that point the business doesn't bear the cost the salesperson does so that they can develop their skills cuz just being real you're still paying them to learn and I'd rather pay as little as I can so I can allocate the resources the best
(2:07:05) way possible in the business my biggest pet peeve and the reverse of that is my favorite thing about the best salespeople is they never blame circumstances so whenever I have a salesperson is like the leads are bad or you know uh these These people aren't a good fit or just like whatever BS that they can come up with or like I don't like the commission structure we should change like just focus on the things you can control right and the guys that I love the most never complain they pick up the extra shifts they call the leads the most they work them the most they're
(2:07:38) like these leads are amazing I'm so grateful to have these and be able to practice and get paid to do it and there's a time and a place for giving feedback on stuff group calls not one of them if you are one of these salese you give it oneone with the manager say hey by the way I've noticed like some people get on the phone just objectively like their credit scores are just consistently lower than they were a couple months ago I don't know if we've changed anything on the marketing side I'm going to approach the leads the same
(2:08:02) I love The Practice just thought might be you know useful data for marketing right that's very different than like dude these leads are [ __ ] I'm I'm not taking these calls right that's just a primadonna and I hate that and so again the worse the leads the better you get the flex your skill and the best sales people take 100% of the control and the best marketers take 100% of the control too and so if everybody is taking absolute blame for every outcome guess what you win we doubled one of our portfolio company sales by tweaking several tiny things in the sales process and you can use all the same tactics in
(2:08:33) your business too enjoy three young Founders who are all sad because they were not making the amount of money that they wanted to make so before I show you the data let me explain what each of these terms actually mean so show rate is the percentage of people who have an appointment who show up for their appointment so in any business if if you deal with people you will have sessions or appointments you have a time slot that someone says they're going to show up right if it's a sales consult then they are a prospect and they're going to show up to get sold so if I have 100
(2:09:01) people have an appointment and 70 show up that would be a 70% show rate the second one here is offer rate which we forgot to put in the rate so let me just put that in for you there you go offer rate which is the percentage of people that we actually make an offer to you might be like well why would I not offer everybody well not everyone's qualified and so for example if I work with only gym owners and somebody comes on it's like Oh I'm a personal trainer well you shouldn't be here we had all these other things that said don't be here but you
(2:09:24) still came why are you here that means that you don't offer them anything and that's it now if 100% of people who showed up show right you are able to offer to then that means that your offer rate would be 100% And that is an indicator of the quality of the lead flow that you have the third is close rate this depends on how you can track this all right so you can either do it based on percentage of people who show or you can do it on percentage of people who are offered what I normally do is I'll just track both I'm going to guess that this one is off of offer rate because it's what we have here it's good
(2:09:49) to have both stats here because let's say a Sal man wants to artificially increase his close rate well then he will just say well I'm not going to offer anyone unless I know they're going to say yes and so then their close rate is high and then they'll show that there's a really low quality score but if that salesman this is why having team stats is so important and individually is because if the team is all saying that they're offer rate 70 and one guy saying his offer rate's 30 but he has 100% close rate and they all have 30% close rates we know where the data went
(2:10:13) and this is why having high quality data allows you to see what the problems are if I didn't have this percentage then I wouldn't know it's because we have low quality leads or because my salesman suck this data allows me to identify the problem and then fix it so the fourth set here is percentage of cash collected up front meaning if we're selling $1,000 widgets and the average cash we collect today is $500 because people do payment plans then we would know our cash collected percentage would be 50% if I have a low close rate but High cash collected percentage that would tell me
(2:10:41) a different story than a really high close rate and really low cash collected percentage i' be like oh so they're just getting anyone to say yes and taking $10 down if they can versus somebody saying we have a hard line and so it's really trying to find the magic between these two and saying how can I get as many people to say yes and get as much cash collected up front the final one here is just unit sold and this is really just the output of these four well if we multiply these things together how many do we end up closing and that's the
(2:11:03) result so beforehand damn we had a 49% show rate so let's say we have 100 appointments now we have 49 who actually show up for their appointment and then of the 49 we're able to offer 83% of them beforehand so 80% of that is 40 40 people now are getting offered out of our original 100 appointments of the people who get offered 27% of them which is 10 people roughly are actually buying in that closing percentage and then our cash collected from those 10 people is we're getting a little less than half of
(2:11:34) the cash that we closed down now I gave you 100 as a number but the actual number of units sold for this business in the prior month was 56 units all right so this is current state if you don't know these numbers in your business you should so that you can improve them let's say I invested in your business today the first thing we want to do is get the data so that so we can see what Baseline is so we can see where the discrepancies are and where we think the biggest opportunities for improvement are and you're going to have to wait till the end of the video I'm going to show you what happened after so let's start with problem number one or
(2:12:02) opportunity for improvement number one we had a low show rate as in based on our benchmarks of 70% for any kind of appointment type business we think that we should have at least 70 there Allen which was a company that I had all we did was show rates we were doing 4,000 appointments a day we experimented we had a machine learning team to think like what was the number of communications that we had to have with a prospect what was the delay between responses that got the most people what were the total number of exchanges how far apart were the exchanges there is lots of data that we were able to collect so their number was 49% of
(2:12:32) appointments were showing up what we wanted them to be at was 70% this is our Benchmark where we'd say okay this isn't a problem anymore now do we want to improve things absolutely but where are we going to allocate our effort at the constraint this was a constraint now to give context here this Delta is a 40% difference 40% is a lot think about the S&P 500 they're like we trying grow 9% a year it's like boom I unlock that I get 40% growth I don't have to do anything else for like 4 years in the S&P big wins that's what we look for lots of things can affect show rate by the way
(2:13:00) the number one one that affects show rate is number of total time I sa available take that to the bank but one of the other ones is the targeting and the offer itself so targeting is who's actually seeing this promotion if I'm targeting teeny boppers for example I might get people to schedule but then realize that they're not here for a laser hair removal appointment so the targeting there would be off and and so that would affect our show rate and that has nothing to do with our lead nurture sequence or our salesman or anything
(2:13:26) like that it's just the wrong people were seeing it so that was issue number one for context for us just imagine that's underneath it was 25 to 35y olds who were gainfully employed and love their job and this when we came in to look at it was actually targeting 18 to 24y olds the reason that this was far off for us is that the ad objective now I'm going to get a little bit tactical with you ad acis.
(2:13:50) com at hold Co we have media buyers we have Pros who do this for a living and so when they zoomed in on how their Med a buyer was optimizing the traffic they were optimizing against what a lot of people would initially think they should do which is optimizing for the lowest cost leads and the lowest cost appointments what we had to do we switch to optimize around cost per sale if we can optimize around who we actually sell to we will shift where the sales come from and just to give you how big of a problem this was they had to cancel 75% of their appointments before the 49% show rate the sales guys are spending most of their time just looking at their appointment looking up the person cancelling to get their 49% show
(2:14:18) rate and that's about the closest thing to literally burning money so second big problem was multitasking and this really goes for any role but especially like sales-driven roles they had a setting team and a closing team and the Setters were both trying to call leads to get appointments and then also nurturing and doing the follow-up to remind them of the appointment and it's similar as that may sound in your mind it's two completely different activities you're banging phones calling people up you're
(2:14:41) in that flow and then you're like oh wait Sarah has an appointment today let me go REM mind Sarah does Sarah going to interrup it and you're like wait I'm calling and then you start like and it's you go back and forth right so they had three big issues number number one is that they weren't double dialing right which is one of the most common things that you can do by the way if you're doing phone calls because a lot of initial screens will stop the first call but if you dial twice you'll get through number two is that the time to contact
(2:15:04) was too slow so lead would come in and they would just like sit there for 30 minutes 60 minutes an hour 2 hours 3 hours right and they weren't getting contacted it's like what did this person do they're like oh I'd like to find out more information nothing and the third thing is that they didn't have the right times to set appointments and they weren't nurturing correctly so we go same day next day I'm just giving you some secrets and they didn't have morning of nurture meaning if you have an appointment today and you booked this
(2:15:28) appointment 3 days ago if I don't remind you that day that you have an appointment the likely that you show is lower and so these are the problems that they have no double dial slow speed to contact and they didn't have any mning of nurture but wait there's more the second problem they had or opportunity for improvement was that they had a low close rate and this is based on our Benchmark I would normally give you a kpi but it has so many different variables in terms of what percentage Clos rate is cuz if you're selling in person for example for a low ticket thing you might be able to sell 80% plus
(2:15:57) of people walking the door on the flip side if you're selling an investment opportunity over the phone on you know a first or second contact you might sell 5% but for this particular type of sale that they had which was a two call close for like I would say a mid-priced consumer service in my opinion they should have been about 40% so 40% is what I wanted them to be at and then current was 27% so this is where they were this is where we wanted them to be and again for context here this is about a 50% Improvement so problem number one is that they had service level Discovery if you're not familiar with that terminology in a sales script there's
(2:16:28) different kind of phases that you go through in a conversation and the opening part is often a little bit of Rapport and then right after that you get into Discovery and Discovery is where you're discovering what the problems that the person's going through you're trying to understand why they are where they are why they're on the phone with you why they decided to take time out of their day why this problem's important to them what they've tried in the past etc etc right this is the Discovery this gives you all the ammunition that you're going to use at the end of the sale to close it so the
(2:16:53) way that they were doing was simply saying how much money do you want to make just asking the one question which is the big obvious question it's surface level but the big thing that you always want to ask when you're selling is intention why do they want this like what changes as a result of this how will your life look different what can you not do now that you would be able to do as a result of this change who else in that in your life would that affect why does that matter to you right and so these are all why questions and it's to to dig up their intentions because if
(2:17:18) you can understand why someone's there it's much easier to get them to agree to getting them there right but if you don't know that someone's trying to let's say replace their income versus quit their job versus just have side hustle money those are very different intentions if I want to talk to side hustle money I'm probably not going to be like this is going to take a ton of time on the flip side if someone's like I hate my job I just want to do something that's not this then I might talk about what the day-to-day looks like in this scenario and ask them if that sounds better to them so if you think about sales process
(2:17:51) what they were doing is they were asking questions that were here surface level but this is where all the meat is and that's where all the money is is the questions that are below the surface is understanding why someone's even doing this to begin with look at that Iceberg killer Iceberg and so the second issue is that they had a lot of objections coming up on the call I'll say objections but I also mean obstacles for those of you who are sales sales senses objections happen after you talk about the number obstacles happen before you talk about the number if you come on the phone and I say hey why are you here and you're like I just want to find out more
(2:18:21) information that's actually an obstacle like you already have to confront that cuz like no you're not hopping on phone calls all day trying to find information what problem you trying to solve and then they're like well and then you get into it right but if you don't address that up front it'll blow up on you in the cloes so objections and obstacles is what they were encountering a lot of and part of that is because they Discovery was wrong right they were talking to service levels so then lots of [ __ ] was
(2:18:40) blowing up on them in the close common objections that happen after you present price is uh this is too much I need to think about it I have to talk to my spouse I'm not sure if this is for me I'd like to get more data can you send me a brochure like these are all just the make believe things that people will say in order to not buy from you interestingly a lot of times if you stay in the surface level they'll even give you what we call Smoke screens but basically like they'll just come up with uh a reason that they're not going to do
(2:19:03) it and it's not even the reason they just throw a smoke bomb up and they're like I don't like English you know walk away right has nothing to do with it they just want to get off the phone so those are the two issues that we had on the sales and that was getting us to this 27% close rate and what this looks like is lots of argumentation and like hard closing and it's because the S isn't positioned properly and they were basically talking at people and not listening if the salesperson is talking more than the prospect in your sales like these are likely issues that are
(2:19:32) coming up I'm going to give you two examples real quick to show you how important delivery of a messages so if I say I have to think about it and I say oh like what are your main concerns or what are the main like what are the main variables that you're considering you're not thinking wow this guy's a douchebag I sound like I just genuinely want to know I call it childlike curiosity I always cue it by tilted my head I'm like huh what are the main things and I would increase my voice at the end there an
(2:19:55) improperly trained salesp person might be like well what are the main concerns you have and all of a sudden that sounds like a very different thing so they're saying the script but they're not but the prospect isn't hearing the same message and these are little details that actually can make a huge difference in ultimately how you close there's a lot of things in tone but I'll just say one is how you raise or lower your voice and the second is where you choose to emphasize if I say I didn't say he hit his wife if I say like that I have
(2:20:17) neutral Tone If I say I didn't say he hit his wife then it's like I'm not saying that I didn't say he hit his wife is now saying that like those weren't my words I didn't say he hit his wife he's the one to question I didn't say he hit his wife means like he might have done something else but he did something to his wife I didn't say he hit his wife it could have been somebody else's I didn't say he hit his wife it might have been his kid right and so it's the same sentence but simply emphasizing different parts of it communicate
(2:20:42) different things and so the tone and emphasis create a altogether package of how we communicate and for them their tonality was way off as a team because they were missing the first five minutes of discovering and setting the frame properly and so I'll give you the last set of problems opportunities for improvement and then we'll dive into what we did to solve them and what happened sales problem three opportunity for improvement people in orc structure issues so issue number one is that CEO was the sales manager and that was
(2:21:10) because he was the best closer he had a significantly higher close rate than the rest of the team but he wasn't a very good sales manager even though he was a good Closer by the way that's one of the main issues that a lot of sales teams have they promote their best closer as a sales manager and often times those are two very different skills and we could see this because the churn on their sales team was through the roof just to be clear like they were a group of young Founders it's not uncommon it's actually probably very common because usually
(2:21:35) when you start a business learning how to promote and sell the product is usually the job of the founders like how do I get people to want to buy the thing and so they end up getting the most reps early on and also understanding the prospect better than just about anyone and so one of the big things you guys were in a little mini sales last I is that companies will over educate on the product and under educate on the prospect the person that you should be educating your sales stuff on is who we're talking to more than what we're selling cuz for me if I know someone
(2:22:00) deep in their core what their intentions are I can tell them anything I know someone inside and out and then someone says sell this thing and I know nothing about it I could probably get them to buy on the flip side I know everything about this thing and I don't know who I'm talking to talking to a child a man a woman old young different language and so a lot of people talk like hey sell me this pen when in reality what we want to do is like talk to John the majority of good sales trainers who try to do that
(2:22:23) gimmick what they want the person to do is ask them a question it actually has nothing to do with the pen and so if they say sell me this pen what you do is you take the pen and you put it in your pocket and you say how's it going what brought you in today right cuz I got to go from where they're at to wanting a pen I'm not going to just be like hey buy this pen give me money like it doesn't work that way but bad salesmen do so the second issue was the setting team expectations one of the benefits of working with someone who has more experience is that we know what the
(2:22:48) Benchmark should be and so a lot of times we can reset some 's minimum standard and they're like well they're setting two a day and we're like they should all be minimum setting three and that sounds tiny but again 2 to three is a 50% increase in sets and that's across a whole team so that means a lot of productivity but if you set the bar low people just naturally shrink down to that level all right so you understand the problems and here is the data this is before they had a low show rate issue they had low close rate and multiple issues around that and they had people in organizational issues I want you to pause real quick in the video in the
(2:23:17) comments to be like what would you do how would you attack these issue if this was your business and then I'll tell you what we did now there's two elements of solutions element one is what would you do to attempt to solve the problem and the second is which one do we do in what order the third problem that was actually the first thing we decided to fix was so we hired a sales director the reason for that was because the CEO was overly involved he was micromanaging he wasn't a good manager and he also wasn't doing CEO stuff and so we had to hire an
(2:23:45) experienced sales director who in this instance had been a sales trainer for a similar type of sale in a consumer good this guy ended up being exceptional and being able to implement the rest of the changes that we outlined so this was in terms of order of importance I think if we hadn't done this and had tried to do the rest of them it would have fallen flat this is like one of the most common errors that business owners and Founders make is that they see the what and not the who or they focus on the how and not
(2:24:09) The Who and if you have the same problem that has recurred multiple quarters in a row in the same Department underneath of the same who it might not be a what issue it might be a who issue one of the reasons having experience is he is because you know what it looks like when it's right some of the biggest costs in the business are hiring incorrectly you waste the time trying to find them you waste the time onboarding them and training them and then you waste the time of all the time it takes you to figure out that they're not the
(2:24:32) right fit and all the loss growth that you would have had to then start that process over again that's tough but a lot of businesses have to deal with that which is why picking Personnel is so important with this instance we looked at culture fit which is like do we think that this guy will fit in which we usually the founders pick that part out like hey does this guy fit in cool and then we're going to hardcore drill on usually experience and tactical knowledge and so we have subject matter experts at holdco media buying cro
(2:24:56) experts sales experts Finance expert whatever and we will then do tactical interviews we talked about earlier you can know that someone is good based on the quality and quantity of the data that they collect I would ask somebody what data do you plan on collecting and how would you plan on fixing those things based on how vague they are and how high level they go in terms of their Solutions it'll tell you how nuan they can be in their thinking and ultimately executing Solutions sales directors specifically in my experience when I have guys who are like I just want to build up people I want to give these
(2:25:24) guys skills and they marry that with like and these are the metrics that I track to know X Y and Z that's a good sales director the next thing we decided to solve boom was fixing the ad targeting and the reason we did the sales director first was because we're like well how do we know if anything else is going to happen afterwards if we fix this so what we ended up doing here it turns out is that we also had another Personnel issue the media buyer was asleep at the wheel they were optimizing around the wrong stuff they were trying to split their attention and start their
(2:25:49) own side hustle it was clear that they were negligent they actually were doing the right thing and then they stopped doing the right thing and it was clear that that type of behavior the founders felt was not going to correct itself so they let go of that person hired a new person and boom fixed the ad targeting problem we were back to 25 to 35y old people who love their job what did we fix next boom We reduced the sales team what and we reset expectations for the setting team what we looked at is sales team utilization if we know that guys can take 10 sales a day and they're actually only taking four then we have
(2:26:17) too many sales people in this instance it gives you an opportunity to to cut the fat for lack of better term and reward the people who are actually doing their jobs and closing well if you cut the lowest percentage of the team and you have utilization like you have space you lose the lowest closing percentage people and you gain more closes just by Shifting the closing rate overall of the team when you make those changes in my experience sales people get into a rhythm if you don't take enough sales calls you're too desperate to close the deal and then you start being too hard
(2:26:47) and not listening enough cuz it's about you not them when sales people have more and more consults they sell from the back of their heel they're open-minded they're asking questions they're feeling good and they get in a rhythm the setting team we both downsized and increased expectations how did all these sales increase by having fewer people we had better people that's how and that also helps recreate the culture of the team so that we can have a new standard set of high performers because there's
(2:27:10) nothing that demotivates a high performer like a low performer who's still on the team and so we went from two to four in terms of our expectation per day for the team in terms of sets sales fix numero qu I'm messing all my columns up now just going to have to deal with it we promoted one Setter to lead nurture specialist I was saying earlier that they were multitasking right so they're doing some setting and they're doing some lead nurture and that gets really hard for a team of six guys to split those things we took one of the
(2:27:34) Setters who was really good and made that person the lead nurture specialist who basically acted as the bridge for both the setting team and the closing team to basically coordinate and remind the people of their appointments and we equipped that lead nurture specialist with one of our checklists for what that role needs to do to get the most people to show up and I'm not going to give you all because of the long checklist I'll give you two quick examples one of them is doing a three-way intro once you have the set appointment between the setter
(2:27:57) and the closer and doing it via iPhone if you can because now you have a known person and an unknown person and a person that Bridges the two they might know show on Johnny over here but not on the guy that they just spoke with and so the idea is how can I bridge that Gap and kind of make the association for them add some trust the other thing is that the closers mning of would remind them with either a voice memo or a video text personalized to them being like hey John really excited for our apointment
(2:28:21) today I saw your profile XYZ personalized to you really pumped for you I think we might help you out so that's just a couple of the things that we have on that list that we had them Implement and all do consistently and sales team fix number five boom is we optimize the sales scripts I said earlier that the discovery was to surface level so we rescripted the discovery made sure we were asking deeper more meaningful questions and a part of that is also bringing some of the objections to the front it's much
(2:28:44) easier and this is the this is the terminology that our team uses which is killing zombies right it's a lot easier to kill a zombies when it's far away than when it's on top of you if somebody's trying to bring up a zombie in the clothes another way of saying it is like you want to diffuse the bomb before it goes off in the clothes in your face so we solve the problem before we bring it up now this is actually something that we added to this part of the script which is prior to the appointment we say hey is there anyone else who'd be required to make a
(2:29:07) decision about this thing if they say yes then you say cool well let's push back the appointment and let's get that person on that way you have all the decision makers present so these are just little things but like little 1% improvements over and over over again is what yield these 50% boosts and the third main change we did was that we drilled the team on looping and looping is just a sales terminology for basically when you encounter an objection handling the objection and then asking again handle the objection ask again right because a lot of sales people are afraid to ask if someone says
(2:29:38) no and they don't want to ask again right and I can tell you this is that the number of sales you make is direct proportional to how many times you ask there's ways to do it wrong and there's ways to do it right the idea is that you should be able to resolve the concern right so if someone says I need to think about it and you say well what are you your main concerns and they say well it seems really complicated you say oh what part specifically feels more complicated they're like it's the whole Tech thing and we're like oh we also have a vendor that can actually fill that in I think
(2:30:00) it's a couple bucks extra but like we can just handle that for you does that solve the problem and they're like oh okay so you guys you guys will just handed that one part of it like yeah we'll handed that part of it for you cool now this is where the salesman says great you want to move forward you have your idea on you hey what C you like you can just make the ask right after that and so then at that point you might say ready to move forward then and they might say this feels like a fast decision it's like oh well what makes it fast how long you been thinking about
(2:30:24) this they're like well I mean I just met you and you say well how long have you wanted to solve this problem and then they would say well I mean a long time it's like well that doesn't sound like a fast decision at all it sounds like you've already made the decision a long time ago that you wanted to change now we're just acting on it so now do you want to move forward right keep looping and continuing to resolve the concern ask again resolve the concern ask again drum roll please what happened in the real world so let's go to the data all right so in
(2:30:48) our first column we had 49% show rates after we implemented sales fix 2 fixing the ad targeting sales Fix 4 promoted one lead Setter to lead nurture specialist and sales fix 3 reduced the team size and reset expectations survey says we had a 70% boost which is almost exactly the kpi and that's because when you do things that work they work so that was a 40% Improvement in sales and to be clear this was just over 2 months all right so some of these changes going to happen real quick if you know what you're doing the second change we have is our offer rate and so here's what
(2:31:19) happened so survey says 80% we actually offered just about the same amount of people realistically what they were doing is offering people who weren't qualified cuz the sales team wanted to eat I get that like there's a human component here they were offering people were not qualified the deal cuz they needed commissions right which is what we were trying to fix with the targeting close rates we went from 27% and 60 days later we were at 41% so 1% above our Benchmark all right this is a 50% Improvement in sales so 40 and 50 Kazam next up we have
(2:31:48) percentage of cash collected a really good metric for knowing how strong the sales team in is and this is especially important for that early Discovery portion and how good they are at looping and closing because the deeper you get the discovery the the more convicted the buyer will be about the solution and the more likely they are to pay up FR as a measure of their conviction in the solution the survey says we went from 47 to 82% so we almost doubled the amount of cash that we were collecting up front per sale in 60 days we had a 40%
(2:32:19) Improvement and we had a 50% Improv and we had a almost doubling of cash collected so if we almost doubled the amount of sales that happened and we almost doubled the cash upfront collected what did we do to the cash FL the business Forex ah much more enticing after we added all these four changes together and we waited 60 days what happened survey says we went from 56 to 93 sales a month and that was just from a few of these fixes on one particular part of the organization I taught 116 sales Prof professionals my closing
(2:32:51) framework and after implementing it they increased how much they closed enjoy um Alex Becker who's the who's the founder of that uh clued me in recently to something he's like dude your your your rowes is insane because he can see everyone's revenue and their ad Spin and I was like what do you mean he's like you have the highest return on ad spend of everyone in the entire platform by like a mile and I didn't really ever think about it but our lifetime return on Advertising is 36 to1 so to do over you know hund now you
(2:33:23) know five or 10 million whatever we're at now um we've spent just under $3 million in advertising and so there's a lot of other pieces to you know making more but just for everyone on this call we're talking specifically about sales correct yeah so so Alex yeah yeah 99% of these guys are are closers and they're getting closing positions a couple people are sorting like a closer agency where they partner up with a guy like you and they're like hey let's do like a little JB deal I slam your deals okay sweet well then why
(2:33:57) don't I so what I'm going to do is because I do have a presentation um which is just how I think about sales um and I have the the third part of the presentation about scaling sales teams does anyone here have multiple closers who work for them or is is most people just closing on your own right now you guys got to talk with Alex he don't bite I also can't see I can't see the chat I can't see the chat we're working towards that Alex okay so how about this I'll give you the things that so um Russell when I
(2:34:29) first met him was like dude how did you learn how to sell so well and it was because I looked at my CRM and I'd done 4,000 sales one-on-one uh in Fitness and so that's a lot of reps you know I was taking 20 consults a day for like four years and so that's in person face to face my team would double or triple book me every 30 minutes and I just sold the same thing over and over again and because I was really good at sales I ended up not hiring a ton of salese and I would actually have my manager set appointments for me all at one location
(2:35:00) so I had six gyms and so I would go there they'd stack up an entire day I'd mow down a whole day go to a different gym and they'd been stacking all the appointments and I'd mow down and so usually I do 20 to 25 consults a day and you just get you you know you just get these reps in of reading people gauging tonality and seeing where you need to lean in and where you need to lean back and so um you know over time I've then started training sales people and sales managers I had a remote sales team we F we'd fly out and do turnarounds um like in person so I had eight guys we'd fly
(2:35:30) out to eight facilities every month and we turn these facilities around because I know Mike you were in the Fitness World before this um that's right and then I brought that sales team in-house and they started doing phone sales for high ticket so I've had um I've had in-person phone High ticket low ticket we've kind of done a lot of those things I trained mortgage leads teams um so kind of the whole Gambit and there's definitely some things that I've seen you know I've bought every sales product on the market I bought Grant stuff bought bord stuff um and I think there's
(2:35:57) a lot of Merit and there's a lot of good stuff out there but in my experience uh Simplicity is what scales and so I'll give you if you're okay with it I'll give you the few things that I have implemented consistently within my companies that have generated outsize returns is that cool all right awesome what I'm Gonna Roll let get all right full Jam so as I said Simplicity right I'm a the world's best graphic designer uh as you can see here so I'm trying to uh show the the real Keys of the Kingdom so everybody here everybody here selling expensive stuff is that most people on this call yes everything's High Alex
(2:36:40) fantastic all right everyone still see me and the screen yep all right Rock and Roll All right so I'm guessing this guys isn't your first rodeo um not your first presentation with the sexy headliner big promise and so if you have failed for you guys to uh grow your thing in the past I promise you it's not your fault lots of information very confusing um and you can sometimes be inundated with lots of different sales people's information you've got Mike here who's a who's a gem and knows his [ __ ] and you guys are lucky to have him um but in hopefully in this presentation I will
(2:37:11) put some of those fears to rest of like what if I'm never what if I never make it what if I never turn this corner um and become the salesp person I want what if I never hit the 100 100 Grand a year what if I never hit the 100 Grand a month or whatever don't hit the million a month goal that I have and then what does that what does that mean about me right if you've ever thought those things um like I can tell you I did two um right after the instance that I had uh mic with that individual um and that individual drained my entire bank
(2:37:34) account and then sent it to their girlfriend in Sweden and then filed bankruptcy after that happened I had $1,200 because I had sold all my gyms and put my money into that account so I started at zero which I'm very grateful for because it gave me the experience that I have now and so what I'm going to show you is that you can have a simple sales process that can yield outsid returns a lot of people like to make this fancy because it makes it easier to sell stuff to people about selling but these are the things that I have seen that have unlocked the growth for us because I don't think I'm the best marketer out there I think we've simply
(2:38:04) attached a phone to a funnel um and we've been very efficient at it and so as a result of that I've always been able to make more per customer than anyone else because of how efficient we are at the conversion process all right and so that's what we're here for so I want to show you exactly step by step our process for selling all right and so there should be two types of people here some of you guys who are under $100,000 a month and I'll show you how to never compete on price again all right and if
(2:38:28) you guys are over $100,000 a month I'll show you exactly what we did to scale a team to get to a million a month and Beyond is that cool yes because if you're under a 100 it's just you right if you're over a 100 you need people all right so it's GNA kind of be like the actual sing itself and then the scaling of the sales all right so that's kind of the goal for the 60 minutes I'll probably be able to get it done in 40ish I'll talk fast so we can have some time all right everyone can just listen fast
(2:38:50) is that all right all right I'm it so I've been really fortunate um yeah now we're at 105 or 110 or whatever it is um in in selling stuff which has been cool what's been coolers we've been able to donate to causes you guys don't know my story but um I had a I had a gym teacher after school who stayed with me he didn't have to he didn't know me from anybody and he worked out with me for an entire year and taught me how to work out because I was like a really insecure kid and as a result of that I got into fitness and so I feel like it's all of our opportunity because you guys are on
(2:39:20) here like we're already in the top 1% in the world you know what I mean like we're bitching about not making a 100 Grand a month like [ __ ] you you know what I mean like really and so um it's been a great privilege to be able to give back you we've donated 1.4 million just in the last three years actually 1.
(2:39:38) 7 now I have to update that um but anyways just the causes that we that we care about and so for us it's it's kids being able to have the opportunity that we had all right and uh if you guys are in the fitness industry Arnold was my hero is the reason I quit my job um and I've been able to you know grow a friendship with him which is been awesome um and we've had you know over a thousand clients hit $100,000 a year using the sales framework I'm going to show you all right so like you can imagine that these people are not maybe as good as you are you can imagine that somebody in that thousand is probably not as naturally talented right so the
(2:40:06) process works okay and we've got a lot of people over seven figures now um but it wasn't that way right so this is me when I started my first gym I slept on the floor I had $5,000 total my rent was $5,000 um and so I had one month that I had to learn how to make money and uh I built a funnel because I learned this from the internet and I was actually I sent this picture to my dad because I was so excited I was so proud of this picture because I sold that many people in the first in the first two weeks uh for free um and things started to grow right
(2:40:36) I my that was my one of my gyms I had nine employees I felt like a badass you know my dad finally told me he thought I you know wasn't a schmuck for you know being an idiot and getting into fitness so I thought I felt like I was figuring things out and then all of a sudden Facebook slap happened this is years ago and there's been many slaps Facebook just kind of kind of has its it its [ __ ] hand proverbially swinging back and forth but um you know we got slapped and overnight my my lead cost went up 5x right and so my my money my moneymaking
(2:41:01) rain turned into a desert and the thing was my marketing was losing money every day and all I could think about was letting my dad down and more realistically having my dad be right I'm gonna I'm gonna all right cool um and so the question that I asked myself was like how can I afford to get more leads right and so I called on my friends up and he had a he was a brick and mortar gym owner and he told me that things were going great for him and I was like what the hell dude what are you what are you doing he was like dude we just we
(2:41:25) just attached the phone to the funnel and I was like no [ __ ] he's like we're selling expensive stuff on the front end now instead of selling trials I was like well that's cool I'll do that and so we went from losing two and a half two to one to making 10 to one return on the front end right and what that meant for my business is I went from being able to break even at $10 a lead to being able to spend up A1 $100 a lead and still make money which is crazy right and so then things started to grow again for me and then we you know open location after
(2:41:50) location and things grow and I met this guy and uh I was I was I met I joined his Mastermind I was trying to I told him I wanted to create a nationwide gym gym chain and he said uh you should teach other people how you do what you do and not grow that chain and I was like well you make more money than me so okay I'll listen and so then I started making uh our doing our Marketing System Mike this is by the way at that guy's gym um did 191 signups in 19 days and that was the stack of contracts um some
(2:42:16) of you guys may have seen this it was like the most run ad for like a year and a half um but we did I know $100,000 in in 19 days in sales like in the ghetto all right so these are the three Frameworks sorry I sped through that because we already covered a little bit of my story early so I wanted to get through it um and these are the free Frameworks that I kind of discovered um to scale High ticket all right and it'll take if you if you're if you're partnering some with someone then it'll help take their losing funnels and turn them into into cash machines and I mean that genuinely
(2:42:42) all right so the free three Frameworks that I do is one is the closure framework all right these are the questions that get prospects to say yes all right and so adding this to any kind of any funnel process is going to instantly make it more profitable all right and I'm going to walk through the questions that we ask and specifically what only three things that you can say on a sales call period it's the number one mistake that all the sales guys that even my guys make and I have to remind them up all right the second thing is the conviction framework so anyone who believes can outperform a seasoned sales
(2:43:08) rep by simply learning control their tone all right so some of you guys right now can I get a hand um I'm gonna unshare my screen real quick can I get hands on the screen of who here is newer to this newer to high ticket sales okay great great perfect then this is for you I'm going to show you how you can beat the best sales reps all right and this is how I never ever hire seasoned closers just FYI no no mik we're goodna TR trading salese I don't um but I'm gonna show you how you can beat seasoned prep seasoned Pros all right which if I can find my
(2:43:41) presentation there we go um by learning control your tone and the last one is scaling so for all you guys who are over $100,000 a month and need to scale a team I'm going to show you how to duplicate the skill in other people all right because it's one level of the skill is learning to sell another level of the skill is teaching to sell and it's a more valuable skill so if you can duplicate your skill in someone else that is how you can make 10 times 100 times more money because it's no longer you're no longer constrained by your time all right so let's rock and roll
(2:44:10) close your framework so after pouring over like hundreds of scripts like I mean it hundreds of scripts um I realized that there was always like these minor in wording but if I hit these kind of main Milestones along the way I ended up closing the sale right and the nice thing is that this process works for B Toc and B2B so I don't know what stuff you're selling but it works for both and it worked for $500 tickets as much as $100,000 tickets the process is the same right and the way I teach my sales teams and now thousands of clients is This Acronym right and like even when
(2:44:41) I'm thinking through sales calls we use we like closer C right l so the C is clarify why the person is on the phone with you right that's the the objective why are you here why' you take the time to take the call what's the problem right what are we trying to solve here after that then we're like got it so what I'm hearing is you're struggling with this does that sound about right I'm going to label you with a problem after that we overview their past pain it's like okay so you have this problem I can't be the first person you've talked to about this tell me a little bit about what you've done so far to try to try and get past this right tell me
(2:45:14) more about that how'd that work out for you okay understood after that it's like okay so hearing all these things this is why you're here this is what you're trying to get this is what you've tried and hasn't worked okay well can I tell you about how I think we might be able to solve your problem this is where we sell the vacation right and then finally or step before finally we explain away their concerned so this is where we tell them about the program and then we're like do you want to do it they say yes
(2:45:38) or no if they say no then we explain away their concerns so they say yes and then once they say yes we reinforce the decision and this last R here is a point that I added years later because we realize that the sale the sale just continues throughout the entire customer relationship right and so for you guys if you're dealing with clients uh who you're selling for you have to also sell them on continuously selling right you might have closed the card or closed the first payment but they're onboarding experience they got to close them again
(2:46:07) and then after that when they have their first week check-in call they got to get closed again because we have to consistently sell them on why they should do anything why should they not just watch Netflix why should they why should they take action why should they have the discomfort of getting you know smacked on the phone by a stranger right why should they why should they feel the The Sting of failure we have to sell them consistently to help them overcome their pains right and so I'll show you each some of these more closely so
(2:46:30) clarifying why they're there right it's like what made you come in today what made you reach out what's your goal right now why is that important to you right okay helping me understand what what you what are we doing here right this is one where someone in the beginning like you have to hit this because if someone says like you I just wanted to find out more information you're like cool but why like what did you want the information to solve what was the like I'm sure you don't just go around collecting information all day right like there's something you're
(2:46:53) trying to get out of this what's the problem and then and then you get what you need you're like got it okay so just so I'm hearing you right it sounds like this is your goal correct then they acknowledge they have a problem this is important because they have to say it they have to own it I can't cure cancer until you admit that you have it right we got to give it to you before we can cure it after that we overview the past right so it's like what have you tried so far to accomplish this how long did
(2:47:17) you do it for how long long ago how did that work for you what else have you tried we call this the pain cycle right we consistently do this over and over again until we've exhausted all options right at that point we have tons of ammo that we can use later in the clo which I'm sure you're aware of right and the big piece here is we explain how it's not their fault because if they had this missing piece or two of the equation they were halfway there they were three4 the way there they were just missing
(2:47:41) this one piece which we're going to provide for them right and the nice thing is is for most of you hopefully you're selling a a holistic solution right so for example I'm G to use a fitness example because Mike's from from that background too if someone came in and said they tried workouts in the past I'm be like I'm not telling you don't that you don't need to workout it's great but you also need the nutrition and the accountability right you need nutrition to make sure they stop eating [ __ ] because if you just start working out eating Donuts it's not going to work right of course now if I make you the best plan in the world but you don't
(2:48:06) follow it's not going to work either that's why you need the accountability and that's what I'm here for and so from that point that's kind of how you can naturally transition so it's like I'm hearing these things this is what you're missing well do you want to hear how the program works because I think we might be able to solve that for you they'll say yes all so what we've seen is that there's three things that make clients successful right and at this point this is my belief is that three things has been you know unequivocal and most pitches is that I think it's human brain
(2:48:29) is that you can't take more than three but typically it's like three pillars to the to the stool or three you know finish and accountability if I was selling leads I'd want them to be you know timely uh you know qualified and you know uh exclusive right there'll be three elements to make what makes a good lead right there's there's always three that you can usually find when you're selling a solution and most times not most times every time if you're on the phone with the prospect you always have the upper hand because they have admitted at the beginning of this phone call that they have a problem they have
(2:49:02) not solved it and so inherently they're going to be missing one of the keys they cannot have them all or they would not be on the phone so you have a you you you are in in an unlosable situation unless you choose to lose it right unless you choose to lose the frame and so in this instance it has been my experience that we use stories short short anecdotal stories to to to break the belief of the prospect around a topic what's important here is that we don't get into uh jargon right we don't get into technobabble and talking about the program and the modules and the the
(2:49:35) things they're going to do because all of that sounds like work and that's not what they're there for they're there for a result right and so instead I would say something like with the Fitness Nutrition accountability like I said earlier so if I was trying to explain accountability be like listen you don't have accountability when you were a kid you ever like have your parents tell you to brush your teeth they were like yeah like you know how you're like I don't want to I don't want to and they would
(2:49:57) tell you oh no you got to go brush your teeth and and you go and you brush your teeth and you Sul back to bed and next night you do the same thing they tell you brush your teeth you go brush your teeth go back to bed but you're an adult now right you brush your teeth they're like yeah and that's because you had external accountability that turned into an internal habit right and that's what we're going to do for you here right so I didn't tell them about [ __ ] the coaching call that they're going to have and the post that they're going to have and the blah blah blah we told them as
(2:50:21) the result of that we gave them an anecdotal story that made sense to them for that's probably a really key point I just want to drive home ear out when you have your pitch part it shouldn't be longer than three minutes like tops because no one really gives a [ __ ] and at the end of the day the reason they're going to buy is going to be because of how understood they feel so how much when you went through that overview of the pain you were able to restate back to them accurately exactly how they felt felt and the struggles they are experiencing which is why you need to shut the [ __ ] up when
(2:50:53) they're talking right and so there's only three things that are ever said on a sales call do you guys know what they are there's only three things that ever come out of your mouth questions restatements and anecdotal stories which is the story that I just referenced the three stories that you will use to break a belief that's it so this so that's how you sell them the vacation you have these little sound bites right I'll give you another example so if I was doing um if I was doing food right I'm like listen uh three parts of the program
(2:51:22) Fitness accountability so nutrition wise you've got to eat stuff that's going to make you lose weight can we agree on that yes okay cool but the problem is you don't want to do that right that's where we're here right right okay so let me ask you a question when uh do you feel like what's your favorite TV show they're going to be like uh whatever Game of Thrones you're like okay Game of Thrones do you feel like you need to get like motivated to watch came through like man I was trying to watch it tonight but I just couldn't you know I just I just I got really busy and I just couldn't sit down on the couch
(2:51:54) and turn the TV on I couldn't do it right of course not because you look forward to it because you wanted to do it and the key that we're going to do here is we're going to get you to look forward to the foods that you're eating because if you look forward to it you don't need to be motivated because you do it on your own because you like it does that make sense right so what I didn't talk about the macros and the carb cycling and the intermittent fasting and the calorie counting and the blah blah blah blah blah because the end of the day that does not matter what
(2:52:21) they want is for them to solve the problem and have it be painfree right and that's what we're explaining to them so that's selling the vacation right and this is a saying that I've used for a long time which is sell the vacation not the plane fright right and so this is what everyone else talks about they're like sir for us to get you these results you're going to have to take your pants off you're goingon to have to jump through this Loop you're gonna have to go through the TSA the airport lines pack your suitcases take your shoes off do the layovers connect your flights uh
(2:52:45) have a person farting next to you don't worry they don't have covid you'll have turbulence probably on the plane then as soon as you're out you think you're done you still have to wait a baggage CLA they probably lost your bag right and in our world it's your modules your MPL your Macros your workouts your support team your URLs your domains your funnels your targeting your ads and the other [ __ ] that doesn't matter right but instead what they want is you sell Maui Final Destination and you always sell the same thing because the difference is
(2:53:09) only the level of service and how they want to get there right if you have multiple levels of service so do they want to swim to Maui to where they're trying to go there's sharks and you could drown or get robbed right this chick crazy uh do they want to take a boat to Maui it'll take a little longer but there's no shark attacks but there's still no Wi-Fi and you're kind of you know in the sun uh do you want to take a normal flight to Maui get there a little faster still smells bad has security bad
(2:53:32) food but you're going to get there or do you want to take a private jet to Maui right direct non-stop champagne on the plane suitcase is packed when you arrive right and so that's the selling piece e is explaining way they concerns and so these are the questions that sound like um so there's I'm sure Mike has already taught you a lot of the uh the obstacle overcome Concepts right so fundamentally there's there's three big ones right price and rather than teach you like the uh the the the drilling of the obstacles I told you there's two things you need
(2:54:00) to memorize one of them are the stories the second are the obstacle overcomes all right because those are the things that you're in the Red Zone like that's not where you start thinking about what you're going to say all right so the two things that you need to memorize as a salesperson are the stories about what you sell and the obstacles that you're going to encounter when you're in the red zone the questions on the front end you need to know the Milestones you need to hit in order to move forward and this is one of the big mistakes I'm sure Mike talks
(2:54:26) about a lot which is you need to sit in the pain if someone does not clarify why they need a solution you do not ask for the sale if they're if we just say hey you know what what brought you to here today I just want to find out more information Okay cool so you know let me tell you about the program like that's not we didn't get the [ __ ] like we don't know why they're there we don't know what their goals are like one of the things drives me nuts about my team sometimes is I'm like dude we're eight
(2:54:50) minutes in the conversation I was like I don't know how many clients they have I don't know what their revenue is I don't know what their profit is I don't know what their biggest pain and struggle was right now I'm like what are you doing I'm like you just told them they're like oh Jim is $100 million doll company I'm like they don't give a [ __ ] but they do my sales guys because they get their OS puffed up right but it has nothing to do with the prospect they do not care right they only care about them so right that's right yeah that's the issue right
(2:55:15) everyone talks way too much about the product and so when you're training sales people you don't train them on the product you train them on the prospect the product doesn't matter I mean it matters obviously from like how you're going to make money because you have to do a good job because I'm going to get that in the second point but in terms of when you are selling and training someone if you guys know someone or know a specific Niche really well then you will know their pains and if you have a new salesperson you hear them say [ __ ] and you're like that's not
(2:55:45) what he thinks what is's he doing he might know the product perfectly but he just said that the guy's problem was not the problem and so then it doesn't matter what the product is because he doesn't feel like it's for him even though it's totally for him but you just misarticulated the problem that's where the clarity has to happen if you nail that the rest of the pitch is easy all right and so the key here is relying on past agreements that have already been made so this person with their partner with their spouse with their B you know
(2:56:10) whatever has that person knows that there's a problem and they also don't approve of that problem and so why would they be in any way against remedying a problem that they already don't approve of right and then finally we always tack on sometimes it's better ask for forgiveness than permission right ha depends on the ticket sale right but you can get those in right and then obviously last last case here is you just do a delayed close and say let's get your car down we can put it down payment we can pay the rest on Friday and if between now and then you know your partner comes back and says no man
(2:56:40) I want to be poor I want to keep struggling and like I want to never make money and like continue to do this for the rest of our lives then I'll absolutely tear up the contract don't worry about it right finally you've got stalls right I need to think about it so these are because people don't people are afraid of making mistakes right people are afraid of making mistakes and because of that they don't like making decisions because it's easier to let life make the decision for you and so they like doing
(2:57:08) it that way because then they feel like it's not their fault right and so I mean a great obstacle over for this is what's your main concern which is usually my number one thing I go to when someone's like I need to think about it it's like totally what's your main concern right let's think about it together right and so fundamentally these are the things that they need to know do you feel like what we're doing can meet your needs and solve the problem yes or no yes do you want to work with us as a company do you like our values do you like what we stand for do you believe what we believe
(2:57:37) about the world yes do you have access to funds or know someone who does yes well then let's rock and roll because those are the only things we know to me the B decision right do you like the product do you like us and do you have the money to do it that's it simple as that right and so when we walk through those if you encounter these situations obviously there's you know if you're going to do it now sooner or later you might as well like there's plenty of things to say but I think it's more important to understand the theory behind why someone has this objection
(2:58:07) right they have an objection around price because they don't see the value because you didn't articulate it they have an objection around decision maker usually because you [ __ ] something up earlier in the sale but at this point you're in the red zone so you got to deal with it so you rely on pasted agreements if they come with a stall then you help them confront a decision and make a logical choice and teach them how to make a decision that in that moment you say what are you most afraid of happening I'm afraid of you just
(2:58:30) you're afraid of me taking the money right just taking your money and you getting nothing right again well let me tell you how that's not going to happen right you can bring their concerns all right and then finally they say yes and you're like awesome and this is where if you're selling for someone else get them to send a personalized video like hey Johnny saw you just signed up with us today super pumped to have you uh you're going to be meeting with Heather tomorrow she's going to get you kicked off um you should in the mail get a special gift so keep lookout for that
(2:58:54) and then uh you know send a handwritten card if someone just bought a really expensive thing people are making their decision about whether they believe in you as a company within the first 48 hours after the sale they make a decision of whether or not they're going to be with you in the long term and how they are treated in the first 48 hours after they give you money so it's critical and it's usually in that point that people [ __ ] up and just ignore them framework two and you know Mike I can stop I'll just do framework two and then we can do the Q&A because if I don't have time to scale the sales teams I can hit on the points later um so this is a
(2:59:25) big one for everyone who is who's newer to sales all right if you believe you can outperform to season sales rep by learning control your tone all right and so I reworked all of our scripts into the closer framework and the thing is is immediately some people were crushing it right While others were still not selling [ __ ] and I was like what the [ __ ] right and so I talked to my friends and they were like dude you should read this book by Jordan buffer and the big biggest thing that I got from the book was just he was very specific about tonality and that was a big shift for me in just learning to
(2:59:55) teach how to ask the question not just asking the question right and so in the book he talks about having the same issue that I had with scaling sales it's like I give the script to two guys some guy crushes some guy doesn't I'm like what the [ __ ] right and the thing is there's a hidden dialogue that the sales team does not know that they are talking in right and so the words are not going to be enough all right they're just literally 10% so the words that you have it might be the most tested script in the world it's still only 10% 90% is
(3:00:26) how you say the words right because how you say what you say is tonality like right now I could give everyone here you know Jerry Seinfeld standup script you could read it it wouldn't be funny right because it's not just that you had the script it's how you deliver it right and that takes time to develop right and that's kind of unconscious Mastery and so there's two ways to do this all right that I have found you can either trick yourself into it or you can train yourself to do it all right and since we don't have enough time to uh to train on
(3:00:57) the influence of tonalities here's the trick that I teach all right conviction will correct your tone conviction made real so um let me tell you this story so I was I was brought in to do a day of Consulting for this mortgage leads company to train their sales team and the first half of the day I reworked the whole script I put the closure framework made it a question based um sale and then I came in and they were expecting me to like rain you know fire and brimstone on these guys and so I sat down I was like who's the guy having the most trouble it
(3:01:26) was this guy John so I was like John and they were still on the leads I was like John how good are the leads he was like well you know and I was like we're good thanks and I was like let me show you how you would answer it if you actually believed that the leads were good I was like you say like dude these leads are [ __ ] unbelievable right now I'm studying for my real estate exam so I can get in on these leads my aunt is real her and she has more business she can handle and I'm sending her traffic I'm trying to get my my my brother to do
(3:01:53) it with me I'm not sure how long I'm in a worker because these leads are killing it for us right if you believe in the product you don't need to have all the sales skills you'll do it the right way because you'll actually want to help the person so that's why the most important part of the sale is the product Because unless you're a malicious person like most people here was everyone here have some level of ethics on some level like no near just wants to like take someone's last dollar right so then the only way to sell hard because if you're going to close you got to sell hard the only way to sell hard is to
(3:02:28) believe through and through balls to bones when you look at yourself in the mirror at night this is what I talked about when Mike said at the very beginning like what happens when people start hating on you the only way that I've been able to stay where we're at in the gym industry Mike knows the amount of hate that I get right the only way we've been able to do that is that I read the testimonials the thousand of them that I have of Jim who have gone to six figures of the hundred gyms we've taken to seven figures right like I know beyond a
(3:02:54) shadow of a doubt that our product works I also know that if you sign up for a gym not everyone loses weight and I'm willing to deal with that I I'm willing to give everyone the opportunity to change their life so here's the tactics around this reread testimonials out loud daily in front of your sales team all right and if the business that you're working for doesn't have testimonials find another business all right I'm serious you're not going to be able to close unless you're like literally unless you're unethical you're not going to be able to close so go find something that is a good product because there's
(3:03:24) plenty of them out there all right find a good product that you believe in you just see tons of testimonials and then read those every day in front of the team all right second well this is for the business owners but fix everything you possibly can about the product all right and never blame a customer for lack of success so as much as there are people who have not been successful who've used gym launch I still take the fact that they were not successful and I think what could I have done that would have made the next person like them successful and you plug the hole right
(3:03:54) if you do that over and over and over and over again you know truly at the end of the day when you look at yourself in the mirror when no one else is watching whether or not you truly put the effort forth that merits the price that you are charging right and only you can know that and the thing is is like the reason salese get beat up is because they don't put the work in and then it grates on their soul and then eventually they burn out they burn out not because they can't handle no but because they can't handle how they feel about themselves right and so you have to put
(3:04:23) the work in to have the conviction because that's what's going to get you through it if you've ever met someone who's a born again Christian all right they are convicted they do not care how many people tell them to shove it because they are trying to save people's Souls it's real like if you let that hit you it's real you know what I mean and if you can be a disciple of whatever the product you have an evangelist in the truest terms then all the scripting stuff it won't matter why are some of the best sales people clients who had success because they believe in it that's it and the most convicted person
(3:05:00) will always win the fight right they'll always lead the dance because they have conviction in their skepticism you have conviction in your product and one of you is going to win out right and it's the question is whose belief is stronger because belief isn't binary it's not do I believe or do I not believe it's how much do I believe to what extent do I believe would I bet $1,000 on this product would I bet $10,000 on this product would I sell my mother this product think about it if you would sell your mother this product how convicted
(3:05:29) are you probably very and you will have no problem closing deals and notice that I have a lower tone right now so that you listen to the words that I'm saying so you think that they're important in terms of uh the training schedule 60 minutes a day 5 days a week my guys do world class sales training they text me in the morning before they wake up they text me once they're done uh they do the first 25 minutes they read the script out loud five minutes they drill obstacles I need to think about it I need to talk to my partner um this is expensive and then they talk
(3:05:59) they they drill the second half right as a closer you got to talk you got to listen you got to train both skills right the talking is the tone and saying the words the right way in the right sequence without having to think about it the listening is going over recording and figure out what went right what went wrong and what we're going to do next time and saying it drilling it as a team marking it and moving to the next one that's the short answer we 10x the recurring Revenue in one of my portfolio companies by using what we call the
(3:06:24) diagnostic sale there are seven steps that you can use to follow the script and apply it to your business enjoy I cross $100 million in net worth by age 32 I sold my first big company for 46.2 million and the reason we're able to do that is because we know how to grow companies and so now I buy companies at a lower price I grow them and then we sell them and so I want to talk to you about one of the companies we just bought uh we bought them a year and a half ago I think or a year ago uh they had 14 locations so it was a chain of brick and mortar and since then we've
(3:06:55) gone from 14 to 32 locations and the reason we're able to do that is because we focused on the sales process and through a process that I want to walk you through something that I call the diagnostic sale we're able to 10x the recurring revenue of the business across all the locations so before we get into the nitty-gritty of the story let me just walk you through the steps in the diagnostic process first is we like to have some sort of pre-sale questionnaire which the purpose of that is to get get more information that arms the salesperson so they know who they're
(3:07:20) talking to what their pains are but from the sales perspective for them they also increase their awareness of the problem second is we get their information in their credit card which is key and I'll explain why it later uh third is we want to understand what their current situation is where are you at today then we have your desired state so where would you like to be at and then what's the obstacle why aren't you there and then finally once we have these big three we present the desired State and our vehicle to overcome the obstacle and
(3:07:46) we tie our price to the way we're going to get them there and then finally we give them an incentive to prepay so here's the five steps that we follow to actually get this done so number one is that we secret shopped the business so we actually looked into it we went there by the way you should secret shop your own business highly recommend doing it you'll be horrified by what you hear your sales guys say you're like I thought we had a script what are you even doing number two is from there this is basically information gathering we figure out what
(3:08:10) the constraint is okay where do we think there's big opportunities in the business now you should think about yourself as your own business consultant if you could buy your business today and look at your business what would be the no duh thing that you would do now for this particular business we thought that they had an offer constraint which really came down to packaging we had offer slash packaging because fundamentally we're not going to change the core of the business we're not going to all of a sudden start selling soap when you sell HVAC like that's not going to happen right so the core of the
(3:08:39) business can remain unchanged it's how we're going to package the services we deliver or that the services we sell to a customer how are we're goingon to get them to perceive what we're selling we gathered the data we figured out the constraint was that they should get way more re-bookings which I thought was an offer and packaging issue which is we need to sell the solutions sell the goal and so number four is okay if we assume that we're going to make this new transition to this new new offer new packaging we have to anticipate so you
(3:09:04) we call it killing zombies uh which is one way of putting it you anticipate the obstacles or objections that people are going to throw at you ahead of time write this in neon marker above your sales team which is it's way harder to get someone to buy buy after you presented the price because now they're like he's trying to sell me so we have to counter that before we become salespeople in their mind we are a trusted expert ideally if we're positioned well and you should be that way if you know what you're talking about and I like to use the frame of childlike curiosity I always tilt my
(3:09:34) head I probably even did it subconsciously just now you tilt your head when you ask the question because it's non-threatening you're like huh that's weird what changed between then and now just so I understand then they can tell you rather than be like you said that your husband said supports you you can't say that now you have to buy doesn't work that way if you win the argument in a sale you lose the sale the only way that you win the sale is being willing to lose being right and so the fifth step and this is the ongoing step is that you implement the diagnostic sales process so it's implementation so
(3:10:04) now that I just outlined the five steps let me deep dive into the implementation into the actual business and how it did this with this particular business when we bought them I spent 4 hours with our director of sales and we outlined the new sales process we wanted to implement and as soon as we implemented that sales process we 4X LTV progression meaning how much people paid us it went from 200 to 800 so really big jump and we the crazy thing about this is that we didn't change what we delivered we only changed how we presented it and so this is the
(3:10:37) key of how we create value how we scale companies how we grow companies and many companies keep these things as Secrets uh as their special sauce and I just fundamentally believe that that the more we put out the more we get back and so that's why I operate this way all right so I will hold nothing back and this is something I call the diagnostic sales process now to be very clear the diagnostic sales process is one of two different sales or maybe three different sales processes big picture that you can
(3:11:03) have in a business one is a transactional sale all the way on this extreme so on one side you've got transactional sales and on this side you've got Enterprise sales which is like uh relational sales like if you think about like you're selling some big Fortune 500 company you have to get stakeholders involved get budget approval there's all that stuff and on transactional side you've got like High Velocity sales we're talking 20 30 minute sales a guy who stands in of the car wash sells Car Wash somebody sells gym memberships transactional and then you've kind of got like this Middle where you might sell something that's a
(3:11:38) little bit higher ticket but it's a little bit more custom all right now what we did was I took their sale from here a purely transactional sale and moved it towards custom all right now in a transactional sale you typically fit the customer to the product and so let's say that I sell pens all right so I sell pens if somebody comes in I'm going to basically spend all my effort listening to what they say they want and then telling them how this pen fits their needs or I have to basically say your needs are wrong
(3:12:09) let me educate you more and this actually solves all your problems right and so those are pretty much the only two approaches you can take in a transactional sale now the advantages of having this type of sale is that it's really fast uh they tend to be lower ticket in general uh and from an operational perspective in the business you don't need to personalize anything and so you get the sales team and the sales process to basically Orient everyone like a funnel down to one solution and then you just make a ton of these Solutions and you get lots of efficiencies because you only have to produce one thing this the custom sale
(3:12:41) is a harder sale sry easier sale to do but harder on the operational side and so the magic happens when you can actually Bridge the product component of transactional which you say okay we only sell these types of widgets this is the only thing we deliver but I can do it in a way that feels custom feels personalized all right so I'm going to give you two examples and I'll explain this one in a second this chart that I have here which if you could take your recurring revenue from that to that just by changing how you sell if you'd want to do that hang tight
(3:13:13) we're going to break that the process so if I had cuz I did this in the gym in the gym world too which is part of why our gyms make more money so a traditional sale look something like this someone comes in so this is traditional and you say we have a membership that's you know whatever $99 per month all right that's your membership and you say our membership has this this this and this and you want that right because it's going to help you accomplish all your dreams okay sometimes you get people sometimes you don't what I do
(3:13:48) we do something called a diagnostic and so the first thing is that when the person walks in the door we get them to fill out a pre-sale questionnaire and so that's like an application in a digital process but an inperson process it follows the same logic which by the way internet businesses follow local businesses local businesses can also model internet businesses when you find out something works in one place which I think has been one of the big advantage of I've had in business is I try and put it in a
(3:14:13) completely different place and it often works too if you understand the concept and so we fill out a pre-sale questionnaire now the pre-sale questionnaire simply walks them through all the reasons they walked in today and it ask them the same question in multiple different ways so it's like hey like what brought you in today what's the current problem you're dealing with how long you've been dealing with it if you had to quantify how much this has cost you financially what would it be uh if it continued for 5 years how much worse would the situation be and so the
(3:14:40) whole point is we're trying to agitate tame we're trying to bring attention to this problem and Elevate its importance so that's what the pre-sale questionnaire does now the second thing is we get info and this is very key so when someone comes in after that we say hey I want to I want to set up your account profile and so when you do that you collect their information and this is the key part you get their credit card now you're like wait a second I'm getting a credit card but I haven't sold anything exactly and
(3:15:05) you do that so that when you do sell something later you don't have to ask for it now you get the pre-sale they're like wow I really do need this thing you say hey let me complete your customer profile just standard procedure no big deal all right then you get their info now if they're like well I don't want to give you my credit card you're just like it's just how the system works it's how we complete profiles and then they'll give it to you all right so from there this is the this is where the special the special magic
(3:15:30) that's unique to each individual business happens so in the weight loss business I want to understand where their goal at so we say what's current and then four what's desired where are you now where would you like to be and then this one you ask them say what's the obstacle what's in between these two things is the obstacle right current I've got an obstacle getting in the way of my desired that's all we're asking in the process now in weight loss and in most businesses the thing the person thinks is in the way is often not the real thing in the way and that's because they've never had this conversation
(3:16:12) before they clearly haven't solved the solution and that's why they're coming to you and so you want to just get their word words more so so that you can explain it back to them using the language they gave you all right and so in the weight loss world for example instead of selling a membership I would say okay well it sounds like you need these three things Fitness distri accountability Fitness wise you need to work out X days a week nutrition-wise you need to eat this food at this time and we can help you meal prep the stuff so you got when you go to restaurants you can still stick on it and you need accountability because if you don't if
(3:16:42) you do if if I give you the best fitness plan and the best nutrition plan but you don't show up doesn't matter right account is what makes the whole thing work great finished nutrition accountability easy three-step framework fantastic now this is where it becomes diagnostic now most customers and this is why this is where the magic happens is that even if you still deliver the same thing so fundamentally when I switch the sales process the gyms remain the same they still have workouts they still have nutrition help they still have accountability nothing changed but how we presented changes and so rather than
(3:17:13) saying hey I'm going to sell a four-week thing or a six week thing I say hey you're currently 200 lb Okay now what's your high school weight she says I want to I want to get to 140 you say okay cool you want to get to 140 this is your desired okay so you have a 60 pound difference now what we found is that we don't want people to lose more than pound and a half to two pounds a week all right so let's just be conservative and call it one and a half so then I take out my calculator and I say what's one and a
(3:17:41) half time 60 which would be other way around it' be 60 divid by 1 and a half which is 45 okay so 45 weeks is how long it's going to take us to take you from 200 to 140 so you lose a pound and a half a week it's going to take 45 weeks and so six present price in relation to goal so you say awesome so we currently charge 99 bucks a week we can get you there in 45 weeks which means it's $500 and that means and for us I added a a guarantee on the back end which which said hey if you show up to the workouts
(3:18:24) for the next 45 weeks and you log your food and you don't lose the weight I'll keep working with you for free until you do so that means this is the translation this is the key part in the script so that means when you pay this $4,500 it means that you can count that weight for good you can put it out of your mind you pay me this money we're going to get there one way or another As Long as You Follow the steps you're going to follow the steps right great and so here you're trying to sell 99 bucks a month or or
(3:18:48) whatever this would be 99 bucks a week if if I was doing equivalent pricing all right so this would be like a semi-private program but by positioning it this way I'm not selling a membership anymore I'm selling exactly what they want and putting a price tag on it and saying you want to get to 140 it's going to take this long and I'll guarantee that you that you'll get there provided you follow these steps and then they say wow that's awesome you say well if you want I can can save you a little bit of
(3:19:17) money you want to save a little bit of money and they're like yeah I want to save a little bit of money well if you prepay you can save 10% a day so I can save you 450 bucks you want to do that that's what most people do great you want to you want to use the card you have in file done so that's that's the process now I took this process and applied it to a completely different service business that we own that's a chain that this is a little bit more Medical but the concept still applied which is and
(3:19:49) this is the key part is you have to figure out for whatever it is that you sell what the current is versus what the desired is so if I were uh a painter all right and I was painting houses sounds crazy right say hey so you currently have this thing you want a completely painted house and so the like now for them this is like more us do it for you rather than uh self-service like I'm going to have to like they you're not painting your house and them helping you so they're actually going to paint the house so then we just try and think how can we how can we how can we sell to
(3:20:25) goal and break it into a price that we tie to that and so it' be like okay so we're going to need four coats of paint and inste to take this period of time and then at that point your your whole house is going to be weatherproofed and so that means that when you pay this price that's what you're going to get by this state and if we don't get it done by that date I'm going to give you this and that way we can relieve their risk that it's not going to happen happen and we tie the purchase to the outcome so this particular business when I bought it or bought into it
(3:20:54) um it was a business that they had really good lead gen and they have a good product but they didn't have good packaging and I saw the opportunity because I knew that if I installed my sales process into their business I could make it make a lot more money and so if you have the opportunity to like 4X a business without opening new locations you do that and so that's more or less what we did so I actually wrote down the new sales process took me four hours so I wrote down the new sales process and then I presented to the
(3:21:23) management team and they were like wow this is the most valuable thing we've ever had happen to our business and I said great so let me know when you do it across all the locations and let's keep buying and opening new ones and so 18 months later we have 32 locations and the recurring Revenue in that time period has gone up and the average revenue per customer went from $200 to $800 from this one process and that was because before this they were selling one-off transactions they were saying hey we'll do this service for you so think of it like botox or we're going to
(3:21:57) do filler or we're going to do something this one time and so rather than just say sure give us a call when you want it again which is pretty much what the process was before this I say hey you want to look a certain way you're not here because you want filler you're here because you want to look a certain way so if I show this chart to you of faces and filler densities where where do you see yourself on here currently now you let them self-identify you can't be like look vix you're ugly can't say that so you got to say where are you on this chart and then they say
(3:22:27) this now in the weight loss sale I got them to step on the scale the scale called you fat not me all right so maybe just point to the third party not me so so so you get them to pick how ugly they are all right and then you say how pretty do you want to be now everyone's going to say I want to be super pretty but here's the beautiful thing when they pick how pretty they want to be they're the one who set the goal and that means The price came from them and you know where I picked this up was yogurt stores so one of the things I thought was
(3:22:52) genius about like Yogurt Land and things like that was if if you go to a store and then they fill up your stuff behind the counter and then they say hey it's eight bucks you're like man what the hell this place is so expensive but if they give you the cup and you fill it up and you put it on the scale you're like man I'm a fat ass same pricing but because I had control over what I picked I'm the one who's responsible for the decision and so by saying where are you on this chart and again this is where the magic happens I say current desired that's where the thinking behind how I'm
(3:23:23) going to structure a sale is where like that's where the that's where the experience that's where the expertise that's where it comes in this is the process and hopefully you guys can take this for your business and think like okay what's current what do they really want they're not buying lip filler they're not buying a painted house they're buying an image in their mind of what they want that house to signify or what it means to them and this lady is not buying filler she's trying to buy a certain look she wants people to think about her a certain way that she want when people walk when she walks in the room she wants guys to turn their heads
(3:23:51) though cuz she's probably getting a little older they're not turning their heads as much and she still misses that and she pay anything to get that so say you're ugly now how pretty do you want to be we say cool so for us to get you from here to here it's going to take us 45 weeks it's going to take us Botox filler and you know plastic surgery whatever we're going to have to hit you with a pretty shovel and bring you back to life all right we're going to have to do this and it's going to take this many weeks for us to reverse this level of
(3:24:15) Aging or at least take these cow feed out or whatever it is and so we tie where you're at to where you want to go and then our solution is only the vehicle that delivers this outcome and so that is the moment that you present the price because they picked where they were where they want to go and then you as the expert explain the path to getting there so they pick the before and after and you just use your expertise of this is what we found best to get people to hear Who start where you're at and so we found out that this opportunity existed within this particular business because I had my
(3:24:46) sales director your secret shop them so mind you this is Brick and mor chain we have a lot of locations so we could sneak our way in it's harder if you have like a you know four sales guys who do all the sales they'll just tell the owner right so we wanted a secret shop before we actually completed the investment and so uh when he went in he was I asked him so I went through this checklist I was like okay so did they give you some sort of pre-sale question he was like no I was like okay great I like did you did they ask you for your
(3:25:09) credit card or did they ask you for your information or anything before you got the service and he was like No And I was like fantastic what else what else El did they do it's like did they have you set you know pick uh where you're at and where what your goal is he said yeah they did have me uh pick where I was at but not where I wanted to go so they just had him pick okay how ugly are you and he's like okay now again not completely flawed I want to be really clear here like this is a at 14 locations they're not they're not idiots they had the pain we agitated the pain they said listen this is how ugly you are on this scale that we invented and
(3:25:39) you're here you're a seven ugly great so he checked this but he didn't get to say where he wanted to be so then from there he just went right into the service and then when he came out he just gave them the card to pay for the service and that was it and he just walked out the door and I was like wait so they didn't they didn't actually like ask you to buy a package or get into some membership or anything and he's like well they tried to upsell me this one product at one point but this was the price point and the price point was like 20 bucks or
(3:26:09) something and I knew what the average customer's worth which was like 200 at the time I was like that's like by the way if you're going to do upsell you want the price point to usually be usually be five times more than the current price because if you get 20% of people so customers are fractal so we're going to go into a little side quest here but it'll be worth it for you since we're talking about sales so you've heard of 8020 right so You' got a 100 people right the top 20% you've got the 80 underneath
(3:26:39) right these are the people 8020 have five times the spending power of these people and so because of that if you get 20% of people to buy something that's five times as expensive so let's say my current thing is $11,000 if I'm going to have an upsell I want my upsell to be $5,000 because if 20% take it then it's 20% time 5,000 which means I add $1,000 to my average ticket so I go from $2,000 or sry $1,000 per customer to $2,000 per customer and so when I heard that their upso was 10% it'd be like having a up be
(3:27:17) like my upsell is 100 bucks okay fine maybe 20% take that so I I go from a th000 to 1,020 who cares like what's like why bother right and fundamentally again smart business owners and they were upselling product which means there's no real delivery in a brick and mor service business so they could just hand the product make the money and I think they were using it more for commissions for their staff to increase the average pay which a different objective entirely and totally fine but I was only looking at this from how do I take customers who
(3:27:48) are worth $200 and make them my goal is to get them worth a th000 currently it's $800 I'm going to keep getting there until we get to 1,000 but I think that we can get it to a th and so we secret shop them number one which by the way if you have a team of people who are currently selling your stuff secret shop them and then be horrified by what you listen to on the phone or what you see in person because you have this beautiful idea of what you think your sales process is and it's a night nightmare it's an absolute nightmare if they remember half of it you'll be stoked and so if you run in an
(3:28:21) environment especially in a in a lower wage environment so if you're brick and mortar you have a chain of of locations and you have to take low skill labor and teach them a sales process you've like the the expertise in sales comes down to how easy and simple you can make the process and so that comes down to like can I automate parts of the p uh the point of sale so that they can't move forward without doing this checkbox right and by doing this checkbox they have to ask the question so it forces script adherence now training sales not into this video but you want to
(3:28:52) basically repeat the process over and over and over until they're sick of it until they say like yes Mom would you like to have do you have your credit you want to use the credit card on on file like until they're saying it like they could they can breathe it they can think they can say without thinking about it that's when you've maybe just started to have a a team that's that's well trained now that we finished these seven uh pieces of the diagnostic I want to add one more bonus because you're like wait a second so where's the where's the
(3:29:15) recurring Revenue great observation Andrew okay so so number eight is transition to recurring all right I remember this I'll give you two separate stories that'll drive this home so A friend of mine has a a recurring membership that he sells and he sells it at uh I think he was sell at 300 bucks a month and he couldn't get people stick past three months and so he tried all these different gimmicks and things and he just couldn't crack three months of LTV now that could have been a pricing issue whatever so this is what he did he
(3:29:46) stops selling it at $300 a month month to month and started selling as a $10,000 program with 36 Monon of Interest refinancing and so when people bought they were buying a $10,000 price point but they got an amazing payment plan and so he didn't change anything about what he sold but that took his average customer from 3 months to eight months so we're talking about a $900 so three times 300 to 8 * 300 2,400 that kind of change in a business life-changing in terms of how much money you can make the second one was I had a different friend who had a continuity program uh he was
(3:30:20) an uh agency and what he did was he realized he had churn in his business and so he said you know people are way less likely to turn out of a payment plan same as the other one than they are out of a monthly recurring Revenue strain and so what you call it to the customer can affect the likelihood that they pay but as far as the business is concerned you just want payments that are regular and all you do to take a program and take it from from a payment plan to to recurring in terms of what how it actually looks and feels is you just put an automatic recurring at the
(3:30:51) end of the program and so when someone buys this big thing and you make a payment plan and then it recurs into the exact same price as the payment plan you just move the pieces around but the likely they stick is way higher and so that's exactly what we did as the last step in the diagnostic sales process and I wanted to highlight this point for you because I've done it in every business and so we give someone the option to prepay you can give if you want a little bit more aggressive you get 20% off if they prepaid today if you want to have one step down below that which is what I
(3:31:18) like to do you give them 10% off if they do half down and then make the rest his payments and if they still can't do that then I take the whole thing and I spread it over let's say our 45 weeks and so I'd say okay it's 99 bucks a week 99 a week and there you go now they go from 99 a week to 80 bucks a week if they prepay the whole thing and they go from 99 bucks a week to 90 a week if they prepay half and here's the key part is that when we present the price you present it at the highest rate so you present it at the payment plan let me walk I'll walk you through this CU I
(3:31:53) think it's important well I'm going to put it here and so I don't have to flip screens for you all right so you have your full boat I'll say full interest price so for us in our example is 4500 bucks all right 45 weeks time 99 roughly all right so this is our full boat price we have our prepayment discount in full which is- % all right so for us it's going to be minus what is that 900 yeah 900 from there so that's 5600 sorry other way uh 3600 3600 if they do half down you say I'll let you save uh 450 bucks so 10% so 40 five Z all right so
(3:32:38) this is 10% minus 10% that's- 20% now the reason this is so important is think about the alternative think about and this is what most people do so listen to me Andrew most people do this they present the price is $3,600 and then they say oh well we have payment plans that we have interest on and so we do we do have 10% interest if you can put half down and we have 20% interest if you put uh nothing down and you just go onto a straight payment plan well which one would you rather buy if on one hand you have a $4,500 price tank
(3:33:11) which anchors you high and you say or you can get a benefit for prepaying today rather than you think about 3600 you're considering it and then they say oh it's even more even though you're just considering this Peg guess what you have to pay way more now be because you can't afford it you have to pay more Banks do it all the time and guess what everyone hates Banks so if banks want to fix their process Mr Bank maybe this will work who knows anyway point is is that this is how you present the price because you get the benefit of a price anchor and you get to be the good guy for getting them to pay upfront
(3:33:42) rather than the bad guy for them not being able to so we're going to we're going to go through step eight in uh in the more transition uh process for the sale and so I want to just walk you through step downs and so this is super important to understand from a sales perspective so we'll call this sales step downs and uh this is by the way a preview for my next book coming out $100 million yeah anyways so so sales step Downs is one of the things that we have so obviously the first thing we're going to present is a prepayment all right which is painful today prepay yay by the
(3:34:14) way you've probably noticed from any of my content I don't say paidon fools and that's because that's a that's a Salesman term not a customer benefit if you prepaid you get a benefit whereas paidon full is like I got all the cash to front good for me and so I have trained myself because I used to say paidon fools pipis P you know whatevers pifs like all of that stuff I used to do as a sales team sales leader and then I also heard my team saying that to customers like hey if you want to pay in full today like it's just like kind of gross and so I prefer to say like hey we
(3:34:44) have a prepayment discount and so training that just little Pro tip for you so number one is prepay number two is we do discount uh with partial so this is the half down oops half down here you can also do in-house well this is whatever sorry this is credit card or third party so if you have like most most businesses that sell legitimate Services have third-party financing solution that already exist and so I promise you there is a banker somewhere who started a business to service this Emerging Market of whatever it is that you do who says I'll bet you I can help Finance transactions now the prices they charge
(3:35:28) for that financing will differ based on how risky your businesses and so like there's financing for casinos like if you want to get if you want to get a loan to go gamble more like there's financing for that but they will charge you a lot of money right and so like that being the extreme on the other hand if you want to finance a house there's obviously huge mortgage industry and so from every step in between there are Partners who will step in as third party and take on that risk for you for a price and so I prefer can I get the
(3:35:55) prepayment because it's easiest and fastest if not I usually have a third party that I set up so that my customers can get financing if we don't move past either of these two things then I try to go with a partial with some level of discount not as much as here but a little bit and if they still say no then I go for continuity which is why don't we just make a payment plan on the thing and in this particular business because what they were doing before was simply rebooking people for another session of service we just had this be the automatic like everyone gets rebooked
(3:36:28) and that would became that became an internal saying like I like having montras uh within sales teams which is like everyone buys something like everyone buys something there's no reason someone should not buy something and so sure we'll get them a prepay maybe a partial okay fine we'll do a payment plan that's whatever call it you know 250 uh times four great that's our th000 that's our th000 plan that we're getting people to buy and you pay 250 today and then three more times and you can do it every other month if it's a more uh intermittent service whatever
(3:36:58) just match the payments to when they get delivery and then finally if they're like well I can't do any of those things and like cool let's just let's just book the next time you want to come in that's it and so this is the final of the process in terms of in terms of the step Downs that we might offer someone we just walk through this whole process and you're like wow maybe that's l lot of work I have to use my brain power but welcome to business but let me tell you why it's worth it so these are the
(3:37:22) actual stats and I put the numbers without the names to keep it nice open loop for you so number one is that they had 9% of Revenue uh that was recurring within this product line all right so they 9% that was occurring after we implemented this process 60% they took this 9% to 60% of this product line within the company so awesome number two they had basically no membership at all because they just weren't it wasn't even an option not really and we were to push that to 30 that's a 30 30% into memberships this included payment plans this is just
(3:38:02) memberships and then we went from getting one additional extra visit on average per person meaning two to getting 4 to six visits per customer by introducing this sales process from a money perspective we went from $20,000 when we uh bought the business so mind you this business made a lot more money than this single product line or this service line but this is where I wanted to invest my time because I thought there was a huge opportunity here because I saw from the secret shopper from the constraints I
(3:38:33) thought this was a big area of attack and so they only do 20,000 a month which business de sizes not a lot and then however many have been dots this later over 250,000 per month in and added and it continues to grow and this compounds and that's the that's the beauty of this type of sales process and repackaging of what someone already sells and so we went from 9 to 60 0 to 30% on memberships from one visit to four to six visits and from 20 to 250,000 so we more than 10x the recurring revenue of this business by
(3:39:05) following a diagnostic process rather than just selling some traditional one-off thing the first thing you have to learn how to do is how to sell the second thing you have to learn how to do is get someone else to sell for you and so in this video I break down how he scaled a new sales department from 0 to 40 sales reps doing 5 million plus per month in sales within 90 days but before I explain the $21.6 million increase let me kind of give you some context on this business and where it was in the life cycle we brought in Mercenaries so when
(3:39:32) I say mercenaries I mean an outsourced sales team the founder of the business had never been in sales at all he'd never got on the phone he' never done door Todo he never done anything related to getting a stranger to give him money one-on-one I thought it was too risky to try and have somebody's completely new to it try and start from scratch and so I called somebody in my network and I said hey do you want to make a bunch of money and he said yes can you round up some of your guys and start taking
(3:39:58) college for this company that I have and so they started taking sales and we started making more money we have a w money up W fantastic and in a second I'll walk you through all the statistics of what the mercenaries and the ouse team did which then led us to a fully in-house team now as you can imagine imagine going from zero sales guys to 40 sales guys in a fresh company is hard but let me explain some of the problems with the mercenaries and then I'll walk you through the actual stats so there were three main problems with the
(3:40:27) mercenaries all right problem number one is that we were giving them 20% of the revenue all right now this is something that I was vehemently against to be very honest with you in this particular company I was in a minority position I said it's ultimately your call I was like but I would not do it at this percentage they decided to move forward with it anyways and hey we made money there was a w there but it was a problem 20% of Revenue coming in is a big [ __ ] check the sales team company was arguing we can't get the top guys to sell unless we give them a really big rip that's sales slang big commission so
(3:40:59) we had to give them 20% of the revenue that they collected as commission to The Mercenaries team the ouse sales team the second problem that came up is related to Performance they were getting less than 30% of people to ascend meaning people who buy the first thing to buy the next thing and we wanted it to be higher than that or I believe that it should be higher than that we're paying a lot and we're not getting as much out as we want the third problem with the ouse sales team and this is one that I think more long-term about because I'm investor in the business
(3:41:31) is is the sellability and Enterprise value of the business meaning in the future we'd like to sell the company at some point probably and even if you don't want to sell a business creating a sellable business still makes the business more valuable and so if you can make a business more Val Val to a stranger it also becomes more valuable to you if you have a outsourced sales team something that exists outside of the business that's responsible for 203 40% of the revenue in the business then that could be a material issue that's why we decided to look at these three
(3:41:59) things and say all right let's see if we can move this in house I'm going to walk you through first the funnel kind of before and after and then I'll walk you through the process that we did to fix it or swap it over that resulted in the $21.
(3:42:18) 6 million increase in profit not Revenue profit the way that this process was structured is we had a two call set up we've got a percentage of people who schedule a call a percentage of people who show to the call and then schedule the next thing then they have to show to the next thing and they go to the next call and then do they buy so let me walk you through the stats here because everyone who bought the product had a first call that they wanted to attend 100% of people were scheduled to show up for this call with the Outsource sales team we had 74% of people are actually showing for the call once they got on the call we're
(3:42:49) able to get 53% to schedule the follow-up call and so some people call this a qualification call which is if you're going to sell something else you want to make sure the person actually fits for the thing you sell makes sense right you want to make sure they have the problem to solve and the money to spend with the 53% the Outsource team wanted to only give their closers because he's trying to optimize for his dollars per hour for his team only the easiest closes so they weren't willing to take call they weren't already sure were going to close all
(3:43:18) right so because of that they're only passing 53% or almost half to the next call now again this is just scheduling now from here we had 63% showing up to call two so this is call one this is call two now this is the close call this is the set call this is the close so I'll just put set this is close so the last box we got to fill in here is how many people were they actually selling all right and they were getting 80% of people who show go to the second call the closed call to buy all right and so that is where money came out the other side hooray so let's walk through the math as if a 100 people bought the
(3:43:56) product so if 100 people bought the product then it means that we'd have 74 74% of 100 74 people who would show up to this first call now of the 74 people 53% so about 37 of them would then schedule for the second call of the 37 people who scheduled for the second call we're going to have 22 so 63% 22 of them are actually going to show up to this close call now 80% of these 22 are going to close which means we'd have about 20 sales or 20% of that front end that ascends now remember I said at the very beginning one of the
(3:44:38) problems is that we wanted it to be closer to 30 this is the issue and so I want to be very clear a big part of this was was the price point we were selling at and the fact that we were selling people who are already customers we're not selling cold traffic here we're selling people who already bought this already demonstrated an interest and we're saying do you want more help with that thing so we thought it should be much higher so there's five steps that we broke down that we had to do to go from out ofh housee team mercenaries to
(3:45:04) in-house sales team and the first one started with hiring a director now right off the BET let me explain our thinking process before I explain who we were looking for and how we found them cuz listen you don't want to hire 40 people people right you were thinking okay I want to hire one person who can then hire 40 people times a lot more circles right it's even long to write it out all right it's an old investor saying which is hire one to hire 10 we're going to hire the one person not the 40 that's the main decision after that what we're looking for is who who are we looking
(3:45:35) for what do they look like and then how are we going to find them okay now from a who perspective we wanted someone who had been there done that which means specifically somebody who sold this type of product in this type of industry and ideally scaled a big team and knows how to coach up new salespeople so that's what been there means for us for this particular role the next thing is you want the person to be metric driven so one of the easiest ways that you can measure someone's Proficiency in any skills this little Pro tip the quality and quantity of metrics that someone explains about how
(3:46:11) they do their job is directly correlated with how good they are at the job and so if someone's like hey I'm an amazing HR person and I say cool what metrics do you track and they're like well the happiness of the team and I'd be like what else do you track how many complaints I get on payroll I'd be like okay what else do you track the order that they tell me the metrics they're looking at and what they track is going to tell me what they care about what they pay attention to and their level of expertise now on the flip side if someone says hey I like to take companies from on average a 45-day time
(3:46:42) to fill to 20-day time to fill because we know that every day that company doesn't have something they need they're losing money there's opportunity cost of Revenue they should be making by not having them this is really interesting because they're connecting their metrics to the company's revenue and so how people talk about the metrics and which metc they track and how they connect those with how it makes the company more money will show you how good they are what they do the third one is just kind of the I would say demeanor now I've hired a lot of sales
(3:47:07) people and sales directors in my life and the personality of a sales leader is usually not the same as the personality of a sales killer now there are some superstars who can do both but it's rarer often times the demeanor of sales directors is a little bit more even killed usually more humble very servant oriented they have to be people people they have to be the type of person who wants to pour into the team and loves watching someone improve their skill set and can repeat the same directions over and over and over again without losing
(3:47:38) enthusiasm that's who you want you want somebody who's like a Energizer Bunny of of Positive Vibes because for the most part sales director is just Performance Management they manage the culture of the team like the output of the entire team is the direct function of the sales director and so if you think about this like on a on a football team or something you can switch the coaches and all of a sudden the whole team does way better it's because the coach drives the culture in the team that drives the performance and the output and so that is what they are responsible for and so
(3:48:06) if they don't have values everything else that comes from the team is going to be a diluted version of them now we go to the how you're like okay well that sounds like an amazing unicorn Alex how do you find that person who's going to replace this well I personally have a relatively large network of salespeople and so one of the big things here is that you can either this is the core 4 by the way you can do Outreach which means you reach out to strangers who you think might fit the role you can run ads so you run ads to go get more people content you can also
(3:48:37) do recruiter I've used all of these all right so there there's pros and cons to each of them but what I will do is I'm going to cross out two of these early for most of you most people think that you can run ads for these types of roles the reality is usually no the higher the role is the better the person is the less likely they're going to respond to an ad cuz think about it an amazing sales director is always going to have a job and always going to be making good money now they might not like their job as much as they they they could but
(3:49:04) they're going to keep making money and sales directors tend to be money oriented in general and so they're going to keep making money so ads is probably not the way to get them content unless you have a salesperson audience probably not going to be the way you can always try it it's free give it a shot but I wouldn't say I'm going to bet the farm on this so it's probably not going to be content and so usually you're going to do one of these two which is you're going to get a recruiter to do it or you do it yourself but guess what a
(3:49:29) recruiter does they do Outreach too I know this is going to sound crazy you message them and you say hey I've got this role and it looks like you're perfect for it could I tell you about it or if you want to be a little less direct you can say you're an amazing person who' be a fit for this role do you do you know anybody else like you they're going to be like screw everybody else talk to me Alex how many people do I reach out to five five no one's even going to read it if you message five people 10 no one's going to read it if you message 10 people reach out to 100 to 1,000 people
(3:50:04) and if you get to that 1% on the 100 and you haven't found it then you might have to go 1% on th000 and that's okay cuz remember would you rather have a top 1% sales director I sure this [ __ ] would so it's okay to turn down the first you talk to just cuz he has a pulse and has one of these things it's like okay this guy talked about metrics but he was a dick and he actually doesn't have the experience that I'm looking for well then don't hire him the thing is is it's tough to do that when you're an
(3:50:30) entrepreneur because you're like I'm bleeding every day the house is on fire I need this roll but I promise you it's way more painful to hire the person on board them spend 2 months run getting them up then they start hiring [ __ ] because they're a [ __ ] and then all of a sudden you're like oh my my God I HTE this whole team and so even if you do get rid of the top you then have all the stuff they brought in underneath and so you have to clean house and it's really really painful and so as much as
(3:50:54) you hire one to hire 10 if you fire one sometimes you have to fire 10 and that sucks and so getting this higher right is super important but it's also why we spend more time on it so now that we hired our in-house sales director we want to rebuild the compensation structure right because remember the 20% wasn't going to fly because if we just flipped it to 20 we might as well just save the effort right so we had to rebuild the incentive structure the problem that we had right now if you remember was that we had the pro I think it was problem one or problem two whatever problem one problem two
(3:51:22) whatever it was 20% of Revenue was going to the Outsource sales team so we wanted to make sure we were less than that our Target was sub 10% and that's usually around what I like to be in now I want to be very clear here there are things that this depends on so if you're in a business where the salesman does self gen meaning they generate their own lead so if you're if you're going out Bend and you're cold calling or you're door knocking then these percentages will be shifted because you technically are a cost of acquisition you're both marketing and sales you're getting the leads and closing the leads if you're handing
(3:51:53) salese leads if you're running ads you have a media team that then generates leads or prospects for a sales team then you basically have to split that cost between the marketing team and the sales guys and so given that let me explain how I actually think about this what skills do I need how rare are those skills so if I'm feeding softballs to somebody then I don't need need Ken griffy to hit it out of the park all right for jiny uh mookie bets all right I don't need mookie bets to knock it out of the park uh because I'm soft tossing right anybody can probably rock it out
(3:52:25) of the park that's double AER up because at that level because it's so much easier if you have crazy expectations it's rarer and they have more skills so you got to pay more if it's something that's not a lot of skills and more common you can pay less and so I just think how much would I need to pay to attract the level of salesperson I need our goal is to take from 20% to around 10% or less and rebuild the complaint you can think about compensation in two columns all right you've got money and not money all right this very complicated system I don't want to get into the specific a lot of physics behind this
(3:53:01) all right so you've got the money you give them for closing deals and then you've got other [ __ ] and so that's recognition praise attention approval perk status if you publicly recognize them if you have a leaderboard if you give them more attention you get you actually train them more you give them more skills you say hey out a boy awesome job great day today you say hey the guy who closes the most gets to park in the nice parking lot and then status like maybe when they close a 100 sales they get a hat with a stripe on it when they close
(3:53:34) a th sales they get two stripes and so forth so when you guys come on the team they're like [ __ ] I want one of those hats right sales team six let's go there's all these things that you can do to increase the value of of the job outside of money and as much as people sales guys include will be like that doesn't motivate me sure as [ __ ] does all right it totally does cuz it makes your life better on the money side there's a couple ways to do this all right and so I'm going to explain how we did it i' we've we've made a lot of
(3:54:00) different compensation structures a lot of it depends on again the business that's involved now one of the big decisions we made up front was that we were going to comp Setters and closers now why is that so important the funnel is through if I can increase my show up rate by 20% it's just as good as increasing my closure by 20% it makes no difference the business they were just as equally weighted in terms of their value but again how rare are the skills and what skills are required it's easier to set than it is to close just as
(3:54:29) important but easier Setters and closers equally important but rarer to find a skill from closers so they got paid a little bit more but Setter still got commissions as well to incentivize the fact that they would get people to sh cool so the way that I prefer to set up compensation structures the idea that I like to have is that I like ww at the top which means winners win all right which also means losers lose that's fine there's more fewer winners than there are losers what that means is you can have ratchets for compensation meaning
(3:55:01) if you close 50% of the people I'm just using arbitrary number you get to keep your job if you close 60% you get adab boys if you close 70% your commission goes from 10% to 15% ah 50% increase not bad if you close above 80% you get 25% whoa right and so it ramps and so it allows the people who are absolute Killers to crush and then the people who are not guess what happens down here turn but this is structural turn this is expected turn this is part of the game with this type of role like if you require work ethic you require practice require people show up early
(3:55:52) work late work weekends take calls it requires a certain type of person and a lot of people aren't cut out for it which is also why most people don't make multiple six figures a year selling we fixed the compensation structure we comped Setters and closers we ramped it so that the best guys would get more than 10% but we knew that as a team we averaged around if you want to know the actual number was we got the overall everything Allin fully baked in including the sales director for 9% we are feeding them qualified prospects they're not even prospects they're customers we already have their [ __ ]
(3:56:24) credit card like we just had to say want more of the thing you just bought want more help with that thing so you can get the outcome you just said you wanted like these are not hard sales and by doing this we got to move on to step three now that we rebuilt the incentive and comp to get the types of sales guys that we want on the team then we had to rebuild the process so I'm going to walk through what we do to improve each of these numbers one by one because as you're thinking about your business there is no Silver Bullet there's no one thing you're going to do that change this entire process it's 100 golden BBS
(3:56:53) and this is how we approach everything in business and business is a pipeline like this and so I'm going to show you what we did and we did improve every one of these numbers except for one but it was okay and I'll show you why but remember 100% of people are automatically booked for this next appointment all right and so we wanted to improve this show up rate and so we improved it to 91% woo ooh 74 9991 more money good that's a 211% increase meaning if we did nothing else we did nothing else in this entire process everything willse stay
(3:57:23) the same we would have a 20% increase in sales and most of that would disproportionately drop to the bottom line cuz we already acquired the customer so all this additional sales money goes to profit big deal so we did three things the first is that the mercenary team is way too aggressive in their copy false urgency false scarcity people kind of see through it um so that was number one that they did that we fixed number two is they were giving people way too much time time to book out I'd say hey when do you want to show
(3:57:47) up for your next call people would be like oh how's 2 weeks from now and they were like sure our big rule of thumb despite the fact them trying to push out five plus days for appointments is we try to go for same day next day and that's because in our history more people show up the same to next day appointments than 5 days plus from now and so by just simply making the messaging less aggressive shortening the time when they can book their next call and number three setting reminders that were actually personalized so rather than just Robo texts they're the green ones that everyone [ __ ] hates right
(3:58:19) we'd have the sales guy do a three-way connection with the setter and say hey my name's John it's nice to meet you Sarah looks like you've got X Y andz that I can reach from your account really excited to talk to you tomorrow I think I can help you with X Y and Z very simple but it's a video or a voice memo and they see it from a real person all right and they can take a picture whatever and those three things together 91% which is a 21% improvement so now that we got people to show for that first call how many of them did we get to schedule the next call which is
(3:58:48) basically the close of the set call you're going to see some magic happen right here we had a major Improvement I'm not going to tell you what I'll tell you how much we improved this one in a second but we did two things to improve the percentage of people who showed up to set calls who decided to schedule close calls all right so the number one mistake that they were making in this particular business is that again this was an outsourc closing team and so they were trying to minimize how much unqualified work their closers would get because they so carefully wanted to make sure their closes were happy because they were all mercenaries they all had
(3:59:18) to pay them a ton just to show up to work every day point being one the incentives were misaligned and so Setters remember we added our Setters had a compensation to get people to set they didn't have that we did add that and so what do you know our Setters got more people to schedule wild I know the second thing was that they were deqing people on the set call uh in my opinion too early and so they wouldn't really go through a sale they would just say hey here's the price are you down to pay that if yes I'll book you a call with
(3:59:47) John but by doing that they were basically not selling they were just taking orders which if I just tell you the price and you buy I don't need you you're not selling at all you're just a checkout page that's inefficient that takes 20% we corrected number one we we we align the incentives of the Setters with the overall business not the closer we align the setting incentive with the business throughput which got rid of the dqs that were overly deqing people and we made sure that when they were talking about the product we were just more
(4:00:20) trying to qualify the prospect to make sure they had the problem to solve and the money to spend not telling them the price of what they would ultimately buy cuz we haven't sold them yet we just want to make sure that this is a big enough problem for them and that they seem reasonably able to pay if we present it to them our schedule percentage went from survey says 53% to 94% % for those keeping track at home that's a 77% increase so forgetting this one if we kept everything else the same and we only did this we would have increased sales by
(4:00:55) 77% assuming everything else stayed the same but everything else didn't stay the same so let me show you the next thing we did which is we had people show up for the first call we got 94% to schedule the next call and now we have what perc of these 94 actually showing cuz hey maybe you just get everyone to say yes so they get off the phone but are they actually showing believe it or not this is going to sound crazy the show rate that we had here was actually the same process that we had here because believe it or not if people have good experience and it's personalized to them they're more likely to show and so rather than explain literally repeat
(4:01:27) myself I'm going to say how we actually got the team to do it so we did four things number one is we started implementing daily training which means that every day the team would get together and they would roleplay the scripting to make sure their tone was right that they were coming off the right way that they're hitting the main points Mak sure that they were framing things properly adding curiosity hitting the main pain points that the prospect was going to have so they could set up the next call number two is that we do gam tape reviews which is uh very simple
(4:01:48) but you just watch gam tape with the team and you have the person who is in the call critique themselves so rather than have everybody jump on them cuz no one likes that it's horrible you just have them say what are all the things you could have done differently and then the team says all the things they did well cuz remember there's always something someone did well you play the tape they say all the things they would have done differently and most people do know when they watch it which is one of the best ways to learn and then everyone
(4:02:14) else says hey I think you did a great job here I think you did a great job here Bravo next one up the third thing is this is why the sales director was so key and why they were the first hir was is doing one on ones and 101's you role play like I you role play till you're sick in the face you have to learn how to train people how to speak like that's what the job of the sales manager is besides managing the culture of the team is if John's Rapport building sucks guess what sales manager does every time they have a one with John they practice
(4:02:39) Rapport building all right which means you follow the script no say it again y say it again try like this huh like there you go change your tongue there it is like we're talking 10 20 30 reps on one or two phrases in the script so they get it down if your salesman is not talking back to you in the script on your one-on ones you were literally wasting time the fourth thing was just end of day reports which is you just want to make sure that they know you're tracking what matters and if there's no tracking throughout the week no one feels held accountable it also doesn't give you the opportunity to praise and
(4:03:10) give out of boys all right and so every day the stats are get tracked in real time and daily leaders daily winners all right so those are the four things we did from here to drive our show rate to woo 87% that's a 40% increase so if we did nothing else but we just had this one Improvement in this process and everything else stayed the same we would have increased sales by 40% not too shabby if you're following at home which you should be we should at this point have a ton more volume that is coming to these closers massive improvements cuz remember these are
(4:03:45) customers this is why we felt like we could do a lot better now hitting the close call so in order to improve this number to the best degree possible because we never we're going to have more disqualified people here remember we we told the Setters send anybody you can because we wanted to get more at bats okay so one we also added in a vssl so video sales letter between call one and call two so people got to have some social proof they got to see some results they got to have a better understanding because in my personal
(4:04:09) opinion I don't like sales people repeating a pitch I'd rather have someone understand the benefits and then have salesmen resolve concerns and personalize solutions to customers rather than have them say the same 15minute pitch because it then it sounds robotic and they zone out and so does the prospect so I like to say here's all the info watch that and then we'll talk about it okay so number one is we added that piece in number two we role played a lot on the common objections and we like to do that before the call the video sales letter covered some of these
(4:04:40) common concerns in the video so that the sales guys had a little bit more of Advantage going into the call and then also in the scripting we front-loaded the obstacles before you mention the price you overcome obstacles after it's objections all right so if I say hey do you think your husband supports you in doing this new thing before I say the price then I've overcome an obstacle if I say the price and I didn't overcome it it becomes an objection which is way harder to close we call it killing zombies right you want to kill the Zombies you want to defuse the bombs
(4:05:09) before you talk about money and so we front loaded the script to accom at those issues that people were losing in the sales and we focused the script far more on what they were going to experience afterwards rather than the features within the service because at the end of the day they don't care about the features of service they care about where they're going to go what life's going to be like afterwards so sell the vacation not the plane flight so we made those changes and we got the close rate if you're like wait 42 is lower than 80 sure as hell is great math if we're doing the
(4:05:40) percentages here and we have a 21% increase here and a 77% increase here and we have a 40% increase here so that's 1.2 + 1.77 + 1.4 we have far more than a double in terms of how much volume was going there in fact we had three and 1 half times more volume but we cut the Clos rate in half but 3 1/2 * .
(4:06:05) 5 is more than 1 meaning we increased the total throughput of this system and so the end result of this entire process is we went from closing 20% of that 100 people that buy the product to 32 for a net Savings of going from 20% of Revenue to 9% so we paid less than half to get 60% more sales and as you recall all additional sales dropped to the bottom line because we'd already acquired the customers so now that we had ear in house director we rebuilt the incentive and comp plant and we rebuilt the sales process now we wanted to scale so we had to go from zero to 40 reps and we had to
(4:06:49) do it in record time all right so number one is that to go get all those people we went everywhere all right so we actually did all the things that outlined but we also hired five to six recruiters right off the bat we did a ton of up on ourselves we hit our whole email list up we did everything cuz we had to hire 40 guys we had to do it in 12 weeks all right so number one is we did everywhere so plus ads well actually didn't do ads there's more uh content and outbound all right so recruiters content and outbound is what we did to get all the people in the door now once we had people in the door we
(4:07:24) didn't have the sales director interview all these candidates because he just wouldn't literally have the time he did a final check off once the team planned on hiring them and so we had the manager for the Setters do do several of the talks with the leads and we also had the recruiters do a lot of the screening as well so that the sales director could save his time and still keep managing the actual team and training the people who are on the floor making money for the company all right so saved directors time the next thing is okay
(4:07:55) great so we got a lot of people we got them hired but how do we make sure that they're actually good so we automated the sales training to the greatest degree possible now what does that really mean it means we made a course that was an internal course on how to sell this thing and so the nice thing with internal courses if you don't have them high recommend it because the most expensive thing a business can do is train salespeople reason why is because when you take a salesperson and you train them on live prospects all of the money they don't close is money you lose and you lose all
(4:08:28) like you lose the money that you could have made and you lose the money that you spent to get them there very expensive all right especially when and this happens a lot too you do all of that only to have them get fired or leave or burn out or whatever all right and so we want them to take as many reps ass soonly possible in a fashion where there's no risk to the company which is why we have them watch tons of gam tape footage they tend all the meetings they listen to tons of live calls they go through the course and then they roleplay there's one takeaway from this
(4:08:58) [ __ ] video it's that you roleplay with your team and that you get really really narrow on the things you want them to improve and you keep nailing that thing until it's perfect and then you move to the next thing there's no point in trying to tell someone to improve six things doesn't work I promise you it doesn't work I spent too long doing this doesn't work you say let's work on the first sentence of the [ __ ] script keep doing it again try it again try it again try it again one more time say it lighter say it faster
(4:09:20) Loop to this one got it second question right that's how you work through a script until they will they will be able to breathe it in their sleep then they can actually be present for the sales call cuz they don't have to think about the scripting cuz they already know it so we recruited the people we saved the director's time we automated the internal onboarding I'm going to give you a pro tip from me which is that if someone seems like a dad within 14 days let them go some people think I'm heartless how could I be so heartless because I have other families I have to look out for
(4:09:50) too and if we don't keep the sales team profitable the whole business doesn't work we give people a shot we get to all this stuff we give them a ton of free training all right they actually technically get paid to get trained and if they don't if they're not up to chops we got to let them go but we set that expectation up front and one more thing and this is a a little Pro tip for me I don't know how to spell that but no padas all right so no special snowflakes because the thing is is even if you have one killer on the team and they don't follow the process they undermine the
(4:10:18) entirety of the process and they also kill the culture and so if one guy does double the sales of everybody else or triple the sales of everyone else I can almost guarantee nine times out of 10 in my experience they actually take those sales out of the organization overall so one guy does triple and everyone's like oh we should be like him but the you if you have like a 20 person team and everyone goes down by 10% because of this guy because the cancer spreads not worth it just cut it out keep the system
(4:10:44) and now that we had the in-house director we rebuilt the incentive and comp plan we rebuilt the sales process we scaled the sales team and we stabilized it so that we were consistently beating the other team and doing it for less then we're able to move on to step five which is get rid of outsourced team so with the ouse team we did $7 million in cash collected in q1 the commission on that was 1.
(4:11:18) $4 million remember 20% so the company got to profit 5.6 I'm saying profit Loosely 5.6 the company got to keep after paying the sale the out Outsource sales team this 7% with the in-house sales team became $12 million the next quarter the commission because instead of 20% we went to 9% so the commission went from 1.4 million on 7 to 1.
(4:11:51) 08 million for 12 net change here was 12us 1 10.92 million which created the difference between these two was 5.4 million and that was just in that quarter times four for the year and you get 21.6 million this is one of my favorite sales presentations I've ever given and it covers three things one how to ask the right questions two how to ask them the right way and three how to duplicate those words in that tone across a team of people if you're building your first sales script if you're scaling a sales team and you want to make sure that you can onboard new
(4:12:33) people and get them selling at the same percentage or better than you are right now which for many people is biggest bottleneck especially when you're coming to for your first million or first 3 million per year scaling the sales team is one of the most difficult tasks and so I've broken this down into three Frameworks that I've used very successfully to scale lots of different sales teams I say that the the company I'm referencing in this video has 14 that one company already now has almost 30 sales guys so this process continued to work past when I made this
(4:12:58) presentation so if you're trying to scale sales you want to close a higher percentage you want to get more guys closing at that same percentage or better than yours and if you don't know who I am my name is alosi I acquisition.
(4:13:10) comom with a portfolio at this moment of six companies to do $85 million a year keep being awesome love you and enjoy the video what I'm going to be breaking down today is the scripting process that we've applied for calls right and so as the world's worst marketer I set my first email this year I was very excited about it we've been in business for 10 years uh pretty big stuff and it was because I couldn't get webinars I couldn't get vsls I couldn't get all the fancy stuff that you guys get to work um and so I went back in time and just was like if I can just get him to give my phone number I'll be able to get him to you like buy [ __ ] from me and so I went and called
(4:13:40) back all these webinar leads that never showed up or never bought or whatever and then doing like 100,000 in sales in a day and I was like wow this is so much easier and so over time I've consulted with sales teams I've uh trained and owned four high ticket uh performance teams uh I think we have 12 or 14 sales guys now it kind of rotates and so what I want to do is kind of show you what we've done to consistently replicate the skill of sales another human being would that be cool all right so if I can add like 10% to your conversion rate in terms of how you attract better closers
(4:14:12) how you script the process out and how you should close more deals and scale them to incentivize them would that be valuable for you guys all right sweet so these are the three Frameworks that transform losing funnels in cash machines that was my real life that was a picture of my actual first funnel and that's what it became and so these are the three fail uh the Frameworks number one closure framework how to ask questions that prospects to say yes adding this to a funnel instantly can make it profitable right this is my personal experience number two is
(4:14:38) conviction framework all right how anyone who believes can outperform a seasoned sales rep by simply learning control control their tone really important this is one of the biggest things that most sales people Miss number three the scaling framework how to easily duplicate this process across sales people in any niche in seven days or less so seven days from now we can do this would that be cool all right let's rock so number one the closure framework after going through hundreds of scripts I've bought Grant stuff I bought the
(4:15:04) Wolf of Wall Street stuff I bought all that stuff and going through my own sales processes I learned that the the scripting process even was simpler I think than it's portrayed and it's not that it's something to be sold against but um every sales script that has been absolute Gang Busters has been a question-based framework that is based on this process all right and this works for B Toc sales it works for B Tob uh B2B sales it works for $500 tickets it works for $100,000 tickets the process is the same and so this is the acronym closure framework as I said world's dumbest marketer so I made it nice and
(4:15:34) easy to remember all right so C clarify why they are there when I look at creating a script the first thing we ask is like why the hell are you here what mean you reach out to us today what was the thing what is the goal you're trying to accomplish right two label them with a problem we can't cure cancer unless they admit that they have it right has anyone had a situation where like I just want to find out more information you ever had that right well it's like well I'm assuming you're not hopping on sales
(4:15:59) calls all day just trying to find information is there a problem you're trying to solve oh you're fat got it all right boom so that's a problem we can solve it after that I'm I'm assuming I'm not the first guy you've ever dated right so is there anything else that you've had happen in the past that got you here that didn't work I'd love to know more about it s once we've gone through the pain we sell on the vacation right there's a process that I'll walk through e we explain away their concerns cuz obviously samean people don't make
(4:16:22) decisions on the first call unless you're a closer in which case they do which I'll talk about and then finally and this is something that we actually added in my original flamework for my first couple years was close and then we added the r uh because when you do this it actually transitions into the onboarding process that will get higher LTV per customer lower churn lower refunds lower charge backs which sales guys and you will be happy about cool all right let's rock so we'll examine each one more closely clarify why they're there these are the questions that sounds like what made you come in today what made you reach out what's
(4:16:54) your goal right now why is that important to you why that number specifically what does it what does it resonate for you right why why is that real L the questions that we're looking is like okay so what I'm hearing is XYZ us your goal does that sound about right right really simple but very important it's a milestone that has to be hit in the process all right then we overview all right this is where we're Gathering all the inel and for some of you guys my goal is that you can take this to your sales team your sales director and run
(4:17:18) your script through this framework and then see where you can plug in you probably have some of it but if you're missing one or two of these questions and Milestones you're losing conversions on the call like you're closing people who already had those obstacles covered but everyone who didn't have two of these questions covered you lose them and you don't know why you watch the sales call you're like what the hell happened here right so what have you tried so far to accomplish that how this is what we call the pain cycle it's a
(4:17:43) four-step process what have you tried so far to accomplish this how long did you do that for how long ago how did that work for you what else have you tried right so we just do that cycle until they're like well yeah that's it now that you think about it I've tried everything under the sun like I can't imagine what that's felt like wow right it's not your fault you're so close you're 6 Ines away right and I think you you said this one thing which I'm about to show you in a second we could be able to help you want to hear about the program fantastic that's when we
(4:18:12) transition to the sale right right so sell them a vacation the number one thing that people mess up our sales pitch on the call is under 3 minutes 3 minutes 180 seconds when we talk about um I think someone was asking about what are the bullets on the page we don't say anything about that because what we're trying to do is get them to understand what they're going to experience not how they're going to experience it right and so when we have a sales pitch just about every time we sell three things right and it doesn't matter what industry you're in I was
(4:18:42) training mortgage leads team and they were selling leads right and it was like uh the leads are exclusive they're timely and they're qualified right and so we talked about hey you've had leads in the past ah well the Zillow leads my real estate people right the Zillow leads are not they are timely but they're definitely not exclusive and these are people just window shopping right our leads are different three things you can always find them your s fitness your own Fitness Nutrition accountability right and so what we do is when we say the three bullets get them to understand yes that takes 5
(4:19:12) Seconds cool fitness-wise we get the commitment this is what I need you to do fair enough be like I need you to work out three days a week can you do that awesome if we see any hesitation you have a 30second story that's memorized most of this script and this is what makes it scalable is a question-based framework which means if you get lost you can find your way back again if anybody here have scripts that are like paragraphs and stuff anyone okay like no no one has a script that's paragraphs and Pages please we all know um but if you have those things
(4:19:44) it'll totally mess it up because then the the sales guy gets lost and then he's just freeballing and he has no idea where he is hot doging a hallway no idea what's going on right and so the point is here little visual anyways is that when we're telling the story like with the fitness example I would say hey when you failed in the past like right now do you have a do you have a favorite TV show Game of Thrones that's awesome do you feel like like you got to get motivated to watch Game of Thrones you're like oh man I've been wanting to watch it but I just can't get up the motivation to watch TV they're like well
(4:20:14) no I don't have that it's like right and so that's exactly how we're going to make your fitness program so if you look forward to you don't need the motivation The Willpower because that's why you fail in the past they're like oh I didn't talk about the workouts the heart rate and the calories they're going to burn and they're going to sweat cuz all that [ __ ] sounds like work right but what they do get is exactly what they want which is wait so you're telling me that if I actually like something I'm not going to even have to try and it's going to feel like watching TV cuz I
(4:20:42) look forward to it it's exactly what I'm saying and if you can deliver you make tons of money and that's the point so each of those points your sales guy should know what that anecdotal story is right if I was selling accountability anyone have kids anyone here tell their kids to brush their teeth and we have their kids to brush their teeth say they don't want to brush their teeth anyone tell their kids even though they want to brush their teeth to brush their teeth anyways and now you're an adult did your parents did that to you do you brush your teeth that's an example of external
(4:21:14) accountability turning into an internal habit it's exactly what the accountability we're going to do in this program indust does that make sense great done next bullet that's how you transition in the pitch right so if you think about this process why are you here I have cancer I think we might be able to help you out but I don't want to get into that because I don't know about you like I don't know what your situation is tell me what you've done ah that sounds that sounds great that makes sense okay I think we might be able to help see a little bit about that all I
(4:21:39) did is I tell three stories that make complete sense to everything you just told me and then we transition and so um I pretty much just covered this um but we we call it sell on the vacation not the plane flight right and so we're not selling TSA we're not selling your modules your me plant your macr workout your sport team your URLs your whatever right we're selling Maui we're selling the Final Destination and it doesn't matter what level of service you are selling you're always selling the same thing it's always Maui it's just how do you want to get there you want to swim to Maui right do you want to take a boat
(4:22:09) to Maui do you want to take a normal flight or do you want to take a private jet to Maui right it's your call you're getting to Mau either way because we're a man of our word and I'm not going to sell you something that's not going to deliver right but it's going to be a little different it's a little bit rock here but we're going to get you there all right so everyone gets the Maui the variables are the the speed and the quality of the journey all right the likelihood of arrival is assumed so since it's always the same thing you probably have multiple levels of business um but it's always the same
(4:22:33) process right and so once we have that they're like got it then we just make the ask all right from this point going forward it's explaining way their concerns like any human being would normally do I could drill price over comes with you but I think it's more valuable to explain the thought process behind price stall and decision maker um objections all right so the first and obvious one is I can't afford it anyone to get this one right couple people two people of God in the you guys have the best leads give me your leads um and so
(4:23:04) the easy question that I use to explain to our sales team because it's really about breaking their Le beliefs is if we were giving away Ferraris right now for five grand do you think they'd find a way to get the money yes so that simply they do not understand the value we're trying to provide and if you can get your team to believe that then they understand that it is always their fault if someone cannot afford the program does that make sense fantastic second decisionmaker clothes one of the hardest things to
(4:23:33) overcome right I got to have my business partner I got to have my husband my spouse my whatever right so we have a specific process that we go about this and so what we do is in the very beginning we just say we circumvent then we go over past agreements and then we ask for forgiveness all right this is the best way that I've seen to overcome this so the first thing we say is well what if they say no one out of three times they'll be like I'd probably do it anyways and we're like let's get started boom it's done you'd be amazed how many
(4:24:00) times that actually works it's hilarious if they say well then I wouldn't do it then we divert we say well what do you think their biggest objection would be about it because now they're just using a foil even the person's not there and has no idea what the program is cuz they're not involved with call right they're like well I think this and at this point we can attack the actual obstacle even though the decision maker isn't there now if they still if we still can't overcome it then we go to P agreements we say well does your business partner know you guys are struggling on sales well yeah does he
(4:24:27) approve of that well no then why would he be against something that he already doesn't approve of that doesn't make any sense why would he be against a business partner solving a problem is know what you do well that's great you're being a great partner let's go right and so we try and rely on past agreements that are obvious and use those to Pro into the present right and then finally you know sometimes it's better ask for uh forgiveness and permission right and so we'll tack that on to the end you can
(4:24:51) put that at the end of any of the closes and so when we're dealing with this with price it's value with decision maker we go on past agreements and with stalls we just teach people to make decisions people are just so afraid of making the wrong decision they're petrified and so what we do is we literally teach them on the call here's how we make a decision these are the the variables you should be considering X Y and Z right can the product meet your needs do you think that if you work with us you have a greater or lower likelihood of losing
(4:25:21) weight greater fantastic I think we're halfway there do you want to work with us do you think it'd be fun to hang out and see me every day because believe me this stash I had to I had to work 12 months to get my wife to say yes to that so I understand if you're hesitant does that make sense would you be willing to do that all right let's rock right and then do you have access to funds or know someone who does right because it's not just about you because if it's something that's amazing we can find other ways to finance this so do you have access or
(4:25:46) know someone who does yes well then great let's get started and if for some reason we haven't closed them at this point we say how about this let's take a card down we'll delay the payment to Friday you go to your husband you go to your business partner right you go to your I love this one you go to your husband right and he says baby I want you to live a shorter life I want you to I want you to be a terrible example to our kids I want you to not have generational Health in our family to be down I want you to sit in that corner I want you to pull those sweatpants up
(4:26:16) take up a bag of Cheetos rub your fingers on there right and just get comfortable with the fact that you're never going to look better than you are right now I like if your husband says that to you you call me back and I will tear this contract up fair enough right you close them all right so we explain where their concerns and then finally we get the yes we reinforce the decision this is stuff that we started doing and it helped a lot so personalized video from the CEO hey welcome aboard so happy to have you thank you for trusting us with your business hey we're so happy to have you you thank you for trust me with your your weight loss Journey know personalized this is we want to do
(4:26:45) everything in our power to absolutely Amaze you right little things like that because the customer is usually deciding whether or not they like your business in the first 48 hours after the sale I learned this later so how you hand off from sale to customer experience and activation is where this all happens does that make sense is that cool was that nice love framework to work through okay so that's the disclosure framework that is the first thing that's what you can run your script through all right how to ask the questions to get the
(4:27:11) prospects to say yes check one down two to go you with me you still good all right let's rock so conviction framework number two how anyone who believes can outperform a season sales rep by simply learning to control their tone all right so um after I reworked all of our scripts using the closure framework um some of my guys were really successful but other ones still blew and I was like well this sucks right I was really excited I had a little acronym and everything I was like that took me a long time to come with
(4:27:42) the acronym right and I was like what gives and so I talked to some my friends um and they recommended this book which was awesome and the biggest takeaway from this book is the is the concept of tone and this was something that really helped take us and give an extra Edge for our sales training ourselves process and the coaching that we give people right and so in the book he talked about the hidden dialogue um which I just love and I just I just never want to take credit for an idea because I got it from him um but there's two dialogues that are happening right um because the words
(4:28:12) or the logic right what you're actually saying is talking to The Logical brain how you say it is talking to the emotional brain right that's the one's making decision that's the one running the shop all right and so how you say what you say is what you say so here's an example that's my wife she's going to be here with me soon but if she were here if she said Alex right or Alex right or Alex very different meanings very different afternoon for me in each of these scenarios right based on how she said it because there's so much communicated and that's just one word imagine a 30 minute
(4:28:56) dialogue where each word can be chosen to have packed with the meaning that you need them to feel does that make sense okay so we need the words for The Logical influence we need the tone for the emotional influence we need both okay and so once you become a more seasoned like sales crap you can learn to control your tone on purpose right you can raise your voice at the end of the statement to make it into a question right it's a question this is John right I didn't need to ask him I'm saying you know to answer that as a question I didn't ask you that but you know that based on the tone right or I
(4:29:31) could lower my voice right now you know that what I'm saying extremely important right tone matters and so it takes time to develop this level of unconscious Mastery so there's two ways to develop this and I believe that you can either trick yourself into it or you can train yourself into it and since I don't have enough time in 30 minutes to train on the influence of tonalities here's the trick is that all right I'll just give you the hack conviction will correct your tone if you believe in what you sell you will say it the right way and that's why
(4:30:03) some of you guys have a sales rep it comes on crushes it and then tanks because they did believe and then they saw your reviews or they got customer support feedback someone called them up after buying it was like [ __ ] you I can't believe you did that and they're done and then all their tones off because they feel like out of Ethics right and so I'm lowering my tone right now so you know that this is really important right and so I'll go upbeat kiss the boooo bring us back up all right and so real estate sales team Consulting this is a great story so I
(4:30:32) was flown out paid way more money than I should have been paid um to fly out and consult with the sales team all right they were selling mortgage leads example I was giving earlier and they were really excited and they wanted me to give this ABC always be closing chat like this huge PumpUp chat and so I spent the first half of the day on the script and the second half of the day we're supposed to be drilling the sales team right so I get on the sales team they got I think had a nine person sales floor and uh they're like we're having some problems with this guy John I was
(4:30:58) like all cool so I was like John how good are the leads he was like well you know there's kind of and I was like I'm good thank you and I was like because if you [ __ ] thought the leads were were good you would say dude they're unreal I can't believe it right now I'm getting my mom to pass her real estate certification so I can start sending her leads I'm studying for mine I'm a couple months behind but I'm telling you as soon as I [ __ ] get this thing pass I'm out of here I'm G to start buying these leads myself because I make more than I make right now as a sales guy that's what you'd say if you
(4:31:30) believed right the way you say and what you'd say would be entirely different and so one of the hacks on this by the way has anyone ever gotten hot or has a sales guy who got hot starts just closing closing closing closing anyone that becomes a sales training for that person because the way they asked the question at what point how they closed that's how it's perfect and so they should study the best game footage when they're on a streak and that's when you can replicate it much more easily because it's like in the wild you'll witness it and that's when they're Masters right in those moments all right and so these are the actions that we do
(4:32:03) so I'm transitioning into tactic for you guys who have teams all right reread the testimonials out loud daily in front of your sales team if you got fresh ones which you should read them makes their day makes them feel like they're making an impact right they're getting the [ __ ] kicked out of them every single day getting hung up on getting cussed at getting told a [ __ ] off every day right and like the best thing you can do is give them a cup of coffee and says hey man you're [ __ ] doing good in the
(4:32:26) world right that's what they need so do it every day number two fix everything you can about the product this is obvious but I want to say it directly like don't blame the customer for a lack of success because it doesn't help anyone right doesn't help them doesn't help us if we can take ownership then we can fix the product right three never stop improving it so you always know it's up to date and this is a good one for the sales team if you're sales dip take your head of customer support bring them to the sales meeting and say Erica tell these guys what you do for our customers they're like oh well the first
(4:32:55) day what we do is we send them this text and we send them this letter and then we give them swag and then we follow up with them and then we like write them a handwritten card and we give them a back massage and a foot massage and then we find a wife for them it's unbelievable you know what I mean and then the sales guys are like God this is [ __ ] awesome I'm like I know let's go sell it right and so these are the actions that you can do on a daily basis to get your team to be excellent all right and so that's how you can hack
(4:33:16) conviction and get your team's tone unconsciously correct by just truly believing in the product is that cool you think you'd sell more if you did that hell yeah sweet thank you all right conviction framework number two check all right number three scaling framework how to easily duplicate this process across sales people in any niche in seven days or less all right so we've talked about closure framework we talked about conviction framework and this is the oops I think I going to skip one oh no where you are back great so when I
(4:33:43) showed my sales team this stuff they didn't do it every time all right because you're probably going to come back from here all gung-ho you might show them this video and they're like yeah and they go raw ra for two to three days and then it's like back to normal right no one wants that so piece by piece we implemented processes to get the same outcome over and over and over again because of the $10 million we've sold which is crazy it's been 100% over the phone no one over the age of 20 no we got one guy who's 40 but Bey besides him everyone's younger than $27 $27 27
(4:34:14) years old all right like these aren't like crazy you know what I mean like crazy veterans right they just do this process over again you get the right thing as a total aside find people and educate them about your prospect not your product that's a big [ __ ] up because like they shouldn't even be talking that much about the product they should be knowing everything about the Prospect and so right now if your sales training is focused on your product Doing It Wrong these are the six C's that I use to scale teams from little guy to lots of guys all right so this still a you
(4:34:47) know we Ed this to build a 3,000 person affiliate base in our physical Products Company it added 35 million in sales which is cool which is awesome and so I will show you how this works all right and so um we've used these sales teams and this is how we've kind of these were all multi-figure teams and I'll show you what we did all right so closure sequence is the first C which we went over earlier the second C is consistent daily training and conviction and I'll show you how to do each of these call
(4:35:11) recordings you got to record them communication Cycles cuts and competition those are the six C's all right so number one make sure you have a question based framework that follows those steps in the script it should just be questions it's so much easier to just follow questions because if someone's out and you know out in left field you know wandering on like onto the highway you're like whoa hey come back over here this is the next question in this process so thank you so much for sharing that that must have been so hard for you so what do you think that brought right you go right into the next question the sale all right
(4:35:42) number two uh consistent daily training this is the number one thing if you take one thing away from this besides conviction because that'll do more for yourselves than anything this is the second biggest thing all right is that daily training our team trains 60 minutes a day five days a week we actually do twice a day stuff but that's okay anyways for right now if you just do this you'll already be way better than everyone else in your in your Market all right so we do talking and listening because a salesperson needs to know how to speak the right tone you know how to listen right and so we drill
(4:36:10) both scales we're talking we have them read the script out loud and the questions with the correct tonality for 25 minutes and if they [ __ ] up they start again simple five minutes we drill obstacle overcomes I need to think about it I'm not sure I don't have the money can't afford that right now I got to talk to my partner right I know what's going to work in my market or whatever your specific obstacles are because those when they're in the Red Zone they shouldn't have to think about those so the only two things that someone will ever truly memorize will be those 30
(4:36:39) second anecdotal stories I mentioned earlier and your obstacle overcomes it makes it much easier to get new people on the team listening so every day we listen to a 30 minute recording and we'll go with what went right in this call what went wrong what are you going to do next time very simple right you play the call everyone watches it's game tape review we're like man you got kicked in the balls on this one right but you had great report in the first 5 minutes right um you're like what went wrong and that was about it um and what you going to do next time I'm going to transition from the report of the question asking without sounding
(4:37:16) like a douchebag fantastic all right next day and you continue to improve I know this sounds crazy simple but it's so simple no one will do it so number three C's is call recordings if you don't call like record your calls one you're not compliant but two like how are you going to study game film you know what I mean everybody's got all their data and you've got your mouse tracking on all the pages I'm like how where's the mouse tracking on the calls right that's where that's where you're going to train your team this is like every NBA team they play game and they watch the game footage right why are we not doing that with the sales team and
(4:37:45) so you have to record it if you use zoom gong is absolutely the best highly recommend it it's been awesome we us this for two years they'll tell you exactly how many minutes people are talking versus someone else they'll tell you who's talking the most where how many questions were asked if the AI they have there is unbelievable um it's expensive but it's worth it four com cycles and feedback um I don't know if you guys have heard the story but if I were trying to uh fix your golf swing right and I said okay so I take a swing
(4:38:12) looking like I do like a like an idiot right he's like all right man well first off lose 40 lbs so you can rotate all right after you do that uh change your wrist by two degrees turn your other hand over put your thumb underneath I need you to take your first foot put it forward and then point it the other way and then put this foot back and try again I'm [ __ ] no chance of swinging right but if he just said hey take another 20 swins and just put one thumb under the other one I'd have one thing to work on I could probably get better and so when you're training and this is for the sales directors if you're helping them out with that call what
(4:38:45) went right what went wrong the what am I going to do about it is the one thing do that makees sense and so in terms of communication Cycles we do weekly with the team we've got daily training we've got daily wrap-up at the end which is really just to pump up and kiss them on the forehead good night to make sure they feel okay right because they do get punched in the face all day so it's it's worth being like hey you see Derrick's overcome this morning it's [ __ ] awesome he killed it let's watch that as
(4:39:09) like highlight footage like watch him say he's going to have to talk to wife Bo overcome right and then and then they're like dude you killed it and then it just makes them feel like they're part of the team right and so that's where we do the feedback and the communication cycles and then we do once a once a week if they're new we'll do one of ones if they're a little bit older we'll do once every other week does that make sense can you use this right now what I'm giving you for your sales teams okay sweet number five cut the fat cut it
(4:39:34) fast um Randy probably knows this better than anyone when you hire sales people at least in my experience like it's Sinker swim like if a guys if guys can't close in the first week to two weeks unless it's some sort of crazy complex thing they ain't closing right and then I've got somebody who now came in neutral now they feel like they suck right they're actually worse than someone who's new because now I got to overcome all your beliefs and then bring you back up and so in my experience it's been much easier to take a six and get him to a nine than try and take than try and take a two and get him to a five it's more
(4:40:07) work and it's not good for me or him right does that make sense so in most cases does anyone have a salesperson that you've been waiting for them to turn the corner for the last like six months they're not going to turn the corner unless they have like a come to Jesus moment which does happen but it doesn't need to happen on my team you can do that and come back right all right number six competition and career path all right A big one so salespeople are competitive right as they should be right they are hunters and they should go hunt and so having competition on a
(4:40:38) regular basis what we have found is that six we Cycles tends to work best it is long enough that believe they can accomplish something but short enough they believe it's going to happen soon and so we run our competitions on six we Cycles um for us I think what you said uh whatever Ryan said about the percentages 10 to 15% actually works pretty well as like a group goal um when we have those as like top salesperson we like we did like weekend to Vegas so we'll split all the guys up we like four teams of four you know what I mean and
(4:41:02) they're all comp so it's like you get the the competitiveness but you still get the camaraderie CU if it's just one you know one versus everyone sometimes they can get um a little bit too you know teethy uh so having like little mini teams helps too because then you can you can kind of like make it an adjusted draft you can put the best guy with the worst guy and then he helps him out and he speeds him up does that make sense and then career path this is one that I probably learned later but it's really good is that you can have minor
(4:41:27) Minor Road uh Milestones like 50 deals closed 100 deals closed 150 deals closed right and they just get a little just a little you know they go from 500 a deal to 525 a deal right they go from 525 a deal to 550 a deal just the fact fact that there's this this road map of where they're going and there's actual progress because sales is one of the most repetitive positions in the world just the fact that they're doing this and they something is changing on the outside I think just helps relieve anxiety and help the guys Focus so that
(4:41:57) is one of the things that I would recommend doing um with the career path and then obviously if you have roles like depending how big your team is manager Etc and you can move up um something that I don't have on here that I will add is that um this seems to be common practice but remember dumbest marketer on Earth um outbound and inbound uh keep them separated we also have Setters and closers for both of those teams so outbound sets are different than inbound sets which go to different in closers on either side right because the prospects are a little bit different right and so if you if you
(4:42:27) have lots of different types of leads going to the same person you're probably losing a lot of efficiency and if you don't have that much lead flow that's another issue but it's it's as soon as you can separating them out will get you a lot a lot higher conversion rates all right so I'll recap this this six for scale in our closure sequence make sure it's in a question based framework daily trainings and conviction so you're reading the testimonies every day you're training them every morning on talking listing the most valuable skills that a
(4:42:50) Salesman can have call recordings to make sure that they're actually doing you have game tap footage to actually look at communication Cycles to actually improve on their skills based on the game footage that we just had you cut the bottom people who are just dragging the team down that probably just don't have the makeup for this and then you keep it competitive and you give them a career past so they have something to look forward to in the future all right and so uh now you can understand how anyone can sell expensive FX paper Pro even if you don't think you're any good
(4:43:13) which is completely normal yeah that's sales

Brutally Honest Advice to my Poorer Younger Self - YouTube

Transcript:
(00:00) this is more brutally honest advice to my younger poor self this advice is only for somebody who wants to make more money grow in their business grow in themselves people obsessed with their morning routines make less money than people obsessed with making money people work sacrifice and then they get rich then they fill their time with weird routines then they forget how they got rich in the first place and then they tell other people the weird routines made them Rich rather than what they actually did which is whatever it took
(00:26) not some 3-hour morning routine there was a kid who dm' me who said hey I've been working with this business coach and he has me doing a morning routine could not make this up after I do my grounded walking I do my gratitude Journal I do my list for the day I do my ice plunge it's like after I do that he takes me about 3 hours in the morning to get all that done he's like I barely have any energy to like actually get work done I just said I'm going to give you the biggest hack in the world cut the 3-hour morning routine replace it
(00:54) with 3 hours of work and I promise you'll get more done and he messaged me back a week later he was like dude it changed my whole life I'm getting so much done now I was like what a [ __ ] concept if you work more more gets done and I love just looking at this it's like what actions do I have to take to get what I want anything that is not that is a distraction from it period if it takes you 5 minutes to feel 20% better and you can actually measure that your output goes up by 20% Then cool that makes sense so I'm not I'm not
(01:17) against doing things I'm against doing things for the sake of doing them and so one of the biggest issues with learning and education as humans do it is that we make correlations to things that are approximate they're close to another tall people play basketball I should play basketball to get tall we make these very mistaken correlations but we should look at is what it took to get there not what they're doing now so the better advice is to look at what someone was doing on their way up in the grind mirror that
(01:44) more than what they're currently doing at the top of the mountain so it would be like assuming warm Buffett is Rich because he drinks Coke I drink probably 5 12 ounce Cokes a day all you have to do also on the cories are there other people who drink Coke who aren't Rich I've had probably 10 different podcasts seed the premise do you think that the fact that you had a hard childhood has created the success today and I would say no I would say the work that I did created the success and all we have to do is look at all the other people who
(02:11) had bad childhoods who aren't successful and I think there are way more of those than there are that are to prove that it actually has nothing to do with who's successful there's also people who didn't have bad childhoods who are successful too and so it's just that many people have bad childhoods some of them become successful and so that's why trying to figure out why something happen happened I have spent less and less of my effort trying to do that and only look at what actions created a result rather than looking at intention
(02:40) or anything else that's a morphous that can't be measured 30 isn't the new 20 it's an excuse to take 10 years longer to accomplish the same thing you can die when you're done until then keep going in your 20s you're young you can [ __ ] around it doesn't matter cuz life is long number one that assumes that you're not going to die if you're in your 30s you know someone someone in your high school class who died and it's not just the drug overdose people it's the people who got shot got in a car accident had a
(03:05) weird brain cancer I've had all of those things happened to people that I went to high school with in one way I think it's a little bit arrogant to assume that you're just going to live because it means you can waste your life and I I wholeheartedly stand against that the second translation around that that I think has hurt a lot of people is that they can do what I would consider dead-end jobs and that means jobs that don't have any direct correlation to your personal growth has nothing to do with pay you can work for free and grow
(03:31) more than anyone else this is not saying that you need to go into a season of earning in your 20s but you do need to be setting yourself up for growth in my opinion if you want the big ultimate outcome and so most people that at least consume my stuff they want to be better they want to grow they want to get in better shape they want to have better relationships they want to have a better business they want to be you know bigger in every way they want to expand if you spend the decade of your 20s not growing
(03:57) and not investing in your skills and your education if if you do that in your 30s you're going to be further behind than someone who starts in their 20s you're going to be a decade behind you know nowadays there's kids who are starting the entrepreneurial Journey when they're like 13 and so when they're 23 they're Mr Beast he's young but he's actually pretty old in business terms CU a lot of people start their business journey in their mid-40s and so if they're 50 years old and started their business 5 years ago Mr Beast has twice
(04:20) the amount of time in the ring under the bar that they do for me I want to start my time clock on paying down my ignorance debt as fast as seemingly possible because the debt is a constant for everyone all of us are trying to pay down that debt as fast as we can and taking a decade arguably one of the most productive Decades of your life and not paying down that debt you just sit in such a deficit compared to your peer group some people might watch this and be 30 or 40 or 50 and be like well [ __ ] I took the wrong advice from the wrong
(04:46) guy guess what you're going to die it's not going to matter anyways big deal whatever the best time to do this was start when you were 10 and get born to an entrepreneurial parent who got you in their small business and invested in all of your education as a homeschooled student and taught you all the ways of of the of the Jedi but you probably didn't have that and so the second was time is to start now because let's play out the alternative how much does it serve you to just say I guess I have no chance okay die there's nothing left for me to
(05:13) do I will relinquish the remainder of my living days and years because I choose to lose and that's a choice and if you want that that's cool the idea of quitting simply because you're older because you didn't do something everybody doesn't do things that they know they should be doing now and that's because you're always going to know more in the future than you do in the past and so it's a faulty premise to say that I'm not going to take action today because I didn't know something in the past everyone doesn't know anything in
(05:42) the past but all you can do is take action with what you know today and by taking action you have learned and so you actually take one step to making your first payment on ignorance debt through actions not words I mean I think a lot of people know the story of the 30-year-old Barista if you love that then do it you know what I mean like I have no judgment on what you do do if you don't love that and you wish you were doing something else that's what I would say I have a problem with which is why are you not doing it and I think
(06:08) diving into that which is usually some sort of fear some sort of anxiety some sort of label that they believed that isn't true from someone else and just trying to Zone in on like why am I not doing it and taking two steps closer to it not just like because I don't know what I'm doing well duh okay neither does anyone what are you doing about that just defining it to what actions am I going to take as a result just makes life a lot easier what does figured out mean it means that I'm going to read 2 hours a night on a specific subject
(06:31) until I feel like I can make a decision within 30 days on what I'm going to do great that is something I can do and I can measure whether I did it or not you have seasons of earning and you have seasons of learning I had this kid who reached out he was 18 years old said he was going to edit videos for us when he came in he said I want $100,000 a year as an editor as a starting job his reasoning was that somebody else had offered him that amount of money I want to make this statement because I think it's logic iCal and also stupid if
(07:01) you're optimizing for your earning potential in your 20s you're missing the [ __ ] point this individual had the potential to be on a team that has a massively globally recognized brand in terms of media and from there learn how to be way better than they currently are and then become a creative director at another company or at one of my portfolio companies like that is the career path and instead was comparing that to something that you would make $100,000 a year and be the only person in the depart department and no one
(07:30) there knew anything about media and so he wasn't going to learn he was going to earn whereas somebody who got into the big leagues and learned 10 times the skill set then 10 years later is either starting a multi-million dollar company or heading up a multi-million dollar division in a billion dollar company and the potential is so much wider because 10 years from now someone says what's your experience it's like well I I worked at a real estate firm and I made their social media content who gives a [ __ ] whereas if you're like I work for
(07:58) one of the biggest media companies out there everyone will give you the job offer and that is when you can choose to earn over learn but people make the trade too soon because they compare themselves to people on social media and think that the .1% is the norm whenever you choose to earn rather than learn you're right hooking life and saying I'm no longer going to develop and this is good enough and so if $100,000 a year is actually good enough for your long-term goals then do it but I would imagine that it probably isn't for what you really want
(08:25) to do long term and I'm using 100 you know six figures as a as a placeholder it can be whatever number you want when you make that decision that you're no longer going to learn that's when you stop growing your potential to learn more I say this because that's what I did I had a white Coller consulting job for defense Contracting I had a top secret clearance I had everything that looked good on paper space I intelligence I had a two to threee path clearly for for getting an MBA at an IV League school and then decided to drop
(08:49) all of that and start working for $13 an hour at a gym after I graduated magn klady in 3 years from banderol I know what I'm asking people to do and I'm not asking them to do something that I wasn't willing to do and I think that I might have even a more extreme version that most people are having to live with trying to say like well I can't figure out what I want is a really paralyzing place to be that I think a lot of young people are in is like I want to find my passion but the big misnomer is actually a language issue which is that people
(09:15) say they want to find their passion rather than they want to build it or create it or learn it and so like I can promise you that if you're good at something you'll like doing it and the only way that you get good at something is by doing things you suck at and doing a lot of it so let's say you make $50,000 a year it cost you $950,000 a year not to know how to make a million do a year so how much is that education worth answer the difference the difference between $1 million and $50,000 which is $950 Grand if you learn how to make a million the
(09:46) education is worth the difference this is why education and information are the most valuable things that we can know Elon has like lost everything and then gain it back so many of the best off Runners have stories where they lost it all and then gain it back and so how is it that they can go to to zero back to a billion where somebody starting at zero can't get there because they didn't lose the education they didn't lose the learnings they had a bad role and sometimes in business you do make bets on markets and sometimes they don't
(10:11) shape up but you didn't lose and a lot of times you actually gain in experience so that the next bet pays off even bigger everyone gets this wrong the most expensive thing you ever pay for isn't your car it isn't your house it isn't your insurance it's the information that you don't know but should I mean how many things can you think of right now that if you knew 10 years ago would have materially changed your financial outcome your relational outcome your physical outcomes probably a lot what is the value of that information borderline
(10:39) Priceless and so the idea that we wouldn't invest in paying down that debt of ignorance that we owe the universe is just because we don't know who we're paying the check to every month for the things that we don't know that we don't value it appropriately the cost of success is the years of feeling like an idiot for things that you should have known by now all the the decisions that I made up to to this point led me to hear and I don't regret my life so I don't regret not knowing I mean if I started over I'd be wealthier than I am
(11:05) now you know what I mean I can't go back in time but if I could go back in time to talk to my 20-year-old self and it wouldn't change the outcome of my life now cuz I would never roll that dice is I would say there's two things that you don't understand that will massively change your life you don't understand brand and you don't understand product because I was obsessive in my 20s on sales and marketing and what I would consider fast money I had fast feedback loops so I would I get better at sales and then I
(11:30) immediately make more sales I get better marketing immediately make more money and so I had this very fast feedback loop that gave me the misinformation or the false belief that this was the right path but I was actually just playing the wrong game because it's kind of like in The Matrix when Neo says to morphus so you're saying when I'm fast enough I'll be able to dodge bullets and he said no I'm saying when you're ready you won't have to me being obsessive about sales and marketing was me trying to get faster and faster in the Matrix and not
(11:57) being the one and seeing the code for what it is which is that if you make a product that's good enough people will do the marketing and sales for you if your brand is strong enough people will make the association that they want to buy your stuff regardless of how good your copy and your headline and your landing pages and your conversion rate optimization and your media buying are I kept getting really good at a game that if I knew how to master the big things that mattered would make those skills almost irrelevant when $100 million
(12:24) offers came out the book I didn't make it for anything I made it for me and it was originally intended to be an internal document and so I just wanted to make it exceptional and what happened once I released it is what shocked me the most was that I posted once and I just said hey I wrote this book I hope you guys like it and then we sold out in minutes and I was like that's weird the next month more copies sold and then the next month more copies sold and then the next month more copies sold and it's continued to sell more copies month
(12:46) after month after month for 2 years and it's still number one in its category on Amazon and that was with zero paid marketing purely off of people telling people about the book and so when I saw how much leverage that was that that book sells thousands a day not dollars thousands of copies a day I have never marketed anything well enough to sell a thousand customers a day now mind you I've always had more expensive stuff that I've sold but like I'd never seen that kind of transaction volume and the only way to get that kind of transaction
(13:15) volume is to have a huge amount of Leverage The Leverage that product unlocked for me or that understanding was that if you make it good enough and I love this saying which is there's too big to fail and I love the other which is too good to fail my headline for $100 million off offers makes no sense no one knows what $100 million offers is and it's just like a picture of a $100 bill it's a big purple book like it actually makes no sense but the contents of the book were valuable enough that people were like
(13:38) just just read it and they said it so many times to so many people and most people who when I see the comments and I see the reviews they say I had four different people in the same month tell me in different groups that I should read this book so I decided to do it even though it looked hokey and oh my God this thing is unbelievable and then they tell 20 people or 100 people that was when I realized how much Leverage spending more time upfront on building a better product would unlock for me what I used to do was spend 2 months building
(14:05) a good product and spend two years marketing that product with great marketing rather than spending two years on a great product and then for the rest of my life not having to spent any dollars or effort on marketing so that it would sell again and again and again because of the quality of the product itself and so that was the first lesson that my younger self needed to understand about business and the level of detail that it takes to go from good to Great is so much wider than people think it is the difference between an
(14:33) eight and a nine is 10 times the wor the difference between 9 and 9 and a half is 10 times the work the difference between 9 and a half and 9.75 is another 10 times the work it's so much more effort and honestly when I was younger I couldn't even comprehend the amount of work that I can do now and for me that amount of work is the amount of unbroken Focus time that I can stick with one task I did not have that level of focus I didn't have a strong enough no muscle I didn't know how to turn down other things that would distract me for long
(14:56) enough if you can count in terms of hundreds like I can promise you if you put a th000 hours into something it'll probably be pretty good and most people spend like a 100 hours on something or I mean that's [ __ ] most people spend even less than time than that you start a clock when you start working you stop a clock when you stop working you spend 1,000 hours or 2,000 hours on something there's a level of detail because of the number of exposures you'll get to it the crispy details of the product or the service that can only come from looking
(15:23) at that thing when it's cold looking at thing when it's hot looking at it when you're angry looking at it when you're sad looking at it when you're inspired looking at it when you're bored you see it with different lenses and then what happens is it just gives you so much more depth and context to whatever you're trying to build that that's the difference between mediocre products and excellent products and it just takes time in an ocean of volume which there's more commoditized products and services today than ever before there is outsized
(15:47) returns to being number one it is an even bigger win or take all market now than it ever has been because of social media and the ease of letting other people know about stuff if you are truly the best everyone will know and if everyone knows you are the best you will have more demand than you can possibly deal with people think the word of mouth is dead when there's literally never been an easier way to go viral in a literal sense from people telling other people about stuff I said the second lesson was brand
(16:12) and so I had to look at a company or brand as a learning tool as what are people going to learn to associate my brand with the tangible and the intangible ideas there are many people that I associated with when I was younger that I would never associate with today even though I would say well I don't act that way I don't live my life the way they live their lives people would still make that Association if I did nothing but talk with porn stars on my show people would still make a very different association with me and
(16:41) so I want to embody certain values that I want my brand to associate with and anything that is not those things by default detracts from it because it dilutes the association branding is like curating a garden where pretty much anything but the flower that you're trying to grow there is a weed even if it's a daffodil even if it's a sunflower even if the flower itself is fine like I said I have no issues with porn I think it's a sunflower whatever but if I'm trying to grow roses that anything that's not a rose doesn't
(17:08) belong being so Vigilant about defending that Garden of Association and reputation gives you so much leverage because the reason Warren Buffett now can just do deals that no one else can do is because his handshake means more than the US governments if he says he will pay we know he will pay if he says he will be there to ensure your entire city we know he will he can do a deal on a one-page agreement for billions of dollars because people trust and they know that his reputation matters more than anything to him and so trust is
(17:38) leverage for deals it's leverage for sales the first experience I had with having a strong brand was when we were probably a year year and a half into gym launch I launched what would become Allen my software project and when people heard I had launched a new thing the clients that I had were sending screenshots of their credit cards to my C customer support team saying I don't know what it was but if Alex made it I'll buy it and so all of the ideas and the obsessions around how it was going to Market it and how I was going to
(18:07) position it the thing that mattered most was what they had already received from me and how much I had delivered on my first promise and so when I realized that I was like all of this sales and marketing stuff gets you one sale delivering exceptional product an exceptional reputation around your products gets you every other sale after that and you will always be able to sell the next thing provided you delivered on the first thing and that's where there's this obsession with marketing because there's always more people to sell to
(18:33) it's a very in my opinion tiring life you always have to go get new customers if you make sales to get customers rather than get customers to make sales you make the customer the goal and then you get to keep that relationship and then next year you still have that customer if you got a customer just to make a sale you have to go get another customer to make another sale next year but if you make a sale to create the relationship of the customer then next year that customer will buy again and the new customer will buy bu and the
(18:59) third year you get the first two years and the Third customer and then that is how you create a compounding vehicle and so both of those things brand and product are actually underlying one concept now that I'm saying it out loud which is I didn't understand compounding I thought that it was normal to have to go out bang doors call phones DM run ads to get customers every single month and that next month I'm going to have to get another 20 just to keep the lights on rather than having spent more time on my reputation and the quality of my product
(19:26) so that when I sold the first they would never leave again and then they would send me the next 100 and I wouldn't have to do anything and then I would be able to fend people off and then I'd be able to raise my prices and be able to take people on my terms but I didn't understand any of that and part of that is because I wanted money so fast and building a great product takes longer building a great reputation literally never stops until the day you die leaning into that lesson you know the first book I launched and I think it did
(19:51) two or 4,000 copies sold its first month something like that you know the second book that launched 2 years later sold 250,000 copies cop in its first month which for context the average New York Times best sell ourselves between 10 and 100,000 in its first 12 months and we sold 250 in the first month the only way that that can happen is if the people who bought the first book buy the second book and everybody they tell also buys and that book still continues to sell at twice the rate of my first book today here's how to spot friends that
(20:20) are worth cutting they only talk about your past not your future so if you go and you hang out with your buddies and all they can really reminisce with you on is the things that you did together but none of them are talking about what they're going to do or what you're going to do for me that's a Telltale sign that they're living in the past they're not even living in the present their best years are behind them and for most of us we want our best years to be ahead of us and we want somebody who's also looking
(20:42) at the same goal as us which is growth which is moving forward just making progress if you are a growth oriented individual and you feel like you're not sure about your environment or if it's conducive the easiest liment test is who talks about the future and who talks about the past keep the ones who only talk about the future future cut the ones talking about the past the best thing that I ever did was not listen to other people's opinions about my life they don't want the best version of you they want the version of you who best
(21:08) serves them now when I first said this I got Flack from a bunch of parents they were like I really want the best for my kids I was like that's not true you want a version of your children who serves what you think will make you look the best family I would say more often than not has a closer alignment with your long-term goals than strangers do and so it makes sense that family would have more aligned interests but not completely aligned interests with you cuz the only person who has a completely aligned interest with you is future you
(21:39) keeping that as the litmus test of whose opinion I'm going to listen to although it's more difficult has ultimately been very fruitful for me because if you're looking at two even two parents you can disprove that concept by saying okay well both parents want different things for me of the things that both parents want which of the things help each of the parents individually out cu I can promise you that the thing that one parent wants doesn't hurt them and help the other parent if they disagree it's usually something that's more aligned
(22:02) with their worldview their beliefs or what they will get status from in their Community for you doing and so all of the things I just described have nothing to do with you so why consider it I'll say this upfront I hate why questions cuz who knows why but I would say that I if if I had to make a guess on why we care about other people's opinions it's because we've learned to care about other people's opinions and when we're children we learn to orient ourselves to the world through other people telling us what is what literally when you're a
(22:28) kid you point and then you say what's that and then they say this and so you have to listen to other people on the way up the problem is at some point you have to turn it off and say you know some of the people I was listening to had no idea what they were saying but you don't know they have no idea because you don't have a context to make a judgment you have to learn to become human and then you have to learn to become yourself and I think that at that Turning Point you then have to analyze the beliefs that you've been given and
(22:52) then keep the ones that you choose most parents are risk averse rather than risk-taking for for their children so like we are willing to take more risk for ourselves often times than our parents are willing to take on our behalf and I think that's normal they want to like keep you alive there's a lot of evolutionary Drive behind that and so they're playing not to lose but if you want to play to win then you have to take different bets I think a lot of younger people get really confused because they spend a lot of time talking
(23:13) about ideas and very little talking about doing actions and so if you just Define the World by only things that occur in it and not things that occur in your mind there's a lot less noise and so it becomes easier to see the farest from the trees let's say I have an employee and I want I hop on a one-on-one and they said something in a meeting before and I say I think the intention behind your statement was that you wanted me to do this and this is how I was feeling about your statement and this is probably where you were feeling
(23:40) everything I just said is a complete waste of time because all I know is that they said this and so just focus on the facts and if you can do that it actually makes living life a lot easier or navigating life a lot easier at least it has for me because those are the only objective truths an easy frame for that is like would it be admitted to a court at as evidence you saying you were offended is not evidence John said this to Sally these words that's evidence indisputable and so just look at the things that are Beyond reproach look at
(24:07) the things that are indisputable look at the things that are facts that are observable and the world gets a lot quieter and you also realize that most people are full of [ __ ] and don't know what they're talking about I mean if someone was like hey Alex why did you get into business I could make up an answer it just how do we know it's true trying to figure out someone's intention is [ __ ] if someone ask me why did you get into business I can make up an answer anyone can make up an answer why do you like making money why do you like
(24:30) sales why do you like marketing why are you good at this I can make up any answer all I know is that these things have occurred and so we can look at my actions and we can look at the results the rest of it of which which had what influence on what like I can't relive my life and I can't run the experiment and so trying to determine why like was it because my mom didn't hug me was it because my dad hugged me too hard who knows I can give anyone and someone will nod and say great because we've trained ourselves to say to answer when someone
(24:54) says why do you do that you give them words and they nod and say oh that's interesting but like it doesn't does mean it's true and so I just try and skirt the whole conversation because there's no point so when someone's like well I'm the type of person who I'm like just stop then they start using this label to decide whether or why they can or can't do something I wouldn't be successful with that cuz I'm a KN freak why because you take trash out of your car regularly why does that have anything to do with whether you could do
(25:19) this or not I used to think and told people I was bad at math until I was 25 post College post consulting job all of it and then I decided that I was not going to be bad at math and so I was like okay well I'm not going to use a calculator and so then I started getting better and better at doing math problem and then lo and behold uh when I took the GMAT I was like okay I have to study twice as hard for the math section and I did just as well on the math section as I did on my verbal but my whole life I had said I was bad at math and so I
(25:46) didn't study as hard because I was bad at it everyone who's listening to this has something they say about themselves they're like I'm not organized I'm an early bird right like we have these labels we give ourselves but like why do we have these labels like if you needed to wake up early [ __ ] wake up early if you need to stay up late you stay up late the labels change our Behavior more than we change the labels I really abhor labels overall because I feel like it limits my action when I get on podcasts and I have talks and people try and
(26:09) label me you'll probably actively see me break the label almost every time because I'm really aware of it and a lot of people aren't and I don't think people do it on purpose in a bad way I just think that they will speak things over you which is why I hate going home because no one speaks [ __ ] over you more than your family and the people who knew you in high school Alex has always had a short temper you you're a hotthead literally people from home describe me that way I was like I don't think I'm a hotthead they will say that and then I
(26:32) feel like I have to really put up my mental like defenses to be like this is not true here is the evidence that this is not true what would a hothead do in these scenarios that is not the way I behaved therefore right and i' have to I have to basically unwind that [ __ ] whenever I go there and so that is why I've been an advocate of like if you want to change your behavior change your environment because they're not going to reinforce labels that you then also perpetuate in your own mind by the actions you take as a result and the
(26:55) only reason they want to label is because it's shorthand for other people to understand not cuz it's true they just want to say he had a bad shot and so they take your whole life and they just say bad that's not true there's more Nuance to it I prefer to think of ideals and think of taking steps towards those ideals and since ideals are not binary of like he is courageous or he is not courageous but how courageous is he or how patient is he not impatient or patient but how much then I know the values that I want to embody and then I
(27:20) just take steps towards those every day with the actions I take and so if I'm deciding do I want to take this action I say which action aligns most with the values that would have EMB body and then I try to do that so rather than being like Alex is patient i' be like Alex attempts to act in accordance with the value of patience and sometimes fall short but dries his Darkness

(00:00) if you're a business owner or work for one this presentation may be the most tactical thing that I can do to make you money I think this one's going to be a really big hitter which is why I wanted to do it live to you guys um so let me ask you guys a question who believes that you have to work hard to make money real question okay who believes that no one can outwork them okay good I have at least some honest people in this room um well I'm going to attempt to prove some of you wrong who believe that you can never be out work because I see that on the internet all the time and it drives me
(00:30) banana um and the reason this is so important defining work is that all of us claim to work every day and yet most of us can't even Define the word and so how do you define work so we can use the science definition which is you know work equals force time distance problem is that that's not very useful for knowledge workers for what we do uh do we use the time on clock definition you know time spent working as our inputs prob is you know work 16 18 hours a day and so if everyone is already doing that then how can one person work harder than another okay okay um so then do we Define it by
(01:03) how hard you try so the effort that you expend is the work that you do well do you want participation trophies and people just saying like yes you tried your hardest is this how you want your employees to gauge themselves well I tried really hard even though I suck it's like well okay and so if it's if work isn't four times distance if it's not just the time you put in and if it's not just how hard you try then what is work and so we better be clear on what it is we're trying to to do to make money right if we're going to do more of it to make more money and so this is my
(01:34) definition which is work equals outputs and outputs equal volume times leverage so some of you guys have seen this for me before and the Plaine is the number of times you do something times how much you get out of each time you do it fundamentally that's what it is and so the next question that follows is well then how do we work faster or how do we do more work per unit of time and so that's volume times leverage divided by time and so the plain speak is output per unit okay and so if you want to the
(02:00) most per unit of time please pay attention because I do think that this will help you and so how can we get more out of the time we put in which in the game of business is money and so now everyone's like attention you know perks up they're like ah that that stuff I would like that and so visual for you so volume is the number of times you do the thing leverages how much you get out of each time you do it equals your output how many times you do it times how much time you get equals your output and so some quick examples and you guys can tell me whether it's high or low all
(02:32) right is this high output or low output this is low it's very hard to do that with very low leverage high or low high great high or low higher exactly high or low highest because we have a lot of volume on good leverage and so now we understand what work is you can either do more activity do more stuff or get more for it to get get higher output and so normally I spend the vast majority of my career talking about leverage but today I actually want to talk about volume and the reason for that is because talking to a lot of businesses
(03:12) and um I have taken for granted that people do all the volume stuff and it turns out after talking to many of you that is just not true and so here I am talking about leverage because I just assume you work your ass off um and that's fundamentally false for most of you um and I'm baffled by how little people people actually work when they think they are working it's for you and so I'm going to cover two things today number one clear on the input that grows your business the most two is removing everything that isn't that from your life my disclaimer is that this is for
(03:48) business owners and specifically your highest level employees and so if you're like taking notes and you're like hey I want to send this to my team I would recommend because my team saw these slides beforehand and I had like two guys being like I'm going to change a whole bunch of stuff and I was like great and that's my sign for good presentation so figuring out the right input let's say that you want to grow your business you can either get more customers or you can make them worth more that's it you either sell more units increase LTV done so breaking this into actions for customers you either
(04:17) get more traffic or you convert a higher percentage of them of the traffic you have that's the action making them worth more you raise prices decrease your cost of goods sold buy more get people to buy more stuff more times those are the things that's all you got and if you look at four things what do you actually do well to get more traffic you have to advertise more better to increase your conversion you have to practice sales or you have to improve your offer if you want to raise your prices you just have to grow goads and decide by the way goads are are both both sexes so there
(04:48) you go there's my PC for the day buy more times which would be decreasing turn you have reach outs you have exit interviews you do pre- payments you improve your on boarding you get faster results you hold events to appreciate members or clients but if you look at your time you do almost none of these things you're not doing this stuff now and that's why you're probably not making money or as much as you want and so if you don't do this stuff all the time that you spend quote working has the same impact as doing nothing and it's kind of like spending
(05:25) your entire week thinking about how you're going to build and redesign your website and then deciding not to do it except it's just more tiresome than just watching Netflix and relaxing and so you'd literally be better off doing nothing than doing the work that you claim to be work that actually isn't and so that's why most of the businesses here are stuck and why many people watching this at home aren't growing as fast as they want and so for most of you especially the smaller businesses your effort should be disproportionately here on
(05:57) getting more traffic advertising more advertising better and higher con conversion meaning your actual activities on a daily basis is letting more people know about your stuff and practicing getting them to give you money when they find out about it that is what you do on a regular basis with a vast majority of your time after all if you do not have customers then there is no one that you can raise his prices on and that you can get to buy more times and increase their lifetime value and so let's pick apart this first one first advertising more and better so you advertise better by advertising more
(06:26) Excellence comes from repetition when we even use volume as a measure for skill like I've taken 4,000 sales consults we even say that we use it as a proxy and yet we don't think about that for our own skill and business and so if you want to get unreasonably good at advertising do so much advertising that it would be unreasonable for you to suck after doing that much of it again we're just defining inputs here so if you run ads it means you commit to spending four hours a day scripting analyzing writing copying recording ads which may mean
(06:55) learning how to use editing software or an iPhone if you use Outreach it means spending four hours a day reaching out to people across social media platforms if you use content as your primary advertising then you make content for four hours a day every day and you make it on every platform if you use partners and Affiliates it means spending four hours a day doing Outreach ads or making content to help your Affiliates send you more customers so these actions become the volume that create the outputs which for many of you is more
(07:26) leads and if you're hearing 4 hours a day and thinking how will I have time to do everything else remember that doing everything else is what's this is what your time looks like when your business is stalled this is what your time looks like when your business is growing and so too many of you if you're honest with yourself your days look like this and expect results that look like this I told you I'll just give you a really thorough answer and so before you say but I need to keep doing insert whatever thing that isn't growing your business remember you guys can do whatever you want but if you
(08:04) keep doing the same stuff and your business isn't growing then the stuff that you're doing is wrong it is not the right stuff and you have to learn how to let some fires burn some problems are problems but they not the problem of the business today and this is the essence of strategy you learn to prioritize some things are more important than others which means yes you can neglect them for a season then when they actually become the true limiter of the business the true constraint then you focus on them four hours a day until you solve it and
(08:37) so if you use these four things as our guide let's say you master traffic and you're getting loads of leads but you can't close a barn door if the wind was behind you right then conversion becomes your limiter and so then you train someone else on the advertising stuff you do because you mastered it and then spend four hours a day trying to optimize your conversion which might look like this you might actually track your close rate for a change you might actually report all your sales interactions and do them from behind the person you actually see their identity this is for Brick and mor
(09:07) people and have a sign on your door that says that you record so you can do this legally watch game tape of sales that actually worked every single morning you practice your script out loud every single day you hire someone who can give you feedback ideally daily on how well you sell you have a two-minute mental prep before you take consults every single time you give a pre-sale questionnaire to every person who walks in the door if you're bricking Mort or you have some sort of thing online to get them ready for the sale you qualify people on the phone better to pre-sell
(09:38) them and then you actually do that every time there we go you guys getting this cool okay so all problems are solvable with skills and all skills are attainable repetition and feedback and once you have a skill you can do it in less time which gives you Leverage so you get more for what you do the better you get at it the less time it takes for you to do it so you get more time back in other words once you get great at sales you don't need to switch As Much Time on it and you'll still close the same percentage you go from growing
(10:14) a skill to maintaining a skill and it's much easier to maintain a skill and continue to stay at that same level than it is to gain a skill and so it's kind of like maintaining weight if you've ever like lost weight or gained weight like once you get to that level it's much easier to stay and maintain that it is to to break the whatever the word is homeostasis and same thing for gaining muscle and everything you spend your time on has to clearly lad up to one of these four things and so right now if you look at your schedule and you're not lading up to these four things you're
(10:44) not doing the stuff that makes money otherwise you're just doing this rather than this but still some of you guys are going to be thinking to yourselves well with what time out I can barely keep water as is I'm very busy understandable and if you have a special snowflake excuse I'm special um you're totally right it's literally impossible for you to do what I'm saying and that's why your business will never grow cool and that is my talk for today now be better of course you're rights will never grow right happy now you're totally justifies not achieving your
(11:16) goals consider yourself excused all right so for everyone else right um we just have to face reality success the marketplace your customers they don't care about whatever your excuse is and it may be entirely Justified it also doesn't matter and they also don't care they just care about output they care about what they can get from you what's in it for me and so if you're open to the idea that might a little bit about making money and growing businesses I want to get to the second part of my presentation which was that
(11:45) was my 11-e transformation that's my before and after how to make this easier for you so I said I was going to cover two things the first is how to get very clear on the inputs that grow your business every feel very clear on the four things that you need to do and how they lad up to activities that you spend four hours a day and you're like great but I don't have four hours a day well that's why we're going to do the second part which is removing everything else that isn't that from your life and so the nice part
(12:09) about this second half of the presentation is that there's nothing to argue about it's just facts we all have 24 hours a day I'm good there so far I've just stated facts okay people who move faster just do better things with their time you can cut grass with scissors and it will take all day or you can make one call and have someone else do it in either scenario both people get the grass cut and so we outlined that you need to spend your time working on those four levers in your business at least four hours a day and so I'm going to show you
(12:39) how to find the time with a combination of habits and buying time this may be one of the more tactical things that I give you guys that will probably change your life from this whole experience so first we have to find time and second we will buy time so let's start with finding time so there's two types of work that every entrepreneur has you've got maker time you've got manager time maker time is long blocks of uninterrupted time four to six hours you only have 14 work blocks per week of this maker time it's very very valuable it's low urgency High importance work that's the stuff that moves the business
(13:07) forward a productive maker calendar is an empty calendar an interruption always destroys an entire time block who here has had a Time block where you're like really excited and then a 1-hour call comes in at 10: a.m. and you're like well there goes my morning yes we've all been there and you hate that person and this is what maker time looks like looks great look at that beautiful blue space so much work so much money to be made made on the other hand you've got manager time and we manage both of these things these are time blocks as small as 5 to 15 minutes you've 100 of these plus
(13:38) per week the goal is to fill your calendar with these slots if you're in your manager time and you're are Maxim manager when you have no gaps and this is usually when you're spending time training teams coordinating communicating putting out fires and this is what it looks like when you're on manager time this is also my calendar when I'm on a manager day and both of these work styles are important everyone here has worn both of these hats right okay but the moment these two hats meets is when disaster happens and so if you're trying to in tiny slices of
(14:08) management into your making time kill half a day it doesn't work and if you have lots of empty slots between your managing time it's also inefficient there too because you're not doing anything with that time you might as well fill it with more meetings and so you have to understand what type of work you're doing when you start the day and explain to your team the difference between these types of work and the importance of those time periods and why you have to prioritize them the entire business can grow and so beyond explaining the difference in the of work I don't know why I keep going out there
(14:39) um here's what I did to facilitate maker time because manager time kind of always happens so here are the maker habits that I have so one is I decide the one project I need to work on that's most important and yes it can be the same thing for a while I woke up at 4:00 a. I worked until 9:00 a.m.
(14:56) on that work 5 hours that's how I work I turned off all my notifications I have a dark room my office now still has no windows um no sound earplugs I keep it very very simple I want to put everything out of my world besides the work and I realize that there are no emergencies so this is something that for all entrepreneurs we have to understand is that there are no emergencies there's 911 someone's dying in which case call them not me and then there's the emergency that your business isn't going to grow for the third year in a row which you need to solve
(15:25) now which also means going to bed at the same time every single night is a habit that served me very well and that also includes weekend I just and if you're like how do I do that I always go to sleep late just wake up early once and be tired that's how it works it's my brilliant idea treat weekends and weekdays the same and realize that drinking cost you two days the day you drink and the day you recover and some makers work late at night after their kids have gone to sleep anyone here who have that is that
(15:54) your time slot for making okay cool it doesn't matter what your time slot is as long as you make time for it just find the four to five hours that you can turn everything off and working weekends is also a hack that you can move forward it's 104 days a year the amount of entrepreneurs that're like I take weekends off like 104 days of uninterrupted time okay got it understood well I'd love to compete against you anyways so those are some of the habits that help me find time to do the things that matter most the second is buying time so let's talk about that so you are the most valuable person in
(16:28) your business you produce the most most value for the company and if you had a star employee You' want to maximize their ever weeking moment right if you've got everybody here have some person you're like man I just want to clear the way for them I just want them to just keep working working working okay and we often do this with our teams right we try and Empower them we try and clear their calendars trying to give them help but we don't do this for ourselves and so there's the myth of work life and personal life you know integration or whatever and this isn't that talk believe me I don't care about
(16:57) that talk what I mean is that we all have one battery and the problem with your spouse and your kids and your chores and your employees is they all drain from the same source and so you become more productive by eliminating the things that make you unproductive more than you have some pomodora time hack and like this is what I really want to have syn in you will become more productive through elimination than by adding optimization just by taking away all the things that are not the things that grow
(17:26) the business and so I also bring this up because no one ever sticks with that stuff anyways we all see the Tik Tock hack of like put a timer and then take a walk or like no one does it no one does it no one doesn't so let's let's just forget about it why bother but cutting things out they are permanent reductions and energy drainage that you can reallocate to making more money doing the stuff that matters and so if we all have 24 hours a day someone who works on the most important stuff for 16 hours six days a week is going to move way faster than someone who's who
(17:58) does it three hours per week in real real work time some of you guys if you look back on your last week you're like how much real maker time did I make for myself to work on the stuff that grows the business many times if you're really honest with yourself it's like four hours and so there's a reason that someone could actually move 30 times faster than you and that's the difference if you're doing three hours of productive or 96 productive hours it's just the math and so it's not even close that's how you move 30 times
(18:27) faster than somebody else even though both people work all day and so hopefully they convince you about how important this is and maybe why other people you know move faster than you and so let's get really tactical the average American spends 50 hours per month on food groceries eating prepping cleaning the replacement cost for that is $800 a month the average American spends 25 hours per month cleaning their home the replac cost for that is $500 a month the average American spend 16 hours per month doing laundry washing drying folding organizing dry cleaning driving
(19:03) to laundromat $200 a month to replace that which means that for $1,500 a month you can get 96 hours per month back that's two full work weeks every single month and that means that if you can make more than $15 per hour with your time you should make that trade seven days a week twice on Sunday and once for your mom and this is very much a form of reinvesting in yourself but you have to use the time that you buy to work to make even more so this isn't the I will spend $1,500 a month and then I will get 96 hours back and I will watch 96 more hours of
(19:41) Netflix this is not that plan and I bring this up amazed at how many people feel like they're being irresponsible by spending this money like the amount of entrepreneurs that I talk to that are like that will happily hire somebody for $50,000 a year and are unwilling to think about the idea of spending $1500 a month on things that make them feel fancy or frilly or like exess expenses is ridiculous I'll say that is silly but if you could spend $1,500 a month on your most valuable employee forget about you for a second you're most valuable employee to have 50% more out of them wouldn't you do that every day of the
(20:18) week and twice on Sunday of course but you are that more valuable employee you are that person in the business by far not even close it's you and I didn't even get into into the free 40 hours a week that people spend all right so following sports teams four hours a week replacement cost of not following sports teams zero dollar watching TV 21 hours a week on average replacement M literally nothing scrolling social media 17 hours a week also literally nothing driving to and from work and refilling gas four and a half hours a week replacement cost is
(20:50) $700 a month for Uber you have somebody else drive you I tweet on my way to work and I tweet on my way back where I get my content and for $1,500 a month you can still do those fun things so I'm not even I'm not even taking those out because you're not going to do it anyways you're still going to watch TV you're still going to you're still GNA scroll social media you're gonna do all that stuff not even gonna try you can still that stuff and spend $1,500 a month and get 96 hours a month back and so I want to be clear this is a one-time investment you will never get
(21:21) this back I can't resend the $1,500 and get another 96 hours back you only get to pull this trigger once and I'm still amazed at the businesses that are doing 50 100 $500,000 a month and they still are analyzing this bill as something that they have even hesitated to spend money on because of whatever narrative they have around why it's good to clean your own laundry or cook your own food now sure if you like cooking and it's recreational then fine but you and I both know that's not what we're talking about it's lunch on Tuesday that's what I'm talking about and so there are so few things
(21:57) that you can spend $1,500 a month on getting 96 hours per month back and you can only pull the trigger once and so this advice is so simple and yet when I see rooms like this with the same problems again and again and again I had to make this incredibly obvious presentation because the only thing that's easier than doing this is not doing it which is what most of you will probably do is you will nod and you will think about it and then you will do nothing and you will still cook your [ __ ] food and you will still drive yourself to work and you will still
(22:32) still clean your house you're like well I like my clothes folded a certain way who cares like is it worth the business not growing by 50% this year and somehow those of you who do nothing will be amazed while you're later you're still in the exact same position while someone else who took these simple steps 30X their output and this is how you can actually do your day job as the manager while also giving yourself the time to do what matters most as a maker those 96 hours you can take those four hours a day and it's there that's just from the stats that's not just me like that's it's right there you can have
(23:11) it and so this trading up for time is buying time and it it it's less valuable work that you trade money for for more free time to do more valuable work that you then trade to get more money and you just never stop this NE this whole process never ends and so bringing this all together that's the stuff that actually grows your business if you work on the right stuff your business will grow like getting more customers making them worth more and if you want to do as much and you want to do as much of that as you can to grow your business as fast as you can and make sure your day looks like this not like that and to do that in the
(23:51) real world you eliminate everything else that's not that which you do by understanding and explaining the differ between maker and manager yourself and your teams and giving yourself time every single day to decide the project that matters most wake up a little bit earlier turn off your notifications get a zone that you can actually work investing your most valuable employee by eliminating 96 hours per month of work for $1,500 a month so that you can actually work not to 2X or Forex more effective let me say that again so you can work not just two
(24:28) or four times more effective than your competition but 30 times more effective than them because they're like you super distracted have their notifications turned on are taking calls in the middle of the day and they too are only working three hours or productive hours a week and you can absolutely murder them in their sleep by how much you crush them in business if you actually spend the time to do the things that matter which almost no one does and it's crazy because I spend all this time making all this business content about LTV to C ratios and decrease inur and make sure your onboarding is on board is
(24:58) streamlined people are like I don't have the time find the [ __ ] time buy it it's right there it's for sale and so you maximize your time and actually work on the things that matter which everyone else would then wonder when you actually do this how does he move so fast how does she move so fast but you will know the secret is that there is no secret you have one battery and you just try and eliminate as many drains as you can that aren't aligned with your goal and that's how you can compress multiple lifetimes of growth into one
(25:29) thank you any questions on this is this uh was there was there anything that was unclear about that presentation go for it what time do you go to sleep uh so I get in bed at 9: I go to sleep by 10: you get up 4 uh I'm probably up well today I was up at four but like most of the times I'm up by like five yeah 10 to fives works fine I like I've haven't had an alarm in like five seven years I a long time um I'm a big fan so I probably should add this is that I think you should have a sleep alarm not a wake up alarm I mean I sleep as long as you can
(26:11) because like if I don't know about you but like if I get nine hours of sleep I'm like I can cure cancer today like like I I so rarely get nine like if I get seven you know I'm I'm fine but nine like I I literally look at Lea I'm like give me the hardest problems today like like I'll just sit in in discomfort go for it manag time sure yeah so I think okay so the question was um is it okay to make your goal eliminating manager time um I see it as a Continuum rather than an absolute or a binary so it's not like I
(26:43) am 100% maker or I'm 100% manager I think it's just how much of that so like Leela's calendar is flipped from mine so I have four days a week of maker time and one manager day on Mondays which I just stack the living hell out of I'm just like just I just tell the team I was like just destroy me just just put everything in there I expect to accomplish nothing and I will just make all the decisions and talk to everybody about all the stuff the other four days I work on things that I think matter most and I also work the weekends her schedule is more like this
(27:12) where she has four days a week where she has their manager time in one day a week that's maker time she also spends the weeker do week ends doing maker stuff and so that's kind of how she balances it um because Lea actually runs everything in the business I take credit for running everything in the business that's kind of our division uh it's worked well for us for years yeah so recommend yeah shoot how much time you spend on I just tweeted about this like 10 minutes ago which is great yeah so how much time do I spend on Fitness stuff in general so my big advice is get in shape
(27:45) between 18 and 24 and then after that the maintenance of being in shape it takes like 10% of your time which I was alluding to in the presentation and so it takes me very little time to maintain this um but I now have a gym downstairs and so it's super super easy uh but you know I work out when I can I usually probably work out three four days a week and it's just downstairs and I do it in the morning or I do in the afternoon keep the relationship not turn off make it more of a business relation so how do we I'm repeating it because no one has a mic just so you know um so how
(28:22) do we manag being married and being co-managers of the business always talking about the business oh so we always talk about business I think what we don't do is Judge ourselves for talking about business I think more people get stressed about what they think they should be doing rather than just being like this is our relationship these are our rules which we make and we don't think they exist it's worked fine so far if one of us wasn't into business it would suck it's all I want to talk about shoot this is this is [ __ ] awesome so the question was do I have uh do I have
(29:02) fun outside of of work um the majority of my fun is in work uh but I take like one or two vacations a year that are like three or four days um and we try to do it with friends of ours because most of the friends that we have don't live where we live and so most the friends that we have not most all the friends that we have are all pretty high level entrepreneurs and they're really busy too and so we try and have you know company there while we can all talk about business and talk about you know what we're excited about and that's what works for us you know there the first I
(29:37) think three years of our marriage we didn't take any I mean we didn't take we didn't do a honeymoon we work the day we got married we work the next day um we're like we but we do us though and so I don't like I don't for every like I don't see this as prescription we just do we just do what we want to do um and so I always hesitate with those those questions because people take it as gospel and I just like we really really spend a long time trying to not care about what anyone else thinks about what we
(30:07) do okay yeah so how often do I review what the constraint is in the business your business constraint doesn't change that often once you get it right and so once you know it's like okay I need to advertise more you just keep doing that until you break something else and sometimes you can do that for a very very very very very long time and the constraint then goes one is chunked down so it's like we need to okay so it's like you're advertising and you're running ads but you're like I need a second channel so you're still like the the bigger constraint is still the same I need more leads but you need to have the constraint of like I need to
(30:49) solve this next acquisition Channel and so it'll it'll move against the larger constraint of the business but finally all the constraints are going to chunk up to I need to get more customers I need make them worth more and I might need to make them more so that I can get more customers and so those will oscillate back and forth um on the business the big thing that will matter is kind of benchmarks is understanding like I think we were talking earlier when the guys were there with the med spa um he had a LTV issue he didn't have
(31:13) a leads issue and so it's making sure that we're solving the right problem and I see a lot of business owners really obsessing trying to drive down lead costs and I find it to be more easy to just fix the sales process and add a zero to your price and then all of a sudden all your lead problems go away and so it's it's I try and find the easiest way to solve problems which often times isn't the thing that's immediately apparent so I'll tell you I'll tell you a fun a fun so we have so the book launch is g to come up at some point um
(31:44) and so I was thinking about some of the goodies that I was going to be giving away and one of the goodies I had was like like legit like 400 more hours of work and so I started the project and I stopped after an hour and I was like okay can I use my second brain cell here and think of something else that I can give away that's more valuable than this that doesn't take me 400 hours and it took me like an hour to think of something else that was better and took less time and so I think sometimes like the the pendulum swing on the other side
(32:15) of this is if you have tremendous work ethic then sometimes you want to solve problems the hard way but there's like this is something that I feel like I've found more and more as I've like gotten doggy years aged in business is like like there's usually a more elegant solution if you just take a second and you're like and I like asking hypotheticals of like what would it take two or if I had to make something more valuable in a tenth of the time what would I do if someone 10 times smarter than me had the same problem what would
(32:45) they do and like cycling through those frames helped me attack the problem differently and that that helps me a lot like I use those frames a lot when I'm trying to solve things guys I appreciate you all hope you enjoyed the uh the Youtube video thank you much appreciate you

Transcript:
(00:00) what do we really want to do like what's the actual impact if at the end of our Lives we have something that is a shining Beacon of a different way to do business that to me is something worth fighting for [Music] what's on deck for today I am working on the book [Music] you know what's going to happen what they're gonna be like when's the book coming out yeah whatever you have to say oh I don't know what is it are we gonna mention it just like insert it casually in this vlog that's a pretty big deal honestly they
(00:42) just found out for the first time that's right I get some messages that are like offended they're like yo what the [ __ ] where's the like I need some leads bro give me real quick this is really the first time we're kind of seeing you in the morning and you're not meditating you're not journaling you're not doing the red lightsana I mean I should normally I have like a three hour routine just so that I'm capable to function as a human being I have a long affirmation routine that I do there's a wall mirror over there that I just
(01:11) that's where I just say them to myself you're amazing you're fantastic people love you the comments don't mean anything this is decaf all decaf yeah wow so you drink it just because you like the flavor uh actually I drink whatever Layla usually drinks because it's easier for me to just be like too if someone gets plastic surgery right of any kind the real real is that like either say nothing or be positive about it because they can't change it like you wouldn't say that to somebody who didn't have their nose changed but the the feature is still
(01:56) permanent I had one guy message me and he started commenting on all my posts and he was like evil horrible all this [ __ ] and then I like looked in my inbox and he was like messaging he was like you don't want what's best for us because if you really did you would give us the name of your plastic surgery he's like you want us all to be poured ugly he was like you just don't want us there were days where like Layla would be not in as good of a mood and I would try and be like hey what can I do like let me do
(02:21) these things and she would still stay in a kind of a bad mood and so then what would happen is I would then get Stern and be like all right do your own thing and what would happen is that she would then step out of it as soon as I got mean and so then what she taught me is that if I am mean she will stop being in a bad mood right as soon as you have started having punishment and reward as as things in your in your dialect and thinking what happens afterwards kids cry parent gives them a cookie and you now teach them to
(02:51) cry to get cookies like it's just like so simple and the other piece is if you reward too long afterwards you still teach them something but not what you intended a parent for example fast forward as a teenager who sneaks out of the house right and then they come back in the middle of the night and then as soon as they walk in the door they punish them and so what happens you punish a kid for coming home and then the surprise the kid doesn't want to come home what uh what's your day looking like what's what's on the agenda leadership
(03:24) meeting pipeline review book meeting I have a bi-weekly with two of our teammates that I try and do with some of them non-executive team and you do that every day you try and block up until like noon or one or one yeah and then Layla's been doing such a good job though that there are more days where I just have nothing on my calendar at all which is awesome and amazing why do you like having nothing on your calendar I just I just have more time to work farewell Farewell My Love sweet queen little guy for a guy you want a little
(04:04) you want a little guy where to start the day you see my little my little workstation I've got my iPad which is where I draw my stuff I've got earplugs I've got my Nicorette my work timer going so I actually don't use it all the time it's more during the week because people ping me I'll just set my timer for really how long I think Something's Gonna Take and then I'll hit it and I just keep it right like in plain sight and that works really well so interesting combo is if you go headphones ear muffs nicotine caffeine
(04:34) and like work and a timer I've yet to find like a better combination of productivity use if useful [Music] [Applause] [Music] acquisition.com is be able to build acquisition.com to whatever a billion 10 billion leading with or he's not punishment if we could really do this and then teach other CEOs how to do this if that's something worthwhile of doing and it's not like anybody else but on the same side we have our mission which is to make real business education available to everybody there's often two visions in a company
(05:15) there's the internal Vision which is much more relevant to the team and the employees and the vet vendors and everyone that you touch and even the customers and then there's the external division which is like how are we affecting the Greater Community that is affected by acquisition and I think that we actually really have to do as we've clarified this conversation it's been an ongoing dialogue between Layla and I of like what do we really want to do like what's the actual impact at the end of our Lives we have something that is a
(05:42) shining Beacon of a different way to do business that is more profitable by building something bigger and better but do it our way which is praise over punishment that to me is something worth fighting for it just takes more skill because when someone messes up all you want to do is punish them how can I not do that and then get the desired result we will Define somebody who is motivated by reward or reinforcement as someone who is who utilizes all of their discretionary effort so if there's the level of effort that is required to not
(06:13) get fired and then all the effort above that is discretionary effort in a business that is based on punishment people will go to the law of least effort which is as little as they can do to not get fired so if you have a business that's based on that then how do you get higher performance well look at McKinsey look at Goldman Sachs they'll get a lot of the P industry you raise the bar and so what happens is you get really high performers are the only ones who can perform in that in that place and they are driven by anxiety they're
(06:40) stressed out of their minds they drink they do drugs they get hooked on porn whatever it is right to deal with the stressors in their life but you just move the bar and so the alternative is a world where everybody is working even harder than that because the law of of least effort there's still people that are so talented that they can work medium and not get fired but you lose out on all of the discretionary effort that they would be putting in if they felt that they were being reinforced in a safe place and so that's the kind of environment
(07:08) that we're trying to build I'm not saying we're perfect we will mess up but that's that's I think something that's worth fighting for so fun story one of our teammates went to an event and was rocking in acquisition our Contra now they're not for sale obviously and many people came up to him asking to take pictures with him invited him out for drinks invited him out for food to portions of it that he wasn't allowed to go into but he was able to because he was wearing that shirt so how does that happen they read a book
(07:44) that gives them value they're reinforced and rewarded for that thing and then when they do the stuff from the book they associate the rewards they get from that with the book the book they associate with me and then they see me in all the videos and all the content with this thing and So eventually you remove me and you just keep the thing and you associate that thing with all these good feelings all this reward and so then someone else wears the shirt and then they feel the same way towards that person simply because they have
(08:16) Associated so many good things with that and that is branding and yes let's switch to pipeline that would allow us to do that kind of vision of the 49 or 51 for new companies just adding them straight to kind of like our Top Line bottom line that would be a huge move what was that what was that meeting that we were just in this is our pipeline review so it's looking at the companies at different stages in the deal process and you know mind you of people who even get to this level 95 percent of deals we don't do
(08:46) um it's just because we're looking for a lot of very specific things it's not just necessarily like is the company valuable but like can we add value to the company fundamentally there's two schools of investing there's Bettors and Builders so Bettors are like can I find a mispriced company that I will simply put money in at less than its intrinsic value and then hope that it will grow over time that's kind of like the Warren Buffett style probably the vast majority of investors are that way and then there are Builders who have like a unique set
(09:11) of skills in their hold code that they try and templatize those kind of like Sops those playbooks and just deploy them into the companies knowing that they're going to Triple 5x 10x the companies that they have private Equity is usually a combination of both those things I would say that we lean towards the building side of like we're not trying to be like amazing Pickers we just try and find companies that we know our playbooks will immediately 10x and then try and work with them it was texting my wife gosh I'm pumped because in the in the new
(09:43) place I will be able to fit my entire wardrobe in my bedside table oh yeah we'll show Layla's entire closet and then I will pull out my two drawers with beaters and shorts it'll be great why are you so obsessed about that stuff well I will say this I don't know why I know that I am I have become more that way because it's probably been reinforced the more obsessive I am about like iterating things until they're like just right the more rewarded I get Trevor's saying that like that he's alarmed by the number of people that he has worked with
(10:14) who do not read well he said we need to teach them to read he got a kid who was struggling to stay focused and so he came to train the kid with a bag of Skittles the kid would read three words and he would give him a Skittle but if he read four words because if his previous best was three he would give him two skills so we reinforce him doing it every time he had a bigger reinforcement for when every time he hit a new record so if he read a full line he would give him more by the end of the first session he had them reading entire
(10:43) Pages hello so we're doing this whole Vlog thing so we're we're capturing Day in the Life the very you know the high energy life of the CEO who lives in a closet you have anything excited yeah I mean like I don't see an issue with translating into more languages like that doesn't bother me then we just have more people who get the book can they do mandarin or Japanese or Portuguese Portuguese would be big German I got a lot of DMS after I showed the French one so that was a meeting with my book manager who also happens to be my
(11:16) father-in-law so we have massively improved our relationship since the first time I stole his daughter told her to quit everything to join me to gallivant across the country living in motels six weeks after we met uh but yeah he runs everything with the book so we have a French and a Spanish version out and then looking at other languages that we want to translate it into and looking at publishing and printing firms in Germany and Italy so that's kind of what that that meeting was about we've got uh different
(11:41) versions of the books as they progressed over time from different printers so that I could see the print quality just so you guys know I don't go to one printer I go to a bunch of them and make sure that the book quality is good and if you're like well why are you even dealing with this rather than going over publisher because Publishers don't want you to give away your book for free and so I uh you know Uncle Alex foots the bill I'll have probably a million I'll add it up probably like a million two into this book negative I mean
(12:10) that's why most publishing companies will front the money and I would have done that with this book just so you guys know except if I had done it with this book it wouldn't be out until uh spring of 24. like it has to be 100 done nine months before you actually get it I finished this and then I'm releasing it 16 weeks after it was done and that's because 12 weeks is printing if I wanted to just do like Dropship real-time Printing and then wanted everyone to wait forever I would do it that way but it's also way more expensive to print
(12:42) that way and uh you know the books fund Mosey media which is really so you guys know where did the dollars go from the from my 2.99 books that I get a dollar from it goes to go to the team so we can put out more stuff for you guys Tobias what's up man tell me your most painful moment it's tough I mean like cutting my eyeball that sucks I took sales call still so yeah there you go yeah okay um I would just get your opinion on fixing the sales issue here's what's crazy is that if the other guy gets up to 40 at Double sales I think that if I
(13:19) had a two-prong approach get a good salesman in there and then double the throughput on the webinar I would say like that's a 4X if we double double sometimes people ask why don't you make videos like you used to why why the change why all the editing the new thumbnails all that [ __ ] more people see it I mean it's just that we see the comments this actually reminds me of a story that you told me but like whenever a band goes from like a small town to like they go they go bigger audience they go more mass Market people are like
(13:48) the band's selling out or whatever it is but the reality is that like the band morphs into the thing that reaches the most people and so if you believe in the message that you have then packaging it in a way that allows the most people to consume it if you believe in what you want to get out there as long as it doesn't dilute the core message which I don't think us editing more heavily and having higher produced videos does it just gets more people to see it and so here's the thing is that everyone in Mosey Nation votes
(14:17) with their clicks and their eyeballs about the things they find most interesting and so you train me to make the content that I have so if y'all in general liked the webcam only thing more than I would be making more of that you train me with your clicks and your watches of the things that you care the most about and so we make more of those things so in many ways you guys control the content and to all the day one homies appreciate y'all many of you guys were like at 5K we're like dude this guy's gonna be in a Million
(14:50) and it's true I got there but it was just because you guys appreciate you guys sharing commenting send it to your friends all that kind of stuff I feel really confident in saying that like in two years you will laugh at what we are putting out right now um I know I certainly will there are some things that are going to get released that are going to blow what we are doing out of the water we like to say we think of decades not days um but I think you can just watch and see if if we're full of it or not

Brutally Honest Advice to Build Your Confidence - YouTube
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pt50QF6al8g

Transcript:
(00:00) this is brutally honest advice to my younger less confident self having an epic story is about asking the girl it's about shooting the shot it's about launching the business about running the ad about knocking on the door quitting the job taking the risk when you're 85 years old and on your deathbed you're not going to wish you had fewer crazy stories you're going to wish you had taken more shots don't build confidence build evidence confidence comes as a result of evidence not the other way around confidence without evidence is a
(00:26) delusion it's you beating your chest looking at yourself in the mirror trying to pretend you're something you're not do it so you get the confidence but don't think you need confidence to do it so the whole idea of fake it until you make it should switch to walk it before you talk it right prove it to yourself so you don't need to prove it to other people and let your path that you're talking for you until you win effort always goes unnoticed get used to it if you aren't willing to suck you're never going to get good losers stay losers
(00:53) because they aren't willing to lose confidence is also domain specific so you can be really good at public presentations and really bad at talking to girls it takes a lot for a skill to transfer between domains and so if you want to get good at the thing don't try and do something to the left of it just do the thing the first sales consult I ever took I didn't close and I say that because everyone just imagines that mosy just came in just slinging credit cards and stacking bodies right it didn't work that way I came in it was a 5minute
(01:21) conversation the girl was like I need to go get my card from home and I said oh yeah okay go do that and she walked away and I went to my boss he's like how'd it go I said oh I closed her and he was like oh that's awesome he's like you got the credit card I said oh no she's going to come back with the card and he literally stopped what he was doing with six other guys around him and they all non-stop laughed for a minute straight like they couldn't breathe cuz they thought how stupid what I had just said was but I had no idea and so that was my
(01:48) first ever experience in sales I'm known for sales now and I wouldn't even say I'm confident in sales it's just more like this is what works and has worked for me take it or leave it and so people perceived that as confidence but it's simply just based on experience and confidence comes from experience what it really is is a prediction what you think is going to happen will happen and so even in statistics what is your confidence metric this is 78 it's literally just what the percentage likelihood that what you think's going
(02:17) to happen is going to happen and so how do you increase the likelihood that what you think's going to happen is going to happen have it have happened already I could have either spent 30 minutes every day looking at myself in the mirror and telling myself I was going to be a great sales guy or I could have reviewed the [ __ ] script which one do you think would get make me a better salesperson reviewing the script you can take all the time that you're trying to spend psyching yourself up and you'll feel significantly more confident not having
(02:39) done that and simply knowing what you're going to say which you get from practice the world belongs to those who can keep doing without seeing the result of they're doing and the longer you can wait to see the result of you're doing while still continuing to do is the extent to which you can win big in life for example to be a top 1% podcaster you have to upload 21 podcasts 21 top 1% % 90% of people don't get past one 9% don't get past 20 and then 1% of podcasters of all of them make it to 21 plus so when people say try harder it
(03:12) usually just means don't give up the price for Excellence has never been so low people give up so easily now that it's just so easy to win by just being willing to post 20 times you're in the top 1% like am the top 1% we're not even talking 10 top half top one % people are so afraid of being humiliated they get the long-term humiliation of never amounting to anything no one's going to watch your first 20 episodes anyways and even if they do it doesn't matter because that's not what you're building towards like you posting those 20 isn't
(03:46) what you judge yourself on you should be judging yourself on the difference between your first one and your 20th one are you better probably and the difference between your 20th one and your 100th one because the win is you you are the asset You're Building not the downloads that you get on your first shot mosy immediately had a podcast with millions of downloads every single month no I spent 4 and 1/2 years making two podcasts a week straight didn't miss and guess how many podcast downloads I was getting per month at the end of that 2
(04:15) to 3,000 downloads a month not a lot I used to think to myself okay well each one of these podcasts gets like 200 downloads well 200 downloads is like an auditorium of people and so would I feel okay giving a speech to 200 people yeah and even before that when they was getting like 10 or 15 downloads per episode if I had a little lunch and learn that I would I used to have to do to like get leads for a business I'd be fine talking to a group of 10 or 15 people because the reality is that those people are doing me more of a favor than
(04:42) I'm doing them they're literally giving me their ears so that I can practice my voice and how to talk and how to present and it was only at year 4 and A2 to 5 when things started taking off and you know what the two things that changed are one is I did call I changed it from gym secrets to just the game which was a business thing so it made it more go more people and the second thing and here's the real one is that I sold a company for $46 million and so people are like oh what does this guy have to say and the big thing that everyone
(05:09) misses is people try and dissect my content the message is 10% of how people consume it 90% is the context around the message so Elon muskin can tweet on the toilet and be like I'm on the throne taking a [ __ ] and it'll get a million likes why because it's Elon Musk he's the richest man in the world and owns three of the biggest companies that are most Innovative of all time I don't Kid myself and think that like my content is so much better than other people there's plenty of people have better content than me that don't get the same views
(05:36) and the reason is because I have the context they don't have the proof and solve for the proof and then the content will take care of itself because one you will know what you're talking about because you have proof that you know what you're talking about and people will believe you which is why you should solve for evidence above everything else like evidence gives you the confidence if someone says Alex I don't think you know [ __ ] about business I'd be like okay it doesn't really affect me I do know we cross 100 milon net worth at age
(06:00) 32 I know that but if someone said that to you and you haven't accomplished anything you don't have anything to stand back on and it hurts you more but I have proof so it's like you can just deflect it towards the proof and keep living your life the secret to longevity is especially in the content game but really in any game that you're trying to at least help other people with is that if you've done the thing you can be certain rather than confident be certain based on what you've done not based on what you say other people should do
(06:25) there used to be uh too big to fail and I think there's an alternative which is too good to fail if you make your stuff so [ __ ] good that only one person who gets exposed to it sends it to somebody else then you have nothing to worry about and you will eventually get discovered it's a Time game and in the meanwhile you just keep getting better which is the point because at the end of the day you're going to die everyone's going to forget about you anyways and so you might as well just work on the one asset that you get to keep for the rest
(06:48) of your life which is you and rather than measuring yourself based on how many views he gets versus how many views you get measure Yourself by how much work he puts into one of his shorts versus what you put into one of your shorts and then you might think the output is more reasonable and if there's a top sales guy in your organization who's making more money than you compare not what his commission check is to yours every month compare how many calls he's making how many times you practice the script how many calls he's made
(07:13) before you how many sales he's closed before you what time a day he shows up at work what time of day he leaves whether he works weekends or not whether he's willing to hop on the phone in a family context so he can still close the deal if you're doing all the inputs the mat the outputs will always match on a long enough time Horizon and if you are new to the game then my recommendation is not only to match inputs but to double or triple the inputs that someone ahead of you is doing and the reason you do that is because if you just match
(07:39) your inputs then you're always going to be behind them because they're already ahead of you because they're better than you and so if you both do the same amount of work they're going to keep getting better and so with you so you have to do twice the work you got to be like Kobe right where everyone else is doing one practice a day you do two practices a day and in the beginning they'll be better than you and then you'll match them but because you're doing twice the work eventually you'll get better and then that's how you win
(07:57) yeah and one of the biggest misnomers in in whatever Endeavor you're trying to track is people track the wrong metrics they track the lagging metrics rather than the leading metrics lagging metrics are what happen those are the outputs and if you want to track those fine but the real things to track are what you're doing to create the outputs so I don't want to necessarily even track sales I want to track how many calls I'm making if I'm trying to get in shape I'm not necessarily going to track the weight I'm doing I'm going to track how many
(08:20) calories I'm eating and so the more ways you measure the more ways you can win and so the idea the ultimate win at life is where you can shift things that out of your control that you deem winning to things that are under your control which you can deem winning because if you're measuring on whether you lost the fat or not sometimes people take longer some people don't that's something that you actually can't control what you can control are the inputs and so if you say based on this if I do this one thing every day for a long enough period of
(08:47) time I'll eventually get there the real winners cut out the I'll eventually get there and say if I do this every day I have won the thing that I try and focus on now is the Delta between how hard I tried and how hard I can Poss possibly try and if I know that the gap between those two is zero then I have one and I've decided to spend a inordinate amount of effort trying to make that my definition of winning is that there's nothing left in the tank if you get into a harder career path or one that takes more reps to get good at or more reps to
(09:17) get into then every day you can win based on saying like everyone else does 100 I do 250 and I have nothing left to give I won and that should satisfy you and if you're if you're obsessive on the external thing that takes too long and you will give up too soon one of the things that took me too long to learn was the difference between the finite and infinite frame and so finite frame is where you have known players agreed upon rules and a way to win or lose at the end and then the game is over an infinite frame you have known and
(09:46) unknown players no agreed upon rules and the point of the game is to keep the game going and all the greatest games that I've ever participated in marriage Health business you don't win at marriage the point is to stay married you don't win at Health the point is to stay in shape you don't win at business the point is to stay in business and so by default if you don't give up you win and so that's the big frame shift which is why leaving everything on the field is the way you have to Define winning if you want to win in the long term and
(10:16) anything worth doing takes great time if you stick with it and you make that the win you'll notice that the external win will just happen on its own and if you really commit to that perspective it won't even mean much to you because if you make that everything it's the same thing with the guys who win the golds and then kill themselves or win the championship and then go into these massive depressions is because they're playing the wrong game when Kobe was asked shortly before he died like do you think that you're somebody who's afraid
(10:42) of losing or do you think you're somebody who loves winning he basically denied both frames he said I'm paraphrasing I just love playing to the best of my ability and that's what he measures himself off of the fact that the world chooses to measure him on the fact that he's won so many games that's the world's problem not ours it's saying I'm game master not a player and I choose to play by these rules and as long as I playing I win by default and it's because I'm not accepting the world's rules for winning I make my own
(11:10) an easier analogy here is and this is a naval Ron quote he said what looks like work to other people should feel like play for you if you look at an artist and he's painting you're like hey how soon are you going to finish that painting the point for the artist is to paint he'll finish that piece and he'll start the next one but the process of painting is the thing that they enjoy and so the idea is that if you can commit and the broader you can generalize what you're committing to the easier it will be to stick with it so
(11:36) you might be like I love making calls but I hate entering things in the CRM well both of those are required for the role of sales and so I prefer to chunk up a level and say I prefer to do hard work because of what that work does to me then whether I'm putting [ __ ] into the CRM or editing a document or having a hard conversation all of those things are difficult and I see those as all contributing to the person I ultimately want to be until eventually I die and it won't matter anyways and so the only asset that you really get to keep with
(12:03) you is your character and that's the only thing you keep building and so if you make the character the W at the end of the day did or I did I not contribute to the character of the person that I want to become if that's the W every day you can never lose if you have your menu option of things that you can do in life just remove quitting as one of them and then try your next idea and if you are in that Rocky cut scene and you're 2 months in 3 months in remember that the rocky cut scene in the movie last a couple seconds and the rocky cut scene
(12:32) in real life might last a few years and so whenever I get to a low point where I think why do I even bother doing this I just like to remind myself this is where most people stop and this is why they don't win and as hard as this is going to sound the best thing that I ever did was not listen to other people's opinions about my life they don't want the best version of you they want the version of you who best serves them and unfortunately the closer people are to you the more similarly they they'll see themselves in you and the more your
(13:01) success will make them feel bad about themselves and I can promise you this from somebody who might be a little further I have more people who root for me now that I've already won than people who rooted for me along the way no one is doing as well as you think they're doing so by comparison everyone is better off than they think because the cumulative median visually is probably three times higher than what the actual median is and so if you're like oh I'm average or slightly below average compared to the perceived median of
(13:29) society you're probably way above average and that's okay and being above or below average doesn't even matter anyways because you've got a lot of innings left there's a lot of quarters left to play and so like until the day you die you still have hope you still have a chance you can still keep moving forward whenever someone gives you your their opinion about what you should do with their your life it's really them saying this is my preference of how I want to live my life and I say great live your life that way and I'll live my
(13:56) life this way because me living my my life has no effect on you so live your life the way you want to live it and I don't want your life either they State make those statements because they feel uncomfortable and so they have to like release it and so they say that to you to make themselves feel better and that's their problem not yours I think I've learned a lot of frames around not caring about others people's opinions be out of necessity because I was so crippled by the opinions of other people for what felt like such a long time that
(14:25) I always had to face my death in order to get myself to move and so I talk about death a lot because it has actually been one of the few things that actually motivates me to change my behavior and so when I had done all the things that I thought would impress other people one I realized that they didn't really care and secondly I realized that I deeply cared about how much I hated my life when I was like is this what winning feels like because if this is what winning is then I don't want to play by thinking I'd rather be
(14:51) dead than continue to play this game I was forced to change the game I was playing which is like well what is a game that I would like to win at well I'd like to win a game that is by rules that I set out and there are things that I can control and then those people because you break their mold of what they're supposed to be doing and they might be miserable too but they are not willing to take the risk that you're willing to take because they care about other people's opinions more than you do because they haven't gone through that
(15:13) little journey that you just went through fine you do it your way they do it their way I mean I went from prodigal son my father super proud of me graduating Vanderbilt in three years president the fraternity vice president of the powerlifting Team Management Consultant to uh minimum wage employee like that's a pretty significant Dro in status I have these frames because people will say whatever they want but for me that relative drop in status was a lot I went from about as high status as you can get in a as a 22-year-old to
(15:41) about as low status as you can get I mean I remember having people be like so did you go to college and I was like yeah I went to college and I [ __ ] murdered it and I did everything and the cuz the implied question is why are you here and so that's what in the beginning hurt a ton but then I just realized that they just didn't know and they were were asking genuinely and all of my judgment around that was just my own problem how I'm perceiving this question is affecting my mood to such a great degree what if I applied this to every question
(16:08) all these people are asking me things and I'm either getting offended or getting complimented but the statement doesn't change so that sounds like a me problem and so the more I started diving into things like that the less bothered I became by everyone everyone else's opinion because they also have no context even if they did mean it is an insult so what if they're saying well I'm better than you I'd be like yes you are a lot of even successful people frame their success around trying to prove someone wrong right but when you
(16:34) try and create your entire existence in opposition to someone you actually give them complete control over your life it means that because of the things that this person has said I will choose to change all of my behavior which basically means that the directives from that person have commanded you to do whatever you do and if you like to be a free person and want to be somebody who acts of their own valtion then I choose to accept insults so that I can live my life rather than living in contrast to them and giving my control to the person
(17:00) who insulted me I that would mean I put me changing your mind above my goals which I don't do my goals are more important to me than changing your mind I'm super sensitive to I am statements labeling statements like this like I'm a neat freak I'm the type of person who so whenever you're dating someone you're getting to know someone people like to blanket I am statements really early on to set the stage like I'm this type I'm the type person who likes to show up early I like to clean things I'm a labeler I'm a whatever and then and this
(17:26) is the Insidious part they then say because and then they insert a reason that they made up or that sounded good in the past and people nodded their heads and agreed with because my mom never loved me enough because I didn't get enough hugs because I gave a speech once and everyone laughed at me because you don't know and the reality is you will never know all we know is that you do a certain type of behavior that's it by giving these because statements all this power you actually put all the power into something that is unchangeable in
(17:56) the past and so you have to keep dealing with it whereas if you just said I do these things period now if I want to change what I do then I should just reward myself in the present for doing something different and that makes it a lot more valuable and it makes your identity and what you do as a result or rather what you do and your identity as a result something under your control you don't want to blame the things in the past that you can't change you want to blame things in the present that you can't so if you said I have trouble
(18:20) getting close to girls because my mom and I aren't close one you give your mother all the power in your love life you give power to something that happened in the past that you can't change to things that are happening in the present that you can change and so wouldn't it be more useful to say in the past I have struggle to get close to girls period now that could be for a number of reasons thing is is that you don't know what reason it is cuz I could say let's say imagine all these things happening you struggled with your mom
(18:48) let's say you had a bad breakup at some point in your life you're not in shape I could say I struggle getting close to girls and I could use any of those three as my reasons but which of those serve me none of them all we know is that you struggle to get close to girls okay well then just look at what it would take to get close to girls and then do that rather than having this other thing that's attached to the behavior that you can't do anything about it just makes changing who you are and what you do a lot easier sometimes people are such
(19:18) douchebags they will tell a young child you will never have a successful relationship with a woman because you don't respect or love me a mother or the reverse could be true of a father they're a [ __ ] douchebag for saying that because they are labeling you with something that you can't change but that's their problem it also is no basis in fact when people are like look at how the son treats the mother that's how he's going to treat his wife why the [ __ ] would I treat my wife like I treat my mother dear God that's just a
(19:46) statement that sounds good but has no basis in fact you treat your wife like you treat your wife you treat your mother like you treat your mother they're different people people want to have problems because it gives them a reason to suck and it be okay it gives them ego padding so they can protect themselves for the reason why they're not successful for the reason they haven't accomplished what they said they were going to accomplish and so they lean on their potential comma and their trauma as the two reasons that people
(20:10) prop up I've got lots of potential but I have all this trauma and neither of those matter I've gone through three stages of like mental development in terms of how I see changing my behavior in the beginning I attributed my behavior to my past traumas the second phase was that I I chose to change the story what if my mother was just trying to feel better it wasn't my fault so then I changed my behavior in that sense the third phase which is where I'm at now maybe it'll be a fourth phase but the third phase was I behave this way
(20:36) period the because statement in the second half is completely irrelevant one because I don't know it two because I can't change it so I might as well just choose to do the thing that I want to do irrelevant of my past the single strongest predictor of my behavior is what will make the more epic story I've thought about that frame a lot and it's still continued to win out and so when I'm forced to make a decision between two things I prefer to choose the one that's the more epic story because either you have an epic story of failure
(21:02) or you have an epic story of success but no 85-year olds are regretting their epic stories they are regretting the stories they never told our minds are meaning making machines and they have to be because they create associations between things we know and things we don't know that's how we learn the problem is that our brains will make wrong associations and then they will plague us for the rest of our lives but we can just redefine what the association means for ourselves to make our lives easier because whether you
(21:23) miss the game-winning shot when there's a huge crowd or you miss it when no one else is there the only reason it h hurts more is because you choose to let it hurt you more now there are things that you can do prior to the game-winning shot that can increase the likely that you make it which is that you practice way more in high stakes conditions over and over and over again and if you do that it increases the likelihood your confidence that you'll be able to make it why because you've made them before and if you're like well I missed my
(21:44) first ever game-winning shot now what do I do well you practice in every other condition that's as close to that as you can until eventually you make one and then when you do make one you'll have evidence that you've made one and you try and make one again what you probably don't know is that Michael Jordan has missed more game-winning shots than he has made but he's remembered for the ones that he made but how was he able to make them by missing and being willing to shoot again on that basis of story The many excuses that we give ourselves
(22:06) in Reverse can make a more epic story and so rather than to say like these are all the reasons that I can't succeed I think reframing that is these are all the reasons that when I succeed it'll be an even better story and it'll be more inspiring to other people is a much more powerful frame the more disadvantages you have when you start the more epic story you have when you win Donald Miller has one of the most powerful frames of heroes and villains I've ever heard of heroes and villains always have the same backstory it's pain they're
(22:31) always an orphan right or the the villain has some sort of disfigurement to show that they went through hard times the difference is what the character chooses to do about it villains say the world hurt me I'm going to hurt it back Heroes say the world hurt me I'm not going to let anyone else hurt this way so Heroes use pain villains are used by it and so I think all of us have the choice to become our own Heroes our own villains in our own life simply by how we choose to do with the pain that we all inevitably
(23:00) experience so pain is a constant the choice about how we react to it is the thing that dictates the path of Our Lives you know there there are certain rules of playing the game that have served me really well one of them is and that's okay and I probably use that frame more than anything else which is I'm not close with XYZ relative your parent your mom your sister your brother and that's okay it's been a a lot of my mental effort trying to untangle stories that I told in the past about things that were my fault or were a problem and
(23:34) the easiest way that I found to solve problems is to decide they're not problems to begin with I have a handful of pictures that I took for the first 5 years of sucking during business and I use those pictures all the time every day and the zillions of pictures after I became successful I barely use any of them the time to document your life is when it sucks not when it's great because those are the stories that you're going to tell and those are going to be the reminders that you use in the present day of things that you have been
(24:05) through and prove as to who you really are because my favorite line in The Matrix is in the second or third Matrix when Morpheus is standing on the hell and he's looking at towards everyone and he said I stand Here truthfully unafraid not because of the path that lies before me but because of the path that lies behind me and so the struggle period that you may be in right now is the path behind your future self that you are building so that that man or that woman can stand on the pulpit and look at you straight dead in the eyes in the mirror
(24:34) and say I'm confident and I stand truthfully here unafraid not because of what I said my goal is going to be but because what I've been through to get here and so here's my advice to my younger self document your life more otherwise you'll forget the details and the details are what make it worth remembering it's the times you're sleeping on the floor it's the time the person walks out and you miss the seventh sale that day it's the time when your bank account's at its absolute lowest it's when you're car breaks down
(24:58) on the side of the road and you're like what am I going to do now I can barely afford this right those are the moments the ones that you want to ignore the ones that you want to look away from that are the ones that you need to capture because those are the moments that you will tell in the future of things you got through because no heroes are heroes without Epic monsters and the bigger the monster the greater the hero

Transcript:
(00:00) I have over 100 sales people across our portfolio that does over $250 million a year in this video I'm going to teach you one sales skill that separates the best from the rest and it's so powerful I've never taught it before and so I'm going to cover the 3A framework of reframing which is the skill I'm going to teach you and the five rules for using it ethically so what's reframing reframing is the one to three sentences that you say after a prospect says anything but yes that increases the likelihood that whatever your next thing
(00:25) you say gets them to buy so here's how a reframe might sound someone might say say hey uh how many certifications do your trainers have now this is a trap question because it's basically a blind question where whatever you say in response Prospect gets to be the judge of whether or not they accept that and then they choose to buy or not and you don't know what the right answer is and so rather than answer the question you ask a question about the question and so you'd say something like well which certifications are you looking for
(00:56) specifically the next version of this might be someone says uh how many questions I'm going be able to ask via email in support now whatever number you give they might say oh that's that's not enough or that's too many or whatever it is and then they say no for that reason I don't want to buy so instead you might say well why do you want to ask additional questions how many questions do you want to ask is there a purpose that you're trying to solve with this like what are you most afraid of see that was two or three questions in a row
(01:20) that can reframe without answering the question they gave me and one of the biggest lessons that I teach in sales is the person asking the questions is the one who's in control and if you've ever seen the Hollywood movies where they're like I'm the one asking the questions here it's because the person who ask the questions is the one who's in control of the conversation as soon as they start asking the questions you're on defense which is not where you want to be and the reframing process I'm about to show you has sold things as low as 100 bucks
(01:46) all the way up to Million Dollar Plus service packages and it's sold them in person on the phone via Zoom from stage wherever which way you can imagine this works so in a second I'm going to give you the 3 a framework and five rules for using it because this is unbelievably powerful and in use the right way it helps lots of people make good decisions use the wrong way you become a very bad person give a bad reputation for sales so the reason I started thinking about this was I was writing and reviewing our closing manual for our closers and I had
(02:14) this little piece right before all the closes says hey by the way make sure that you reframe the question before you enter into the close but the thing is is I realized as I was walking through the sales Flor the other day I heard someone just immediately fir back an obstacle overcome and it seemed very combative and I was like ah they're not they're not getting the the reframe part and I realized that that little reframe little bubble was one of if not the most important part of handling sales and so if you think about what the most
(02:43) productive sales people do the people who close the highest percentage of sales what do they do they ask for the sale more times than anyone else now here's the problem with that is that if you ask more times than anyone else the wrong way you'll get prospects to hate you and if prospects hate you they won't buy from you and so the idea is we want to be able to ask ask for the sale as many times as soon asly possible which means the way that we ask for the sale or how we frame our ask should not decrease rapport with the customer and
(03:10) so the idea is we want to continue to maintain Rapport the entire time so that we can then ask as many times as we darn well please so here's the 3A framework that I teach the first a is acknowledge all right this is where you build rapport with the prospect version one all right and the way that we do that is by saying what they said back to us now there's a couple benefits from this one is when you say it back to them they think that you're actively listing which of course you should but the other part of it is that it buys you time to think
(03:42) about what you're going to say next and so it gives you a little bit of space to process before you give your overcome or your handling of whatever their objection is the second piece and this is part of why this seems more natural with the most professional guys is that you this is the this is the really sexy part you associate all right now there's three associations that I'm going to show you how to do but what you do is you associate the question they asked with the type of behavior that someone who gets the best
(04:10) results from your product or service would ask and so basically when they feel like they're taking a step away from buying you say that's an amazing question that's actually a question that a lot of the best customers we have ask and so actually you just say nope that means that you're more likely to buy the third thing is that after you have made the association you've made you've acknowledged what they said you've made the association then you ask your next question after you've properly reframed what you're going to say next so let's
(04:37) dive into this so like a lawyer in an interrogation they never ask questions they don't already know the answers to and you as a salesperson want to only ask questions that you know the answers to and if you are ever going to answer questions you want to know that you have the right answer before you respond and so when we do the acknowledgement let's walk through the example I had earlier so they say well what kind of certifications do your trainers have and I say so you're curious about what our certifications are it's a great question
(05:06) it's actually shows that you're really rational person and you're making a serious decision here which is amazing so what I did was boom We restated it boom we made our association and then I would ask an i you can call it an attack it sounds a little bit more aggressive than it is but you basically attack the frame of the question you say hey which certification you looking for specifically and the thing is is most people have never asked a question about their question they usually ask questions because they feel like they're
(05:33) supposed to to make an informed decision but most of the time they don't even know what they're asking and so they're like I don't know it's like well let me tell you what we do have now if the person's like uh do they have nasman Ace certifications now if I don't have that for my trainer specifically I would then say why those certifications specifically right and then they would say well I I I heard that they're good it's like well those are amazing certifications I agree with them I'm not disagreeing and then I would say well we
(06:00) have a couple other ones and I'll tell you why we chose these rather than those and now I can answer it without failing right now if I just said uh our guys don't have that or they have this I might have lost the sale right there and so the thing is is that this applies to basically any question that someone asks it could even be like um you know I need to think about it it' be like awesome what's your main concern right like immediately I'm not I'm not letting them out on that or like hey what are the main variables using to decis make the
(06:26) decision or what would make this a no right these are all questions what are you most afraid of having happen right if I'm deeper in the sale obviously that wouldn't be my first one I would say what's your main concern then we'd sort the question from there but many times people ask you questions in the sale that you don't need to answer you just ask more questions about their question and as long as you're the one asking questions you're the one who's in control which leads me to rule number one of the triaa so here's a little
(06:53) psychology for you as counterintuitive as this seems a prospect believes almost nothing about what you said say in almost everything that they say and so the goal is not to tell them they're a good fit the goal is to ask them questions so that they then say I think I'm a good fit for this or yeah that makes sense that's how you can get them you breadcrumb them to The Logical solution which is that they should buy your thing and by the way if you like some of this more advanced sales stuff we go through this stuff in depth at our
(07:22) acquisition. comom scaling Workshop so my sales director he personally meets with all the companies uh that show up and helps them issue whether it's nurture issues whether it's compensation issues is stuff that we understand really well and so if you are a business owner you are looking to scale check them out acquisition.
(07:38) comom hit the scale button and my team will be in touch so a lot of beginner salespeople think that they should want and this is the worst question ever asked in sales is do you have any questions it's literally asking them to have objections and asking them to take the wheel of the conversation you're literally saying here take control over this because I don't know what I'm doing so please don't do that train that out of your team the second thing is that as soon as you start answering questions again they're the judge jury and executioner of whether or
(08:01) not your answers are good and if your salespeople are not as knowledgeable as you or your technicians which is often true in any kind of service business the people delivering are not necessarily the same or as knowledgeable as the people who are selling it is that they basically set themselves up for failure and I'll give you a quick overcome for this if someone gets a little bit like hey why aren't you answering my questions you say listen it would be like you asking the secretary about how your heart surgery is going to be with
(08:25) the surgeon you're going to want to talk to the surgeon and I'll give you a different one I call this the mechanic version which is hey you're asking me what's wrong with your car and it would be unethical for me to answer it without looking under the hood first and so we can give you much better answers on the inside once we started working with your business or with your whatever right with your body it doesn't really matter right but you can use that analogy to kind of get around it and then I say this and this seals it and if anyone
(08:46) this is how I say it and if anyone does give you an answer on the first call without already having looked under the hood after already giving you a physical or doing the an assessment run the other way because it means they're just trying to tell you whatever they can to get you to buy and now I have the ethical High ground and they can't ask any more questions about that rule number two no one can disagree with a question I tell my team be like smoke and so you can't catch smoke because all you're doing is
(09:12) you're basically always sides shifting in terms of whatever they say you're like o let me ask you a question about that oh can you be more specific hey what are the variables you're thinking about and that way you're always engaging with them and they're the ones doing the talking and then you get to decide whether their answers are good or not and whether or not they're a good fit for the program now we're not going to tell them that that they're a good fit for the program we're going have them make that decision but in terms of
(09:35) judge jury executioner you want that to be you here's why rule number two is so important you can never disagree with a prospect now you may you may you know actually disagree with them but you don't want to voice disagreement with the prospect because you never win a sale by winning an argument anyone who's engaged in an argument both people lose and more importantly for you as a salesperson you lose the sale and so the objective is actually to never disagree with a prospect and the point is to get them to change their minds and we can
(10:01) only do that in an agreeable way people don't change their minds when in a bad mood or they feel insulted right and so we do that by asking them questions now there are ways to ask questions that seem insulting and that's what triaa helps solve and we're going to dive more on that as we go through this but it also means that we can ask questions about their questions which is something that a lot of beginner salespeople don't know they then assume they know what this person is asking about and so they have this really vague question and then
(10:25) they try and come up with the quote right answer and they fail every time and by the way this is just the Ultra Mega hack is that if you don't know how to answer the question you can always ask more questions about their question so let me show you how this sounds in reality so someone says I need to think about it we say totally understand what are the main things you're considering what are the variables that you're considering in your decision what's your main concern what are you most afraid of having happen What would make this a no
(10:53) and one of my favorite questions by the way is well then what would it take for you to say yes now let's say someone says I don't have time timing is off right now for me you say great totally understand acknowledge timing is kind of tough for you right now I think it's smart that you're already thinking about implementation our biggest success stories are actually people who think they're the process the same way you are right now so what would make it a good time and so as you work through this this these two give you the space make
(11:23) the positive Association they take a step back you say I feel you I totally understand now they're back to neutral and then you iate with the thing that's closer to the sale and then you move the move the conversation forward with the ask so let's do another one someone says I need to talk to my spouse you say totally understand I think it's really sensible that you'd want to talk to your spouse and super fair just so I understand out of curiosity what parts do you think now I'm here what parts do you think they wouldn't like what parts
(11:48) do you think they would disagree with and so we've now moved from I have to talk to my partner to now we're back in the sale talking about the specific things and once we get the prospect to name those things then we can attack those right we're still in the sale so let's say someone says I hate this particular feature you say totally get it I hate them all too just kidding let me just ask you a real question why not and then we can get we're back into it right like all of these things is people will make statements as though they are
(12:15) deal Enders and beginners will take a statement like that and think oh I guess they're not going to buy and that's couldn't be further from the truth you just continue to ask questions about why they don't like something and by continuing to ask questions about their questions you can stay in it and keep asking because that's the point the best closers make the most asks which leads me to rule number three which is tell them what their question means so this is a zoom in on associate if you're a salesperson with at least two years of
(12:42) experience and you're enjoying this stuff this is like just the surface of the type of stuff that we train our teams on and if you'd like to work at acquisition. comom or one of our portfolio companies we are always looking for exceptional sales people we have a lot of roles open right now in sales and so you can go to acquisition.
(12:59) /are and hit the business consultant button that'll that'll take you to the uh application for that if you're good just apply we're willing to be flexible on payments based on experience and whatnot but just put in the application so the first time I had this used on me I was actually getting pitched investment or private wealth management from somebody and I wanted to just get out of the conversation as fast as I could because I was like I already have a wealth advisor like I'm good and the guy just said oh that's amazing 90% of
(13:28) the clients we have that shift over are already have a wealth advisor so it means you already know how a lot of these things work which means you'll be up the learning curve and I was like what just happened I was like I thought I was getting out of this and now I'm more like the customers that that ultimately buy and I ended up not buying from that particular guy but I did think wow that was such a powerful reframe how can I use that in all of my selling and so the prospect has not had this conversation as many times as you
(13:57) you should never be caught off guard with the questions or the statements that they're going to make remember you've had a thousand of these conversations the fact that somebody could surprise you is ridiculous you have to practice this is why we train and so a prospect is trying to just throw up bombs or smoke screens to get out of the sale and again to be clear what I believe is bad selling is one of two key things is one is you sell an unqualified Prospect which basically means that you're lying to them that
(14:23) they're going to get a good result or that they somehow are qualified when they're really not which really underpins the main thing of sales in my opinion which we have across really all of our communication stuff in the company which is State the facts and tell the truth if you state the facts and tell the truth and this person is qualified then you have the ethical obligation to ask as many times as you possible and get them to pull their head out of their ass so that they can see the world clearly instead of it being
(14:44) dark and full of which is is up their ass and help them make a decision to help themselves that's the point now if you get weird about resistance then you don't understand the job of sales the the best sales people are comfortable when other people feel like there's conflict all right and so they're able to always deescalate which is why be like smoke is so key it's a dance not a fight it's seduction not rape all right the idea is that we want to always have consent from the person we always want them to want to be there
(15:16) and people like you when you ask questions about them people like you when you compliment them and you say hey that's a really smart question hey that makes you just like the people who have the best success stories and I'll show you a little bit more about some more associations in the next rule which leaves to rule number four use Straw Men for tough truths so we've all been in a sale where someone just says something ridiculous where you can clearly see that they beliefs around the world are so flawed that you have to have kind of
(15:40) a papa talk right now there's different ways of entering this some people say hey can I put my coach hat on instead of my friend hat so the thing is is that in all of these reframes you're basically getting permission from the person to give them a harsh truth now if you're a younger guy and let's say you sell B2B much tougher to do so if you're 22-year- old sales guy and you're talking to a 45-year-old you know $10 million year plumber he probably doesn't give a about you trying to put your coach hat on he just thinks you're a child and he
(16:08) doesn't care at all to the same degree if you say hey well can I share something that really worked well for me again the same degree that puts you above him and he's not going to like that and so I use three different strategies of Straw Men and strawman in argumentation is basically like basically putting I use the word foil normally but people don't know what that means but basically it's like you basically put up this caricature of someone who's just like them that you can then have the tough conversation
(16:31) with without insulting the prospect so I'll give you three different ways that we do this so the first way is when you make the association so this is us going deep on associate here okay so this is where someone says whatever it is totally understand that you're coming from that direction I would ask those questions too now we make the association so one of three so number one you can say it's so funny you ask that because I had someone just earlier today who asked the same questions can I share with you what I just shared with
(16:59) them now the thing is is that because I'm now talking about a conversation I had with someone else I can now be brutal as to this other person but I'm not saying it to the Prospect and so it's not insulting the second way that you can do this is that you do it in reference and I said it earlier to a successful past customer that's so cra like totally understand you know what that actually makes you just like Sarah who had a similar Plumbing business and actually crushed it with our marketing agency and so now we've made the association and
(17:30) she asked this question too boom and then we and then we handle the objection all right and so these Straw Men are particularly important when you are going to answer a question so everything up to this point has been basically sidest stepping being like smoke but sometimes you will have to make the answer and so if we do need to give them an explanation or kind of break their belief when they're say I don't have time you're like oh it's not really a timing thing it's a priorities question but if you say that to somebody and you
(17:55) don't have as much Rapport you're going to lose the sale right like that is the logical thing it everybody has the same amount of time every day it's really just a question of priorities but if you say it at the wrong time they're going to be like screw you right and so by doing the straw man or putting the foil up or the car that you can then attack or talk to in front of this Prospect it creates a third party that's neutral the third way of using the associate is that you can appeal to Authority so if you're in a business
(18:21) where the CEO is edified or the CEO is seen as a as a as a as a uh as a respectable person or an expert in the field either can be fame or it can be influence or can be expertise it doesn't really matter which one but as long as they have some level of expertise instead of appealing to your own authority you appeal to theirs which is it's so funny that you ask that Alex just told me this thing earlier today can I share it with you right and so then the person appeals to someone else's Authority and then shares it they're the messenger they're
(18:51) not saying I'm not saying this he said it and I'm just sharing it with you these sound like tiny Sid steps but this type of triple reframing is what separates beginners from pros and it and when you do it this way people actually like to be sold by you because they feel like they're being hurt you make associations that are saying hey that's smart hey that's reasonable totally understand why you'd say that like these are all things like that's a rational decision hey I think that's a fair point those are all things that someone wants
(19:17) to hear they're like hey he's listening he thinks I'm intelligent or I'm rational or he's not discarding my decision everybody wants to be validated right so it's the same thing as the angry boat but just in a sales conversation so in the angry boat for customer success or customer service if someone's upset you don't disagree with them and say hey it wasn't that big of a deal sorry we were 5 minutes late it never works because you're disagreeing with them you're invalidating the reason that they're angry so you have to get
(19:42) more angry you have to go above and that's where you say hey that's a totally reasonable concern rather than saying that's a stupid question right like you might feel that way but you don't say that and the reason I realize this especially with the association one is I heard my sales guys and they were they were having a tougher time using some of the closes and I was like they're like yeah you know some of them aren they sound a little you know tough they're a little harsh and I was like no no no it's and when I realized that I
(20:10) was like oh it's because they're not prefacing it with this if you preface with this you can say almost anything and this allows you to cut to the heart of the matter way faster instead of dancing around it because you don't want to hurt someone's feelings which leads me to rule number five which is retain childlike curiosity at all times so one of my favorite ways of training this concept is actually training a physical thing that you do with your body even if you're on a sales call and they can't see you because your tone will change
(20:35) based on how you're standing if you're smiling or not your voice will come out different which by the way I encourage you to have a mirror if you're on the phone next to you in your sales booth and if you do Zoom obviously you can see your own little image there but I like to have people say huh and you say it just like that and huh also buys you two or three seconds before you say your next thing say huh that's so interesting you'd ask that question can I can I ask you a little bit more about that like if someone says something really
(21:02) nasty to you right but if you if you retain that way the goal is to seek to understand not whenn and the way that I try to keep this and if you're a sales guide put a little sticky note above your camera or wherever you look while you're selling which is keep the human number one all right and so this is a really powerful frame that I actually learned from Leila for having hard conversations on the team but it actually applies to sales which is if you genuinely believe that the product you have is going to help this person
(21:27) and this is a qualified prospect that you're talking to then you want to understand their concerns so that you can help them get over them because you know this is the right decision for them and so this is a frame that I like to think about so let's say you could travel back in time but you're in a different body and you see your old self and you know what the future's going to be and you might say okay I have to convince this person to buy Nvidia 10 years ago and so or I have to buy Apple stock or I have to buy Bitcoin whatever
(21:58) it is I don't really care the thing is is you know that this thing is going to go through the roof but the person you're talking to doesn't know you from adom think about how you talk to that person now remember they don't know who you are even though you know you you would have absolute empathy for your old self and be like listen I totally understand this seems totally crazy but let me walk you through what I think is going to happen right let me let's like what are what are your main concerns what are you most afraid of right what
(22:24) would it take for you to say yes what would it take for us to take the next step together it allows you to make sure that you're focusing on the prospect rather than the product and so you don't close sales by being right you close sales by making the prospect right and so the big understanding here is that you want to understand them not beat them because as soon as it feels combative you've already lost the sale if they feel like you won an argument logically you've lost the sale the point is to make money not to be right and so
(22:53) we want them to feel good about The Logical decision that we're helping them make and if anything you want to be you want to be a face hero in this in their in their Journey you're like hey I'm just I'm just the guide here I'm just I'm going to just share the information that I think will help you make a good decision right Ah that's a great question can I provide a little bit of context on that just from someone that had this experience earlier today right like all of these things are things that will allow you to give those hard truths
(23:15) to close the deal the reason the association is so important is that it gives the prospect a label to then live up to and so this is a 2011 version of selling but if you say Hey you seem like a really honest person or hey that's a really smart decision or hey that's a really smart question if I then give them that label when I get closer to the close I might bring that back up and then associate smart people by this thing right hey that's you must be a good family man right because you had some spouse objection fine seems like
(23:44) your family man family is really important to you I think that's awesome it's super admirable now when I get to the end of the sale I can bring up the fact that this is a family man and because he's a family man he should buy and so it allows me to pair whatever their obstacles were with things that I'm going to bring up in the clothes Pro tip my Universal response for almost anything so I walked through the sales floor and one of the guys was on the phone and I was like you should come and I just walked through the room and then
(24:09) the guy was like ah and so my sales guy was like so you coming and the iy was like yeah and it a super weak right he was obviously not sold yet so I actually was like give me the phone and so I hopped on the phone and I said dude what are you afraid of and so when you ask what are you most afraid of it gets you to the heart of the issue as fast as POS now if it's the first objection I would want to ask what's your main concern what's your main issue what are the variables using to make the decision that's like kind of understanding so you
(24:35) can triage but when I'm further along in the sale I'll usually ask hey what are you afraid of man like what are you afraid of having happen and if someone's like I just I just need more time then you say totally understand what would make it a no and so by doing that it still keeps you in the sale because at the end of the day like you want to make a good decision I'm the source of your information so the best possible decision we can make is is here but again you can only say something like that if you have Rapport in the sale and
(25:00) you've continue to demonstrate that throughout if I said something like that and I didn't have Rapport they'd be like no you so it's not going to work if you liked this very mini training you're going to love the 4our plus compilation of my best sales trainings all put together at once click it enjoy

The SEASON OF NO (What it Takes to Win) - YouTube
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ueJg14gQLuc

Transcript:
(00:00) so if you have trouble being productive then I would consider entering a season of no Warren Buffett once said the difference between successful people and really successful people is that really successful people say no to almost everything when I look at the periods of my life in business where I've had huge amounts of growth in very short periods of time I've gone through things that I call the season of no and a season of no isn't forever but it's just for now and sometimes seasons can be three months sometimes seasons can be three years the
(00:27) longest season of know that I had was a three year season during that season of no I said no to friends I was a little bit extreme but I also was running from absolute poverty and I had started seeing some success and I was so afraid of messing it up that I said no to alcohol so I stopped drinking entirely I stopped saying yes to any social events I was in a paid group that I was paying like 35 000 a year to be in and I didn't go to any of the events for two years even though I paid for it a lot of people think it hurts to say no to
(00:57) things because it does because you feel like you're rejecting other people and most of us have been on the other side of that that and feeling rejected sucks you have to kind of trick your brain into thinking that the no is actually a yes to the thing that matters most because the way that I've always thought about this was from my first principal's perspective of if I achieve this really big thing in three years or five years all of these doors will be open for me but if I allow these onesie twosy one-off conversations one-off favors
(01:20) one-off things to take me away from that one big thing I know that five years from now me not having the thing makes it far less likely that even those first doors are still open they're only reaching out to me now because of the little bit of success that I've experienced which I got here because of being focused on the one thing that mattered most Jim Watson the big 50 million dollar whatever exit was built during a season of no and all the people that I said no to still hit me up but if I hadn't built that during a season of no and I had
(01:49) said yes to all these little things and I said no to the thing that mattered most they might not be here still hitting me up there's two scenarios that I play out in my head one is that at the end of this where you achieve something 95 of people are going to be even further behind you and so you'll still have access to them the people who were on par with you shoulder to shoulder always mutual respect you still also have access to them if for some reason someone is offended that you said no to them earlier on guess what there are
(02:17) other people that in this future state will walk into your life and so there's a lot of no's that I made early on that I can't even remember the door that probably permanently shut because I have so many other doors that have opened for me I like to think of yeses that I give to other people as withdrawals from my personal energy account and I think of knows as deposits into my gold account here's our Warren Buffett told people to make goals he said write down your 25 top goals in life he's a said really think about it make them in order 1 to
(02:47) 25 then Circle the top five tear off everything underneath and throw it away because those are the only things that matter during a season of no I put all of my effort into the one goal of those five that matters the most to me then I write down what is the minimum that I have to do to not move backwards in these ones kind of like bodybuilding you usually can only work on one weakness at a time Steve Jobs said people think Focus means saying yes to the thing you've got to focus on but that's not what it means at all it means seeing no
(03:14) to a hundred other good ideas that are out there you have to pick carefully I'm actually as proud of the things we haven't done as the things I have done when you think about focusing right you think well focusing is saying yes no focusing is about saying no Innovation is saying no to a thousand other good ideas there's the opportunistic yeses and no's that we have to make so the better and better your business gets the more attractive the opportunities that will present themselves and so you may have this marketing agency for example
(03:43) and it's doing well but then all of a sudden one of your clients is like hey man how about I give you equity in my business and you keep doing the marketing for me and then you start thinking yourself well yeah because I'm gonna make more on this deal I should do this deal but the thing is is there's so much inefficiency in this one-off or ones you choose your relationship that you lose on the main thing if you build this massive agency that's the thing that everyone's going to come to you for if you have this weird thing with two or
(04:06) three odd appendages from these one-off deals I'll tell you as an investor when I see that I see an undisciplined entrepreneur I see someone who cannot focus on the thing that matters most and that's why when we talk about leverage in terms of getting more for what you put in that's why being so selective on the one thing that matters most is so important because most people don't achieve the success they want because they either don't do the thing that matters most enough times they don't do it for long enough or they're doing the
(04:29) wrong thing altogether most plans taken to their natural end are actually pretty good so even if you had a local business that was a dry cleaning business if you did it for 40 years never got distracted I promise you that one you'd have a pretty good dry cleaning business too you'd probably have multiple locations and three you might have been able to scale Nationwide I was in the gym space for a decade so I could have gone into probably having 100 locations of my own or doing the franchise route I went the
(04:51) licensing route but just staying in that game for a decade straight without doing anything else and when I did do something else which is why I make these videos because it was one of my bigger mistakes I started the supplement company and I probably shouldn't have done that I probably should have kept doing the main thing there's also the no of doing work that's below your pay grade this actually happened with the portfolio company recently they have access cash flow they're making profit every month but the CEO in the short
(05:15) term didn't want their cash flow to go down there was this clear role that he was spending 10 to 15 hours a week on it I'm like dude that's two full days of your work week but he didn't want to give it to somebody else because it wasn't 40 hours of this week do you not think that in the two full other days you can make up for the work that you shouldn't be doing that somebody else can do and realistically they'll do it better than you because they're actually fully focused on it rather than trying to get it done you have to say no this
(05:39) is going to be a controversial one to family obligations we even say the word family obligation as though it's assumed and expected it's a choice it's a Family Choice I'm not saying don't talk to your family I'm saying you might not want to talk to your mom every day what you really have is a family trade-off you're going to trade getting a one-off comment or a stink eye you think you're too good for us now or Mr big shot comment for the one thing that matters most if you can't talk to me your father you got all the
(06:09) money but you know what you don't have you don't have no heart you ain't got two balls you have to let other people's dream of you die so that your dream can live because there's only so much of you to go around everybody else is trying to get you to be the version of you that best serves them including your family I don't think it's a malicious intention but they have goals for you that are probably not your goals for you and somebody's goals have to die and where most of them die is right in the middle which is you try and do theirs and you
(06:36) try and do yours and you actually accomplish neither so you might as well do a hundred percent yours do none of theirs and then actually achieve the long-term goal which they probably have is that you live a happy and successful life you only get there by saying no in the short term to get the long yes this is a big one this is business contacts and this is one of the hardest ones to say no to so you hop on the call you hop on the zoom call you take the hey got a second say you got 15.
(07:00) I'll show you literally I looked at my inbox let me tell you the actual words what it sounds like hey I wanted to touch base real quick about something hey I've got this opportunity I think you're going to want to take a look at let's catch up it's been a minute it's not the 10 minutes they're stealing from me it's the time that I'm thinking about what I'm gonna say before I get on the call it's what I'm thinking about after the call it's the one I wake up the next morning and I'm still thinking about someone else's business rather than my own and it's the
(07:24) actual cost of switching they've done a ton of research on this but basically you are like four times more productive per unit of time if you do one task rather than try and go A and B and they just did it between two tasks just asking people to go switch between task a and then do task B and they were different tasks and it took people four times as long versus just doing a and then B so when people interrupt your day think about it as they just 4X how much longer it's going to take me to get this thing done that's the real cost of
(07:53) saying yes to them now in the beginning if you want to hop on calls to other people because you want to provide value to them by all means do it but you're being conscious about it so if you have trouble being productive or getting the things that you want done or achieving the Big Goal then I would consider entering a season of no there was a season when I was going from six locations to ten now I ultimately talked to a mentor decided to sell my location is to turn into licensing and I was like sucks right now I was like I'm
(08:18) working 80 hours 100 hours a week every hour of every day I gave up football I gave up Netflix and what I started doing is writing down the things that I was willing to sacrifice for my goal rather than things that I was willing to do a lot of times people have these really big to-do lists but what I don't think people do is make really big to-do lists everybody ahead of you has the same time so if you're working all day and you're not making progress as fast as you want it means the people ahead of you it's
(08:41) not that they're doing things you aren't it's that you're doing things they are they're choosing to say no to more activities than you are and if you say no to everything else what's left is the work in front of you that just he's doing Jerry Seinfeld talked about how he wrote comedy he never forced himself to write but he said during the time block he wasn't allowed to do anything else but right he said I could sit there bored but I couldn't do anything else except for right it's a long time to spend on something that means absolutely
(09:07) nothing but that's what I do that's what people want me to do is spend a lot of time wastefully so that then I can then waste their time people aren't willing to sit for that two or three minutes and they allow themselves to get distracted and so I think one of the easiest ways to be really productive is just allow no space for anything else to occur and then what happens by default is you become productive because you have nothing else to do when I need to change a behavior I try and change the environment rather
(09:35) than changing myself because it's way easier to change everything else than to change you

You Get Rich By Not Focusing On Getting Rich - YouTube
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uki3IUkUu7Q

Transcript:
(00:00) stop trying to get rich get better and if you get better getting rich will happen as a consequence getting rich is an outcome getting better is an input most entrepreneurs are focused on the output as the thing and so they're scattered in terms of where their focus is because they're just trying to do everything they can to drive this number up rather than trying to do the thing that creates the wealth I see a lot of small business owners circling around asking the same question which is figuring out how they're going to scale and your almost all doing it the wrong
(00:31) way John Paul deorio said you don't want to be in the selling business and everything that I described at this point is very much the selling business and so the only way that you can grow that business is selling more units is selling more customers and that's a very terrible business to be in and that's also the business that 95% of businesses are in is they're constantly struggling for leads they constantly are trying to figure out where my next customer is coming from and if this is you then listen to what I am saying right now if
(00:58) your goal to grow your business is you say okay I sell books great I sell books in order for me to grow my book business I have to get more people to buy my book and that's it period Well if you do that um there's you literally just have to Market and sell for the rest of your entire life and the only way to grow your business is to advertise more that's literally it the only way to grow and so unless you're supremely good at advertising and you learn how to master Affiliates you learn how to master SEO you learn how how to master making
(01:31) content you learn how to run paid ads you learn how to do email you learn how to do outbound right you learn how to do all these things so that you can maximize your sales unless you do that and the thing is is and this is what sucks is that the next month you have to reload all of your sales again you have to start at zero again and that sucks and that's how the vast majority of businesses live but the thing is it doesn't have to be that way you have to look at the back of the business and say why are there so many holes in my bucket because just pouring more water into the holy bucket like everyone understands
(02:03) this conceptually but we don't act that way and I say this from experience because in the earlier part of my career I only chased revenue and I chased profit I just wanted I wanted growth at all costs but the thing is is that sometimes the cost of that growth is the long-term growth of the business and so it's like you sacrifice the long-term growth so that you can grow faster in the short term and so big picture what what you what you want to do is figure out something that people don't stop buying and I feel like I say this over and over again but like no one does it
(02:34) and so it doesn't have to be a recurring business model you just have something that people either tell their friends immediately about so like in the book instance we sell almost a million dollars a month in books I don't advertise the books right and it's because people read it and then they post about it they tell their friends and then other people buy the book and that that Circle goes on it's because we spent more time on the product and it's the sandwich shop that's like I have to sell more customers into my sandwich shop but their sandwiches are just
(02:59) mediocre and so they're going to be stuck forever trying to figure out what the new Hook is and to be fair I wrote a book on offers and I think that's important when you're getting started but long term the offer just gets them in the door how well you deliver on the offer is what's going to keep them paying over and over again it's going to get them to send referrals I'll tell you a story so I had a friend of mine started a cookie business and when he started the cookie business this is what he did he went around the country to the
(03:24) top cookie stores and chefs or Bakery chefs I don't know what they're called Bakers and he asked them if he could just hang out with them and learn how they bake their cookies and they were you know some of them said you know pound sand but some of them were like sure you can hang out and so he learned what they did to bake cookies and then when he came back home he baked a new dozen cookies every single day for a year and he numbered all the batches and he had 365 batches of cookies and every time he did it he gave it to Tasters and then people would say you know what I like this I don't like this whatever and so by the end of that time period when
(03:56) he opened his restaurant guess what also happened the many people who had tasted his cookies he got their numbers he was giving free cookies away so that he could figure he also generated leads from his area and then he opened and had a a a smashing success of a business selling premium cookies in a local market which is a tough business to be in but he crushed it and he did it because he spent 365 days doing the work to figure out the hundred tiny details that make a perfect cookie and so like if you're in the sandwich business if you're in the SEO business if you're in
(04:26) the in the mechanic business it's figuring out what we need to do to make the cookie that much better and that's the work that no one's willing to do and that's the good news is that's the opportunity that's the opportunity that most people aren't willing to do they're always like if you ask small business owners what do I need they say I need more leads they all say that now if if everybody says they need the same thing to me that's a big light bulb that if they're all pursuing the same thing and none of them are growing then they're probably looking for the wrong stuff and
(04:51) if you've been stuck at the same level for a long period of time listen to what I'm saying right now you have to find out why people aren't buying again you have to find out why people aren't referring their friends and sometimes you're like well when I ask them they don't tell me it's like sometimes you have to read between the lines and that's the hard part but that's the work like that's the work and I get I get I get I get a little bit peeved about this because I see so many small business owners that
(05:20) aren't growing and they're not growing because they're always thinking about how they're going to get more leads but they're not realizing the fact that they have to get more leads because they have so many holes in their bucket and so there is a level advertising that you have to maintain in order to test my friend with the cookie store had to go out to people and he had to get them to try the cookies but the objective once he had his second batch of cookies wasn't like oh I need to give out you know 12 batches a day no that wasn't the goal at that point the goal was to refine the product refine the service
(05:48) make it better get the onboarding the recruiting the hiring the training of the employees so they could deliver the service good enough so that when he scaled the quality of the product remain the same or ideally had a process in place that that it would improve over time but people rush to scale because they have some sort of insecurity about I have to make progress but the thing is not all progress is measured in Revenue immediately some progress happens at a delay and so one of the biggest progress
(06:15) markers that happens at a delay is product and so when we talk about delayed gratification one of the ways that you can exercise that muscle of learning to delay reward for the work you do is improving the thing that you deliver because if you improve your sales you're going to immediately see a jump if you improve your Le you'll immediately see a jump and that's why it gets so addicting for small business owners because they say oh look I improved this little sales thing and look we're making more money and yes you are making more money but the thing is is that you're not going to make the big
(06:40) money the monster money comes from the back end the reason you can't afford your leads there's never not enough leads I like I want to impress this upon you there is an unlimited amount of traffic in the world across all media you've got radio you've got newspaper you got direct mail you've got you've got Instagram you've got Facebook you've got YouTube You've Got Tik Tok you've got you've got Spotify ads right you've got podcasts you've got Affiliates you've got there's SEO there's so many different places where eyeballs are the problem is not that you don't have
(07:09) enough leads the problem is you can't afford them because your product sucks like this is the problem and so you have to build it back to front you can consistently think about this from a competitive Mo perspective if you make the same amount of money per customer as your competition then you are always going to be in a race to the bottom and when I say race to the bottom I mean a race to the bottom of CAC you want to all you're going to be doing is trying to find little hacks to to hack social media to hack ads to do whatever and those hacks are always short-lived the biggest businesses and I
(07:43) look at this a lot because I spent a lot trying to trying to think okay how's Alex going to get to a billion how's Alex get to 10 billion is I look at the biggest companies and the thing is is that have you noticed that the biggest companies aren't doing the Instagram hacks have you noticed they're not trying to do these little like oh yeah if you put this hashtag at the bottom like oh if you do this little call out or the shout out like if you noticed that they don't do that and the reason they don't do that
(08:06) is because they don't have to because they have won the long game and the long game is the LTV game it's how much is a customer Worth to me and so Dan Kennedy said this a long time because he who can spend the most to a Car customer wins and I rephrase that as he who can make his customers the most valuable wins because being able to spend the most is a product of how much you make a customer worth to you which is a function of what the gross profit is and how many times they buy and the how many times they buy function has a direct
(08:37) proportion to how good the quality of the product is and by the way when you improve the quality of your product guess what happens you get referrals now think about this I want to again we have to play this out two three steps if you start marketing let me tell you some truths that will not change advertising will always become more expensive the cost per eyeball will always go up you look at cpms on Facebook you look at cpms on YouTube the costs per eyeball always always go up on every platform and as you scale your
(09:09) advertising will go to colder and colder audiences and it will become less and less efficient this happens at scale these are truths these will not change these are facts and so if you want to scale a business how can you scale if there have two things that are going in a linear Direction against you the cost of advertising to reach the eyeball goes up and the conversion percentage of those eyeballs also goes up because you go to a bigger and bigger audience that knows less and less they're less problem
(09:34) aware and you have less product aware and you have to do more education up front to a less interested audience this happens this is an inevitability and so how do you combat that one of the cool ways that you can increase LTV for almost any business is actually building a community around your business and so I just became coowner of school.
(09:58) com and you can go there and we have facilitated and made super super easy getting a community built and monetized and thriving and so whether you want to start a community business which is you know one type of person or you're already a business owner um it's a great way to increase the LTV of your customers provide more value to them and have one place that you can always disseminate all your information all your announcements to them to continue to extend the LTV and you can go to school.com games or just school.
(10:21) com and you can start for free you combat that by having referrals and referrals come from every sale and so if every sale one that person keeps buying and two they send you another customer guess what happens that cat gets cut in half and so you need an equally strong compounding vehicle that works in your favor to maintain your lcvd CAC ratio and so when you improve product you also decrease CAC via referrals at scale so it doesn't matter how much scale you have if you deliver an exceptional product you will
(10:50) be able to have you always know that 1.3 customers or every customer brings you you know whatever3 new customers on top of that so you decrease your cost require by 30% and you get the LTV boost that happens on the back end as well which is that they buy more and they they spend longer they're willing to pay a premium and so forth and the third third wheel of that in terms of product is that product is the end of the brand cycle so if you think about brand is a reinforcing Loop right in the beginning when you start a company you make a promise fundamentally
(11:20) that's how you enter Marketplace you say I'm going to solve this problem that is my promise to you all right and anyone can say that what builds the business over the long term is your ability to deliver on that promise otherwise it's the same reason you see all these [ __ ] internet marketers who change Who start a new a new business every 6 months and the new businesses they're like I got to find the next offer because they're so frontend obsessed because they never figure out what was wrong with your first offer people bought it the problem is you couldn't
(11:45) deliver on it and so just little Vegas Warning Sign by the way if you see the same guy changing up his offer every 6 months is because he doesn't know how to keep his promises he lacks the skill of product he lacks the skill of delivery he lacks the skill of being able to recruit hire and manage a team that can deliver consistently he lacks that skill and so honestly what happens to that person over time their reputation gets degraded you start saying this guy's a a h a has been he he's washed up all he does is promote new stuff he's a shill
(12:18) he just sells whatever is hot and many of you are that person and so you keep trying to find new ways to get leads when you can't keep your promises if you keep your promises and you put all your focus there your CAC will go down it will continue to go down and that's what's crazy is that the more you do that the more you reinforce the brand Loop because you make a promise you keep that promise and then the people you keep the promise to tell other people you kept the promise and then that decreases your ca the inverse
(12:51) of that and this is there's a there's a quantitative test for this if you run advertisements and your cost to acquire customer increases at a faster rate than the average cost of cpms the cost per impression in your market then it means you have Word of Mouth working against you think about this everyone understands positive word of mouth we all get that right we're like oh yeah I get referrals did you know that you have far more negative referrals you have way more detractors you have way more people
(13:24) that when they see an ad of your business what do they do they reach out to other people to ask about you and then then people who would have purchased choose not to based on information they get online or asking someone they know and so your conversion rate decreases over time you complain that ads aren't working when in reality all of this is the Invisible Hand of your product sucking I get passionate about this because I just I see it so many times and it's the thing that that keeps you stuck and so the only way to combat
(13:55) this is to become a worldclass marketer and just only know how to sell [ __ ] and hey if you're selling to a really big Market I'm going to be honest with you there's a lot of really big name marketers that the only reason they make money is because they sell to the ocean of humanity and they only need one transaction and they spend all of their trying time trying to Arbitrage media as in they know what their cost per impression is they know how much they make and they just Jam as much as they can in there but that's not a business that is a cash flow job that you get
(14:25) really good at with that skill but that's also why marketers have terrible reputations building a brand is in my opinion the good side of marketing and the brand is simply the associations that people have with your product and if those associations are positive then you build that reputation you build that positive Association and that takes time but if you make the brand your end goal then you will be able to charge higher prices than other people for the exact same thing and people will purchase from you because from a value equation perspective their perceived
(15:01) likelihood of achievement goes up their risk associated with the purchase in terms of what they believe their ease and the ease of achieving what they're going to get goes up and even if your time delay is slower they have so much conviction that you're going to deliver on your promise that they're willing to pay the premium and so your cost to acquire customers goes down at scale brand driven advertising is more profitable than the pure scammy direct response stuff it just takes longer but the Raz is insane it's not like 2x 3x it's like 30 100x it's way
(15:38) bigger and that's how companies like apple print money they print money look at their marketing spin they print money because they have a line of customers that bought their last product and just by knowing that they have a good reputation of delivering on their promises they buy the next one and so I'll tell you a story that happened for the one of the probably the first time I really saw this was when I was uh when I I was probably a year into gym launch we're ripping and roaring right in terms of scale and you know everyone's just printing money using the system that we had right and I launched something
(16:11) called uh I think I called it LNS at the time which was like lead nurture system something like that I can't remember what I what I called it but basically it was we no aln it was automated lead nurture that's what it was aln and so I did this big webinar I did this big launch and because gym owners are business owners there was a number of them that couldn't make it on the live but they heard that I had sold told this thing the amount of people that reached out after the webinar not having seen the webinar and said hey here's my credit card number whatever it is just
(16:39) give it to me I I if if he launched it I know it's good I had never had that happen in my life and I was like how do I never stop this from happening again I want this to always be my norm and it reinforced so strongly how important it was to keep your promises and so there's there's a relationship that I think is missed a lot especially in the the info and online space and I want to hit on this but it applies to all businesses is that there's three lines that you have to keep in touch with you have the price
(17:09) that you charge you have the value that they get and then you have the cost associated with delivering the thing and so you want these lines to be as far apart as humanly possible all of them you want them to be spread out super super far you want to have crazy high value at the top you want a price that's a premium and then you want to have a lot of juice left over relative to your cost and the way to get that kind of space between your cost and your price is to do the work of the hundred details that your competitors aren't willing to
(17:42) do they're not willing to find out that when someone walks in the restaurant if we just we find out what their name is at the car we can greet them by name small thing right and we have the waitresses all write down on the on the on the on the receipt what their name is and say thanks for coming in ow whatever right and we try to make sure that they all get their Waters within 30 seconds of sitting down we make sure that they get their bread within 2 minutes we make sure that but we check in every five or every 10 or whatever we've tested has been the right amount
(18:14) and maybe it maybe it comes down to asking the customer up front hey is this something do you want like do you want me to come like is this a fast dinner or is this something you want to kind of like juice and enjoy I will I will match your Cadence maybe simply asking the question draws attention to the fact that you care it might not even matter what you do but maybe simply asking the question improves their experience and so it's these 100 BBS no silver bullets that the good news is that your competition is lazy as [ __ ] it's so easy
(18:39) think about how many business like I do business with a lot of businesses on a personal level on a business level I would not recommend most of them and the thing is is that those vendors think that I'm an amazing customer I'm I'm a hair away from being a detractor and many of you have customers that are a hair away from being attracted sometimes you got customers who pay for your thing and still tell people not to buy it my pool guy when I had a pool I don't have a pool anymore but when I had a pool that guy was so inconsistent he didn't clean stuff all the time i' I'd
(19:09) walk out afterward be like what what did he even did he even do anything this week right but I still paid because it was just such a hassle to change but I was Absolut attracted when my neighbor like oh yeah who's your pool service I'm like don't use my guy I just don't have time to find somebody else they're like oh thanks and and that small business owner is like man I have such a great business like and like we'd have gym owners who thought that their their gyms were hot [ __ ] and then somebody opens up across the street and literally takes all their customers what they didn't realize is the main reason people went to their gym
(19:40) is it was just convenient they thought all of their workouts they thought all of their music they thought they thought the the the the layout of the gym the equipment there they thought all that was important but the thing that mattered most was that you just happened to be the only gym in a 5 mile radius of this spot and so a lot of times the thing that the reason that you're winning you don't even know why you're winning and so professional uh Professor berglan from Stanford said this he said it's better to know why you have failed
(20:10) than to succeed and not know why and I always I think that's a very profound statement because for us as business owners we we're always willing to attribute negative things to outside forces right we're always willing to say oh you know Co happened my business got hurt or whatever right the economy is bad credit rates are compressing but we aren't willing to give outside forces the credit for when we do well we're like oh no that was me that was that marketing initiative oh yeah that's cuz we've been really working on the team it might just be nothing to do with you at all and so understanding what are
(20:40) the drivers that actually drove the success are some of the things that you have to find out that your competition doesn't know so many business owners just believe in mythology they just they just make up narratives around why they're successful and they have no way to prove it one of the things that I see people just melt in front of me when I ask they're like well this is uh you know they basically tell me a story about their business they say well people don't do that because and then they insert some make belief thing and I
(21:06) say how do you know that and then they just look at me like how do you know that they don't they've never measured it I had a vendor recently uh who was like hey we need to do this this and this uh with uh with something on media and I was like okay why he was like well this is going to create more growth and I said how do you know that and then he gave me another stat and that stat was derived from the first stat that he said to increase he said when this increases this increases I was like no [ __ ] do you know how math
(21:37) works of course of course it does now to be clear I don't think this was out of malice to be very clear but no one thinks and the good news is your competition doesn't think either and so if you want to win you just need to stop like whenever someone gives you a because statement in your team just ignore it and if they do give it to you and you in and you insist on trying to listen to it then say how do you know that and most of the time they're like well you know gut feel like your gut feelings me nothing to me if you haven't
(22:08) tracked it and you have no data to support it then you I can make up things too when you hear podcasts of of of business people and they're telling you the things that work for them the crazy thing is that most of the time they don't know either and so this is what drives me nuts people are like hey Alex do you think that you know having a hard childhood even having a troubled relationship with your father I don't we're fine right but do you think that is the reason that you're so driven I'm like I don't
(22:38) know how would I know I know that I am driven there's OB zillion things that have happened to me in my life I don't know which one it is but we create these narratives around it to believe it and I and I'm and I'm I'm bringing this kind of conceptual idea because right now many of you are creating stories that you tell yourselves to make yourself feel better about why your product isn't as good as it should be but you have an excuse that only you need to believe and you believe that excuse so it excuses you from working harder on the stuff you
(23:07) know you should be doing but aren't and that that work the work you know you should be doing but aren't is the opportunity because that is the work that your competitors also aren't doing and I'm telling you from the bottom of my soul it is so easy to beat people today they are so soft they have no work ethic no one can stick with anything everyone's distracted they're on social media they're their [ __ ] notifications because they can't stick with [ __ ] they can't say no and so sometimes you got to say hey guys we're going to stay at this Revenue level
(23:38) until we get referrals over 30% we're going to stay at this Revenue level we're going to stay at this level of advertising because I don't want anyone else to know how mediocre our sandwiches are why would I tell anyone else I don't want anyone to know if I could test this with no one knowing I would do it but we have to advertise a little bit so we can fix our thing but the point of that first phase of growing the business because you start making sales is to get better not to get rich the point in the first phase is to
(24:07) learn not to earn if I started a new cleaning business tomorrow the first year would just be trying to nail the model I wouldn't be I wouldn't be thinking about what we're growing every I wouldn't care I would only be focused on how can we make this experience so that no one leaves and that's all my obsession is because I know that once that happens whether you sell One customer a month or five customers a month or 10 customers a month your business will not stop growing if you do not lose customers
(24:34) your business will not stop growing and so while every one of your competitors are looking for cheaper leads and trying to find the new place where they get do their little hacky Instagram thing you can sleep well at night knowing I sold 10 customers last month and this month I'll sell another 10 but I'll have 20 and the month after that I'll sell 10 and I'll have 30 and the month after that I'll send 10 and I'll have 40 and we will just keep [ __ ] growing because I spent a year or two years or 5 years figuring out exactly what to do
(25:04) that delivered for my customer and that is the work that no one will do and that is why entrepreneurship is much more a a battle of wills than it is a battle of intellect you have to be willing to delay gratification for an extended period of time and eat glass and that eating of glass is seeing how many failures you have until you get it right and this is the difference between small businesses and big businesses is their willingness to put put up with that long period of time of getting the product right and then once you get it right you can scale to the Moon because you will
(25:36) make more than everyone else on your back end you will deliver on your promises your brand will be reinforced with every sale rather than degraded with every sale and then at scale you will continue to be able to acquire customers profitly because you have a force that is compounding which is the referral base of customers that tells other people how good your stuff is while also continuing to purchase themselves so in Silicon Valley they have a saying which is you know break break things move fast I think that was
(26:00) one of Facebook's early you know values um that break fast and move stuff is building back to front that is building the product through iteration so that you can have extended LTV so that you can have the activation of users so that because fundamentally think about this way if Facebook did not get users activated and they were like we need to spend more on marketing so we can get more users it would never work at scale it has to have a compounding vehicle built within the business and the compounding vehicle in the business for most businesses is the quality of their product that is the compounding vehicle you have to get people to continue to
(26:30) buy or continue to use in Facebook's use in in Facebook's case and so they have to think about how can we eliminate friction in a hundred different ways so that we can make it smoother I mean this is what we work on at school all the time is how can you make this easier how can we make this faster how can you make this more streamlined so that anybody can be successful with it in most small business owners fix one or two things and then they immediately want to scale they want to gas the advertising to make
(26:49) more sales and the problem with that is that it does this so you increase sales and so by percentage growth it'll be really aggressive and it starts slowing down and you can always tell growth of businesses like this especially at the 1030 $100 million Mark and they're not even close to their total addressable Market because the only way they grew is through jamming sales and marketing not through having a product that compounded and so that is the big difference between massive multiples in companies
(27:11) when you to sell for 20x 50x you know massive numbers because the person who's acquiring it has no doubt that that business will continue to compound and grow if the business is purely based on Marketing sales then they know that it's only as good as it's last month and if the marketing director leaves or or their their sales channel gets shut down then the business is going to rapidly Decline and so not not only does it make the company significant more valuable it also makes life a lot more chill as an entrepreneur because you know that this
(27:34) month like last month like two years ago the customer you bought you sold two years ago put that all that effort in they're still buying today improving your product is the highest leverage thing you can do because every single person gets that product and so you work on it one time and then it's you know cut cut once sell 100 times cut once sell a thousand times whereas marketing is a is a linear relationship you have to go market more to get more customers but if you continue to improve the product that thing can get you 100 times more customers or massively increase LTV
(28:04) and so you get a disproportionate return on the effort you put in on making your thing better than you do on getting more customers chunking up what we're tracking with product is the price that we're able to command for our services or our product the number of recurring purchases that we have from somebody so if you have a reoccurring business it's average number of orders that someone's going to make with your business over a lifetime or it's the churn associated with your subscription or membership and so these give you the quantitative
(28:30) outputs of a highquality product but the inputs are going to be closer to what are their activation metrics like what is and the way that you look at this is you you do something called a regression analysis around okay let's look at the cohort of customers that don't cancel because there is hopefully some customers that don't leave you and you look at what things occurred in and you have to look at a lot of variables of what things occurred uh in those customers that haven't occurred in other customers and then once you find those things that occurred those become activation points or at least your first
(28:59) guess at activation points and then what you do is you drive your onboarding towards that activation Point some people got a retention point and then you remeasure again and so if you know that once people you know achieve a sale from SEO for your agency that the likely the cancel goes down precipitously then all of your effort for onboarding is how quickly can we get them a sale from our SEO if it's for weight loss you find out that somebody needs to lose seven pounds in the first two weeks and if they lose the weight then the lik that they
(29:23) continue to stay is very high so then you drive all of your activation your arm boarding towards getting to that point and so everything is about looking at the people at the end looking at the thing that preceded them getting to that point and then putting all of your focus on getting people to have that experience at the most basic level I had a first book and many people who bought this book and liked it bought the second book when it came out obviously we had a launch but the thing is is that we still sell thousands and thousands and thousands and thousands of copies of
(29:52) this book every single month and even though this book is 2 and a half or three years old or whatever it is this still sells thousands and thousands and thousands of copies every month because there's also new people every month that are getting into entrepreneurship or want to learn about uh making better offers for their business and so the people who upsold between product one and product two many of them saw nothing besides the fact that they found out that I had another book out and then bought it and I don't say that in a
(30:17) self-aggrandizing way I say that because like I've lived the other way and it's much better to do it this way and if you're trying to increase LTV to have a compounding business model then one of the first things you need to do is do the unscalable I made an entire video about it go check it out it'll probably help you out

(00:00) when I was a wee lad a young man I lived on fifteen hundred dollars a month and believe it or not during that period of time while splitting a room sleeping on the floor with another dude I was taking home about fifteen twenty thousand dollars a month and the reason that I lived like that is because a I'm incredibly risk-averse but B because I wanted to have money to go on the offensive later if you don't know I am my name is Oxford own acquisition.
(00:21) com it's a portfolio of companies it's over 200 million dollars a year make these videos because I want you to make shitloads of money and make a big company so that someday we can partner together and take it to 100 million dollars and beyond for me making 20 grand a month was never an amount of money that I wanted to brag about or feel like I had made it I wanted to shoot really really big this was only stuff that was going to be stepping stones for me to achieve what I wanted to later what I want to do in this video
(00:41) is I'm going to break down how I was able to live for so cheap this is for all the single guys all the single ladies and if you can live with your parents even better for me somebody would have died it was for the best that I didn't have to live at home this is what I actually did in order to live at fifteen hundred dollars a month or less and I did that eating out every day there's three big cost centers you got Transportation you got living and you got food so food wise some of you guys have seen Mosey meals meal hacks the
(01:04) things that I do at these chain restaurants and I did it that way because I don't like cooking and I wanted to have more time to make money but made more financial sense for me to not take eight hours on the Sunday to go grocery shopping and prep all my food versus me getting Chipotle twice a day which is what I did at the time then 15 a day a day 20 bucks a day 30 days in a row 600 a month you can also go to Panda Express which has a phenomenal 110 gram of protein hacked with extra chicken so you could have 200 grams of protein
(01:33) every day recommend it third best option is Chick-fil-A is one of my favorites they are on the pricier side just go with a 220 packs of chicken nuggets and get in close to 12 bucks just a shitload of meat or two sandwiches either way you'll end up in that 10 to 12 range and you'll be at that 600 700 a month range and if you're like huh did he really do that I sure did that's all I did I picked between Chick-fil-A Panda Express and chipotle and that's what I lived on so much to this point that lay didn't know that we were going on dates but for
(02:03) me these were the fine establishments that I was frequenting on a regular basis they knew me by name and they knew that I knew how to work the many so first step was Mosey meals and that for me time to money wise was worth it when I would go to the grocery store and I would get all the fixings and all that stuff I spent 150 in a week and I ended up spending almost 600 a month as a single guy when I went grocery shopping and did all the prep and all the clean versus me running out next door grabbing the food eating it and heading back and
(02:26) it was a nice mental break for me I ate cheap and as crazy as this may seem it is easier to figure out how to get all of your calories in eating out stuff ahead of time the absolute cheapest route which I'll tell you right now loaves of bread peanut butter cheapest thing in the world and if you really want to make sure that you're covering your basis get a multi item you can live on it if you want to add a third Staple in there you can add Lactaid milk if you're Dairy sensitive you'll get your protein you'll get your
(02:50) carbs you get your fat in if you want to be extreme on it you can be extreme for me I didn't want to live on peanut butter sandwiches I did eat them when I was trying to bulk up but I did those in addition to my normal calorie intake and to that degree you might want to do one of those Mosey meals and then do peanut butter and milk is the other one which is a nice cheap in between the reason this is so important for everybody who's watching this you got to know how to live cheap so you can save up to build the business you want so you can invest
(03:13) in the skills and the experiences that are going to make you money number two is transportation this is where MOSI mobiles came in there's lots of M's when it comes to mobiles meals and mansions from the mobile standpoint the most efficient way to own a vehicle is to purchase it in cash a used vehicle that is ideally between 5 and 10 years old any place in America right now today you can find a used four-door vehicle that is between 5 and 10 years old for 10 000 dollars you don't have car payments the only thing you really have to manage is
(03:43) car insurance which is not too expensive and here's the cool part the cheaper your car less the insurance you are young and you are living on 600 a month for Mosey meals and you live on a hundred dollars a month after you've made your one-time Capital expense of actually getting the car which I recommend doing and not taking a loan for it all you have is your Mansion your Chateau where are you going to rest your head at night I lived in Southern California one of if not the most expensive markets in the United States I
(04:08) was in Costa Mesa was where I lived and after I slept on the floor of my gym which is the first place which technically was Zero but at the same time it was five thousand dollars a month because it was my actual rent for my business I then really splurged I ended up having a member at my gym say are you really sleeping here said I sure am another member was having me sleep at their place for free I was able to move from the free place to my own place which is really in quotes here we split a single bedroom in a seven bedroom
(04:35) house he and I were roommates not housemates roommates and I I had one mattress that I got off Craigslist and put on the floor fan next to my face because it's really loud by the way so you can not have to hear what someone else is doing because every other bedroom had a couple there were three dogs in the house my roommate had a dog another couple had a dog and another couple had a dog and one of the couples had two dogs and they were both big so there was marking of territory there was [ __ ] and piss in the house every day
(05:03) it's [ __ ] horrible my half was 400 bucks a month if you're in like North Carolina or you're in Boise Idaho you can probably get a room for 400 a month without having to split it big picture here I would recommend you go to the place where shit's happening 400 a month that you'd spend to be in an area where things are going on and people are doing things with their lives to get out of your area of the world where nothing's happening and your friends are still in the same place and your parents don't encourage you and think this internet
(05:29) [ __ ] is weird to tell you to stop watching videos on YouTube and trying to better yourself and just tell you to get a job whatever it is if you want to get out of that environment it is worth the 200 to 400 a month the easiest thing to do is to to connect with people online join communities join Discord groups join Facebook groups whatever it is try and figure out where there are pockets of them because people congregate you can find pockets of people that have similar goals to you and get around them every move for the first few years of my
(05:56) career was only to be around people as long as you're a person who's going to hustle and people see it people will open doors for you move from SoCal to Puerto Rico briefly from there we move to Irvine and then Albuquerque New Mexico because I had people there that I wanted to learn from and I didn't know anyone else besides this one couple if you just say hey do you know anybody else who lives in this area and this is where like now the world's even more connected than it was a decade ago see a lot in SoCal you see a lot in Miami
(06:22) you'll see a lot of New York a lot of Chicago and a big thing here if you see Cleveland rich is not the same as SoCal rich not the same as New York happens is your standard of Excellence raises in some ways you feel worse about yourself but to the same degree it shows you what's possible my recommendation is to use that as inspiration it is possible they're made of the same flesh and bone as I am therefore I can too and when you get around people like that they start talking at different time increments and
(06:50) different money increments if you're hanging out with or talking in terms of weeks talk in terms of paychecks talking in terms of of 100 000 Investments you got to be talking to people who are talking about hundred thousand dollar Investments we're talking about years talk about decades you can judge how wealthy people will be by how they talk about how they allocate resources time and money and the increments that they measure those I've moved a lot faster in life through handshakes instead of hacks so who who introduced
(07:16) me and opened way more doors than any what ever did getting around the who a lot of times it's hard to measure but when I look at all the big deals that I've done in my life it's all been one or two degrees connected from people that I met one recommendation that I have for you don't turn down the first invite you connect with somebody at a thing it's like hey let's grab dinner if you make that first one happen the likely that you end up staying friends and connecting is significantly higher if you turn down the first invite it
(07:39) shows that you're not as interested they also turned out your counter invite and it becomes this whole thing and I'm just saying like one big move is just make it work on the first invite when you go to that meeting do some prep work do 30 minutes of research on the person you're going to meet with and try to bring something valuable to the table now it might be your skill and you just apply it to them and this is the thing this is a [ __ ] hack a life no one wants a free pass out of here like hey you got a
(08:04) buddy who builds patios you don't have a patio you have a couple people bid for it your body's like hey I'll build it for you right he says he'll do it for free and you say sure cool I'll save some money the other guy said they can do it in four weeks he starts taking four weeks and it's you know a third of the way down he said oh sorry I'm working some other jobs I'll be around to work on it later this weekend and now it's eight weeks and it's still you know halfway done and at 12 weeks now you start to [ __ ] hate the guy the thing
(08:26) is is that if you want to do somebody a favor if you really want them to take it as a favor blow them away make them feel awkward for the amount of work that you did and if you've never had this experience I can promise you I've been on the receiving end and it is uncomfortable [ __ ] I owe this guy something and the nice thing about this you just provide value you go in and you know just probably a little bit of value you actually do what a full-scope project would be for whatever it is that you're good at and you just set it up
(08:52) for the dude or you've spent a whole day walking them through how you do this stuff and you're like well how do you find the time for that you work all the time that's how you do it this is work it's investing in the long-term relationships they're going to pay dividends later does that mean that I'm going to give to somebody and I might not get anything back yes didn't you say you want to be an entrepreneur and make the world a better place that's what it looks like at a micro level the ultimate leverage that you can have in a
(09:12) relationship is not needing anything back if you do that you can be the guy that stacks ious and then when you do need to make your move because you are going to do the next thing then you've got all these blank checks ready to cash in and then that is how you can Propel yourself way faster and you just load the deck early when you don't need anything the time to dig the well is not when you're thirsty but when you have enough water so that when you are thirsty it's there now we can go on the offensive my plan B was always strip at
(09:41) night drive Uber during the day and I'm dead serious if you're making less than 60 70 000 a year I don't understand why you wouldn't take that car that you saved up for that's got four doors it's 15 years or younger and has no visible damage on it if you got those three check marks you can drive Uber it is the most flexible job you can make money immediately there's no risk besides the actual vehicle itself you can work whatever hours you want want you can do it on separate apps and when I say whatever hours I said there's
(10:06) flexibility but also how many hours you want you work 12 hours a day if you feel like living on 1500 bucks a month or less spend 20 make another 200 have saved up after taxes so I could go on the offensive again if you know it doesn't cost you much to live your risk tolerance goes up because you don't have other [ __ ] to worry about real cost of the [ __ ] that you can't afford or shouldn't be affording right now you're paying for the car but you're sacrificing your dreams you're paying for going out with the boys at the club
(10:35) buying a table getting bottle service buying girls drinks all of a sudden boom 100 bucks boom 200 bucks in a night like what just happened that was half my rent you become less dangerous because it's very hard to fight someone who has nothing to lose and it's very hard to find someone who can live on nothing if we had to pick between living on ten thousand dollars a month and making ten thousand dollars a month or living on fifteen hundred dollars a month and then spending the spread if you spend five thousand dollars a month three thousand
(11:02) dollars a month two thousand dollars a month on your education so that you can increase your earning capacity it's hard to be stopped side note if you can get competitive with yourself at how little you can spend recommend one of the other hacks that Dave Ramsey has that I'm a huge fan of is taking out the amount of money that you're gonna spend for the entire month putting in your wallet and leaving it there don't spend more than that period that's it that's all you got you're one of these people who wants to
(11:25) credit card hack you get two percent here and I get one percent here and I get three percent here you're focusing on the wrong [ __ ] percentage side if you're trying to be financially disciplined just [ __ ] be disciplined so I get asked a lot about the income to spending ratio I never had one that's because I just try to maximize both sides how can I hack the game to spend as little as humanly possible period and then how can I heck the other side of the game make as much money as I possibly can I just saved every dollar
(11:50) that was it food Transportation living the other way of doing this is getting competitive with your bank account one of the habits that I highly encourage you do is that every morning what's the first thing you check is it Instagram is it YouTube is it your text I will tell you the first thing that I checked the mornings when I was in this period of my life it was my bank account every day I would wake up and I'll check my bank account and what happens when you do that is you develop this muscle of kind of this understanding of the money
(12:14) flow it might be uneventful to check your bank account every day but if I can give you a habit that will make you a lot of money it's just like weight loss if you get on a scale every day and you're trying to lose weight and you don't do jack [ __ ] but you literally just get on the scale every day people lose weight drawing and putting awareness to the problem or the thing that you're trying to change improves it if you're in a business and you want sales to go up start tracking everything if you just start reporting publicly on
(12:39) close rates and put a leaderboard up sales go up think about this from a human behavior standpoint punish bad behavior with yourself as quickly as possible and you want to reward good behavior as fast as possible so you do more of it that's why you check the bank account every day start seeing it go up and you get this little ticker it goes up and if you really want to be a g about it this is how I did it check your bank account and you have a Google sheet on your phone and every day I put my balance in and if you can start getting
(13:02) addicted to getting personal records in your bank account like if I can give you the one gift of this is to gamify it the people who make the most money they think about money as a game and the best way to do that is early on track two things you check your bank account and you put it in and what's nice there is that you can start seeing long-term trends when I would look at that Trend I got a tremendous amount of Good Feeling I would look at it and be like I [ __ ] did that and every month it get a little bit bigger a little bit bigger a little
(13:28) bit bigger and you start feeling progress for the sacrifices that you make every day because you look at where you're at this month versus last month and you see progress so if you want to improve your money situation you got to check it you got to look at it every day and the first thing in the day priority it means it is happening prior it's more important so you wake up you make money a priority you check your bank out every day you start get a pulse on what's going in and what's going on what's going in what's going on you look at all
(13:54) of the pluses that go in you look at all the minuses and next month you try to make that column go up and that column go down you keep running that cycle and I promise you if you actually look at your bank account every single day even for 90 days 90 days you will be amazed at what goes in there they're like huh didn't even know I still had that app most people get anxiety they avoid the things that they don't like gotta confront it I'm [ __ ] poor don't want to be poor I'm going to look at this money until eventually it starts paying
(14:18) attention back to me because money sticks to the person who pays it the most attention this is how the economy works the person in two parties who pays the most attention is where the money ends up

(00:00) Conor McGregor came with proper 12. boom it was a 600 million dollar deal The Rock had taramana tequila which is now worth like 4 billion Kylie made the front of Forbes as a billionaire and she was 20. Mr Beast he will be a sense of billionaire right now the entire economy has shifted the last century was a century about the power and when I say power I mean like energy the wealthiest individuals of the last century were built on oil the biggest companies were all energy companies fast forward today four out of the top five biggest
(00:28) companies in the world are not built on the old oil but the new oil and the oil of today is attention rise in teens on tick tocks the thing that is being pumped and drilled every day is the attention of the masses you have 24 hours a day that your ears are open you have 24 hours a day that your eyes are open and so the idea is how can we capture as many of those hours from as many people as possible and the war for our minds for me the stuff is all about like helping people connect the total of attention that exists is every human's
(01:02) eyes and ears collectively 24 hours a day that is the pie and they're fighting for it people who are creating the platforms that other companies can come and drill they're basically the digital landscape they envelope the world they're literally buying up the real estate of the collective attention that exists the oil tycoons had to go and buy a state negotiate haggle with the farmer to get us things the new world today they don't need to haggle with anyone they just take it scarce resources are the things that are the most valuable
(01:30) and so oil was the scarce resource and now attention is the scarce resource and so that's why attention is the new oil a friend of mine Ryan Fisher just showed me a clip on his phone of a podcast that I did with him this is when I wasn't really actually I didn't do any podcast I was that wasn't doing any speaking stuff like all I was doing was building gym launcher Prestige Labs I was like screw content just run ads I don't want to be known I want to be rich and unknown it's funny because he was like and now you're not doing that I was very
(02:01) against it and then what happened Kylie made the front of Forbes as a billionaire and she was 20. and at the time I was 27 and I think I had taken home 17 million in income the year before I was on Pace to do like 13 to 15 that next year in terms of take home and I thought like I was hot [ __ ] and then this girl is seven years younger than me [ __ ] crushes me in net worth and I was like Wow and so it was just this huge belief shift for me where I was like what am I doing wrong my ego felt hurt so I started protecting myself and
(02:32) I was like oh no Kris Jenner's her mom she's an absolute gangster she was born into this royalty it's not that she did it it was someone else and blah blah ego protected I feel okay now and then Huda Beauty sold a percentage of her thing for 600 million at the time it's worth over a billion today Conor McGregor came out with proper 12 and 12 months later boom it was a 600 million dollar deal robot 12 and then the rock had taramana tequila which is now worth like four billion just kept seeing this again and again and again to the point where I was
(02:59) like I I believe something that's not true and so I talk about how skills beliefs character traits are the three things that hold back entrepreneurs and this one for me was something that I believed about the world and I was functioning as though and it was not I was trying to find those things because they construct our reality and we make our decisions based on the things that we believe to be true and so I basically was walking through a reality that was not real I then read a book mine of all rubikov which is his Almanac which is
(03:24) really good really quick read and you talked about the four types of Leverage in the book Leverage is the difference between what you put in and what you get out the people who make the most money are the ones who have the most leverage because everybody's the same amount of time it's just who gets the most back for their time and compounding is that now that you've made that trade with your Leverage is it going to compound unto itself and get you even more back because compounding is a form of Leverage and you've got labor you get
(03:43) other people to do stuff for you which means you get more of your time back and you get output above that you've got Capital so people give you money you invest the money that other people give you and you get leveraged by extension the last two levels are code so you got software and media so if you think about this you make a piece of code and then 10 million people can use it that's leverage you put one-time investment you get infinite on the other side with media it's the same way if I take however much time it takes me to make
(04:06) this video one person a million people a hundred million people can see this video which is what gives it leverage when I saw that that was what made everything click for me as to why these people were getting these crazy crazy numbers when they had like I had heard Kylie had a team of seven and she was doing 200 million a year I was like team of seven and was because she had a compounding leverage vehicle built within her business and that was when I looked at my own businesses at the time and realized I had nothing that
(04:33) compounded nothing I almost became dissatisfied with the business that I had because I realized that whatever I wanted to do next I wanted to have a compounding vehicle something that multiplies unto itself over and over again so Warren Buffett could build Berkshire Hathaway because the money itself compounds and compounds and compounds and on a long enough time Horizon when you keep rolling the snowball after you do that for 40 50 years you have a big [ __ ] snowball you have to unlock one of those four types of Leverage and so when I looked
(05:00) at that pyramid I was like well I understand the leverage of Labor so I've got that I'm now in a position where I have Capital that I can deploy now I don't have other people's Capital because that's not what I want to do with my life right now but when I looked at software and media I was like given my skills Etc I could be better at the media side than I could at the code side but I still wasn't there yet I looked at these people that are Ultra famous and I was like huh well I'd still rather be anonymous because they've got all these
(05:22) stalkers and Weirdos hey good morning when you get exposed to 10 million people if you figure one percent of people are crazy you got a hundred thousand weirdos anyways I go to have dinner with a friend of mine uh Dean graciosi who's he gets like weirdos that come to his house and all that kind of stuff and I was like how do you deal with this I was like why do you think this like how is this worth it you just had me down he was like dude if if a couple weird letters you know every day or every week is the price I have to pay for the impact I
(05:49) want to have he's like I pay that price any day of the week and twice on Sunday and there was just like this pause when he said it between when he said it and he looked at me and I just felt like it hit me because I was like God I'm being such a pansy I want to make real business education available to everyone if I say that that's what I actually want to do then I need to match my actions to that otherwise they're just empty words I hate doing something that I don't get credit for later and so the idea of making a short that is going to
(06:15) float today and then disappear into the ether tomorrow right or make a post on Instagram that's going to be gone in a week like no one's ever going to see it again to me taking the scarce resources of my time and then having it vanish I couldn't make that work for me it was a huge belief that I realized the content is not the output is the input the output is the audience and the audience is what compounds the audience is what sticks you're Gathering the scarce resource and the audience is the thing that pumps attention over and over
(06:47) again you've got Mr Beast I think he opened up a restaurant in a local area and had 10 000 people show up at a local restaurant I don't think people realize that he's 24 and media compounds I will make a prediction that he will be a sense of billionaire not just a billionaire but a sense a billionaire and so becoming a master of media is a huge way of creating leverage because if Kylie can just point or Mr Beast can just point and then you have a hundred million people who buy anything you have a billion dollar plus company
(07:16) but once that shifted in me I'd stop seeing it as a waste because I thought if I got one more person who's gonna see this short or see this long or see this post or see this tweet or see this whatever that was the point the reason Huda The Rock Conor McGregor or Kylie were able to translate their attention into money one they spent a long time building it right and amassing that attention because they knew that the moment they did decide to monetize it it was right there think about how long The Rock has been building the brand of the
(07:45) rock before he signed his deal with Under Armor before he made termana before he made zoa 20 years he'd been building this brand people piss and moan about the fact that you know they posted content for four weeks and they're not famous yet one is they waited a really really long time and they didn't ask they just they gave they give to their particular audience the longer you can wait the bigger the ass can be at the end the longer the runway the bigger the plane that can take off from it the next thing is that the thing they chose to
(08:10) monetize from was on brand this is something that Their audience already dug the Rye signing the deal with Under Armor makes complete sense because Fitness is a core part of his brand it's about drive it's about power we stay hungry we devour like all of that is something that Under Armor wanted to tap into to associate their brand with the biggest brands that exist come from the endorsements of celebrities we can't be Kim Kardashian a girl can't be Kim so Kim is the ultimate status then Dolce Gabbana signs Kim and says wear our [ __ ]
(08:40) people then see the status that Kim has and Associate it with Dolce Gabbana and then little lady who's got money and doesn't have status trades her money for the bag that she can associate with Kim to get the status that's the game let's look at LeBron and Nike they wanted to sign him because they figure he is going to be iconic he is Iconic right and they wanted to associate Nike Victory with somebody who's Victorious because a brand can't be victorious in and of itself it's not a person and so they got to find the people who embody the spirit
(09:09) and the values of their brand they make the endorsement people make the association in their mind and then they buy the brand to get the the association of the thing they could never do but always aspire to the people who are the most famous you look at Rogan right he's got UFC he's also a really amazing comedian and loves the comedy community Fitness and biohacking and supplements and all and like brain stuff he loves all that stuff aliens and UFOs and these are all totally different but the more Dimensions that someone can go deep on
(09:35) the more they'll get an audience from Comedy and then they'll cross-pollinate them with fighting it's this total pollination which ultimately compounds the audience even faster and so these Mega stars go deep on many things and capture bigger and bigger audiences that Compound on themselves and they wait because they stay loyal to their brand and then they appeal to a segment of Their audience or they try to cut across the one that appeals to the most of them it took me way too long to realize that the game had changed fundamentally if
(10:02) the Rockefellers were built on oil the new generation of people are going to be built on attention media will only become more expensive over time advertising becomes more expensive content creation becomes more expensive it becomes increasingly fragmented so it costs more to do it across different platform the audience becomes more valuable the cost of getting the audience becomes more valuable which means the best time to start is now the people who will become the new sense of billionaires Etc is going to be people
(10:23) who can do three things they will be able to capture they have to be able to hold they have to be able to multiply attention

(00:00) how to sell the same thing for more money by making offers so good people feel stupid saying no the agenda number one why nailing your offer will make you more money than anything else number two why selling to the right people makes you more money more than almost anything else too number three why you should charge lots of money for the stuff you sell number four how to reverse engineer value and number five I have a pretty sweet demonstration I'll do for you guys how to use scarcity urges and guarantees
(00:31) to make people want it even more and charge more more and more double more more money good all right so let's start here by nailing your offer we'll make you more money than anything else so this is my uh this is my big aha moment so this is me when I was 23.
(00:51) uh just signed my lease super excited arms look better there than they do now but it's all good uh and uh had no idea what I was doing I'd never sold anything I'd never marketed never gotten leads I had no no clue what I was doing and so I spent three thousand dollars of money that I didn't have only at ten thousand dollars at the time so I spent a third of my net worth on a workshop that's supposed to be a two-day workshop that was going to teach me how to get leads and it was this brand new thing that was on the internet it was called Facebook ads it's 2013. I was super early this is where luck plays plays a role so into this workshop and I was there I didn't have a
(01:24) real business yet because I wasn't open and the guy pulls me aside and he could see that I had no [ __ ] clue what I was doing I was like trying to take notes but didn't even have context to take notes with and uh he's like hey you wanna know the secret to sales that's my faint Australian accent um he said uh he said make people an offer so good they feel stupid saying no and that was actually the first thing that anyone ever told me about selling and so it changed my life and so I tried to tell as many people as I can because if you get that part right
(02:01) everything else is easy and I was very fortunate in that I had somebody very early on who told me that and so I tried to tell to as many people as I can as loud as I can it don't [ __ ] book about it and so I realized in that moment that I didn't be good at sales good at marketing I'm really good at anything because I wasn't at the time I just had to make my offer good enough and that was when the greatest game of my life began and so for those who don't know it offers what you literally give someone
(02:26) in exchange for money all right there's the product that's the stuff the market is the peoples and the offers the thing that Bridges those two all right and so it packages and communicates what you do in exchange for the dollars a shitty offer weekly connects to the market very little flow very shitty or for some of you if you haven't made sales yet that might be your problem as well so here's how you know if you have a shitty offer number one it's hard to get leads number two most people don't want to buy number three if they do want to
(02:56) buy they compare your prices to someone else no bueno and here's why what many people do is they try and just well many people do is they try and create another and also ran right and what ends up happening is that the prospect makes a price driven decision rather than a value driven decision and so they think to themselves these two things are the same I will therefore take the lower price right and so we have to fight very hard or very intelligently on how to break that that cycle all right and so this is what it looks like when it's wrong these two are close enough I think
(03:32) I'll get the cheaper one very sad for all of us a strong offer connects to the big part of the market so that you make more Monies so here if you make and I'm going to show you cool demonstration at the end of this but if you can make an offer the entire Niche that you're going after it's like I [ __ ] need this then you're gonna have a lot easier time getting leads a lot easier time selling and a lot of times it's doing more work than your competitors are willing to do and that is what's going to shift people to a value-driven decision which is I really want this thing gosh it's expensive but I don't think anyone else
(04:07) could do it that's where you want to be because then you can make up your prices great place to be in and the reason it's so important for making money is that when you get this right number one you increase response rates on all of your advertisements in whatever way you advertise when I say advertise I mean to make things known number two increase conversion so think sales so more people that you talk to will say yes to you if the offer is right number three premium pricing which means not only will you have more people respond to your ads and more people say yes but
(04:39) they'll say yes at higher prices and when you have more and more more you make more and more and more money so right now my current return on Advertising my career is 36 to 1. that's not a typo our portfolio is a whole generates over 200 million dollars a year and a big part of that is nailing the offer and so nailing the offer is the single strongest lever on your business success so let me just show you how much so this was a traditional agency offer that we worked on ages ago but we just changed one thing about the business model just
(05:11) the offer we didn't change any of the mechanics in the business what they actually did nothing we just changed the offer so what they used to do is they were generic Facebook ads agency who here knows what I'm talking about with that anybody yes okay you know these ones everybody has one your mom has one your mom's basement has a kid in it who also does it too right thousand down thousand a month I'll run your ads for you right there you go we were doing Facebook ads you get leads maybe maybe you don't you pay us just the same pretty generic pretty shitty offer
(05:45) and so this is what their actual return on Advertising was for their advertising expense so they're spending ten thousand dollars a month they reach 300 000 people the response rate between Impressions to people who click um they got 40 book calls from that shortly 75 appointments who showed was 30 closing was 16 close five price points a thousand so they spent ten they made five so they're making point five to one kind of shitty but 30 days later they're at one to one and then so forth right it's pretty normal and this is actually pretty common in a lot of businesses some of you guys may have
(06:17) numbers like this right now so let me show you a new way so this is the offer that we changed it to so rather than a thousand down a thousand a month we said it's 4K down one time setup no monthly fee and only pay me when people show up we'll run the ads for you and we had an implied guarantee because if no one showed up you wouldn't have to pay us ever again obviously we're invested in getting paid again we prefer to get paid and so we will try and get as many people to show up as humanly possible cool simple so same initial stuff spend ten thousand
(06:49) dollars same number of Impressions three hundred thousand but two and a half times the response rate that's more number one say now because of that response rate the actual percentage stay the same now we got 100 though of points about rather than 40. and our sure remain the same so now we have 75 appointments versus 30.
(07:09) we would already call this a win would you not this would be a win in your business two and a half X cool but then we got more and more because we closed 2.3 times more people who got on the phone than we were before but we already had two and a half times more people ah more more second more so we went from five sales for ten thousand dollars 228 sales for ten thousand dollars more money good and the price point up front went from one thousand dollars to four thousand dollars so we have two and a half times the response rate 2.3 x the close rate at
(07:46) four times the price which resulted in a hundred and twelve thousand dollars in cash collected up front from that ten thousand dollars which is 11.2 to 1 which from a comparison standpoint was 22 times as effective just the offer didn't change anything else and so I say this to demonstrate one thing which is that right now most of you could dramatically improve your offer and make a [ __ ] load more money cool fantastic so if you went from whatever you convinced yourself you're okay with to ten times better row as would that be interesting to you fantastic all right so this is what you
(08:22) will get from this presentation this is the stuff you will learn if you actually do something as a result number one more leads for the same price two more sales for the same call volume three more money for the same stuff so natural question is how so I'll spend the rest of this President doing my best damnedest to explain it all right so nil number one number two why selling to the right people makes you more money so you want to see you want to sell to people who are valuable because of who they are rather than who you are all right so
(08:52) I'll leave you a little example so who you're familiar with conversion rate optimization cro anyone heard that term it's basically people who look at your website and say We'll change a bunch of doodads and more people are going to collect more people in opt-in okay very simple in the Ecom world it's more common than in the coaching world no idea why when I say coaching I mean Services Etc um no idea why it is that way but it is all right now so let's say you own that and you work on an e-commerce business is doing a
(09:20) million dollars a year and you have a 10 increase in throughput which is very common it's actually on the low end for most cro agencies so you increase that business by a hundred thousand dollars a year that's value right and you charge thirty six thousand dollars a year to do that all right cool we got a 36 of the value that you added neat now let's say that you did the same exact work on a business that's doing a hundred million dollars a year in e-commerce get the same 10 increase you make them 10 million dollars more now you can charge the same percentage
(09:51) of the increase and you make 30 3.6 million dollars for that one job same work 100 times the pay who would like it 100 times pay increase yes me too I'm with you all right and so the big Point here is that a lot of people think even the offer itself has to be amazing which it does but the next piece of this is to make sure that we're presenting to the right people so the same work occurred in both of those scenarios but because this person inherently was more valuable we get paid more because we created more
(10:27) value for them for the same work that is leverage by the way the definition of leverages you get more for what you put in high leverage put a little in get a lot out low leverage but a lot and get a little out this is a higher leverage play having a better offer is higher leverage you do the same work you get more responses you get more sales higher prices is this making sense cool so this is a story that I like a lot to drive this point on so Dad buys this kid a car it's a clunker looks like this you can imagine it right and the kid's like I don't know if I
(10:58) want the car he's like well you can scrap it take the cash and you can put it towards whatever car you want he says okay he's like well where should I go he's like well why don't you go to the uh go to the dealership see what they'll give you it goes the dealership says hey you know we'll give you we'll give you five grand for the car he's like okay so he goes back to his dad he's like hey they said they'll give me five grand he's like okay why don't you go to the uh the pawn shop down the street the scrap yard see what they'll
(11:22) give you maybe the medal is worth more this goes the scrap yard has same conversation when I saw the car they said we'll give you 500 bucks he was like oh 500 bucks goes back to his dad sulks and he's like they're only going to be 500 for the car he's like okay he's like why don't you go to that uh that collector thing down the street you already know where this is going go to the collector's thing down the street he's like hey I'm thinking about selling my car and they're like dude you have a historic blah blah blah that's a hundred thousand dollar there's only 20 of these left
(11:53) comes back to his dad his dad's smiling because he knows what happened and the lesson he wanted to teach his son is if you're not being hello it sounded more dramatic that way if you're not being valued it's because of the people that are placing the value on you and so a lot of times I feel like we deal with this with a lot of like again a customer segmentation that's beyond the scope of this this presentation but if you look at all the customers you have there are customers that pay you five ten times more than your other customers right but if you just had those
(12:29) right it's a lot easier to make that person more value because of who they are not even because of who you are right and so the person on the other side of the table matters just as much as this thing you're telling them sometimes more there you go the value derive is often about who you find not necessarily what you provide and so this is a final little one I'll drive this home with so there was a guy who's broke down on the side of the street he was super upset big red car there lots of fumes I don't know I have two car examples but go with it and and uh guys driving by stops on the side
(13:01) of the road and starts pushing has anyone seen this before in their lives okay what's interesting is that this guy who decided to be the Good Samaritan for the day helped the other guy out nothing crazy normal thing when he got back home he found out that the man on the side of the road was a billionaire and he had paid off his mortgage which I think is really cool it's a real story and so it wasn't a function of what he did it was a function of who he helped so most people could push a car and probably not get anything besides a
(13:33) thank you which is fine and that's cool because they didn't do it for that but in this particular instance he got his entire house paid off because of who he chose to serve and so right now you probably have pain in the ass clients who [ __ ] suck and you got a couple of them are pretty cool get more of them and one of the hardest things in business is being able to say no but I promise you that if you're able to say no to people who suck you'll make room for people who don't suck and those people will pay you a lot more money thank you facts
(14:04) so who do I decide to go after if this is what I'm going to decide to do awesome I'll give you a little framework for this so when we look at markets that we want to go after and this is at a market level you can actually drill close to this in terms of customer segmentation there's four characteristics we look for number one is pain number two is purchasing power so do they have the problem to solve do they got the money to spend can we find them easily and are they going to be bigger tomorrow than they are today right because you could reverse this and
(14:32) say how do I find somebody who doesn't give a [ __ ] can't afford the thing I can't find them it's actually shrinking right so let's not do that let's do the opposite of that all right so anyone heard this uh you might have heard this example so if you have a hot dog stand right and you're trying to sell the most hot dogs so this is going to be we're gonna do this live today if you can just shout them out as loud as you can because you have no mic and I do if you wanted to sell the most hot dogs and we're in a contest and I said I'll give a 100 Grand of the person who sells
(15:01) the most hot dogs what would be the one advantage that you would want [ __ ] read my book so normally I would go through this they'd be like the best hot dogs the best packaging the best whatever right the best marketing the answer is you want to be right outside the stadium when the drunk crowd gets out you want to starve and crowd you can sell [ __ ] inside of a bun as long as it even resembles a hot dog and you will sell out and so the idea here is that we want to find the starving crowd and the thing is is that within markets there are sub segments that are starving and they're wildly underserved
(15:36) and they have lots of money and just no one has done a good job by presenting the right offer to them number two purchasing power so a friend of mine actually read this book um and like was going through this process and he was like I think I've got my perfect audience it's unemployed people I help them with their resumes they get jobs this is a huge Marketplace it's growing right um he gets on the phone with me after like a month of this like crazy great idea he's like you wouldn't believe it and I was like tell me it's like they can't afford a 300 consultation
(16:14) it's like I I can believe it and I was like what's the main reason they're giving you you say they're saying they don't have any income right now it's like wild thought and so when you're selling something you want to make sure that the person you have is purchasing power I will tell you something that I've anecdotally found is that the more I re I reveal about how expensive something is earlier on the process the more money out something they make a lot of people like to hide that and they try to like you know obfuscate you know trying to like hold
(16:43) it back and not tell people I don't want to scare people off people usually have an idea of a range of what something is and if someone is like so shock value that they won't get on the phone they're probably not going to close so I have been I've made more money it has cost me more money per call but I've made higher return on my advertising by having that stuff but most people are afraid of that because they only look at the front end metrics rather than the back end metrics so number three is we want to find find people are easy right and so
(17:13) if they're not aggregated somewhere it becomes very difficult to advertise to them right we can't make our ship known to them if we can't find them right if you're trying to reach Rich doctors it's much easier to do that than I don't know something that some of you guys are going after like you got to be able to find this this is really tactical but like this is why I love niches when you have like associations and Facebook groups and Professional Services around this particular audience it becomes very easy to Target them and not only that it becomes easy to Target
(17:40) them across all platforms and it becomes easy to do outbound to them because you can find those lists like there's so many different ways to advertise to them they get easy rather than thinking creative innovative ways to do it again there are other ways but why not make it easier like if we're going to do it might as well just pick the the the deck steps in our favor right and so the last one is one that I learned from Uncle Warren right which is he tells a story that that has always stuck with me I said when I was at Columbia business
(18:11) school he and it he had his closest friend of Colombia and they were kind of equivalent in every way super smart really hard working Etc and when they graduated they went their separate ways he went to get into you know private equity and investing Etc and his friend went into the steel business and worked really hard et cetera et cetera fast forward 30 years his friend did decently well he you know rose up in the company steals a hard business they can't pay as well et cetera this was an American Steel was kind of in turmoil Etc and
(18:42) um two guys same IQ ish same same work ethic Warren becomes an ultra billionaire the other guy he's just a normal dude and he said that's when I learned how important it was that it wasn't about how hard you row but the boat you're in and so a lot of us are are rowing in the wrong boat and we're wrong as hard as we can but we're actually in the wrong vehicle and so when we're when we're trying to pick the market that we're going after you don't want to pick Steel in the U.S when he was graduating from college a good friend of mine had a newspaper
(19:18) business he was a SAS dude from YC slick back hair the whole thing looked fancy and he was like dude we're not growing anymore he's like I've changed the the offer I've got you know I've got my sales team he's doing all this stuff I was like bro do you want me to say it he was like what do you mean it's like newspapers shrinking 25 a year compounded against you not even like neutral like negative compounding people like 25 a year returns like do that for 10 years the other way very bad and so he's like even though we're gaining market share I was like yeah but the Market's this big right and so the
(19:56) thing is there's an old VC saying ventric Apple saying he said when a great manager meets a bad Market the market wins right and so a lot of us are trying we're rolling in the wrong boat you're pursuing people who suck if you go to places or you go to markets that are growing you grow by default there are some people this is the nice thing that we have is that we all just went through covet whatever time ago it was who here saw a big increase in their business who here saw a big decrease in their business well good for you guys for everybody
(20:26) else um the point is is that you actually got to see in real time the difference between markets like the market was actually behind you and it got so much easier and so if we have the ability to decide what we're going to sell and to whom we might as well stack the deck right so number one why nailing your offer is the most important thing that you can do to make more money number two why selling the right people makes more money did I make that point cool all right number three here's why you should charge a lot of money for it aka the right price one of my favorite quotes from Dan Kennedy charge as much as you can
(20:59) without cracking a smile and so there's three little Frameworks I'm going to give you as quickly as I can because I want to get to some of the cool other stuff um there's price to Value discrepancy so price is what you pay value is what you get this is also a Warren Buffett quote you can imagine the top line is the value the middle line is the price and when your value declines the point where the price sorry the value Dives below the price is where people cancel if you have a recurring Revenue business or people don't buy right and so every
(21:31) single person wants a bargain this is an important point you could sell something for a hundred million dollars and it could be a bargain so price has nothing to do with the discrepancy between price and value there's both variables right and the problem is most business owners focus on the wrong side and so there's two ways you can increase that discrepancy number one the hard way is that you can lower your prices right if you lower your prices you increase the discrepancy makes sense right it also sucks because it's a great way to
(22:00) compete on prices commodity remember the apples and oranges we're doing the Apples to Apples shitty life right and what happens is you end up losing most of your money I have this nice visual didn't come up okay it's all good the other way to do this is the easy way right is that you can compute on value and create a value driven decision rather than a price driven decision and so this is where we start stacking as many things as we can on this rubber band of value to keep driving it as high as we [ __ ] can imagine so that the price just follows as a result and so we
(22:33) want to charge 10 times more than we are now for something a hundred times as valuable I showed you an example of how we could do 100 times more value just by serving a better customer but does that make sense this is how you make tons of money is by jacking the [ __ ] out of the value so much so that people are like this is not the same as everything else I have nothing to compare this to I have to take whatever number they give me is the only data point I have to compare to Dan Kennedy said you want to sell in a vacuum
(23:03) no one else is in the room you're like it's just you and me baby I'm all you got right and so that's what we want to do in our sales conversations where they have no alternative there's nothing else that they can do or nowhere else to go or no one else who can solve this problem all right it's remember this is one that's always useful to remind people of you can only go down to zero like you can only go so low on the price but you can go infinitely high in the other direction on value so I would want to tie myself to the thing that I can infinitely go up on rather than the one that I can only compress to zero
(23:36) so the goal is that they buy a tremendous amount of value at a discount we still want them to get a deal but we do it by pushing the other side the nice thing that happens when you do this and this is what most people do when they're picking their price so who here has picked a price for something they're selling recently can I get hand thank you by the way means the world to me that when you raise your hands when I do that because it gives me feedback Okay so this is what most people do they look at
(24:03) the marketplace they look what everyone else is doing number two they see what everyone else offers in terms of what they're actually providing number three they take the average number four they go slightly below to remain competitive of course and then they provide with their competitor offers a little bit more for a little bit less right great value what's interesting about that is that they're looking competitors and the funny thing is everyone's broke you might not know this mushroom competitors broke I see a ton of penile statements every single day they come in for acquisition.com so many businesses
(24:40) broke as [ __ ] don't look at that they don't know what they're doing why would you take the average of the mediocre right don't look at that they're poor forget about it right there we go that was that was the slot I wanted to show you what happens is when you have a commodity driven or a price driven Market we're offering you continue to compete on price and so what happens is everyone offers a little bit more for a little bit less and they keep going until basically everyone's a non-profit everyone keeps their head
(25:11) barely above water one month's profitable one month's not one month profitable is this am I telling anybody their life story right now anyone okay and it's because you're playing the wrong game it's the wrong game you have to be in a place where it doesn't matter what anyone else is charging because why would you want to compete with them then you have to be compared ah sucks no fun right so we want to have a virtuous cycle of price rather than a vicious cycle or price because everyone's doing a little bit more for a little bit less a little bit more for a little bit less then everyone can't do any more for any
(25:42) less which sucks so this is the better way call this The Virtuous cycle of price when you increase your price your prospects increase their emotional investment they increase their perceived value when you increase your price their results increase as a consequence of their emotional investment their demandingness goes down when you charge more anyone had the rich client who just says oh yeah I set the wire this morning and then somebody's fighting you over fifty dollars anyone else yes of course I'm a great client I
(26:18) just send money am I just don't be an ass thank you right when you increase the price I can't even ruin what it says revenue for fulfillment per customer you make more money so you can actually do better [ __ ] for them so you're actually in a very real way get better and the more you do this the more your price goes up the more their emotional investment goes up the more they value it the better the results get the less demanding they are and the more money you have left over to continue to reinvest in the value you can provide them becomes a virtuous cycle right and
(26:47) the flip side of that is that you decrease your price they decrease their emotional investment they decrease the perceived value because they see you as a cheap alternative they decrease the results because they don't give a [ __ ] about it they become more demanding because they're Cheapskates and then finally you have less money left over to provide value is this making sense okay and oh wait there's more your business when you increase your price you make way more profit right you feel better because you're like I'm a good business person I make money I'm good at this game right so you increase your you you
(27:16) increase your profit you increase how much you feel about yourself your perception of impact because the results goes up because you're like I'm doing good in the world not only am I making more money am I good at business I'm actually helping people because I have profit left over to actually invest in the value right now our service level increases because the people that I can attract as a result right because you can pay more people like from a playlist thing and we have sales team conviction and this is actually a really underrated one I've trained a lot of sales teams in my
(27:46) life the one thing that trumps all training is belief and if they believe the heart of the founder the heart of the CEO is to actually help the people that you are selling to they will sell with a completely different frame the best salesperson that we had in our in our company at gym launcher we still have I have heard his calls the man is a Savage like board like psychopath love you I've heard him on calls after the third or fourth objection and he'll just take his dig his head off and he'll rub his eyes and he's like
(28:26) I'm not giving up on you Dad he's like I I know you need this I know you got a lot of stuff that's that's preventing he's like but I know that this is the thing that you need to get to where you want to go he's like so let's let's keep talking through it let's figure this out man it's like there's only one way that your life's Gonna Change is through us like I know everyone else's stuff I know you got no other options like I'm your guy so let's make this work and like I have seen him do this again and again now how many people on your sales team after
(28:56) they get one objection they're like no no you should yeah think about it right because they don't believe because if they really believed this is a this is a really good example so let's say that you could go back in time to yourself and give yourself one investing tip just one 10 years ago there's probably a stock or a thing or whatever that was really small then would be really big now probably change your life right think of that thing in your head now imagine you go now but you don't look like you but you're seeing your old self 10 years ago and you're like you have to do this thing and you can't
(29:34) say that it's you how convicted would you be to get them to do the thing they'd be like no I'm not really interested I don't really know any of that stuff you're like you need to do this you're like come on man the thing is is that that frame is the frame of what good salesmen sell with because they genuinely want the person to do the thing to benefit if you are the cheapest price and that's not what you built your business strategy around so I want to be very clear there is a strategy for being the
(30:06) low-cost leader virtually every person who I've heard say that they're cutting their prices to get more customers that was not the strategy that started their business with the only way you can start that is your strategy is that from day one you have a cost driven culture you build a Tech Tool that automates a ton of manual labor you take labor from overseas exclusively you have a culture of cost-cutting budgeting like Walmart that's their strategy for virtually everyone else there is no benefit to trying to keep cutting your prices but there's a very big one for being the
(30:36) most valuable you dig all right quick one so they did this science experiment which I think is really cool and they presented three wines to blind taste testers and they said they didn't say this they're like there's a cheap wine there's a middle price wine an expensive one so those are the three wines they people try them right and then after they tried them they had them rate them so they said the the cheap one tasted like cheap wine the middle one tastes like medium wine and the expensive one tasted like great
(31:05) one right here's what's Wild they're the exact same [ __ ] wine there is a bi-directional relations between price and value people if you want to in a very real way increase the value that people perceive about your product you can make it more expensive and they will value it more how nuts is that it also makes it more money right there's my head right blowing up which means price itself is a component of value so the goal is to be so much more expensive that a consumer must pause and think this can't be the same category of solution as everyone else it's so much more expensive this can't
(31:52) be the same thing right and then it pulls you into another category so you make a decision or you force them to make a decision in a vacuum all right no if you have any kind of service this is more for services if you have a service where a client has to perform something in order to be successful then it would follow that the more invested they are the more invested they'll be which in turn creates better students and better outcomes so like if you want to help someone you have to charge them enough that it would hurt them so that they actually do
(32:22) it the most the most successful weight loss offer I think of all time I am a little bit biased was the one that we ran for gym launch it's called the six-week challenge here's the stick people would come in we would say Hey you can lose 20 pounds in six weeks you put 500 down if you lose the weight you get the money back everyone had real skin in the game there's a number one offer for the entire industry for almost five years because it was so compelling compared to like a membership or whatever [ __ ] thing that was out there
(32:55) and when we did that we had 78 of people succeed and hit the goal people were like oh is this shake that you like no one hit it I was like no people want to get their money back the stick was that most people need to lose more than 20 pounds right or when you lose 20 pounds you look yourself in me you're like I look pretty flat and you're like right you should tone up we should do the rest of this stuff right so that was the thing but they believed that we could help them because we did and we got them invested more than a traditional gym membership was remember we're competing
(33:25) against 29 memberships so 500 is very very expensive does that make sense think about how you can apply this within your own business to separate and create another category right so when you charge more you also as a side note increase the quality of your prospects which increases the quality of your product like I said earlier with the cro example if you increase the prices it takes all the shitty people out and then by doing that you only get people who are smarter more able et cetera and then all of a
(33:53) sudden your percentage results go up because you're dealing with the right people right don't have to sell to everybody so we actually did this with one this is a different weight loss brand one of our portfolio companies they were doing 450 000 a month five to one row as close rate was 30 percent profit was about 150 000 a month and so we made one change to the business I looked at everything I was like we're just going to raise your price by 50 and change nothing else it was like what about all the other like
(34:23) let's just do that it's like really like that's that's it that's what we're gonna do like of all the levers we have in percentage like I'd already done a bunch of research on other people that are competitors Etc I was like I think the price the market can stay sustain this here's what's crazy went to a million a month within eight weeks went to ten to one row as their close rate went up and their profit almost tripled in eight weeks because people believe that the thing was going to be worth more and they got better results as a consequence and they got better people
(35:04) to buy there you go so 2.76 or six seven okay that's why you should charge a lot for it so making making offers or making more money than anything else number two while making while selling the right people will make you more money number three why you should charge a lot of money for it number four how to reverse engineer value I'm gonna do it on time okay so I'm gonna go over is that cool is that all right okay so if you're gonna charge a lot of money for it you might as well make it remarkable so this was our gym Lords event
(35:44) there's 700 people in this room 42 000 here each wild right so my dad saw this picture on Facebook cost me out and he's like hey I saw that event I thought it was supposed to be like for your really expensive highest paying people I was like it was he's like no the one that was like 40 000 a year I was like yeah it was like do they know that you're that you're charging them that money and I was like yeah they're aware I'm not magically siphoning money from their account they're aware but like blue is I couldn't couldn't fathom it right it's 28 million dollars right there and so
(36:25) it was like okay so I could this was like a teaching moment right so I was like all right well I'll bet you that you would pay me that amount of money too he's like what I was like okay so let's say that I could triple the profit of your business because he's a small business owner he's like okay I was like and I would uh and I could do that he's like well what would I have to do it's like you'd have to show up 10 hours a week more than you currently do he's like okay I could do that it's like well had anyone like would anybody else have
(37:04) already done this thing too and I was like yeah 4 000 people would already have gone through the same process that's what I would be taking you through it's like how long would I have to wait it's like about a year for you to get I was like it would be eight weeks for you to Roi and then 12 months yes okay well then you know what we're gonna do value equation is awesome [ __ ] rocks there's four variables you got to charge something that's uh have a dream outcome that's amazing you have to increase the perceived likelihood of
(37:33) achievement which is the questions my father was asking me you have to do it as fast as you can you have to make it as easy as possible if you think about those four things within the value that you're charging you will make something more valuable so good fast cheap easy so how can you make it easier how can you deliver it faster how can you make sure it's something they actually want and how can you increase or decrease the risk that they associate with the purchase does that make sense okay so lots of variables lots of da very fun
(38:00) there's a whole process to this exciting cool everyone understand how to reverse engineer value fantastic so we got two left or this is the one left so here's my quick recap I haven't understand why making a better offer the strongest level you have to grow your business yes number two and you can say yes back does everyone understand that a big component of values picking the right people say yes does everyone understand the direct link between price and value and that increasing of both increases the perceived value and your profits say yes number four does everyone understand
(38:35) that value isn't an amorphous word but a formula that can be repeated over and over again say yes all right last piece is a demonstration so I said five minutes there we go we're good there we go so how to use scarcity urgency guarantees bonuses and naming there's a lot of other things you can do to enhance the value and get more people to buy your [ __ ] I obviously can't do it in the next three minutes but I'm going to do my best to give you a demonstration all right so we're going to do an exercise to wrap
(39:05) this up and I think it will do more any we'll do more for you than anything I'd say with slides okay so I'm gonna sell you a book for 100 grand cool excited fantastic just kidding 100 a thousand dollars here's the directions the moment you feel that a thousand dollars of value has been created please stand okay thank you 100 just kidding type off a grant let the value building begin so I have a really good book and I will sell it to you for a thousand dollars who would like it okay fair enough at least and if that was worth it it's a best seller

(00:00) I cross $100 million in net worth at age 31 I'm 35 significantly higher than that now and I have the privilege of talking to lots of people who are at Billion Dollar Plus and so in this video I want to break down a handful of themes that I've seen repeated that can make you significantly more successful the rich by time the poor bu stuff ambitious people bu skills and lazy people by distractions as much as these seem like four different groups it's really like you have these pairings rich people use
(00:29) money to buy time ambitious people use time to buy skills and the reason it's ambitious people is because generational wealth isn't transferred through assets it's not transferred through stuff it's transferred through education it's transferred through skills and so there's this Sanskrit proverb that I love if you have a good son you don't need to accumulate wealth if you have a bad son there's no point in accumulating wealth and so the idea that you're going to pass on your wealth to a child who doesn't have the skills makes it irrelevant because fundamentally either
(01:00) it is a good son who has skills and then if the son has skills then whether you transfer the wealth or not makes the wealth itself irrelevant and I find that there's so many things that are like this in wealth creation that you don't understand until you're on the other side of it because the answers that you're looking for are not in your newsfeed they are not in the distraction and so the vast majority of lazy people that I have encountered continue to distract themselves because the difficulty of looking at themselves in the mirror and saying I am inadequate is too painful and so instead they would
(01:32) rather watch fluff videos on the internet that make them feel good and tickle their ears rather than confront reality that they are just not good enough and so they consume the stuff that's like I am worthy I deserve these things in other words entitled to them which by the way if you feel entitled to something then when you get it you are never grateful because you thought you deserved it to begin with we know that gratitude for example is something that increases your subjective well-being in life which is that you enjoy life more when you for what you get which means that you have to by very definition
(02:03) expect nothing which means you're entitled to nothing which means that you deserve nothing in reality you are worthy only of the things that you currently have because you have already gotten them you have proven that you can work a minimum wage job so you are worthy of the compensation of minimum wage and as much as this is painful and I'm sure this will get clipped a 100 times to show me as some evil rich guy or I'm willing to take that hate for the few people who will hear this message and decide to change the way they act you can be ambiti ious and distracted
(02:32) which keeps you poor when I started out at my Peak I had nine businesses because I heard seven income streams make you wealthy but it doesn't seven income streams just spread you seven ways and I had nine I was like well seven good nine must be better to give you context I had a chiropractor agency I had a dental agency I had a gym turnaround business and then I had at the time six locations so there's nine whever it is boom and I had Partners in each of these businesses I was still the one who was required to rain make meaning I was the one who was required to sell customers into all nine
(03:03) if you are required to work inside of the business then you can only really do one job and so when people hear that someone has seven income streams it's because they own assets that generate that kind of income but in order to gain the cash to then buy the assets that create the cash flow it requires time and focus let me make Focus real for you focus is a very amorphous term focus is measured by the amount of things you say no to and inversely you could measure it by how few things you say yes to meaning
(03:32) the most focused person says only yes to one thing and says no to literally everything else and so the next thing that separates the rich from the poor is it's 100x not 2X and so this concept is one that I had dinner with a friend of mine who's a public CEO and I asked him what he had done to grow the business I think from a $200 million market cap to a 1.
(03:57) 2 billion dollar market cap in less than two years all right so that's absurd growth for a company I was like so you know what what are you doing primarily and he said I'm shaking hands I'm kissing babies I'm going to events all the time and I was like well how many he's like well I'm going to do 66 events this quarter and I was like in person he was like yeah I was like they coming to you and he's like no I'm going to them I want to make this real he has a wife he has kids and before anyone listens and says I can't believe he well cool he makes trades if anything I would hope that people watch this and say I wouldn't make that trade in which case
(04:26) great also don't complain about not having with somebody who has made that trade made and so one of the big misconceptions by the way this is a sales thing too is that people want your outcome their way they want to have their cake and eat it too they want to say hey I want to not change the way I'm eating I want to not change the way I'm living but I want to have a six-pack and I want to be in shape I want to continue to live this way and I want to get the 10 chick or the 10 guy I want to continue with my work life schedule as I currently have but I want to have hyper growth they are trades they're price
(04:54) tags when you go to the store you either want the shoes and you're willing to pay the price or you're not willing to pay the price that's it you can't pick the price for the shoes you pay it or you don't my telephone back to myself is that I thought I worked a lot when I was younger and I did spend a lot of time working but I made so little progress because a lot of that time I wasn't actually creating output I encourage people to do something called the 12 x30 all right so it's it's very simple and it's actually not as unsustainable as people would think you work 12 hours a
(05:27) day for 30 days straight no weekends by the last day you realize one you aren't made of glass two how much more you could be working three how much faster you could be achieving your goals four how much you could be getting better every single day five you don't need to work like this forever but if you need to do it for a season or for a reason sometime in the future you've got that gear in you and six there are people who are working more than you who are beating you and you get all of those lessons for the low price of getting
(05:58) more done in a month than you probably did last quarter it's and so everyone and like of course you've got one you know one side of people are like I work more than this now and of course they don't they obviously don't and the thing is is that people are like why I work like that but I take a couple days off right that's the point is that you have to push through it now can you work 16 by 30 sure if you want to you're welcome to work more than that CU I've found that working six to six is kind of like what I do every day anyways I'm on 12 by 100 you know in terms of how I think
(06:22) about working there's plenty of days that I work 15 16 hour days cuz I get here at 5 or 6 and then sometimes we have an event we have dinner things like that afterwards and ends at 9:00 and that's where you have to be on not just at the office not just in front of your computer but people actually demanding things of you on a regular basis all the time being on camera and I'll tell you that there are levels to this like working alone for a full day is not as exhausting as being on stage for a full day being on camera for a full day because every second that you were not Peak you were losing you can take a
(06:50) break while you're working alone you can't take a break when you're on stage when you're meeting customers when you're making content like right like like every minute that is not recorded is basically a minute wasted there's a whole team here behind this camera right that is making this stuff for you and I'm costing them every second I'm not showing up I remember there was a period of season of my life where I think I had like nine straight uh months of this and it was not 12 it was 15 16 because I had
(07:15) to wake up at 4: to get to the gym where I was at the gym but I wake up at 4: and then I would get the the class ready I'd open the gym doors at 4:30 which start the classes at 5:00 and the last class at night would end it would be a 7:00 class it would end at 8: and then at 8: I would then do billing I'd reach out to old customers I would confirm lead appointments for the next day all that sometimes until 10: 11: at night and then I'd wake up again at 4 and so I don't know what the hours are there but it's more than 12 and I did that for 9 months straight and I used to describe it as the kind of tired a good night's
(07:45) sleep couldn't fix it was like it was tired it was deeper than like a one sleep I needed like weeks to like basically come back to normal and the thing is is that I think it is valuable because you have to learn that you have that gear I think that that gives you Supreme confidence when you're entering any new Endeavor because you know that you have acquired the trade of being relentless that you do not relent you do not let up you do not stop until you get what you want and you know that you can push through being tired or being underslept or being overwhelmed because you realize that you didn't die and that
(08:16) you've done this before and so the difference between the Newbie and the veteran is that the veteran looks on something and looks back on what they have done to get to that point and says I've seen this before this is another one of those and that's why they don't have the anxiety that's why don't have the stress that's when they get on stage they crush it that's when they the high pressure situation they still breathe normally their heartbeat doesn't go up because they've done it before and the only way that you can get to the point where you can say you've done it before
(08:39) is to do it now and so I Define work as volume times leverage and so it's about how many times you do something and how much you get for each time you do it in the beginning you need to do a lot more of this right you do way more volume because of that volume you gain skill and then the leverage also increases and so you get 100x the volume which then over time builds skill which then gives you more for what you put in and then over time that continues to increase your output the thing is that this concept of 100x not 2x has applied to so many different areas of my life like when I paid a large brand for insight
(09:16) into how I could grow my personal brand when I decided to get into this game I was like hey I'm not growing that fast uh and he said oh well pull up your social media profiles and we pulled him up one by one and he said look what you're doing look what I'm doing and he had genuinely been doing 10 times more volume than I was doing and so he basically said you're not doing enough volume I then said okay that was clear as day I need to do more volume and the thing is is when we did more volume we got better at doing it and so now we
(09:40) continue to do the same volume as I did in the beginning which is 10 times more than when I started we get even more output and then I had a different friend who talk to me billionaire guy he was thinking about getting into content and he said hey I'm really not growing that fast and I got to have the exact same conversation with him but the thing is is that this guy had done 100x not 2x before in his life it was just that he got to realize like me that it has been 100% domain specific and so when he then I showed him my Instagram and his I showed him my Tik Tok and his I showed
(10:04) him my YouTube and his and I said dude I'm making 450 pieces a week you're making seven and he was like got it like understood he immediately got it because he had already learned that lesson in a different domain I want to I want to zoom out for a second right now is a period of time where I'm working really hard I'm working a lot I'll give you context as what a lot is for me so this year the first hundred days of the year I didn't have a day off and so my time was only spent working and so it's like well what's the difference between when you were quote working all the time when
(10:34) you're younger and working all the time now is that what I get done in a day is significantly greater than what I got done and the quality of that work is also higher because the thing is is that you learn how to work you get better at working the more you do it and so a lot of people are like man I I feel like I'm not that productive when I work like what should I do it's like work more like you work more until you get better at working I remember when I was a legal intern at a at a company in France called ARA ARA if you want to how they
(10:58) say it and I was a legal intern and I was spending the whole summer there which by the way they always trying and like use and abuse interns I was like man I'm I'm working so hard and I talked to one of these legal partners and I only had one exchange with this particular legal partner who's you know high up in the firm and she said oh she was like that's cute you don't even know what work is she said you don't even know how to work just like you spend time here just like but you don't know how to work I just remember how dismissive uh what she said was but I I
(11:23) understood I mean I understand now especially what she meant was like you're spending a lot of time here but you're not getting anything done and it takes time it takes reps to get better at working itself and so that measure of focus the equal opposite of distraction is just how long you can stick with it and I can tell you that me from a very visual perspective when I work there are many times like you know when you work and you're like man I feel like I I like need a break the thing is is that that break period for people who aren't as
(11:47) good at working might be like the rest of the day and the better and better that I've gotten at working is that I can like kind of like whip my like whip my head back in and be like confront like keep going and I'm like all right I'm going to keep going and then you kind of realize that there's like a 5 minute sometimes 15 minute period where like your output slows a little bit but then you catch the next draft and then you're in again it's being able to whip yourself back in and that muscle of doing that takes practice and the only opportunity that you get to flex that muscle to practice it is to work
(12:18) yourself to the point of fatigue to the point or distraction or respite or rest would be beneficial or you feel like it's what you crave right now and then being able to be like no I can power through this and the thing is is you can you can power through it it just takes practice and practice takes repetition and being willing to be uncomfortable for an extended period of time and it's kind of like when you're eating and you're dieting there are moments where you get these Cravings where you're like man I'm starving I want something sweet if you've ever dieted before and this is where repetitions help it only lasts
(12:46) like 20 minutes so if you ever do this by the way dieting hack is just set a timer when you're like man I really want something wait 20 and if you still want it which you rarely do because it usually lasts less than 20 sometimes it's just five it'll just go away and the same thing happen happens with Focus but we then just take off we take off for our diet for the day we order a pizza right we order ice cream right or we take off working for the day right and we just say I'm just going to watch Netflix for the rest of the time or I'm just going to go hang out with friends
(13:12) whatever or I'm going to go out but I will say now that I have worked for a 100 days straight and that was in the earlier part of this year I think this year I've probably taken three or four days off since the year started and I still probably worked until like two on those days but I still consider consider those like more or less days off you're not going to die and so I think back retroactively or like historically like there were people who were forced to work for years on end or they would get killed as gruesome as that may seem I
(13:42) see that as hopeful in that they have already demonstrated that it's possible like you can work continuously for an extended period of time because fundamentally you're just alive you're moving right and like you think Super ancestors it's like they didn't have computers they like they just were around and so you do keep busy while you're awake and so you might as well keep busy continuing to nudge things forward and I can't tell you the amount of times where now I'm like my mind checked out and I was like no I my brain
(14:06) checked out a little bit but I'm going to I'm just going to keep I'm going to keep going and then 3 hours 4 hours 6 hours more past and I'm like oh I actually finished everything that I said I was going to do and it's just so much more work and it's fewer days off and it's earlier mornings and longer nights and it it it just it's being able to do that for an extended period of time I know the whole idea of like you know work on the things you love and you'll never work other day in your life that's just I just don't think it's true like
(14:31) there's the so many things that I don't enjoy doing that I have to do and that's why at least for me my saying is always um I will do what is required how I feel about it is relatively irrelevant because the things that have come from doing what is required have made doing the requirements something that I know will pay off and so I kind of like Feast on those morsel of past achievements as the fuel to continue doing things that may be uncomfortable or unpleasant in the moment and most work isn't unpleasant it's just work it's like I have to get this done right and you like
(15:02) I get to get this done sure but like I'm just being real for me it's it's usually not sunshine and rainbows like I I work a lot and I I get and I'm tired you know I I um I slept nine hours last night which was the first time I've slept 9 hours in a while and I feel amazing right now but sometimes you got to work on six sometimes you got to work on five and so think about this hypothetical extreme let's say that you played video games that was all you did when I say that's all you did you didn't go out you didn't talk to people you didn't see anyone you didn't eat you didn't sleep
(15:31) but you would be incredibly focused now at that point you say well in order for him to play more video games he needs to sleep so there are contingencies right you do need to eat or you'll die and so there are the fewest requirements necessary to maintain consistent focus on the one thing and those thing become requisites for Focus rather than distraction like there are periods of time where you will need to rest that rest therefore is productive because it increases your total output in the one thing that gets you the most leverage that gets you closest to your goals in
(16:02) the shortest period of time and so this isn't a video of me saying you know work until you die well you will work until you die because we all will die and we all probably will work at some point but it is more video of saying that every single thing that is not a requisite for you continuing to do the one thing that one yes are all distractions they are all things that take away and people have a hard time with this because they like to say like you need to have balance but this is what poor people do
(16:30) not understand and I am going to do my very best to kind of like pass down a message from the future to my past self about this and this goes for entrepreneurs specifically which is you do not understand how much work it is like you think you understand how much work it is and I've had multiple times in my life where I've met someone who was way further ahead than me and I saw them actually working five to 10 times more than me and I was like Wow and there's the scene in Invictus which is a movie with Morgan Freeman and Matt Damon I love this moment there's an exchange
(17:00) I'm paraphrasing but he says something to the extent of I've heard that you've been playing with an injury and Matt Damon just kind of says well no one ever plays it 100% And I just love that because to me that kind of encompasses the champion mindset which is that it's not about playing when circumstances are perfect it's that playing creates perfect circumstances we have to learn to play When the chips are stacked against us it's like having values values are only valuable when they are test it you can say you're loyal but if you know a girl if you're in a hotel room and a girl is there and your wife
(17:35) isn't there and there's no way that she finds out that is the test of whether you're loyal it's when there's Stakes test of whether you have work ethic is whether you can work when you're tired it's whether you can work when you're distracted it's whether you can work on things that you don't find Pleasant because all of the and I see this with you know some of the young guys like there was a guy we hired and then in 3 days he said I don't think this is for me and he got hired to a sales Ro he was he was making outbound calls I was like you don't think this is for you I was
(17:57) like you don't even know what's for you you were here for 3 days you didn't even get the ability to get good at the basic thing and so there's a level of intolerance for discomfort in some sort of expectation that it's going to be this amazing thing that you're going to love at all times and it's just not and so I would I'm okay being a different voice in the in The Entrepreneur Space that's not like you know passion is what is what gets you through the the hard times I don't think so passion has not been the thing that has gotten me through my my harder times it has been
(18:28) desire it has been wanting to make something into a reality by dragging something from your mind into the world and sometimes I feel like you're giving birth to this thing which for every mother which I obviously haven't given birth it's like you give birth Kicking and Screaming it's a painful experience but then there's life that happens afterwards and I see work as very much labor and we even use the same word it's labor it's work it's it's painful the pain is that like you're halfway through I would imagine and you're like I still have to keep pushing cuz it's still not alive yet it's still not out and so I
(19:02) think learning to push through that and this is the part that my friend was saying where he's like they don't get it they don't get it they think that I do one of these speaking events and they see my Instagram and they think oh okay well why is my brain not growing like that he's like well I was in five different cities this week and I just had to do FaceTime with my kids in order for them to see me and people are then like I wouldn't make that trade fine but don't want what he has and so let me let me draw this out for you in a nice
(19:29) little visual to show you how I see work right this volume that you need to do so you have excitement right so when you have this new idea which we have them and you're like oh my God this is amazing right this is so good the thing is is that once you become neutral and then you become worried and stressed this is when work begins and so in the bodybuilding world they'd be like okay once you have achieved failure that is where your working reps begin it's an old school bodybuilding sake I'm sure the science Bros will be upset about it
(20:03) but I think that it very much qualifies for how it relates to work in this world is is is that your motivation Fades very quickly it's that work begins once motivation stops and I think if you measure it that way then you will measure how much you work and how hard you work very differently so it reminds me of this Muhammad Ali quote where he says I hated every minute of training but I would tell myself suffer now and live the rest of your life as a champion I have this uh tweet that I said a minute ago that I really like and so
(20:30) whenever I get to a low point where I think why do I even bother I just try and remind myself this is where most people stop and this is why they don't win that period that wall that you hit like that is that is the champion wall that is where you you leave everyone else behind because everyone only works until their point of excitement and then they stop it's like you have to find that next gear so the next point is that they cannot copy your proof people want to gain reputations they want to be known for
(20:59) for certain things they want to get status but people can copy your promises they can copy your services they can copy your logo they can copy your name but they can't copy what you've done I have sometimes younger entrepreneurs who reach out and they're like hey I want to build a big brand and um they're like I want to start making content but I advise them to only make content if they're truly documenting and don't transition into teacher mode because the thing that will build your brand is the stuff you do like we look at the
(21:26) business Titans that are out there you look at El you look at Bezos you look at maybe now Sam Alman you look at Jensen hang from Nvidia and they now have these quote big business Brands Steve Jobs Bill Gates Warren Buffett they are considered probably the leaders of the business World in terms of thought leadership but did they get there by building personal brands or did they get there by building personal businesses and then by building personal businesses which I'm joking here they just built big ass businesses by extension people wanted to know who was the person behind
(21:58) this big business business and then they built their credibility before they built their likeability everyone wants to put the car before the horse everyone wants to put the uh they want to eat the pudding before they have the proof yeah the proof comes before the pudding in the real world in a world where anyone can say anything and get instant reach trust is the thing that is the scarcity that is the that is the rare commodity and so the idea is if you want to build a really big brand then you want to index super hard on trust and the way that people can trust you is that you do what you said you have done the reason
(22:27) Mr Beast videos work worked is because he used his videos as proof he didn't say I am super knowledgeable he said look I did something that no one else is willing to do his first video that went viral was him counting to a million or something crazy right and so he did something that other people were not willing to do and so he just happened to have documented that thing and so if you're like well how do I get proof I'm So Young it's like well you just do epic stuff and then people will be like wow he did epic stuff this is interesting
(22:53) and so it still requires epic amounts of work in order to do that the reason that there's such a misconception about overnight success is that it's just that there's a threshold over which you are good enough that you go viral all right and so this is call it like here is the viral you know viral moment all right so this is our viral moment right here the thing is that we the person lived this whole life what we in the public see is this moment what happened since and so we have the perception of overnight success and this is why it's so
(23:22) difficult for people to wrap their heads around because they want to model what they see not what occurred and so we have to model what they did not what happened and so this fundamentally is the inputs this is what they put in for a long period of time what we see here is the output this is what's visible and so this is where it gets especially difficult for people trying to learn is that most people get rich and then they get weird and then what happens is people then try and copy what they do here not what they did to get there and so they copy the wrong stuff they model the plateau not the rise so you don't
(23:54) get rich by flying on private jets you get rich then you can fly on private jets and so so a big thing that richer people do is that they will act with urgency and I would say that this is just not even richer people this is entrepreneurs specifically that I'm making this video for is that they act with urgency all right and so you can tell in some ways how how successful someone's going to be by how quickly they do things the gap between thoughts and action and so this is something I personally work on a lot which is like how quickly between when I make a decision to do something does it actually occur and you can improve your
(24:24) potency as a person how powerful You Are by decreasing the gap between thoughts and action like if you think about the hypothetical extreme of this the god figure if you will thoughts and reality are one and the same he thinks planets and universes and they appear and so that would be the ultimate demonstration of power in my opinion and so we can approximate that we can get as close to that as we can by shrinking the time it takes between when we think and when we decide and then when we ultimately do when you don't have any more information to collect in order to make a decision
(24:53) then you make the decision and you make the decision by eliminating Alternatives so like literally the word decide comes from decader which is Latin for to cut off and so the question is what thing are you eliminating by making the decision that you're going to make and a really easy tactical thing is is whenever you say I'm going to get this done by the end of the week ask yourself can I get it done by the end of to day and that seems like a very small hack but that increases your pace of progress
(25:15) by 7x and so if you hear that you're like wow 7x it's like yeah and for that reason there are people who are working 100 times faster than you and I think that this is a really good cultural thing which is uh you can just say end of day not end of week and not end of month end of week so in each of the instances this is a 4X increase this is a 7x increase right and you can even go end of day goes into end of hour now this is one that Lila talks about a lot and she's a master operator is that she heard this
(25:49) from a mentor she said if it's a five minute task and you have 5 minutes do it now and so the amount of times where I'm like hey we should do this thing and then literally in 60 seconds it's handled by Lila like while I'm just walking around talking just like shooting ideas out there is baffling and so her speed of like that's a great idea it's already been you know delegated out like she doesn't keep things on her plate and so there's this big falseness that I think is propagated by a lot of the social media world because it feels good and to get lots of shares because
(26:20) it gives people permission to be lazy it gives people permission to tell themselves that they're great just the way they are I wholeheartedly reject that entire notion the idea that they sell you is that you're young you've got time and I think that is false because all this does is extend how long it takes you to remember that number one tomorrow isn't guaranteed like I just looked at my newsfeed this morning and I there was a guy that I knew who's my age and he just died of stomach cancer really sad really nice guy wife and
(26:49) three kids into fitness really in shape just a freak thing that happened and so the assumption that you've got time assumes that you know you're going to live forever that you know you're going to live to 100 and we know that that's not true and let me put this in perspective three out of 10,000 people live to 100 and so everyone has this assumption in their mind that they're like yeah I'm at 50 so I'm going to make it to 100 yeah well you've got a three in 10,000 shot of doing that very unlikely more realistically you'll die at the median which is 74 for men in the US which means that at 37 you're
(27:21) actually at the halfway point just in years but if you adjust for the increase in speed of time so the same reason that your kid at five years old thinks that something takes forever when you say it's going to happen next year and when you're 40 something that happens next year feels like you blink your eyes and it's there is that when you're five one year is 20% of your life when you're 40 one year is 2 and a half% of your life and so it very much in a realway is 9 times faster than it is for your
(27:46) 5-year-old and so it's my belief that as we get older we don't become more patient time just moves faster and so if you adjust for that time speed your midpoint isn't 37 it's closer to 21 and so this is also why in my opinion when you think back on your life you have so much meat in the first 20 years so much stuff happens all these material life events and it's because in that time period it was half of your life and then after that everything happens real fast and so what you have to realize is one tomorrow isn't guaranteed two nothing is
(28:16) going to be easy just get over it every time you think oh this could look just get immediately skip to oh that's not true there's something I don't know about that just skip to it the faster you can train that muscle that as soon as you have this fomo just slow down and realize that you don't know enough three it takes time to get good there's no one who's good at anything that was immediately good at it and the people who were immediately good at it I remember telling a professor I was like you know I've just naturally been good at languages he was like when you were a
(28:40) kid did you have multiple languages in your household and I was like well yeah I bilingual and he's like what are you even talking about like you literally started with that so of course languages are easier for you and so the thing is is that the people who have things that come naturally to them they just only came because they forgot the work that generalized to the new skill once you realize that it takes time repetitions that get good then you also realize that the sooner you start the sooner you get and don't stop until you do so let's
(29:06) assume you act with urgency right you've gotten that done you've moved end of week to end of day you've moved end of day to end of this hour you've moved end of month to end of this week and you've massively increase the speed that you execute well then you start running Face Forward into the fact that things are going to get really hard really fast and so I will I will tell you this one is that hard is for now not forever and so the good thing about bad times is that they end and the bad thing about Good Times is that they also end and so whenever you're going through a good season it's also a good reminder that
(29:35) this too shall pass and so what ends up happening is that when you're in the hard time that can give you that necessary spite it can give you the end of the the tunnel that you can look forward to there's only three outcomes you either quit it gets easier or you get harder so think about that because no matter what it always ends but you only lose when you quit before you see it through because two out of the three outcomes get easier either it relents the outside circumstance gets easier like the hard thing moves or you become harder and then by extension it no longer feels hard for you which I'll
(30:06) make this real for you right now think about the problems that you were stressed about 5 years ago in your business right think about the things that you were dealing with what you were stressed about now think about you trying to solve those problems today it's probably a joke to you now you'll be like well yeah obviously it's not that those things became less hard you became better but here's where this gets really interesting for me it just means that nothing is inherently hard to begin with anyways we are just always
(30:31) inadequate for me I remember when I had five employees and I was like man it's so many people to manage or you know I was like where am I G to you know I have to manage cash flow how do I do that or like how am I going to get new customers like how do I how do I S I can't sell really expensive stuff like what if someone gets obset you know if I if I charge more right what if what if someone finds out I charged this much as though it's like something wrong like all of these things are just just irrelevant to me now just so silly
(30:55) though for me at the time they were difficult and I Can Only Imagine how inconsequential the problems that I deal with growing hopefully $3 billion doll companies right now within the portfolio compared to what Elon deals with having six multiple hundred billion dollar companies and I I compare myself to that so I can always feel like I have a long way to go but let me give you one thing that that'll also give you a little bit of Hope about these these hard times is that these hard times are also your best times but only in reverse and so let me
(31:32) explain what I mean by that think about the times when you were younger and you were in love and you were poor and you're like man those were the good old days the thing is is that when you were in that moment it was stressful you didn't know how you're going to make ends meet how you're going to make rent where you're going to get food whatever it is you have these these hard times the hard times that you go through today but these Hard Times become the good old days and so we only see the truth when we look back you have to go through them to get the perspective and it's
(31:56) something that I try and like remember on a regular basis that like I'm going through the good old days and if they're the good old days in the future they might as well be the good old days today so let me tell you a little bit about what it feels like throughout this entire process because if you were consistently growing you were consistently in pain that's why they're called Growing Pains not growing Joys and if you have stress from growth remember the alternative is that you can have stress from stagnation and you can have stress from decline which
(32:27) fundamentally means that hardness and stress is a fact of life you will always have stress you will always have problems and the largest problem of all the largest stressor of all is determining that having problems is a problem is that being stressed means there's something wrong with you but being stressed just means you're alive having problems just means that you are actually doing something I'll tell you this story that I think can drive this home and I think this is the path to fulfillment over
(32:55) comfort so imagine you talk the creator of the universe before birth and pick the person you get to become you say I want to be the most courageous the Creator replies and says well then I will give you monsters to terrify you so that you can conquer them then you say well I want to be patient the Creator replies well then I will make you work harder and longer so you can learn to wait so then you say I want to be wise and the Creator replies then I will give you failures that will crush your spirit so you can learn the value of judgment you then say sounds like a rough life
(33:21) can you give me a good life greater replies just like we measure the quality of a blacksmith by the strength of his steel I measure you by what you are at the end not the fire and the hammer it took to make you a good life isn't a life that's easy a good life is a life that makes you into a good person and that my son is a hard life and so I remember when I when I sold gym lunch there was a year that I more or less took off I had all these kind of existential crises that I was going through because all I had been doing is
(33:47) just working and working working then I hadn't like put my head up to like look around and and smell the roses per say the problem that I had was that when I was smelling the Roses I was miserable I was very sad and the the sadness for me came from the thing that I had that was most reinforcing my life was the work that I was doing that was the thing that was that I enjoyed the most and so not having that actually created a huge loss for me and so then I had to create like what am I doing like why am I here right
(34:09) and so for me that was when I created the hypothesis or at least the thesis I have for my life was that hard work is the goal is that nothing left in the tank which I got from Jesse hler which I love emptying the tank every day is the point because for me those are the days that when I look back are the days that I feel the most fulfilled on in the moment you feel tired you feel exhausted you feel like you're bored you feel like you don't want to do another repetition you don't want to do another two hours but another two hours another repetition another edit is what is required not
(34:34) what you want but is what is required and if you have a little bit left in the tank and you don't know if you have a little bit left in the tank until you empty it until you physically can and so I think about that steel that we're trying to make and the only difference is that we are both the steel and the blacksmith and so the Creator in this would just give you the fire and either you can stand far enough away from it that it just keeps you warm or you can go into it and you can hammer out the impurities so that you can just become better and better and better and
(34:59) stronger and if you're watching this and you would like to start a business but you're not sure where to start I am a co-owner of school and we just started the school games and right now we're giving $100,000 away in cash or a cyber truck to the person who builds the biggest community on school in 30 days and so school is just a community platform that helps people start businesses and right now one out of two people who start a community a paid community on school make their first dollar online and so you're like okay well that's cool and right now on
(35:30) average the average paid Community owner makes $1,360 per month so this is not going to be the thing that makes you you know a billionaire rich but it can help you get started which is why I invest in the company I spent four years looking for something that could make the easiest kind of starter business for people to get going especially starting online the reason that we have this success rate right the reason that we have this very high success rate is that I meet every single week and on board new people so every Monday I'm on a call
(35:54) and I on board uh you know right now I think it's about 300 people per call that are on there uh and so I answer questions live uh with everyone on there and it's a lot of times it's the same faces so while the the calls relatively small I'd encourage you to come on on top of that I have kind of like step-by-step instructions of exactly what you need to do that the best community owners have done and so you can just model the behaviors just do this stuff I don't explain psychology and triggers and NLP it's just like do
(36:18) this stuff and this is what yields this outcome right and then finally we'll give you the entire platform that basically makes all the tech really easy and so right now we've got people who are in foreign countries who don't speak English uh we've got I mean I think there was a guy who won the gam who's 15 years old so like I'm telling you it's not rocket science like we've really taken a lot of effort to make it as simple as humanly possible you don't need any other software to make this work and so if that sounds at all interesting the best part about all of this is that you can start absolutely
(36:48) free and so we have the course we have the calls we have the platform we also have the community of other people all right and so you can start for free get 14 days uh you can click the link which is uh right here oops other way around school.
(37:05) com games start for free and hopefully I'll see you on the other side and so a big part of why this is so hard is that so few people want to go into the fire right and the fire could be entrepreneurship the fire could be content creation the fire could be starting a new product the fire could be doing Outreach and knocking on doors or quitting your job and and and starting another job in a completely different industry that's the fire it's the thing that other people aren't willing to do and they tell you not to do it because helps them justify the risk that they chose not to take it helps them them feel better about the risks they aren't
(37:30) willing to make I remember thinking about this at long length when I was younger and I thought about the word exceptional right so buried in the word itself is the key point which is that you cannot expect to be accepted if you want to be exceptional to become exceptional by definition you have to become the exception which means you have to be unlike other people you have to do what they don't agree with if they agreed with you if everyone agrees with you you can be sure that it's the wrong path when I quit my job every single person in my life told me it was a bad idea I graduated three years from
(38:04) vanderbelt I had a nice W CER consulting job I was set up to go to grad school to one of the Ivy Leagues I aced my gmats like I was set up I'd done the path and so for me to quit and be like I'm going to I'm going to be a personal trainer for minimum wage at a gym that was not a happy news for the vast majority of people that I knew but the thing is is that I've had those conversations multiple times in my life when I ended up leaving the gyms and started the turnaround business every person was like you finally made this thing work you finally you know now we finally
(38:31) agree with you again and it was right at the point where they accepted me that I was like you know what I think I want to do this other thing and I'm going to sell all these gyms for basically nothing in 90 days to then start new and they're like but you spent so long on this and they see sunk cost fallacy and the thing is is don't listen to the people who are closest to you listen to the people who are closest to your goals and so a lot of people like to think about how they have these mentors and these Heroes but the most important
(38:57) group is your reference group and your reference group is who you compare yourself to but the thing is that people think they compare themselves to their mentors and their Heroes but they don't who you compare yourself to is who influences your decisions so the voices you hear the voices you listen to when you're about to make a big move those voices are your actual reference group and if those voices are not close to your goal you should not listen to them if anything Sometimes the best advice in the world is do the opposite of whatever it is that they did to get in their life
(39:27) if you want what they have don't listen to what they say even when you're an entrepreneur so let's fast forward a couple years so there was a point where I started uh the outbound team so this is sound super tactical but I'm going to zoom out for you so we at gym launch had we were all paid ads for the most part we I had made content I had a book like there were things that were out there but still 70% plus of my of my new customers came from Paid ads and I knew that if I wanted to sell the company I
(39:52) would have to create a second acquisition channel that was very different from the primary one so that I could create more stability so you don't have one itis one point of failure within the business and so I remember reading this book about how to set up outbound and it said it will take a year and I said I'm really good at marketing I'm really good at sales it'll take me 12 weeks and it took 12 months like the book said and so when I walked through that what was interesting is it took 90 days for us to get our first sale and the whole time I'm investing in this team I'm investing in software I'm investing in training and Consulting to
(40:24) like learn how to get all this stuff going just to get our first sale but that's not very good for the amount of time and effort we put into it and then three months you know after that we started getting a couple sales trickling in still not a lot and I actually had almost like an intervention for my my executive team that were like hey we think this is shiny object they're using my words against me like we think this is a distraction it's it's not you know yielding a result for us I don't I think we should you know cut our losses and and move on and I just I kept thinking
(40:55) to myself like this is what hard feels like like we have to just keep inching our way through because we have made sales which me we could just we just need to get more efficient at it and then we did another six months and then we got to the point where it became 50% of Revenue but here's the thing that you you don't see and so whether you're starting a new acquisition Channel like I was you're starting paid ads whatever is that if I tell you in one year I could double your business right let's say you have to pay me $100,000 right and in one year I will
(41:23) double your business many people would probably be like yeah sign me up I'll do it maybe I'll take a loan but even for the 100 like if I know I'm going to double my business in a year I would do it okay but then what happens is month one they drop 5K and then they lose 5K and then month two they lose 5K again and then they say ah ads aren't for me ah outbounds not for me but the thing is is that the way it actually feels is that you lose 5K you lose another 5K you lose another 5K and then all of a sudden one month you make 25k and then the next month you make 50k and you make all of
(41:56) this back and some but it happens all at once and so there's a saying on Wall Street that I like which is it happens slower than you expect and then faster than you can imagine and they talk up at that when it comes to Market drops and Market explosions it's like we should like this we should be crashing it hasn't adjusted yet it happens slower than you expect and then faster than you can imagine and so you have to be willing to foro that period of time for a long time understanding that you just want to make progress and so I think the thing that separates masters from beginners is that Masters have more ways
(42:27) to win so you can measure your expertise in anything by the ways you can measure equaling the number of times and ways you can win and so if you're an expert at making videos then throughout the entire process of a really long project you have many wins on the way you know all the little progress markers that occur to create some big outcome and you approximate those little progress markers for the ultimate goal at the end when you're a beginner you only see the output and all you see is I'm doing stuff and nothing is happening but you just aren't able to mark progress well and so if you want to increase your
(43:03) expertise then you need to increase the number of ways you can measure so that you can increase the number of wins you have in a given time period And by the way that is what makes you enjoy your work and this is how the work itself becomes reinforcing and so in order to develop that expertise you have to have education and people think that education is expensive but the only thing more expensive than education is not being educated and so I would say that in my life I spent more money than I could possibly imagine simply trying to acquire skills and relationships that
(43:34) would make me better to give you an idea I think the most expensive thing that I bought for this this is not including uh me messing stuff up and just losing tons of money but I actually wrote a check for was $350,000 to have a dinner with a guy who was worth 7 billion and I got exactly what I wanted from that dinner and it was incredibly valuable for me and uh he kept saying no i i s offered 100K and then 200k 250k and 350k and when we offered 350k he said fine I'll just have dinner with you and he didn't ask for the money but I think he was
(44:04) just seeing that I was willing to spend the $350,000 for it and so I've spent so much money for one hour two hours anything to gain context because I I heard this close and you've heard if you've watched my channel you've heard this before but pick whatever number your income goal is right let's say it's a million doll a year and let's say you're currently making $100,000 a year if you value that million dollar goal the value of the million dollars per year what's the price you put on that education the value of that education is
(44:36) the difference between where you're at and where you want to go and so that's why if I want to if I want to become a Deca billionaire then I should be willing to pay everything that I have in order to gain the skills the experience the knowledge in order to get there and so if there's a way that you can spend $50,000 in order to learn a million dollar preyear skill set then every year you don't do it you lose $950,000 that you would have made if you had made that investment and so the the key Point here
(45:02) is that we use poor people language when we talk about education when we should be using investor language because it should be an investment in an asset and the asset just happens to be you and you can't sell it but you can invest in it and you can grow it if you think about Investments you'll never say an investment is expensive there's just a cost and a return but if someone says there's a $100 stock or a$1 th stock it could be expensive relative to the return but if the return is supposed to be good then no one says that that amount of money itself is expensive it's
(45:31) just what the cost is for the return it is the investment and so if you think about education in that same way it always has to be framed in terms of what you get for it not how much it costs it's not about how much you make now it's how much you're going to make and how much that's worth to you and for me whatever my Delta is is what I'm willing to pour into that without hesitation and so for the first probably I mean shoot I lost everything at year whatever six of my entrepreneurial journey and I put all of the extra money that I had right back
(45:59) into learning more stuff and so even though I made profit my like biggest expense was me but it wasn't on my living and my lifestyle it was on my education and my network and my surroundings and the skills I wanted to learn the courses the Workshops the Seminars the coaching programs all the things that I did I'm a product of that world despite the fact that I think that world overall has a lot of shitty people I still learn a lot and you can learn just as much by learning what not to do and say I will never do that or treat
(46:23) someone the way that person treated me because the best students never never come out negative so really like think that like I have always been the top performer in every single program coaching whatever I have ever done and so the process that I use is number one do everything they tell you to to the tea the first time then take what works and toss the rest you can learn something from everyone but only take in that which makes you stronger which is a quote that I have from Harry Potter the swort of Gryffindor but I love because it was enchanted to have this this spell that it would only take in things that
(47:01) made it stronger so it took in the bassx Venom which allowed it to kill you know the horcruxes later on but I like to see myself as that sword is that I continue to invest I continue to put things into the steel but I only take in that which makes me stronger so a lot of people have these negative experiences with coaches Consultants vendors whatever and I just like to think to myself like in what way will this make me better and so by instead asking that question rather than enumerating the many things they could have done better or the things they did WR WR simply saying there is something that I can learn from this and
(47:30) there is something in this experience that will make me stronger and that frame may have been one of the most viable frames that I've had because I like you have spent plenty of money on things that have quote not worked but I still learned enough from them and oftentimes what not to do that allowed me to then see what to do but before I ever did that I had to do the first three steps of that which was do everything they said to the tea the first time and if for whatever reason it did not work I would then use my other skills to patch the difference so that I could find a way to make it work and by
(48:02) the way if they have a success story which they usually do because that's how they sold you is that you find that person and figure out what they are doing that is lacking in the education that the person who's teaching taught fundamentally if you ever buy something where there is somebody who has been successful then it means there are activities that yield success and the discrepancy I'm going to show this to you visually because I think it's important so let's say there's a bridge right and you've got you know here's
(48:29) here's money and here's you okay so you've got this path that someone uh shows you how to do so you paid money and they give you these little bricks here right they give you these little bricks that you paid money for and maybe These Bricks you had to pay different vendors different amounts of money for each one of these bricks but you still haven't made money yet the thing is is that there's a gap here and the reason that some people are successful with some people's in uh you know programs or implementations and other people aren't is because that the people who already bought that brick from somebody else
(48:58) before that that brick isn't missing and so if you see the education you have as these bricks on the road then you wouldn't say that the foundation of a house is in some way a ripoff you would just say it's not a complete house now if they sold you the expectation that you would have a house sure you could be upset by them but they still helped you build a foundation and so it's the same people who get upset saying oh I learned arithmetic from Mrs glass but then when I found Mr Hardwick and he taught me calculus she only taught me she's a  you wouldn't say that but for some
(49:30) reason people talk about the basics of business the same way when they become more advanced if someone taught you how to do outbound and do warm Outreach so that you could sell your first customers and someone else later teaches you how to run ads well you probably learned how to work the leads from the ads that work for you because you learned how to do outbound you probably learned how to sell because you learned how to sell strangers and so when you did the ads it worked for you and then somebody else who did that same exact implementation didn't have the bricks that you had and
(49:54) they never got the dollars that came across and so whenever something doesn't work if you can it doesn't make you any better by saying it's their fault and fault also only matters in the eyes of the law which you're not going to sue anybody anyway so who gives a the only thing that matters is whether the outcome happens or not which is under your control because it means that you simply have a discrepancy between where you are and where you want to go and so a lot of people would then say sure Alex
(50:18) it's easy for you to say you're a white guy you're right cool so just don't watch the video move on um but for everybody else you've got connections you've got money you've got looks you've got intellect or intelligence these are all great but you can beat all of these you can beat somebody who has all four if you have one thing which is the desire to improve the insatiable desire to improve no matter where you start if you have this it's hard to beat someone who improves every second of every day without stopping without giving up and so I have met people who have connections money looks and intelligence and they do not people who have an
(50:58) insatiable desire to improve who do not stop and so if you think about it like this if life were a race where at the end you die so got to finish first right there are people who may start at different parts of that race but what is not measured is the speed that you can move and so I don't know if you've seen these these clips that have gone viral in the NFL where they have like one of their wide receivers start like 20 yards behind a fan and they have to race the length of the football field and then the wide receiver will usually catch up like talk to them and then just speed right past them and so it's far less
(51:30) about where you start because that's where a lot of losers will Define themselves they'll Define themselves by what happened to them rather than what they made happen and somebody else may be here but it only matters if you think that there's fairness but I don't believe fairness is something that exists in the universe and so I don't hold it as an ideal that I Proclaim must exist but there is simply a starting point in a rate of progress and the starting point you can't control but the rate of progress you can and so control what you can control if education is a change in Behavior that's
(51:59) what you do if you become educated you do something different after you learn something then intelligence is rate of learning which means that you can in a very real way influence it's the rate of learning the speed of learning you can influence how quickly you move along this race independent of where you start and you'll also note that the person here has no influence on what this person does these two people are independent nodes the only reason that this person gets upset is that they they think it's not fair and if you just eliminate fairness from your vocabulary
(52:31) and think only in terms of what do I need to do then it eliminates a lot of the distraction that keeps you poor so if you call recall from the very beginning lazy people get distracted they focus on distraction and one of the biggest distractions is it's not fair it's it's not fair I shouldn't have to I should get I should I should it should things shouldn't it's all shoulds and I will tell you that should in my worldview should not exist because should creates expectations of an uncaring Universe it says that you demand something and I promise you that the universe will win and so all you
(53:09) have to do is watch like baby seals just get immediately eaten by orcas after like a mother is laying there on the ice to be like wow life isn't fair I'm sure that seal could be like it's not fair that my babies were literally eaten in front of me tough right tough they have mammal brains we can see that they got they got some feelings right and so if we go back to the Sword of Gryffindor does demanding that it should be fair make you stronger does saying that that person started further ahead of you in any way benefit you no because your actions are entirely independent
(53:42) from them and so the only thing that that does is actually delay your speed of taking action it makes you dumber because if we Define intelligence by rate of learning then it means it takes you longer to learn it makes you stupid and I think that that's why people people stay here for a very long time and many of them never leave so what are the things that bad entrepreneurs talk about with good entrepreneurs is one of the excuses they'll make is that they will make preference excuses they will make trade-off excuses they will say this is
(54:17) not worth the price in which case fine but don't also want the thing so for example privacy is the price of Fame loneliness is the price of ambition pleasure is the price of discipline novelty is the price of loyalty discretion is the price of trust and so so many people want the benefits of these traits but can't afford the cost or the price they're not willing to be discreet but they want someone to trust them they can't hold someone Secrets they they want someone to be be loyal to them at home but then they want the thrill of the new relationship they want the benefits of discipline of consistency but they can't trade the
(54:55) pleasure in the moment they want ambition but they're not willing to pay the price of being lonely of being the exception they want fame but then all of a sudden they are startled when they realize that they have no privacy and so each of these things are tradeoffs and if you're not willing to make the trade fine but don't about it and and I think part of it is that we have a hard time understanding to what degree and so each of these ideals are not binary it's not Des discretion it's how much discretion you have it's not novelty it's how much novelty it's not pleasure it's how much pleasure it's not loneliness it's how lonely and it's not
(55:33) hard work it's how hard do you have to work and how long do you have to work and so most people and I think this is where a lot of the complaints come is that they believe they're doing 10 out of 10 work right they're like I'm do this is 10 out of 10 hard for me right now but they're actually only doing one tenth of the amount of work that it takes to get to this goal and so might be doing a 10 out of 10 work for 100k goal but they're doing a one out of 10 work for a $1 million goal and I think a lot of that work comes down to being able to accurately assess reality and see what your actual discrepancies are
(56:10) and realize how much work you really have to do in order to get good at every one of those discrepancies because most outcomes don't occur until you've met all of the conditions like a pipeline all right so let's say you've got this pipeline here and you've got these valves these are the valves you've got this that's coming here and let's say once you get all the way through the water comes out the other side these valves have to open you have to open this thing open each of these valves and let's say you've checked off three of the four boxes the water's still going
(56:39) to be stuck here you're still not going to get the water through and so the thing is is that as much as you work and you're like but I did that and I did that and that didn't work and that didn't work it may have worked it just might not have met every condition to get the outcome and so if you think about life and outcomes that way it gets a lot easier because it stops being emotional you can simply say there's a condition that I haven't met and I have to figure out what that condition is rather than proclaiming that the Universe isn't fair or that you you
(57:06) started further back and that's why your effort hasn't resulted in it maybe and maybe this person only has to meet three of these and you have to meet four okay well then I guess that means that you're going to be better than them why is that a bad thing it means that you're going to develop more skills to achieve the same goal great if the end of this life is that you are the steel you are the thing that gets created then you can't resent the hammer and the fire that makes you because you can't wish for
(57:36) strong character and an easy life because the price of each is the other so either people aren't succeeding because they don't understand that they have to make a trade that they're not willing to make or the trade that they're currently making isn't sufficient so they either think that they deserve to get the Nike shoes just for being who they are and think it's not fair and think that the store owner should just give them the Nike shoes and look all you have to do is look at the news there's plenty of people who think that way they go and try and take it right but that makes them a thief that
(58:00) makes them significantly worse it actually does more harm to them in my opinion but there are people who believe that that's the worst that's the lowest level the next level above that is people who say no I'm willing to pay for the Nikes but I'll pay 30 it's like yeah but they're they're 300 that's the price it's like yeah but I'll pay 30 they don't extend they don't understand the extent of the trade-off and then they complain that their $30 isn't good enough it shouldn't be so expensive it is what it is and so there's a saying that Lea and I say a lot internally I'm like it takes What It Takes and so if we want this thing what often has to happen
(58:31) is you have to keep bidding it's much more like an auction of a trade-off because the real world level three is that you see the Nikes and then you bid 30 and then you realize it's not enough and rather than moan or put your thing down and walk away you're like 50 they're like you're like 100 you're like God and so that is the pain is being able to consistently reset the expectations and again and again and again until eventually you make it all the way through and you bid $300 you do get your Nikes and then all
(59:07) of a sudden everyone says must be nice to be born so naturally good all you have to do by the way is watch some of my very first content pieces and you think my very first content pieces are the podcasts that I made various for Content pieces that I made I made for my gyms 13 years ago and so it's like man you're so naturally good on camera watch those videos tell me if you think the same way I had to take shots before the videos cuz I was so nervous about sounding stupid in the fourth version I would say like the highest version of this so let let's I I'll break this down so the zero
(59:39) level of tradeoffs is should you just say you should get it for nothing the next level is too much so you say it's 30 bucks but it's actually 300 and you say it should the next level is bidding so you bid so you say say 30 50 100 and you find out that you're insufficient and you keep going up the final is source which is where you determine the price and this is often in my opinion where you create your reality so it's continuing to hammer away at content continuing to write drafts of the book before anyone else has seen it because you are the one that holds a standard higher than everyone else's because no
(1:00:19) longer do you accept the approval of others as your litmus test the market for sure in the beginning will tell you whether you're good or not but Steve Jobs Henry Ford right they would have asked for Faster Horses not cars is that they demand more from themselves than anyone else does and by setting that standard here where everyone else is here by actually meeting the standards of the market you actually lower your own and so this is where your standards become source and this is where you get into rarified air and this is what the quote Rich guys if you will when we talk
(1:00:53) behind closed doors about what people don't understand it's about hold the standard and in my opinion the person who should make the decision in every organization is the person who has the highest standards not the person who's most senior not the person who has the most shares it's the person who has the highest standards for whatever it is our marketing should be at this level if the owner thinks it's less then that person should be the person who's running marketing if somebody else thinks the product needs to be this good and
(1:01:15) someone else thinks to be less that person should be in charge whether it's their first day or the thousandth day the person who has the highest standards is the one who should be making the decision they should become source and so when you get to that level the only person you're making trade-offs with is yourself you're the one who's determining is this good enough for me to put my name on rather than is this good enough for them to say it's good and for example Jr toen worked on The Hobbit for a decade and he didn't even submit the draft one of his friends saw that he had been working on it for a
(1:01:46) decade and submitted it grabbed it from his desk and submitted it for him to a publisher and then it obviously became The Hobbit and and everything came after that and so his standards were so high that he still didn't even think it was ready but it was still so good that they ended up releasing it now many of you think that you are Jr Tolkien but most of you were not it's actually just very bad and so once you realize how high your standards really have to be in order to be excellent will you then have this daunting realization is that you
(1:02:15) can only do shot to four things in your whole life because of how long it really takes to get to there and so it's like I want to be best author in the the world that's not a desire of mine to be clear but if I wanted to be the best author in the world that I know that that's going to take at least a decade of actually working hard every single day to get better and believing that for me because I'm special I should somehow be able to be my first book is an overnight success and and and and that is the thing that chains you to
(1:02:45) mediocrity it's believing that it should be a different way rather than accepting reality as it is and then changing your actions as a consequence and so this is also why lazy people distract themselves because distraction makes you believe the lie that you can try a hundred things and then figure out which one works well in the reality any of them can work but none of them will work unless you pick one to work on and then that is you making it work the vast majority of things with enough iteration can become success it's just that people underestimate how many iterations they
(1:03:20) need to have it's 19 drafts not two it's 500 minutes of editing to to make the video not 50 it's making a th000 phone calls every week for two years not two months and so most of the times it's just that our level of understanding it's it's here and this is where a lot of people get stuck a lot of people get stuck here they say I should be better this should be easier I've already paid a little bit I said I was willing to pay 30 the Nike store owner won't give me the shoes and then you you basically are
(1:03:54) the same as this person you just have a price attach to I should I should it should be I deserve I am worth takes what it takes it costs what it costs you got to be willing to make the trade and if you're not willing to make the trade fine just don't complain and so if you want to become that exception you want to make those trade-offs you're willing to invest in skills and invest your time and do the repetitions and gain leverage to increase your output and are willing to move things from monthly to weekly
(1:04:18) weekly to daily daily to hourly and continue to pull forward your reality on a faster and faster Pace then I think you'll love this video about how to get ahead of the 99% of people

How to Grow Your Business SO Fast in 2025 It Feels ILLEGAL - YouTube
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxEQCHpZzHk

Transcript:
(00:00) the last three companies I founded and sold grew so fast it felt illegal us Allen got to $1.2 million per month at the end of the first year Prestige Labs got to $1.5 million per month by the end of the first year and gym launch got to over $2 million per month by the end of the first year I'm going to show you the strongest growth levers I used to get these results so that you can too let's start with the first one which is nobody knows you exist and if you're under $1 million in Revenue I can virtually guarantee that basically everyone on Earth doesn't know you exist and so the
(00:32) first four hours of every day should be dedicated to solving that problem and going from obscurity to being aware and so we do that by doing the core for more which is you have to do more Outreach cold or warm you have to make more content or you got to run ads but the thing is is you don't need to do all of them you pick one you go all in and that's what you spend your first four hours every single day on now the reason that I talk about advertising more so much is that advertising is a boom and if you're like what's a boom it's actually a term that I started using inter for our business which is a business order of magnitude change all
(01:04) right and so fundamentally if you think about a business there are many things that you can optimize so you can increase your close rate by 10% you can increase your your conversion rate on your on your optin page by 10% you can increase your email followup all of those things are optimizations and so the problem is with optimizations you can only go to 100% they're capped but with advertising you can in a very real way 100x the amount of people who find out about your business and one of the key that small business owners get stuck in is they get in this little optimization mouse trap where they're
(01:35) like I need to move this oh I I I I I was at 10.1 1:1 and now I need to be at at 10.2 to1 it's like dude just get a 100 times the leads and your business will grow so here's what most people think when they think about their given Marketplace so let's say you're a local dry cleaner all right you see that you're advertising on Facebook and so you see you have the whole pie and so you're happy so that's just you then you have you plus one other person then all of a sudden you've got half of the pie then it's you plus three other people in the marketplace and now you feel sad but
(02:07) the reality is the marketplace is significantly bigger than you ever give it credit for there are so many humans on Earth this is what it looks like in reality you're actually only advertising on one of four different methods and the way that you're doing it is only on one slice of the medium and then within that you have your tiny little quarter that you're taking up and so the marketplace has so many different ways they can communicate using each of the methods of communication so for example if I'm talking about content I'm like oh there's somebody else in my
(02:35) Marketplace who's marketing on Instagram Okay cool so there's that but isn't there also other platforms you can do it on and don't you think that maybe there's enough people in your Marketplace to satisfy your business probably the amount of times that I would have a gym owner for example who'd come to me and say hey there's this other guy in the marketplace who's now running Facebook ads I'm like you only need 200 people in your gym to be incredibly profitable and right now the last time I checked you've got 1 million
(02:59) people in your city and so you just have to get 200 of them and so if there's 10 others or 100 other gyms that are advertising your era even on the same platform you still just need to get 0.
(03:18) 002% of that audience to just come to you and so you think that as these people enter you're losing market share but the reality is you're this tiny little spec and most people don't even know you exist so the next growth principle is instead of trying to beat your competition shrink your competition Eminem has responded to hate in two ways publicly that I absolutely love so the first is that when will frell confronted him about some things that Afrojack had said to him he said hey afrojack's been talking trash do you have anything to say about it and Eminem just said who and then will faroh repeated the statement and then he just looked at him
(03:48) and he was like who and he was like okay yep that's what I thought and so the first is I'm so big I can't hear him the secondary is that you kill them with kindness right so either grow so big that no one can see them or hear them or you meet them where they're at on a different game which is you play on kindness and Grace and so in 8 Mile Eminem tries to claim all of the flaws that he has so that no one else can say anything and so I get hit on a lot not like that uh for talking about working a lot people are like that's not healthy
(04:22) and of course I try to put disclaimers in every video I'm like do whatever you want right um I get uh hit on for like oh I think he's he's trying to make money duh I try to say it all the time but people assume that I am trying to hide this from my owns of course I'm trying to make money I'm in business that's the whole point I do this and that way if I always start with I'm here to make money when I do something nice then people are like oh well that was nice of him rather than me claiming that I I have to be the Super kind whatever person and then when I try and make
(04:48) money people are like ah shake their finger at me like it's not good and so I try and learn from mem and just take all of the negatives that I can think that somebody would possibly say and then just claim them as my own because yes we are all flawed and none of us are perfect and so for some reason we are bothered when someone else points out our imperfections that we would readily State ourselves we know we have deficiencies what you want to do is overwhelm the marketplace so that you drown them out you want to be so loud
(05:14) that no one else can hear them you shrink them into irrelevance by comparison and so there's two ways that you can become the tallest building right you can knock everyone else down or you grow so that they become smaller in comparison to you and so everyone sees their little building and thinks oh no I should knock all my competitors down right when in reality all you need to do is build the biggest absolute building there and the thing is is that you're going to block out the Sun and your Shadow will be so big that no one can even see these people and let me
(05:44) tell you a story about this when I launched my last book 00 million leads I spent a tremendous amount of time and effort across I think at the time we had sevenish million uh subscribers or you know audience size across all platforms I emailed a bunch I made a ton of com content we spent money on ads we did Outreach we had Affiliates going we had all these different channels going to get as many people as possible to the launch and when I walk around Las Vegas because I live here I will usually get stopped about three-ish times when I do
(06:15) about a 60-minute walk uh mind you I walk in a crowded area so it's not like I'm just like walking in the neighborhood because then that would just be weird anyways and of course you should be recognized by your neighbors but I'll get stopped by three people and every time for the month leading up to the launch I would be like hey you going to the book launch 19 times out of 20 the people would look at me and be like what's the book launch and I was like how do you not know about this right but it was this wonderful reminder that most people when you get tired of your advertising most people don't even know
(06:44) your first name if you have diluted yourself into thinking that you should only have to say something once and somehow everyone in the entire world has heard you say that thing you are kidding yourself you need to become a master of variety in terms of of how you can resay the same thing in different ways and taking the natural extreme there's this fallacy that most small business owners think and myself- included for years I thought this was that repetition in and of itself is somehow bad so let me explain there's probably people on the internet I personally follow a bunch of
(07:19) philosophy accounts and so most of the philosophers are dead and yet I still love to see the quotes they have because they remind me of the things that I want to follow the way that I want to live and it's not like oh another senica quote does this guy never give up it's like he's dead he hasn't come up with a new quote in 2,000 years and yet I still like seeing the quotes even though I know I've seen them before and often times you serve that role for your audience more than anything else like we think that it's like oh I've said this
(07:52) one thing therefore they have all changed out their behavior immediately and they never need to learn that again but the biggest lesson that I've learned is that people need to be more reminded then they need to be taught and in the off chance that you've received hate or you have a competitor who's talking crap and it happens this counts double so instead of trying to beat them or prove them wrong you only have two options option one is you grow so big that no one can even hear them the alternative is that you kill them with kindness which is that you do not beat them by proving that you
(08:25) are right you beat them by proving that you are kind and then by comparison they will look bad and so I can only thing I can tell you about having dealt with plenty of it in my day is that on the occasion that I do choose to respond to hate I try to respond with kindness and so someone can just absolutely tear me one and just say like this guy sucks he's terrible whatever right I will then usually say hey you're right I'm a super flawed person um that being said it seems like you've developed like a big audience here and they seem to like you and so congrats on your your success
(09:00) right when someone sees that it's very hard for everyone to be like man that guy sucks it's just like now if I were to try and like list out all the points all I do is invite more back and forth which I don't want to do and it's a waste of my time and so instead you start all hate responses with you are right because it's all they want to hear and there's really nothing else to say after that and so what's interesting is that often times hate if you boil it down comes down to I do not prefer the way this person does things I have a different preference and it's like great
(09:32) right like I I make money one way he makes money another way and therefore he is wrong it's like no you just do the way you want which is awesome because you do it your way and they do it their way and the people who are attract to that will do that and the people attract to you will do yours and great like I mean of course there's engagement baiting and things like that because you know people people want to get views and all that and I and I respect it I get it um but but big picture I think you can't take it um you can't take it personally
(09:57) because whenever I I fall into that little trap I think to myself I'm a relatively developed monkey that is sitting on a little Blue Marble in a solar system that's in one of a billion galaxies and I'm worried about some screen that has words on it of a madeup language that we had in the last 1500 years of how we communicate face noise to each other and when I think about that I think you know this would be pretty silly for me to like ruin a day over so the third big growth lever and this one's massive is clear not clever all right so what do I mean by that well
(10:25) when I looked at the highest converting ads that I had run and I do this pretty regular I look for different components sometimes I'm like What's the hook sometimes I'm like what's the color scheme what's the what's the visuals that are being displayed in the first however many seconds and in this one particular pass I just looked at the grade level of the language that was being spoken and the reason I looked at that it was I think it was a you know one or two election Cycles ago I had heard this research study that had stated that the president who spoke in the lowest grade language was the one
(10:54) that won the election over and over again and when I heard that I see presidential elections fundamentally as massive brand campaigns and so I see that as they were able to communicate a message to a higher percentage of the population because they lowered the barrier to entry of comprehension meaning more people got what they said and so when I hear that I thought man I like to use all these big fancy College words and no one knows what I'm saying and so all I do is feed my ego not my bank account and so I made one of my big marking rules clear not clever and so
(11:29) you want to take whatever communication is look at your landing pages look at your ad copy look at the words you're saying in your content and say does a third grader understand this and the point that some people try to make as a counter is like oh I don't want to talk down to my audience no when you speak in a more broken down manner you help the experts understand it more easily and you help the beginners understand it for the first time and so it's not that experts are all of a sudden saying oh no I I don't believe that because listen we get tons of very big companies that come to acquisition. comom for investment and
(11:59) the the guys who run those companies very intelligent but I try to make my videos in a way that people can't understand them because who who do I who do I prove when I use a big word and then all of a sudden 3ars of the audience can't understand it and if the point of me making these videos is to make real business education accessible for everyone part of it making it accessible is making it interesting making it fun and making it comprehensible which is a fancy word for understandable and what you guys don't see behind the scenes is that I will
(12:28) typically selfed and so I said distilled earlier in a sentence than I said broken down for experts it because I said distilled and I was like I have to use a different word broken down and then I said comprehensible and then I said fancy word for understandable and so I try to constantly catch myself in this and it's also made me a significantly more effective leader so if I'm trying to communicate with my team I'm not trying to say big words I don't want to impress them I want to change what they do and so I I've taken this to such an extreme that with my books I just use
(12:57) little little stick figures right I have these little drawing it's like oh look here's a guy who's walking on a path look little apple orange big dollar sign little dollar sign right we try to make this as simple as possible so that people can understand what's actually going on because if you can explain it to a third grader and this is Richard fan who said this who famous physicist he said if you can explain it to a third grader then you understand it if you can't you don't and you need to understand it better so that you can break it down and so the broader the audience the broader the analogy and the
(13:23) simpler the language and so I'll give you an example one element is the grade language of the words you use the second is what visuals or stories you use to depict them and so if I'm talking to mechanics I might use an analogy where I relate something they understand cars to something they might not understand a business right if I wanted to teach a specific concept if I was talking to the same uh I was trying to teach the same concept but I was teaching it to Realtors then I would probably use a house analogy if I was teaching it to
(13:50) baseball people I would probably use a baseball analogy right and so if you have a narrow down audience you'll increase comprehension by using analogies that they all understand if you're talking to a broader audience then you need to have a broader slice of the market probably a more human experience that all of them have so if I'm talking to everyone I might talk about food I might talk about sleep I might talk about driving right because most people do that assuming I'm not talking to children and so you have to match the analogy to the history of
(14:22) learning from the people that you're trying to communicate to and this is what takes your marketing and your advertising and puts it on steroids and to put this to the test this is something you can do right now look at whatever emails you send run them through a reading grading level app keep working on it until it's below fifth grade minimum third grade if you're awesome and then send it I did this to our email follow-ups and had a 50% increase in conversion I didn't change anything about what I said but I saw that as I got 50% more people to
(14:56) understand because the goal here is to decreas increase the friction of comprehension so if we think about the elements of value speed ease time delay these elements are all impacted by complexity and so something complex takes longer to understand it takes more effort right and so and it's harder right and so instead what we want to do is say okay how do I make it easy and faster okay well then I'll just speak in a way that everyone understands the next massive growth lever is proof over promise all right and so with this means is that in my earlier days I would spend
(15:32) so much time on my promise right and I wrote a whole book on promises which is basically offers right and I would obsess about the offer but and the offer is super important but the only thing that's more important is proof all right so let me give you two hypothetical examples let's say that you've got business one that's selling Thing One and business two that's selling thing two well let's say they still compete for more or less the same audience and business 2 says we'll do X we'll do y we'll do Z we'll do W and we'll guarantee X Y and Z right and you look at their reviews and they've got a
(16:04) five-star rating and they've got one review the other company says we'll do X and they've got 11382 five stars and they've got a 4.7 who do you buy from this guy obviously but why this guy has a better promise because you believe this guy and so you want to have proof up to your eyeballs proof is your single highest EST priority as a business owner or marketer or Advertiser or promoter for your business it is the one thing that you prioritize before I enter any new space launch a new product the first thing that I do is try and get beta
(16:40) users I work for free in exchange for testimonials reviews and feedback and sometimes referrals if I'm lucky but in the beginning that is the highest most valuable thing that you can do so people will say things like never work for free and you only hear that from people who don't make that much money if you make a lot of money you will know that you spend so much time in the free phas because getting the product right is so important is such high leverage and so the proof process both makes you convicted because you get the opportunity of many feedback loops to make your product better so that you
(17:18) then can collect the positive feedback that you can then advertise to get more people like those customers and the most compelling way to advertise anything is show don't sell and if I just stand here and said nothing and I said and I just stated the facts and told the truth and I said I have 11382 reviews and our average review is 4.
(17:47) 7 and I make pasta really good and then or I have one review from my mama and I make super fragile calistic X docious pasta guaranteed which which one do you like better obviously this one you don't need to say much more the proof is the pudding the most important part of a message is the messenger themselves they're inextricably linked from the thing that's being communicated and this is what people seem to miss when they're making content which is why I'm a big advocate of do epic stuff first then talk about what you did and if the stuff
(18:23) that you didn't do is epic focus more on the doing epic stuff not on the talking about it and so I started this channel uh with a commitment to a vendor saying I'll make three YouTube videos a week and I was busy and I was like I'm just going to hit a webcam and I'm going to talk to the camera and that is how this channel was started and the only reason in my opinion that people decided to listen was because I just so happened to have sold a company for just under $50 million and so because of that there was proof that I was able to deliver on the
(18:53) promise whereas somebody else might have a totally beautiful studio and have all these things but they just forgot the one most important thing which is why should I listen to you and so it either is going to have to be proof that you generated for yourself or proof from other people saying that you help them achieve that thing if any of these growth principles help you in thinking about your business differently so that you can scale faster or you need to sendage your team it would mean the world to me if you shared it um that's my only ask and appreciate it so the
(19:22) next big thing is the hook now you're like okay I've heard about hooks before not the way that I'm going to talk about it all right so so the hook is greater than everything now you're like wait a second I thought proof was greater than everything well the proof is going to be contained in the thing but no one's going to see the proof unless you have a good hook all right and so the one thing that I think has consistently been reinforced and it's just like a greater and greater percentage of my time is
(19:45) allocated towards this one part of my advertising that grows my company the most is I search for the best Hooks and then I don't convince myself that I'm more creative than I think I am and I just keep using the ones that work so think about it like this these are the only four things that you can do to advertise any business you can warm Outreach so reaching out 10 one to people you know cold Outreach reaching one one to people you don't know you can run paid ads which is going one to many to people you don't know or you can post content which is one to many to people you do know and in each of these four
(20:14) situations you can double triple 5x the amount of people who open and respond who click and watch your ad who uh watch your content all the way to the end and if you do something like that and you do increase the clickr rate by go from 1% % to 5% or 2% to 10% which absolutely can happen when you do that you in a very real way can 2x 3x 4X 5x your business with just that one thing remember I talked about earlier that advertising is a boom it's it's an order of magnitude change well what other one thing can you just tweak that then opens up the flow to the entire
(20:55) business based on how good the first five seconds are or the first one second and so in thinking about hooks I think about both the visual hook as in what's happening what that people can see and then there's the auditory or or verbal hook which is what are the actual words that are being communicated and we have right now we reviewed our top YouTube videos of all time and I made a video about six months ago saying what we found which is our hook formula is proof promise plan and so if you have the opportunity to make content make make
(21:29) ads run cold outbound if you can include these I can almost guarantee that you will do better than if you include none of them and this is a force multiplier on any kind of advertising you do and so when I think about like all the different things all the effort that goes into advertising a business if I can just do one thing and the crazy part about hooks is they're the shortest part they're the shortest part of the whole darn thing and this is where David Ogie says if you have written your headline you've spent 80 cents of your advertising dollar the more advanced the
(21:58) advertis is that I meet whether it's a content creator somebody who's on outbound somebody who makes paid ads the more obsessive they are on the first frame the first impression that someone gets because they know one it increases the likel that the person's going to watch the rest of it and then potentially buy and then two it changes their entire perception of what follows so we actually looked at this uh for speakers at an event which was if we change the intro the the one to two minute intro that we had for a 60-minute talk talk the person's net promoter
(22:31) score so what people rated them in terms of how good they were changed massively even though the actual presentation was the same so simply how we framed the presenter the person that even gotten up on stage yet changed how everything they did afterwards was perceived and so if there's two minutes that can influence the score that you get the customer satisfaction the amount of prospects the one thing to focus on is nail the hook let me show you the force multiplication of this we just started reviewing uh short form content on the content team and just doing a more regular activity
(23:04) of saying like what are the things that make uh content do well and there was a video that we were like we think this thing is good and so all we did is we took the same video that got like 40,000 views and then we just chopped out the first three seconds that was kind of like getting into the into the video before the actual real Hook was delivered and by snipping those three seconds and then just starting where the hook really was it went from a 40,000 view video to a 780,000 video so you're talking about a 19x Improvement so I'm talking about you know 1% 2% I'm talking
(23:35) 19x that is why obsessing over the Hoke is so important so the next big growth lever that gave us the super fast growth was more so I talk about more better and new as the three primary strategies of growth you either do more of what's already working you do what you're doing to make it work better or you do something entirely new now most entrepreneurs love doing new stuff and that's why it's called shiny object syndrome and it's a Cancer and you should get that looked at but the very boring answer is the mundane more you have to master more and it's going
(24:11) instead of zero to one which is what most people love doing oh my God I finally got it to work but actually doing one to end which is how do I do as this thing as many times as seemly possible without wanting to kill myself and so here's the actual math explanation of this more is typically the highest risk adjusted turn strategy all right and so what that means is if you can do something and you already know it works the likelihood that the next thing you do works is much smaller and so this is why once you have a
(24:42) control meaning you have um a specific landing page or ad or copy or email that you know converts whenever you deviate from a high converting advertisement the likelihood that the variant is going to beat it is typically low and so you have to try a bunch of variations cuz all you're doing is messing something up that actually already works if you had one sales guy and he's closing at 30% well you could try and obsess to get him to 35 or 40% and that would be material you know get a 25% lift overall 30 to 40% to 25% Improvement but you
(25:18) know what would be even cooler just hire three more guys and then you have a 4X or a 300% Improvement and so it's like I could get a 25% Improvement or I could get a 300% Improvement and me trying to change up the sales script also has a significant shot of me taking it from 30 down to 20 because it's a change and so here's the thing is that when you change anything you guarantee you incur the cost of change but you do not guarantee that you get the benefit of change and so in each of the core four methods you do more Outreach which is cold or warm
(25:51) you go from 100 reach outs a day to 200 reach outs a day paid ads you go from $100 a day to $200 a day you go from posting content you go from posting once a day to twice a day right those are how you do more and when I talk to the most experienced advertisers that I know the most experienced business people that I know the most common theme we talk about is we kind of laugh in the back room of like if people just people just don't know how much more they can do that's that's honestly the real that's the real is that when I when I when I have conversations with small business owners
(26:20) they're like hey I don't think I can do any more uh ads you know I'm running I'm I'm already running $1,000 a day I'm like I mean dude there's businesses that run like two million a day and so you usually have so much more Runway than you think you do and sometimes you just need someone ahead of you to be like dude you can like 10x this and nothing's going to change but they think because of whatever mental limitation they have are like you've never spent that much money on on an ad before you've never
(26:44) made that am is it goingon to hurt my account no they want you to make good content is it going to hurt my ads no they want you to spend money is it gonna is it going to hurt my my you're going to people who've never met you before so why would they know that you've sent it to another 100 people right is that there's this these perceived fears but most of the times it's just between your ears I'll tell you guys a quick story about this so when I had my first I would say real business uh which is my
(27:07) first location of my first gym I had a mentor and he was a really good local marketer and so he had a strategy for his tning salons where he would bring in I mean thousands of customers every single uh every single quarter and what he did was he would put out flyers he just put flyers on cars and then had like a you know free VIP gift card and people would come in redeem them you flip them into memberships and so I figured okay I'll just run the same play and so I did the Flyers and I put 300 Flyers out and I waited by the phone being like Oh my God I'm going get 300 people in here it's going to be sick and
(27:42) what happened well my phone only rang once from the Flyers and when I picked up the phone uh the guy was like hey did you put the flyer on my car and I was like yeah I did I like what time you but he cut me off and he was like you damaged my Mercedes and I was like click and I I didn't know what to do um and as soon as i i i i and thankfully he never called me back because I definitely had didn't have the money to fix any Mercedes at that time um I called uh uh my mentor back up you know a week or two later once it was clear that no one else was going to call I said he said hey
(28:13) how' the Flyers work out and I was like well they didn't work out at all actually you know I was like taking some attitude with him he was like oh what was your test size and he like he didn't take the bait he was like oh what was your test size and uh I said well what do you mean he was like well like what' you test with before you like did the real campaign and I was like oh well I I mean I put 300 out and he was like 300 he's like you can't know anything with 300 I was like what do you mean he's like I test with 5,000 he's like and then we put out uh 5,000 a day for 30
(28:45) days and so I was looking at his results from 150,000 Flyers over 30 days and comparing them to my results of 300 in a day and once I saw that ju to position I was like got it I will never make this mistake again it was very embarrassing for me because I was on the right path I just didn't do enough and so one of the big metal lessons of this is that what presents as volatility is typically a symptom of low volume so if you're like man I only get like you know a sale every week or every other week it's kind
(29:25) of like you know it's you know most days I don't get a sale and then every once in a while I get one it only appears volatile because you're doing so little per day but if I looked at your year and saw that you closed about let's say 12 customers in that year you closed one a month for example every every three or four weeks you get a customer well all I would do is look at your entire advertising activity for the year and say okay if we wanted to get 12 customers a day we would have to do 365 times more advertising than we currently do and if we did that on a daily basis we would get 12 customers a
(29:58) day and so you just take your to calendar horizontally and then you flip it vertically for a day and that is how much volume is required and so most people just think that it's like oh they're they can't be doing more than like twice as much as me but in my experience the people who are crushing it literally are doing a thousand times more than you and that's the part that like until you sometimes you hear it or you have someone ahead of you say it it doesn't become real for you and it's why I make these videos is to try and like
(30:22) push as much you know out of out of my brain and and history so that you can just get the story without the scar um and that's and that's that's the whole point okay so once you're like okay I have something that's working I should just do way more of that awesome well the next thing the next power lever here is word of mouth and it's not the way that you think so Word of Mouth people are familiar with referrals you know customers uh tell other customers or other prospects that your stuff is good but what a lot of people don't understand is that negative word of
(30:52) mouth is significantly stronger and faster than positive and so Disney did this big study where they found that it takes 37 tragic moments to make up for one magic moment and versus uh there's basically like a 5x versus 37x on uh if someone has a good experience they tell five people if someone has a bad experience they tell like everybody and so a new business owner often will get customers pretty cheaply and then all of a sudden costs start going up and part of the reason that costs go up faster because you can actually put math to this which is understanding the difference between CPM which is cost per impression um and it's like why is it m
(31:31) it's mil which is French for thousand so it cost for thousand Impressions um versus CPL which is cost per lead all right and so if your cpms more or less stay the same but your cost per lead has 2x or 3x or 4X well if it's not costing you more to reach those people then it means that fewer of them are responding and if that's the case and you're just going to still relatively warm markets then the issue is that instead of having positive word of mouth working for you we should be actively lowering the amount of cost that it takes to get a new customer you have Word of Mouth
(32:10) working against you and so people who would otherwise purchase from you heard something negative and then choose not to and so now all of a sudden you have to reach three times the amount of people because two out of the three people who would have gone and bought your thing heard it was bad and then now you only have one person who's just heard nothing and so over time the percentage of the audience that's neutral or hasn't heard of you gets smaller and smaller and smaller and so it's way harder to grow off a word of mouth that's positive but it's really easy to get crushed on negative word of mouth and for whatever reason no
(32:41) business owner ever claims that they have negative word of mouth but I can tell you half of you are below average that's a fact and this is why I emphasize the proof over promise earlier on so much because if I'm going to get negative word of the mouth which I know I am if I'm starting out I want to keep that as concentrated and quiet as possible I don't want anybody to know right and so of course I'm not going to charge the money because the last thing I want to do is also have their money when they're upset right so it's like hey I'm making this trade you're going to get stuff it's probably going not be
(33:12) that good my only ask is you give me feedback right tell me how I can make this right tell me how I can make it better right and when you ask those types of questions you get the types of answers that can ultimately create more value for the customer and then once you get positive feedback positive feedback positive feedback now you have something that people actually want they you can need introduce strangers to it and of course you're going to roll into the next issue which is okay how do I keep that consistent because now it's not me doing everything I've got a team and we'll get into that ah this is a really
(33:36) good one so the next big growth lever is steel uh oh what am I what am I about to say from yourself so one of our portfolio companies which is very large hired a new advertising director and that advertising director had came in with lots of new ideas and so the founder because he wanted to teach an important lesson to the advertising director said sure let's let's do all of your ideas and so he sat there he said the scripts he you know he he recorded all these ads he took multiple days to do it and what ended up happening is that they ran all
(34:07) the ads and they didn't work and so he said hey crazy idea what if we use the same hook that's been working for three years and they used the same Hook and the ads worked and so think about it like this Nike on its second year after just do it wasn't like hey just do it kind of old let's switch it up it's it's like when you find a message that converts you keep hammering the message when you find the ad Hooks and you find the the the processes that work well for you most times you'd be better served just continuing to reuse it because you
(34:44) will get bored of it far before your customers ever do so believe it or not there's actually math to support this so uh Sergey brenn and Larry Page I can't remember which one of them uh is like a brilliant mathematician and actually was able to prove this ratio out and so when you're stealing from yourself you want 70% of all of your effort to go into basically carbon copying the thing that works and this works across all functions this works for a sales script this works for product this works for reinvestment activities like this rule works the
(35:14) second is adjacent so something that's just like one degree removed right so it's close to the core of what you normally do okay so instead of saying uh starting a school Community is the fastest way to start an online business right I could say that would be a hook and it's a hook that worked I could say um one of the fastest ways to start an online business to start a school Community right that would be a variation of something that we knew that those words worked but it would be adjacent to it not the exact carbon copy
(35:37) but similar now 10 is that means that one out of 10 of the things that you're putting your effort towards all right would be something that's brand sping new completely you know out of left field and when you look at your effort in your business I can almost guarantee you that you have this flipped and I only say this because uh I speak from experience um is that this is what I would do I would spend 70% of my time on new crazy things new ideas all the stuff that excited me and then 20% I'd be like oh yeah um I'll do something kind of
(36:08) different from what I was doing before and then 10% I'll be like fine I'll I'll maybe and this is this is a maybe most times like oh I already use that use that Hook Once I don't want to use it again I don't want to use the same hook that worked before in another ad it's silly also a different version of uh this from an advertising perspective of the 20% is you use the exact same hook you have a different background so it's uh just like a different variation so it's like I could wear a different shirt I could have a different setting and I could still deliver the same hook and to me that would still be kind of a a 20% variation
(36:35) all of your competitors are copying your stuff and taking what's working when you find something that's Works keep doing it deviation from what works is more likely not to work think about it like this if you demolish a building so let's say we build a building and it takes us two years to build a building right there's our building took us two years demolishing it might take five minutes just put a bomb boom because the place of the bricks and the steel in that building every other potentiality that those bricks could go to create not a
(37:07) building but there's only one placement of that brick in steel that creates a building and so you have unlimited options for Destruction and only one for solution and so when you do find something that works the likelihood that when you change it and you move the brick and you move the you move the scaffolding that you destroy the building is very high something can literally go anywhere except for the right place and so you can have have more options and all of them be wrong so once you're done stealing from yourself then let's talk about emotional versus
(37:36) logical buyers this was a huge like monstrous increase in business for me so have you ever heard from from the marketing world there's logical and there's emotional buyers I had heard it growing up and I kind of repeated it over and over again because I hadn't really thought about it I don't actually think that's true and so let me explain I actually think that there's a Continuum of buyers that people sit on and you've got people who require more information so they're high info buyers and then you've got people who require less information and there's two
(38:08) elements to this one is their information requirement and secondarily how much info they have received and so you could have a high information buyer that's further closer to this little this dollar sign here that only needs a little bit more information in order to buy and then you have some people that just generically buy lots of stuff and everybody loves those people of course but guess what everybody fights over those people and so the thing is is that the amount of low information buyers is like this the amount of high information buyers is an order of magnitude or
(38:38) multiple orders of magnitude greater only crazy people buy immediately it's very normal for people to want to have more information before making a decision and so when we think about our advertising the reason that the direct response Community typically can't grow very large businesses most of the time is because because they only advertise to these people and this pool of buyers is significantly smaller but the reason building a brand for example and investing in an audience is because you're trying to move them down this
(39:10) line now when I heard this in the earlier days of my career I was like I don't have time for that I need to make money I get it sure in the beginning you just advertise the the six-inch putts but when you want to scale you have to educate a higher percentage of the audience because they will require more to buy the way to move people through this is something that Eugene Schwarz uh pioneered in his book breakthrough advertising and he talks about the five levels of awareness so he has unaware people so people have just no idea about anything uh the next is problem aware so
(39:47) they have some sort of pain you have solution aware you have product aware and then you have most aware Okay so so those are the five stages now a customer will basically move in this direction going from unaware to most aware and if you want to go to broader and broader audiences to get their attention the unaware audience you typically have to go off of broad curiosity and so if you've ever seen those crazy like ads that are like weird articles like you know Arizona State blah blah blah has this new blah like they're trying to go after a massive
(40:24) audience of people who have no idea what's going on that new you know scientific breakthrough could lead you to buying a supplement it could lead you to buying uh a weight loss thing it could lead you to buying some sort of equipment it could lead you to buying Insurance like it could go in any direction but it's the Curiosity that gets them in problem aware would be something to the extent of like do you wake up to pee three times a night does it hurt when you bend over to tie your shoes do you get out of breath when you
(40:48) play with your kids those are going to be problem Weare now they again that could lead you to a supplement that could lead you to insurance that could lead you to whatever but it's a slightly more Weare person at least they're problem aware solution aware is that somebody knows of the potential things that they could buy and you're helping them select between them product aware is at even more micro level and most aware is typically your existing customers so here is where you just make offers right this is why the book offers is where I started because the people who are here is the tiny audience here
(41:21) and so you just make an offer to get them to buy but that only works for this tiny audience so you will make money quickly doing that but you will also cap yourself quickly in an effort to figure out okay well how much should I allocate between these most aware less info people and the maybe problem unaware High information people who require more education in order to make a purchasing decision well I had one of the most enlightening conversations I've had in a really long time uh with Ben Francis who's the CEO of Jim shark and then he introduced me to Chris Davis who's the
(41:51) CMO of New Balance and so we had an awesome conversation talking about what Chris had done at New Balance and help them just Skyrocket their sales and so what they did is that when he took over 30% of their advertising budget was going to here was going to the broad awareness level storytelling emotional stuff and then 70% was basically geared towards buying shoes saying hey go buy these shoes what he did when he took over was that he flipped them that he ended up with 70% going to Big highlevel pairings endorsements uh specific athletes that they wanted to recruit recuit that they felt represented their
(42:29) brand and only 30% of their advertising budget went towards actually telling people that they had shoes and that they were for sale and so after he made that flip here's the crazy part it took 18 months for them to see the return on that budget and so if you're in a rush this isn't going to work but if you're in a rush you're never going to get big anyways keeping this ratio made this concept Tactical for me and so when I think about my marketing effort my marketing dollars and most importantly how I measure it my marketing Impressions I want to make sure that 70% or more of the advertising Impressions
(43:06) that someone's going to get are going to be around the pairings that I want of me giving something rather than asking so when we look at this ratio this is actually super well studied between 70 and 30% here because right now uh it's actually three and a half to one is the ratio that has been studied 3.
(43:25) 5 to1 of give to ask to basically not lose audience and so if you look at television for example and they've already studied how many commercials can we jam into the show before people stop watching and so they figured it out that it was every three and a half minutes of content they could basically put one minute of advertising in if you look at your Facebook Newsfeed for every three posts you get when you scroll you'll get one ad and the platforms that grow the fastest have a larger percentage of this give and a small percentage of ask Tik
(43:58) Tok for years had zero ads on the platform and just wanted to grow as virally as possible and they acquired more users because they had a give first give all the time strategy and so the fact that they settled on this ratio and it has been corroborated fancy word for it it's worked in multiple other places made me think wow there's something to this and so this makes this concept of how do I balance High information buyers people that need more brand people that need more education prior to purchase with me making money is that you
(44:29) basically start with that ratio add patience in time and then it becomes a snowball that compounds unto itself and then you will get to a point in the future where you still you're doing so much more than you could ever possibly do if you only focused on the direct response on the less information but you're actually still digging the well for what you're going to do next year and so basically you can see when a Founder stops running a business and then the corporate execs come in because what they do is they flip the ratio they basically pull pull forward demand from the future they you had the the the
(45:00) founder dug the well and then they just suck all the water out of the well but then they didn't dig the next well and so you always going to be ahead of demand I'll give you even more tactics if you guys want more TCT fine I'll give you more tactics so B2B businesses and B Toc businesses do this differently and this was something that took me a really long time to figure out and so B Toc businesses so like business to Consumer businesses will typically do these types of pairings in terms of high information buyers by telling emotional stories making associations getting endorsements
(45:31) from athletes and influencers or organizations that represent the values that they think resonate positively with their ideal audience and once they do that they then can place the product next to those associations so that they can then pair them and then the person wants to buy the product as a consequence that is what it looks like in a b2c business but it took me a really long time to think through well what does this look like for a B2B business and so I break this down into several tactical things so number one is aspirational outcomes that you have
(46:01) achieved or the business has helped facilitate secondarily people like this person like your avatar that you have help facilitat so just to be clear stuff that you did stuff that you help other people do the third is stuff that you help them do the prospect themselves which you can only facilitate at least in my opinion in two major ways one is that you give them free content and education which is why I make this stuff and the second is that you give them free products and services which just why why the books are free they're on my site you can read them you consume them there's a scaling road map there personaliz all that stuff is free
(46:34) because fundamentally it's two degrees of separation if some person does it Alex had a big exit now he's a big portfolio cool that's two degrees of separation there's other companies in the portfolio or other businesses who look just like mine that he helps scale one degree separation I used his stuff and made more money zero degrees of separation and this is always going to be stronger than anything else but it'll take longer and so in understanding the difference between B Toc and B2B in terms of what do I do top of funnel here how do I allocate my resources it means
(47:05) that I'm spending time putting together the course in my spare time so that you guys can go consume it on uh how to make offers how to get leads how to Scale company from Z to 100 million like that's time that's effort that's my team who's behind the camera right now that's budget that goes towards that because I'm not looking for demand today I'm looking for those of you who are going to scale your companies and in 5 years hit me up let's say acis.com went public tomorrow and I got AED for being rude
(47:30) which I probably would and then they put in a new CEO and that new CEO says I need to hit quarterly earnings so what would he probably do he' probably switch to lots of direct response uh and he'd probably cut down all the budget on the gives and the books and all of a sudden be like well there's no Roi In A Book Like books don't make any money it's like yeah not today but they bring people into our world and when they do have the next billion dollar company they will hit us up first and that's the goal but that guy will
(48:00) just say well you know what screw all that I'm going to recapture all this marketing spending effort we're going to focus it all on these direct response ads tell people to buy bye byy and you know what for a quarter it'll work maybe two quarters it'll work but all of a sudden it'll start slowly going down slowly going down slowly going down then what happens they call the founder back up and they're like hey help help help us fix this and then the founder is going to say I can't do it in a quarter like it's going to take me a year year and a half to basically right siiz the
(48:23) ship because you sucked all the wells dry and I'm gonna have to start digging again so the next one is some of my marketing laws so I'm going to give you a few of them and I'll start with the first one that you if you've heard my channel then you should know this one it should be ingrained in your brain which is State the facts and tell the truth and the reason this is so important to me is that it forces me as a Advertiser business person to change reality and so rather than try and exaggerate it makes
(48:52) more sense to put all of the effort into doing epic stuff and then telling a truthful story rather than telling an epic story about something that was underwhelming and I think the vast majority of marketers and marketing do the second thing they have something normal and then they TR try and tell an exaggerated story of it rather than having something absolutely insane and just stating the facts and telling the truth and I can tell you that the second this one stating the facts and telling the truth is the best long-term strategy and so how do I actionized this all
(49:20) right so number one is that we make the truth more compelling all right we actually change reality the second is that we show only what we can show and so I remember I was talking to a martial arts guy and he's like there's all these other martial arts studios you know in my area how do I stand out and I said well what's your you know what's your specialty or whatever and he said I'm a double secret black belt of something and I said okay well how many double secret black belts he's like well there's only six in the nation and I was like okay well do any of them live in your era and he said no I was like well why don't you say that right why don't
(49:49) you say that so every business if you get narrow enough has something that's unique about it you might have the best parking you might have uh the fastest you know introduction to getting somebody to sit down you might have the most gyms you know whatever it is the most customers the most customers at a certain price point the most like you just need to slice the data of the business to figure out what is unique about your business and I remember this moment in uh Madmen which is a an advertising show it's like an old 50 show well it's a new show about the 50s anyways and Don Draper who's the lead
(50:20) character who's an advertising guy um is pitching a client who's a cigarette company and they're trying they're like the third or fourth in the category highly commoditized they're competing on price and they're losing and so he asks them to explain how cigarettes are made and they kind of roll their eyes they're like why is this important he's like okay well first we have the plants then we take and he keeps going through it he's and he's like and then we you know we let we let it sit out in the sun he's like what do you mean he's like you know
(50:45) to to to dry out the leads he's like so you toast them he's like yeah we toast them he's like it's toasted and so that was a unique part he just sliced down and got really narrow about one particular part of the process and was able to pull that out and emphasize it so that people are like oh this is different than other things and the really important part about this is that maybe some of the other cigarette companies also toast it but they don't say that they toast it and so the perception is still that it's different even if it is the same and so the best
(51:18) version of this is finding something that's truly unique the second best version is to just say something that's unique about something that everyone else already does but that your customers don't know and so the the correlator to that is say what only you can say so you show what only you can show and you say what only you can say so the showing part is going to be like okay with the toasting thing how do we display that visually with the super secret blackp then how do we display that and you could show the black belt you could show you shaking your hands getting the certification you could show you winning some tournament right if you're if you're toasting you
(51:49) could show the bed of all the the debacco that's getting toasted and the smells and the wafting through the air whatever right and then you describe it in a way that only you can say and so to do this you get narrower to be more unique and so the thing is is that you don't need to be the best in the world you need to be the best in a puddle it's more important that you are the best than what you are the best of I would rather be from a marketing perspective not absolutely I'd rather have the 10th biggest company in the world right than the first biggest company uh in Indiana but from an
(52:22) advertising perspective it is more compelling to be the best and I'll tell you a story that I haven't told um John Rockefeller when he uh was early on in his oil Empire bid to buy the biggest oil refinery in Cincinnati and he was the second biggest and he ended up overpaying for the business and the business owner of the oil refinery laughed at him and kind of laughed his way to the bank he's like you completely overpaid for this thing and so then what John D Rockefeller did after he bought the second the the first biggest and he
(52:59) already had the second biggest is that he then was able to say he was the biggest and then in the next 30 days he had over 20 m&a deals in the next 30 days to consolidate the entire rest of the market because he became the Gilla and so he was willing to overpay for the asset to get the story the difference in value between what he should have paid for those 20 deals and what he was able to pay by strong arming those smaller competitors because he was now the gorilla more than made up for what he minorly overpaid or maybe even majorly overpaid for the one company
(53:35) that he bought and when he recants the story when he tells the story again he talks about how that competitor didn't see the bigger picture and that was always it was such a I remember reading it in in the letters that he wrote to his son and thinking to myself that is powerful he was willing to overpay for the story he saw it as an investment in his brand in his reputation and so the guy who sold it just saw it as him overpaying for a product but he wasn't appropriately valuing how much true brand value that would give Rockefeller as a result the next big growth lever is
(54:11) all about the list all right so when I talk about the list people immediately think that I'm talking about email list Direct Mail list and sometimes that's true but I'll give you a hypothetical example so let's say I am selling winter coats and I advertise an amazing offer on some killer coats that people love they look amazing and nothing comes back well what could have happened well if I showed my advertisement to people who live in South Florida the likelihood that they buy my very expensive really
(54:41) heavy and hot winter coats is very low it has nothing to do with my offer nothing to do with the ad creative nothing to do with my pricing nothing to do with anything it's just the wrong people are seeing it and so many smaller businesses think that marketing doesn't work work when in reality they were showing to the wrong people and so the first thing that you have to get right in marketing is targeting the correct audience and so this is different by method of advertising and so if we pull up our core four here you want to reach
(55:13) out to people that you know are suffering from the problem that you solve or have a high likelihood of suffering from the problem that you solve and the narrower the problem the smaller the list from a paid ads perspective this is where the target targeting by platform gets more important and this is why some ad platforms tend to be more profitable than others because what makes an advertising platform successful is how well targeted is in fact Facebook was so good that they had to roll it back because of privacy loss but it was so effective at targeting people that people complained because it was so good
(55:42) it felt creepy posting content this is where the algorithm itself based on this is what's crazy what you look like and how you talk and what you say will impact what the AI serves your content to the same works with paid ads and so if I want to get more women to buy a product guess who I'm not going to have in the ad me because this is not what attracts lots of ladies right this is just usually a bunch of entrepreneurs who T have beards and like Fitness or whatever else right but like my audience is like 89% male and sure for for my 11% females keep rocking I appreciate you um
(56:23) but by and large I have a male driven audience now maybe it's because I talk about money but there's tons of female entrepreneurs who talk about money and don't have predominant male audiences and so it's just that my way of saying things and or the algorithm just tends to display it to dudes and so one of the easiest ways to make sure that you're displaying your ads to the right Avatar is make sure that the person in the ad looks like the Avatar and I'll tell you a funny story so when I was running the
(56:48) gym launch 1.0 version which is where we used to fly out to gyms and do the turnarounds I found out that when I put the thank you page this is before automated schedulers even existed so it's kind of wild all right um I remember when I my first automated schedule to put on the thank you page I thought I had like i' i' cured cancer I was like this is the coolest thing people can automatically book like I don't have to call them and work the lead um and so anyways the thank you page that I set up uh was just like hey
(57:13) text this number and then the second version of the thank you page was hey my name's Alex I'm going to be calling you so I put a picture of me and I said I'm going be calling you from this number so I tried to put some visual to it then when I put Lela picture on the thank you page and said Leila is going to be the one contacting you what do you know our response rates went through the roof people were immediately responsive they were showing up to appointments they were oh yeah sure I can make five o' for
(57:37) me they're like oh no I don't give a right and so if you want to attract a certain Avatar try to make sure that uh what is in your content how you talk uh matches the way they talk because fundamentally all marketing works as long as you get the targeting right it's like think about this way if you walked into room this is how I like to visualize marketing because people people over complicate it if I walked into a room and I got on stage and there was a thousand people in the room if those thousand people were my deal customers then even if I had just like a really mediocre offer and uh a something
(58:12) that they like kind of wanted I would get some response now it might not be efficient it might not get me the return I want so I might lose money but I might I would probably make something right I would get some clicks I would get some leads right and so it would allow me to start the feedback loop so I could improve but if nothing is coming through it's typically because the wrong people are seeing it and so one of the highest leverage ways of getting more from advertising is just making sure that the
(58:37) right people are seeing it which is a perfect transition into the next one which is how do you know that you've mastered something which is that Masters have more ways to win now what does that actually mean they understand the many different ways that you can measure progress so if you were to talk to an HR professional okay and you ask them what do you do a lot of times they're going to give you a couple vague answers they're like you know I'll payroll and I'll uh I'll make sure that people get in their benefits
(59:07) and whatever but when you talk to someone who's a master at this and I remember the first time I had somebody who who completely improved my understanding of talent and acquisition and recruiting um in the interview the candidate said oh um well what's your time to fill and I was like what do you mean she's like well the average time to fill a role I was like I don't know she's like oh well what's your what's your two-sided fit I was like I don't know what you mean and so she was like okay uh what's your cost uh to acquire
(59:37) talent I was like I don't know and so she had all of these different metrics that she was using to measure which completely made sense to me like I have cost to acquire a customer I should have cost to acquire talent I should have you know what's my cash conversion cycle how quickly do I get my first sale how quickly do I fill a role and then in terms of like customer satisfaction action is basically employee satisfaction of How likely is it that the manager and the employee both say at day 90 that this is a 10 out of 10 fit and so when I started looking at that I was like oh wow there's a total there's
(1:00:08) a whole another level of understanding this that I I had no idea about because Masters have a higher quality and quantity of metrics that they use to measure progress and so if I am trying to fix this function I have nothing to know how well I'm doing and so a beginner will try to advertise or will try to sell and they will have binary outcomes they'll just say I didn't sell or I did sell or I got leads or I didn't get leads but there are so many Nuance steps between that and when you have the Milestones the progress markers it allows you to fix things so you can keep moving the buck along until you get the
(1:00:45) outcome and so I'll tell you a story about this so when I was starting outbound way back in the day I it was a new channel for us and I'd never done it and about 90 days or or or 4 months in my executive team kind of did like an intervention so they came together I was like I was getting like a drug rehab right they were like we think this is a problem we think this is a shiny object we think you're you're distracted and we should double down on what works I was like how dare you use my words against me right and the thing is is that
(1:01:14) strategically I knew we needed to have a second acquisition channel for us to sell the business and so I was like no it's because they could only see that we'd only done one sale in four months and 100% of my time was going to towards this but what they didn't see was all the progress that we were making and so I had hirer degrees of Mastery in this now to be fair it was just because I had learned it along the way but when it started it was like okay well we have to get a list so where do we get the list
(1:01:38) so we looked at you know we bought a bunch of different list a lot of lists didn't work one of them did we're like okay this is a good provider and then we start you know like oh we got to enrich the DAT so we start learning how to enrich the day then we we started calling them but then no one was picking up and then we had to learn how call wrapping works we get local numbers and then all of a sudden people start picking up and then started hanging up on us and then we had to fix the the hook in the script and then we fix the hook in the script people would a minute
(1:01:56) but then they'd hang up on us so then we got we fix the hook and then we fix the offer and then people would then go to the second call but then they weren't showing up for the second call and so it's like we have to just keep moving the buck along the way but if you looked at it two months in it's like you know a heart surgery looks like murder to somebody from the outside who doesn't understand the milestones and so as you master something if you don't know why something's not working look closer look for the smaller attributes that you can
(1:02:20) actually zoom in on and say okay well I we'll get a sale eventually if we just keep moving in this direction and so look for directional correctness rather than binary and so this is a perfect example of Masters have more leading indicators to success than beginners too beginners typically look at purely the lagging indicat they just say churn is up they sales are down revenue is down cash collection down those are all lagging indicators you can't if I looked at you and said increase Revenue you can't do anything if I said decrease turn you can't do anything with that you would then have to do something else and then the result would be a decrease in
(1:02:50) turn the result would be more Revenue the result would be more sales and so we have to do we have to identify what all those steps are are that are high correlates or increase the likelihood that ultimate outcome occurs and if you like these growth principles you're absolutely going to love the 13 years of marketing lessons that I've learned it's one of my top videos enjoy it
