(00:00) I'm going to give you seven obscenely easy ways to get customers for free that you can Implement within this week these tactics have made me millions of dollars they actually work and I'll give you the real stats that I got when I used them in my business so you can use them in yours you should be obsessed with getting referrals and here's why referrals buy at higher percentages at higher prices they buy more often they buy more times and they're the most likely customer to yes refer you more customers and so if you have two types
(00:28) of customers that you can potentially get one that cost you a lot of money and does none of these things and one that's free that does all of those things which would you prefer well obviously this one and independent of how big your business gets 30% of your business coming from referrals no matter you're at 100 million or 100,000 a year still grows your business by 30% and when it's that big and it's still free that's the type of stuff that compounds a business into Infinity versus having one that plateaus
(00:54) because not enough people tell other people about it so the first one is when I looked at one of our portfolio companies we had a new sales gu who came in and crushed all of the records that had ever been done on that sales team and it was a very experienced sales team and I was like what is this guy doing does he have higher close rates on the phone and he didn't have higher close rates but for some reason he was able to get 30 to 50% more sales than everybody else I was like okay so how is he getting more opportunities and so we got
(01:18) on the call we listened to all the all the scripts we're like he's not doing anything different and so we pulled the guy up we were like dude what are you doing and he said I don't know um after I close the customer I just say who else do you know who might also want this and I usually get like one out of three people to send me one or two other people and I just do that on every sale cuz I learned that uh in my last job and when he said that it was like this big obvious duh that I'm sure was in the sop at some point for the sales team and of
(01:47) course people get lazy because they don't want to scare the sale away but by simply saying hey who else very clear who else do you know not do you know anybody yes no it's who else do you know who do you think would benefit from this who you'd want to do this with right cuz now you're actually asking them to solve a problem with their brain not make a quick yes no answer which is what most people are just going to say no I don't know anybody let's move on and number one this isn't going to be your grandmother's you know referral video on
(02:10) hey you should ask for referrals I'm going to give you some very specific strategies on what to do how to say it in a way that'll actually get the likel that they do it pretty high now referrals are super valuable for a number of reasons one is that they compound with the business meaning whether you're $100 million business 30% on 100 million or 30% on 100 Grand is still going to be 30% and so it's one of the most scalable ways to grow business overall the biggest companies in the world the vast majority of what they get
(02:33) is from word of mouth it's from people telling other people and in today's society where people are more able to share things faster and bigger across broader audiences and networks it matters more than ever it's so funny because people are like man why are my ads they were working now they're not everybody believes in positive word of mouth they don't believe in negative word of mouth but both Word of Mouth happen because that's how this works number two referrals who come in are more likely to buy so they have a higher
(02:56) close rate they pay more they're willing they're more likely to buy buy a more premium version of what you have and they're also more likely to refer other customers so you get three spins on the money-making wheel from having referrals versus a cold customer so if you have let's say a recurring membership business that you have 10% monthly turn well you can obviously always keep trying to decrease that turn but one of the other things that will always come out at any level so if you have a th customer you can you turn 10% you need a
(03:23) 100 new customers just to break even one of the very smart things that business owners do is they say okay well if I can get 10% of my customers to refer someone every month then I can offset that churn so that my business is stable and so by having a consistent way to get your all your customers to refer you 10% you can make up for the 10% turn that you have and the ratio between your referral percentage and your turn percentage is you're going to be your stable at rest growth rate and so if you could have
(03:50) even 20% referrals on 10% then it means you're going to grow two to one and you will keep growing 2 to one no matter how big you get number one this is called the gift card play so I use this dur during holiday season so either you make up a holiday it's like hey it's my birthday it's my wife's birthday it's the anniversary of the business or you go with the standard holidays it's Christmas it's Easter it's it's uh you know you can make it a spring thing it doesn't really matter you just have to a reason why to do the the gift cards now
(04:15) what you do with the gift cards it works especially well at Christmas is that you say that they are gifts for other people so you offer to your membership base and here's the here's how it works is that you want the amount for the gift card to be equal to one of your core unit of service so something that you would normally give away for free so if you were an SEO agency you might have a $2,000 month service okay then it would be $2,000 is what the gift card would be now you're like wait $2,000 gift credit yes this is why it's so compelling if
(04:41) you had a you know a garage door fixing business and there's three elements to your service you'd make it the base level the cheapest level is what the gift card would be equivalent to so let's say you have up to $1,000 of stuff and the lowest thing is 200 bucks then you make the gift card one or $200 now that step one is what you price the value of the discount the of the the gift card at the second element is what you make the discount for and the discount you want to be as aggressive as possible and so I recommend 90% or more
(05:07) discount on this so if I have a $2,000 thing 90% discount is 200 bucks you're like wait I'm not going to make money on this hold on the point here is what would you already give away for free in terms of service or product in order to get in your customer probably a lot especially if you know that a referral is worth a lot of money and this is where it gets this is where the money this is where it gets magical okay is that what you do is you say Hey I'm going to be giving these gift cards away only to my existing customers and you
(05:34) can only give them to other people for the holiday season now I'm going to limit them this is a key Point limit two per customer because that also gets everyone to buy two so that they refer you to customers and so that customer now buys two 90% off coupons that they have to give to two individual people that they can't use on themselves and when they make the purchase you say who are you want me to make this gift card out too and guess what happens there by making the gift card out to somebody you also capture the lead and so you get two
(06:00) referral leads that you get paid for this is what I'm saying you get paid for the referral lead everybody else you have to pay money to get leads here you get paid to get leads all right big difference here so whatever if you want to get really nuanced about it you could just make it your cost to acquire customer but I think it's form more compelling to make it whatever your base unit is with the assumption that you know that you're going to be able to bring this person in and then upsell for the levels of service and then use that
(06:23) gift card against that and so obviously we ran this in the brick and mor gym space which is where I started and so we would run say a $200 gift card which is about a month and you get 90% off so that people would pay 20 bucks for $200 gift card and now they look like amazing family members they're like hey I gave you a $200 gift card and you $200 gift card to my gym the person comes in with the card because you have their number so you can text them and follow up and then you put an expiration date on the gift card this is very important is the
(06:48) expiration on the the gift card needs to be 30 days because you want them to use it as fast as possible this is an year long thing you need to put urgency to get the lead in the door so then you follow up and say hey Sandra G uh gave you that gift card uh let's get you in here and then when they come in you have that $200 thing at the base level you give the free month that you'd be happy to do anyways and you get their card right their credit card or you can take that and say hey I think you'd be a best suited for the $2,000 package I'm going
(07:12) to take the 200 put it against that and boom now I took my $200 gift card put it against something that's 10 times more expensive they got 10 really 10% off and I still got paid 20 bucks for the lead and to make the sale and think about the math here so like if you have a big customer base and you sell two per customer and you have call it 200 customers in your base uh and you get you know 30 of them to buy two cards each that's 60 cards that you give out and you're going to convert a huge percentage of those cards so you bring
(07:38) 50 of those 60 in the door and you're going to close a big chunk of those people and depending on the price point multiply that by your price take out the discount there you go so you don't lose money for three reasons one you're not paying cost to acquire the customer two the amount that the thing that you're giving away as a discount is something you should be comfortable giv away that you would normally give away as a lead Magnet or a free level of service just to customer anyways and so when you have a normal way to get a customer you
(08:03) usually have some sort of promo and you have a cost to display that promo to people in terms of advertising you pay neither of those costs and then you make money because you're still getting paid by the customer to get the gift card and then the third way that you can offset this is that you can still sell them into something that's far more expensive and so at the very worst case scenario you make a little bit of money on the discounted cash to give away an a level of service that you're comfortable giving away anyways so the second one is
(08:29) super tactical and it's a very specific point in the sales process and so when someone comes up to you and says hey I want to buy these Services can you give me a discount we've all heard this hey can you make it a little less hey can you give me a homie hooko hey I know somebody do you think you could uh blah blah blah blah right so you say sure I'd love to just give me the name of three friends and I'm happy to give you the discount and so by doing that you can immediately say like because what happens they walk into a trap because
(08:56) they're they're going to like lean in as soon as you say oh I can totally give you that discount just give me the name of three friends and then all of a sudden they're like oh it's like yeah I will happily do that if you do something for me and be amazed at how many times that actually works I'm like oh so if you just want me to introduce you to three friends for your service or whatever you'll give me this discount I say sure but we do that right now and you got to make the introduction and so by doing that you lock in three leads
(09:18) they get the discount that you might have been willing to give before I personally never discount unless there's a change in terms and so either I change what I sell or they have to do something for me and so this is the second way which is they basically do some average iing on my behalf and so in exchange I give them the discount because I'm paying that discount is my cost to get those leads which I'm willing to pay for if someone's asking for a discount I mean again everything's going to come down to what is your cost you acquire
(09:42) customer normally and so if I figure I'm going to convert one out of these three referrals then I would say 1/3 of CAC times three so 1X CAC your cost to acquire customer whatever it normally is is what I'd be willing to give as a discount on the main thing and as you become more experienced with this you start to get more and more predictable metrics and in the beginning I just want this to work you can start fine-tuning hey I'll give you a 100 bucks per referral or whatever now the second way that you can do this is that instead of
(10:07) offering the discount you can offer more service that's an equivalent amount and the reason you do that is because let's say I charge $200 for my thing and it actually cost me $40 to deliver if someone says hey can I get a $200 discount I say I'll do you one better I'll give you $400 of service for free if you send me the person now the $400 of service to me only cost me 80 bucks but the perceived value of the $400 of service actually makes it even a bigger quote discount for them to get the thing and send me the traffic and so it's the
(10:34) second version kind of 2A and 2B of that second strategy and if you want to hear how to take the referral process I just outlined and put it on steroids I have a course that goes with this book it's free calm down that's on my site at acquisition. comom you can click the leads course you don't even have to opt in for it and just go to the Affiliates chapter it's a 45 minute video I think is that breaks down everything that you can do to get more customers by partnering with people who send you customers on a regular basis and number
(11:01) three is actually a permutation of number two but just done instead of on the discount you do it on the positive you say hey so you ask for $100 discount how about I do you one better I'll give you $200 of extra stuff and the reason I'm willing to do that as a business owner you don't say this this me explaining to you the $200 of service or stuff might cost me 40 bucks whereas giving $200 off the price is going to cost me hard cost $200 and so I'd rather give you $400 of value for 40 or 80 bucks of cost so actually reduce what my
(11:29) effective discount is but I also increase the value for the Prospect and one of the nice valuable things here is that you're just encouraging a customer to use your service more or use your product more which is always a good thing and the fourth version of this is one that I used all the time and it crushed for me and so what I did was as soon as the sale was over I would say hey do you to know how you can get this stuff for free and every time I did this when we'd have our sales 30% of our sales for every one of our promotions
(11:55) would come from people using the word of mouth the referral strategy that I'm about to talk talk about all right so it works really well and so at the end of the sale they already got you already got the card they already signed up and you say hey by the way do you know how to get this for free everyone leans in they're like yeah of course I want to learn how to get it for free so now we're not talking about discounts we're talking about how do I get it free and so what you say is hey if this thing's 500 bucks you say for every person you
(12:18) bring in I'll give you a 100 bucks in cash and it was a real $100 cash check that I would give these people and so I had so many people I had have nurses or teachers who had h networks of people that they worked with on a regular basis and said hey you want to do this weight loss challenge with me or whatever it was and so I would have one girl come ref me 10 people make 500 bucks and I would get 10 customers from this one person now that was obviously on the sale not on them making the introductions that was the big
(12:46) difference between the the first two and this one is I would say it was only after the fact after the sale that they'd be able to get the 100 bucks but that slayed for me I've tactically executed this two different ways in my career way number one is that underneath of my contract I had all the names of the referrals always listed out there and that would remind me and my sales guys to ask for that referral and also know that that person would be attributed back to that customer remember I came from you know analog
(13:12) brick-and mortar I printed out contracts okay the second way is to just do the digital way which is hey introduce me right now with your friend which I'll show you the real tactic on that uh in one of the one of the future ones because it's really good which leads me to number five which is referral at success and so the moment that someone has some big thing you just finished painting their house or you put their garage door in or you train their dog or you help them lose weight there's a moment of transformation that you have
(13:35) and a lot of times that's where you capture testimonials now for sure capture the testimonial but right afterwards they're amped they're feeling good they love your service they just experienced it when you say hey you're amazing how many other amazing people like you do you know and usually they're like I don't know and then they start giggling whatever and you're like awesome can we take a picture together to commemorate the moment and then they say yes it's like let me give your phone so you take their phone you do a selfie
(14:00) and say hey let's take this picture who do you know that we can send this to that we can invite them in so we can do this with them and by making that ask and you do it from their phone you text yourself through their phone with the picture of you the outcome and them so if it's you and the dog or you and the garage or just you and them skinny right you text them and say hey this is Sandra you should meet Alex and I used to joke around and like be like Alex is the coolest guy of all time he's he's the most amazing man you should to CU like
(14:27) they knew that I was texting as them um and they would get a laugh out of it and so mind you this is where you have to have rapport with a customer if you don't have Rapport then this isn't going to work but for me this is why having it at the success moment it's like you've literally demonstrated the result in front of you to someone they know and then that person is making the introduction being like dude you've got to check this place out it's awesome they have the best crepes or they have the they totally fixed my garage and you
(14:50) said you were you were looking at at fixing it look how nice mine looks whatever it is and that worked amazingly well to get referrals at the point of success and so you'll notice the through line here is that it each of these moments if someone ask for a discount boom you can get a referral if you want to get a referral you can add in a bonus uh or you can flip the discount into a bonus you can just ask them uh on a regular basis hey how do you want to know how to get this for free which slay for me you can do the version here we're
(15:15) at the point of success you take the picture and you do the three-way introduction all these versions work obscenely well no matter how big your business is to get more customers in the door let's get the next one if you're watching on YouTube tell me which of the seven you're actually going to do not what you think would be cool or what you thought was neat which one can you do and Implement in the next 30 days number six the next one is a handwritten card strategy so here's how it works you pair handwritten cards with in-person events
(15:39) or virtual events but it works especially well for in-person events and so if you have a member appreciation event or some sort of Workshop or something that you're going to be holding on a quarterly basis or whatever Cadence you have on I'd recommend doing this at least quarterly if you have especially a local business and so you invite the customers in and it doesn't have to be high budget it's just supposed to have some fun have some food it can be a pot lock whatever and so you invite all the customers uh there and
(16:03) the way you do that is you write a handwritten card thanking them for their patronage and saying this is your invitation you're cordially invited to the quarterly or semiannual uh you know painters R R Us event whatever right and so you invite them to this event for you to appreciate them now you say PS This is key PS on the letter you say if you take a screen screen if you take a picture of this letter and you text it to a friend of yours they can use that to get into the event they can have all the food and all the drink they want and
(16:29) they can come with you and if you want just so that I know them before they come in the door just do a three-way text with me and you can send that invite like you sending it to them and by doing that you can collect a bunch of leads and you say hey it's also all people are welcome and so they can then bring other people with them to your event and when we would do this you get 30 to 50% of the room would be people who were friends and plus ones of the people who are coming to the event and then at the event all day long think
(16:54) about this all the people were there love you enough to show up to your event and so they're all talking about how awesome you are whatever the thing is and you're providing stuff to them you're giving them food you're giving them drinks you're ging entertainment you're walking around you're kissing baby shaking hands and so you seem like mayor of the town so you get great positioning and then all you do is as you go one-on-one you say hey let's talk on Monday hey let's get a time set up blah blah blah blah and all you do is
(17:13) you set a shitload of appointments don't sell there just set follow-up appointments so that it's fun it keeps it chill and that way you can collect a ton of leads and after they've met you once in person they're not going to ghost you on the next thing and the likelihood they buy because their friendss already there they already literally consume something from you the reciprocity laws that it's highest amount and so they're really likely to buy so uh two quick tactical things that I learned the hard way uh don't book
(17:35) these too far out like if someone's like hey I can do it two Eastern I'm like girl you're here right now I was like get in on Monday I was like let's coaching starts now let's go you know what I mean like I would like I always try to have that kind of like playful Rapport so I can get people in faster because obviously Interest wains really quickly and so you have a very small period of time where motivation is super high and so we want to capitalize on that moment and after the event happens and I've already booked them I treat
(17:57) them like a normal lead so I'm going to still work them send reminders all the normal stuff you do number seven is the spouse request so this is a good one so if you have a service that a spouse can do with them so that could be like wine and paint night that could be like I said weight loss that could be therapy that could be anything that somebody could do you ask them so basically it proact the obstacle so you get to be aggressive on it and say hey does your husband support you in this hey do you think this would help your husband out
(18:26) and or your wife out whatever and by doing that you say hey we have an amazing uh spouse program and we've actually seen that people who do it with their spouse and this is this is the key part of it is you want to have some sort of stat that's associated with it that shows that oh people who do with their spouse are three times more successful and by doing that then it's like well you want to be more successful and so I would strongly like I don't use the word mandatory and I would even say this in the scripting I never say the word
(18:50) mandatory but unless your spouse has a reason like they their foot fell off or they're you know about to go to the hospital they're crazy if unless it's one of those reasons they should come with you because I think it's going to it's going to it will be far more long- lasting whatever the transformation is it'll be far more effective whatever our our intervention is and you're going to have a much better experience and you'll have support here and at home which makes it way more likely that you'll win and the last one is a bonus one which is
(19:16) a friend of mine runs massive massive online challenges so this isn't just brick and mortar or just service businesses like it works for any business and you just have to think how can I make this work for my business not it won't work for my business because I promise you that is The Voice of the loser like beating you into losers ship okay literally just in all messaging he had all he did for an entire campaign was simply remind people in every piece of content in every piece of messaging in every ad and every post that he did
(19:44) throughout the entire campaign was he just said hey be sure to bring a friend it's far more likely that you'll succeed you're going to love this if you do this together and he just said it every time and at the end of his campaign and he's getting million plus customers when he runs these campaigns so massive massive massive scale 25 to 30% of the customers that came in from the campaign were from Word of Mouth were from unattributed sources and when he didn't do this it was almost nothing and so he attributed
(20:11) that big jump to making sure that he wo in the bring a friend that bring someone else that you're going to be more successful that you'd have more support you'll get faster results if you do it together and so I would encourage you obviously these tactics that I just outlined give you when someone asks for a discount how to do it if it's the holidays you use the gift card if someone has a great success that's the moment if you want to get an event you use it to use as a referral event all of these tools are things that you can use
(20:38) at specific moments but the big overarching one is that if you know that you can generate about 30% of your leads and this is just what I've seen across our businesses by implementing these strategies you get 30% more customers by just asking and actually weaving this in and not being lazy about it it's an obscenely easy way to get customers that are free pay more more stay longer and refer you more customers everybody want to get customers but ain't nobody want to ask for referrals

Business Owners: You NEED to Know This Number - YouTube

Transcript:
(00:00) I want to talk to you about a formula better stated a ratio that you need to absolutely know like the back of your hand if you want to grow a big ass business and if you understand this number you'll be able to make better decisions you'll be able to predict how far you can scale your advertising how profitable you're going to be how many customers you can get and a number of other factors that are all derived from this one number in the business I cracked $100 million net worth at age 31 all of the huge growth in money came
(00:28) from times when this number was maximized and most businesses kind of putter along at a mediocre version of this number but when you really knock it out of the park you can absolutely have a license to print money for as long as you possibly can and at the very end I'm going to tell you the two levers you can crank to move this number into the stratosphere so what is the number well the number is actually a ratio between two different numbers and these numbers have multiple metrics that create those numbers so it's an incredibly densely
(00:56) packed number and it describes so many things that happen within the business and it will tell you how much opportunity you have which is why it's so exciting for me the first number of this ratio is LTV so lifetime value now in common speak people say lifetime value but what they really mean is Lifetime gross profit and so let me explain the difference most people say lifetime value and they think okay well somebody pays me $1,000 a month for five months that means their lifetime value is $5,000 no that's not the lifetime
(01:21) value you have to take out the cost of delivering on whatever service or good you have and then you have the lifetime gross profit because that is the profit that you'll be able to reinvest in growing the business or that you'll be able to take out as a business owner on the other hand you have hard costs which is the CAC to get that customer to pay you the money and so if you think about relationship between these two metrics it's really how much it costs you to make more money and so you spend money to acquire a customer or time which
(01:47) still costs money to make more money and this is the fundamental economic unit of the business that propels the business and predicts how big it can get if I see a small business at at 100 to1 LTV toac ratio and they a reliable way of getting customers then I know that this thing's get scale to the absolute Moon because I can get so inefficient I can be on Tenth is efficient on my advertising and still have 10 to1 Returns and so people get obsessed in the stock market about 5% 10% per year returns whereas the reason
(02:15) that businesses can create disproportionate wealth in very accelerated time periods is because you can put $1 in and get $100 back tomorrow there's nothing else that does this and that's why mastering the LTV toac ratio has been something that I've obsessed with my entire life as as a business owner as an entrepreneur and now as an investor so let me tell you what it looks like when it's done wrong so I had a Facebook ads agency come up to me and say hey we're crushing it we're getting five to one return on our ads meaning
(02:40) cost us $1 to make five and so it costs us $2,000 to get a customer and they're worth $10,000 to us and they're like but we're losing money every month rather than jump immediately into payroll and try to figure out what the costs are I said well break down your LTV metrics forming and again I'll use LTV because that's what common speak is in business world I say lifetime gross profit because I think it's more specific so break down your LT lgp for me and he said okay it's $2,000 a month for our service and the average person's day is
(03:06) 5 months and I was like okay in other words they had 20% churn so you take the price divide it by churn which is 20% equals $10,000 so there two different ways of explaining it five months on average is $2,000 Time 5 is 10 or $2,000 divided by 20% turn is also 10 you have to know this stuff I know people don't like money math but I swear to God if you can't do this division you will literally never make money okay back to it from the $2,000 a month I was like so what do they pay an ad spend he like oh no we wrap it into that I was like okay
(03:36) here we go what are you spending per month for them in ad spend they're like well we we budget $1,000 a month I was like okay so $2,000 becomes $1,000 left over I was like okay do you have a super efficient delivery model and they're like yeah every account gets you know a a a representative I was like okay well how many accounts can a representative handle they're like well we used to do 10 but they can't really handle that so we have them do five accounts I was like okay well what do you pay those reps and
(04:00) they're like well $5,000 a month each and I was like okay $5,000 a month each divided by five accounts means $11,000 per account so $1,000 went to ad spend $11,000 went to management 0 left over and I was like so what you guys have figured out is a way to take $2,000 and turn it into zero and they looked at me like I had you know killed their mother uh but the point is this is an extreme example but a lot of businesses have this situation where they have have a cost of goods they have some cost of service that's
(04:32) that's added on top and they take it as though it's Revenue when it's really you have to look at the gross profit what's left over after you deliver the goods now to be clear there are fixed costs in a business meaning you've got rent you've got some people that have nothing to do with delivery you don't Factor those into gross profit because if you sell an additional unit that additional unit that additional gross profit goes to you that you can either reinvest in the business or just pocket as a business owner which who doesn't like
(04:56) that and so fundamentally this is LTB this is how much money you make from the customer for real not your wink wink stripe screenshot and if you're a business owner and you like learning this language of business and want to understand more deeply the many other metrics that exist in the business to that you can pull on The Leverage that accelerate the value you have we just started a workshop div Vision at acquisition.
(05:17) comom for companies that we don't own if you want to see if you qualify you can fly out to Vegas we spend a whole day with the company and our our teams there and we show you all the things that we would do if we bought your business tomorrow to grow it so if that sounds interesting you can go to acquisition.
(05:30) comom hit the scale button and if you qualify our team will reach out the CAC is actually very simple to understand it's just how much it cost you to get the customer and all you have to do here is just look historically you say okay over the last 30 days I spent this much on my marketing payroll I spent this much on my media the advertising dollars I spent and I spent this much on my sales team in commissions you add all that up and then you divide that by how many customers you got so if you spent $10,000 in ads and you spent $10,000 in payroll between
(05:55) sales and marketing your cost is 20,000 and if you had 20 customers then it'd be a th000 bucks a customer that would be your CAC and so then you look at that CAC which now is very clear a lot of people can understand their CAC quickly where they get messed up as their LTB but once you have these two metrics you can understand the fundamental economic unit of the business which is when I put $1 in here I get this much juice on the back end back to me so let me talk about what it looks like when it's done right
(06:18) and this is where you start printing money so I'm going to give you an extreme example that some of you guys may or may not have heard of so there's this little company called Starbucks that has little coffee business you might have heard of them they got 38,000 locations you want to know how were able to grow to that scale without franchising to grow now they do have a tiny little bit of franchising but the vast vast vast majority of the stores are corporate owned and so something that has cost that much Capital opening
(06:43) up you got all these new stores you got these build outs you got marketing budgets for these local locations how are they able to do that and do it privately they made a lot of money every time they put a dollar into their economic machine so let me tell you how much money they make every customer that comes into Starbucks the lifetime value how much money they make from a customer is $4,99 and that is gotten $5 macchiato at a time $6 frappuccinos at a time and that means that they keep customers for years and years and years and years it
(07:17) turns out that when you boil hot water and you sell for six bucks you make a lot of money and one of the crazy things about a business like Starbucks is that the cost you acquire customer for a local food business is typically very small now I don't know their CAC and I probably could look into their public data and try figure out how many customers they have but I'll tell you that I had a personal experience marketing for a Cookie Company years ago I ran ads locally for them to have a free cookie with a beverage the average
(07:41) lead cost was under a dollar and we got one out of 10 leads in the door and so it cost us 10 bucks to get somebody in the door if you have a $14,000 lifetime value and it costs you $10 to get somebody to walk in the door you make a lot of money and so that wasn't a 5 to1 a 10:1 even a 100 to1 return that was a 14 100 to one return and that is how you build something that is absolutely massive so once you get into business whether you're at a million or 3 million or 10 million whatever it is a year that you're at you start to run into this
(08:10) wall becomes more costly to get customers because you're reaching out to colder and colder audiences you're going to new channels to find them and it just simply costs you more and so the only way to continue to scale obviously you can make your ads better you can make your offers better but the other way to scale is to be able to afford to Simply acquire customers for more expensive and so let's say that Starbucks cost car customer went from $10 to $50 well boohoo still really really good the point is is that if you have a massive
(08:37) LTV toac ratio your cat can double or triple and you're still printing money and so that allows you to enter new marketing channels New Media channels colder audiences and outspend your competition and so this is in some ways an ethical competitive mode there's two ways to have a monopoly one way is that you have a way to under cut everybody in the marketplace so they can't survive and then eventually put everyone out of business because you have enough Capital to do so another way of having a monopoly that is legal is that you can
(09:09) literally just outspend people to get customers and so most advertising marketplaces are based on an auction so they auction for attention and the highest bidder is the one who wins the eyeball they win the click and so if you in the purchase of the eyeball or of the click you can outspend 100% of your competition then you can ethically take all of their money and all of their customers the reason this is so important as a business owner is that if you don't know these metrics you might be able to get to a million two million
(09:35) maybe $3 million a year but you're not going to be able to scale be on that because you're not going to have a consistent way to spend money on the front end and then know how much you're recouping and at what time and so I had a business owner who actually was a business coach ironically uh who was doing three million bucks a year and I said well what's your LTV to C creation he's like I don't know and I was like how are you doing this right and I say this with love it just said know your data so that you can scale your company
(09:58) I just kept repeating he just kept asking me questions I was like you have to know your data so that you can scale your company that's it and these two data points are so simple to get and yet so few businesses do it and this is not a testament to the fact that you can see see despite it it's a testament to the fact that that's why so few businesses make money I mean shoot only one out of every 250 businesses gets to $10 million a year and getting to $10 million a year you just have to follow fundamental business and know that I make $10 for
(10:27) every $1 put in I want to run this machine as many times as I can can so let me break down a couple of these comp sets for you so you've got the lcgp and you've got CAC all right cac's the easy one just whatever your cost is on a monthly basis divided by number of customers you can look at this on a monthly basis you can look at a weekly basis and if you really want an accurate metric look at over a year just say how much did I spend over this entire year in payroll for marketing total in ad spend total whatever and you divide it
(10:51) by number of customers it's back of napkin but honestly that takes out a lot of the volatility of campaigns good sales guys or bad sales days whatever and it gives you a number it's realistic this is actually how much it costs me to get a customer now on the lifetime gross profit side there's a few more numbers so you have your price most people know what that is and then you have to subtract that your cost of goods sold all right now in a physical product business if I'm selling books let's say it cost me $10 to print and Chip a book
(11:15) if I sell the book for $20 then my gross profit is 10 bucks most people in the physical product space tend to get this pretty quickly what's interesting is that the service based guys don't get it at all and so for some reason they think okay well I have you know Five Guys on payroll that do all of my delivery all of the customers I get is just all profit it's like no you have to take out the fact that you've got five guys on payroll and you've got 20 customers and you take that payroll and you divide it by 20 and that's what your cost of
(11:41) delivery is which means that the cost of deliver may change as you get more customers but you can model out what it looks like at scale so if you know that every five you need to hire another guy then you either going each guy is's going to max out at this and you know that that's going to be your fixed amount of cost to deliver your service and so the service guys tend to get this more mixed up than the physical product once now once we know what our gross profit is which is just the price minus that cost then it says how many times do
(12:05) I get this and so that's a function of either the number of purchases they make or the number of months they stay the number of months they stay you can take the inverse of that which is what percentage of people leave and you can divide that and you can get it as a hypothetical metric and so I'll give you an example a lot of business owners who are younger or starting out are like okay well I've only been in business for six months and so I don't know what my LTV is because people are still coming in and we're still growing you can
(12:28) actually still get a hypothe I on this which is you just simply say I had 10 customers last month of the 10 that I started the month with 30 days later how many of those 10 are still with me if nine are with you then you have 10% churn and so you divide your price by 10% and that gives you your LTV which is the same as multiplying by 10 which means the average duration they stay is 10 months and that's why they call it lifetime gross profit and so once you understand this this gives you an enormous amount of power to do a number
(12:55) of things so number one is I had a business the other day that came to me and was saying hey I have two front ends for my business I it was a hair salon uh girl and so she was able to teach other hair stylists how to make extensions I think she was charging $2,000 or something like that to teach them how to do extensions and then she also had like a business coaching thing where she helped them grow their business and she said I just you know I'm running ads for both of them I don't know how I should structure my business and I was like
(13:20) okay well what's the LTV to cek she had done her homework and so she said well this one we make 34 to1 meaning her cost to get somebody who wanted to learn how to get hert exensions or how to put hair extensions in it cost her like 30 or 40 bucks whatever the math is there on a $2,000 sale and so she had a $2,000 sale and so she was getting 30 to1 on that and so it cost her 67 bucks to get a customer who's going to pay her $22,000 for a digital product so the rest of that's gross margin wow what a great LTV
(13:49) to CAC right on the flip side she had her business coaching thing which she had something close to like 7 to one and so that thing was $115,000 and it cost her whatever it was $2,000 to get the sale and so she's like well I like these customers a lot but there you know there's fewer of them uh and they cost more to acquire and she says so what should I do because these obviously stack up fast you know you get 10 sales 150 Grand in a month it's not bad right and she's like I got to sell so many more of these and so I asked her these
(14:15) questions I said well are there more of these people that just want the hair thing than these people and she said yes I said is there a percentage of these people that also buy this thing and she saides said great and so what we need to do is you stop advertising this and then you make this the front end for this and this becomes the back end and so then all of your focus after you acquire the customer is to ascend these people into this thing which means your cost to customer here becomes zero and then we can tack on 20% of this price to the
(14:47) total LTV here and so this is how you start stacking LTV the point is is let's say she got 20% of people to do the $115,000 thing so that means that that $2,000 becomes a $5,000 LV so let me break that down so $2,000 guaranteed because every person who buys gets that now we multiply 20% the number of them that buys the $15,000 thing which is 20% time 15,000 $3,000 and you add that to the front end so means one out of five pays an extra 15 great so that means on average make $5,000 so that took her LTV to CAC from 30 to1 to 75 to1 that means
(15:22) that she can Market even more aggressively and she can mark it to the biggest H many of you have one or two or three different products or offer on the front end and you're trying to figure out what's the thing I should advertise look at the LTV to CAC and then start with the thing that has the best LTV toac ratio and then stack behind it everything else and then that further increases your ratio of how much you can spend to get the customer to make more money so many business owners ask me questions that they can solve with math
(15:49) like this is an opinion thing this isn't like well I talked to three mentors and one guy gave me this advice and like this is a math problem which is why you have to learn it and so if you have a stronger LTV to CAC the exception here is if the Tam is Tiny your total addressable Market the number of heads that you can sell but most of you who are listening to this aren't even close to saturating your Market you're like I've sold 100 customers and my market is 1 million people okay you don't need to worry about saturation yet and so
(16:15) fundamentally if you've got something that has an ocean of customers and you have a crazy amount of what you put in versus what you get out you do as much of that as you possibly can and then you stack the other things behind it to further increase your leverage the last consideration that I'll bring up which is already factored into LTV is the operational efficiency so let me explain I had a business that we were looking at acquiring it was a chain of glass repair all right and they specifically focused on glass work for residential and so
(16:43) they had a number of different customers that they worked with they had high-end you know Million Dollar Plus Homes that would have those big glass you know things and weird bathrooms and whatever people do with glass one of the partners from that business peeled off and started a chain only doing one thing in the entire product stack and so what he did was he did his homework he figured out that shower doors were a product that was very easy to sell people many people wanted it there was a huge market for people who just wanted to replace
(17:09) their shower doors and the delivery so the cost of goods sold to deliver the door was actually very low and so one guy could do five 10 doors a day whereas doing the custom glass work might take months so even though the ticket was higher they could productize that service to such a higher degree and the LTV to CAC was actually higher even though the average ticket was lower and so because of that though he could turn this into a machine that he could repeat again and again and again and I had the same conversation with somebody who was
(17:34) in the pool design business he said well I designed commercial pools I designed Resort pools I designed residential pools and I designed modular pools and I said okay how hard is it to do all these and he's like well they're all kind of hard but these ones the modular pools are the ones that like I could do easily because it's only like six or seven variables and you just kind of plug them together and I was like okay how is the margin on that he's like well the margin's good there and I also have a much faster cycle because you can from
(17:57) the time they say yes to the time it's in their backyard is really fast and I was like okay are there more people who can buy modular pools than Resort pools and he was like yeah okay now we're starting to talk about something that looks interesting and so he was like what do I do and I was like well this is a math problem you have something that has a higher LTV to CAC you have a higher Tam and it's something and this is just side benefit it's faster so you have a way faster Loop and you can productize this to much a higher degree
(18:21) whereas all of this stuff is custom and oneoff stuff which makes it very very difficult to scale many of you have a big Resort thing and a modular po many of you guys have custom glass work in the house or a shower door you want to find the shower door in your business that everyone immediately understands they can come in that's really cheap many people want it you can deliver that value quickly now some of you are like well I'm not passionate about shower doors the question is what game you want to play listen there's tons of people
(18:46) that are out there that say like Follow Your Passion whatever in my opinion so this might be contrary business at the highest level is all the same so if you succeed at your passion to a high enough degree your business and what your day-to-day will look like will almost irely be the same you're going to be having a team of people who report to you you're going to have a head of sales you're going to have a marketing you're going to have a legal you're going to have it you're going to have Finance you're have some Ops maybe some tech
(19:09) whatever all those people are just going to roll into you and so whether you're selling books or you're selling pools or you're selling shower doors you're selling marketing agency Services if you succeed taking to its natural end you're going to end up in the same boat so I'd recommend starting with the one that has the highest chance likelihood of getting there cuz otherwise what you don't want to have happen is have your passion turn into work so it many of you guys don't know is that the first year of gym
(19:31) launch my LTV toac ratio was 100 to1 I spent $100,000 and made $10 million back and yes it was that insane for me too A lot of the wealth that I've been made is made in these punctuated periods of time when my LTV to CAC Racers were absolutely absurd and so when you have one of those things and if you do crack this code I highly recommend Jam as much as you possibly can through that through that machine you think it's going to be illegal because you're making so much money and that's okay it's normal just keep pushing as hard as you can let's
(20:02) talk about how to improve it so I talked briefly about the LTV stuff which for the most part is going to be decreasing turn increasing price those are the things that are going to increase LTV and having additional cross selles and upsells I'll just give you the Highlight Reel of how to improve that you can increase the price you can decrease the cost of delivery you can get people to buy more times you can cross- sell them additional things so that's like if you buy a burger you buy fries you can upsell them a better version of the
(20:28) thing so instead of this burger you get a sirloin or wagy Burger you can sell a higher quantity of that one Burger to two burgers you can down sell them turning a no sale into a sale so they would have been a zero instead of you get a junior Whopper you get a smaller burger or you go from a sirloin burger to a mystery meat burger right and so that's the down sell that gives you more better smaller worse cross sell different more number of options that you sell increase the price decrease the cost of goods and you can do that with
(21:01) any product you have if I sell iPhone cases I can increase the price of this case I can become more efficient with the manufacturing to decrease the cost of my delivery to make this case I can cross sell a wallet that tax onto this I can increase the likely they buy another case in 6 months by trying to say hey do you want to have different color cases so you can do them by mood I can increase the number of cases saying hey do you want a spare case I can increase the quality of the cas and say this is a metal case versus a you know plastic
(21:32) case I can make this a cheaper case or I could do in terms of uh the quality of the material or I could sell fewer units if I had that case every product that exists on the marketplace you can find a better version a more version a cheaper version a fewer version a cross- sold version you decrease the cost of goods you get them to buy more of them or you increase the price those are the ways that you increase LTV and so if you want to improve your ratio that's your homework for this video and you can show this video to your team and you have to
(21:58) check off those boxes okay if we did have our book How do we make this book make us more money well I can raise the price of the book I can try and buy volume of printing so that I can drive down the cost I can spread out the books between three different warehouses so that I can have cheaper shipping prices because it's closer to my customers those would be the first two price and then cost of goods I can cross- sell an additional book I can try to get somebody to buy more of this book can't really get someone to buy less of this
(22:26) book I could have a book lit or a summary version of of the book that I could choose to sell that would give me a worse or inferior version of the book in terms of decreasing quality if I sold a number of units instead of selling a three-pack I'd down sell a one pack and so each of these you can look at any product through these lenses and think is through each of those which of these is the easiest for us to immediately Implement within our business that doesn't create operational drag me writing a second book probably a lot of
(22:51) work me asking people to buy a second book much less work now let's talk about decreasing the other side CU remember this is a ratio right and so you can not change anything about your LTV and still massively improve the ratio by decreasing CAC your cost to acquire customer and so what do you do here so CAC is a funnel right and so in order to decrease CAC it's about efficiency and so advertising always works you always Reach people when you input something into the system if you make a post You Reach people if you were to spend a
(23:18) billion dollars you could reach everyone on earth right the idea is simply how efficient are you with that dollar and so with CAC everything is a percentage off of 100% so you start with an advertisement reaches 100% of people and then a small percentage of those people click or take the first step from there you have a percentage of people that schedule certain percentage people that show certain percentage that buy certain percentage that then upsell whatever and so as you go through this funnel to decrease CAC you either have to get
(23:48) cheaper eyeballs the raw unit that you're taking this price tag off of or you improve the efficiency after you've paid for the eyeball to increase the likely that the person Buys in cro just like so conversion optimization just like LTV often times there isn't a silver bullet i' would say the only thing that's the closest thing to a silver bullet in the CAC world is nailing your offer nailing what thing you're going to package together that you can put out the marketplace that everybody wants I'll give you an
(24:14) interesting monitor concept around this is that I build LTV back to front meaning I want to think about the most expensive thing and work my way backwards so that I can stack as much lifetime gross profit into my customers as I can I think about CAC front to back the reason for that is that I want to optimize the things in the earlier parts of the funnel because they affect a higher percentage of people you often working with smaller percentages at the onset and bigger percentages later and so I'll walk you through an example so
(24:38) if your ad gets shown to call it 10,000 people and you have a 1% clickthrough rate well me having a better ad might get a 3% click-through rate there's almost nothing that's going to take my show rate well there is nothing that's going to take my show rate from 60% to 180% there's nothing that's going to take my close rate from 35% to 105% like it's not going to happen I like going front to back because in terms of order of magnitude of how much I can impact or grow the business or rather decrease the cost to acquire customer I can have a
(25:10) greater impact from the front to the back I'll make one one tiny Pro tip on this which is that I in general work front to back for CAC if I have a clear outlier if I have a 5% show up rate but everything else is amazing and I know the industry average is 60% well then I do see that I have a 12x there that I can go get it's it's just not often and so most of the time the biggest gains are going to come from Improvement in advertising improving the offer improving the headline and the availability of the team if you have a
(25:38) sales team or if you have an e-commerce business then it's going to be cro on the page the offer you're making on the page the headline on the page and the quality of the advertisements themselves and so whenever I enter any industry and to be fair at this point I've seen so many businesses because we get so much deal flow at acquisition.
(25:52) comom I have a really good pulse for what it cost to get a small business owner for an SEO agency I have a pretty good pulse for what it costs to get somebody to buy a $99 a month uh software package I have a pretty good idea of what it costs to sell someone into a uh you know a franchise right there's there's very different benchmarks that exist but the good thing is it's very rare that you have truly novel businesses because more often you're selling to an existing Avatar so even if you have a novel business you're still selling the same
(26:19) person so it's going to cost you about the same amount of money to get in front of those people and then convert them into a customer now the variable will be what that person's worth to you which is the LTV but calcul is much less variable between different players and so the reason that some businesses stay around forever and others don't is that the ca between the biggest businesses is often times about the same the difference is how much LTV they've been able to stack and that is what creates that long-term
(26:44) competitive Advantage for them and if this was a denser video this was literally just unpacking one ratio inside of business and you have to get fluent with this I'd encourage you to re-watch it or relisten to this if you're listening to it you have to be able to breathe this stuff this has to be your first first language if you want to get in business this is the language of business your ability to conceptualize ideas is directly proportional to your vocabulary within a given domain I create Frameworks that
(27:10) people find simple because I'm fluent in the language and I can draw pictures about it because I've had to think through it so many different times and so many different types of business I could draw it what is the difference between selling a book and selling an iPhone and selling SEO services and selling a franchise can you apply LTV to back to investing interesting what's the cost to buy a company what do you make on that company over the lifetime interesting it's just chunked up at another level where the product and the customer
(27:41) itself is really the business so this principle applies at all levels of business the more you EMB brain it into your DNA and your Lexicon and the language that you think with rather than just what you speak with but what you think with understanding that this is the ratio that drives the business means that you're going to Lad up the initiatives and the activities that you do in the business to drive one of these two sides if what you're doing is not getting you more customers cheaper or making those customers worth more then
(28:06) you are probably wasting your time this LTV CAC ratio is just one of many numbers that we use to analyze and grow a business and I have a YouTube video that's more in- depth more advanced stuff if you're a business owner and you want to grow your business faster comment below or have one of your teammates comment below which one of the eight ways that I just talked about you can Implement in your business tomorrow

(00:00) you're not making as much as you want because you probably have sucky customers. In this video, I'm going to break down what that really means, why it matters, and why it's probably holding you back. And then finally, what to do about it in terms of how to actually make the transition. So, let's talk about what this even means big picture.
(00:18) I regularly talk to agency owners, for example, who are selling to small business owners $1,500 a month of social media ads, social media marketing. And what's really interesting about this type of business is that they quickly plateau at maybe a million dollars a year, sometimes $3 million a year, and they come and they're like, "What do I need to do to scale?" And the issue is it's not about what they need to do to scale, but rather who they need to sell to in order to scale.
(00:44) But the reason this is so difficult to transition away from, it's why it's one of the seven deadly sins of business, is that when you have the wrong avatar, the volatility of your business is based on the volatility of your customers. For most small business owners, a $1,500 per month or $2,000 per month or $2,500 per month recurring cost is usually too high for them because as soon as they have a bad month, they immediately cancel marketing, which of course is ridiculous because if you're trying to grow, the last thing you want to do is cancel
(01:11) marketing. But there's a reason they are small business owners. It's because they make small business owner mistakes. The thing is, if you try to build a big business off of small businesses, it's basically having a terrible foundation. It's building a castle on a foundation of sand.
(01:26) As soon as the tide comes out and pulls the sand away, so too goes the castle. When I talk to these types of businesses, whether it's an agency or whatever, the point is that they ultimately have to switch who they sell to so that they can sell to less volatile customers. And one of the easiest limit tests to think about this for whatever industry you're in is to think about what is the ultimate version of this business look like? Are the people who have the biggest agencies in the world, for example, are they selling to small business owners? The answer is
(01:54) no. Think about it. The biggest agencies in the world, Oglev and Mathers, you got Vayner Media, you got NP Digital, some of the big, you know, multiple hundred million dollar per year agencies that exist out there, those businesses almost exclusively sell to Fortune 100, Fortune 500, sometimes mid-market businesses.
(02:10) Because anybody who sells to really small businesses ultimately realizes, man, these guys need way more help than just getting leads. They don't know how to work leads. They don't know how to sell. They don't know how to price. And then all of a sudden, you have to start building their business for them.
(02:22) But the problem is that you need to build your business right now and you're building it on the wrong customer base. The reason this is one of the seven deadly sins is that there's usually an apparent conflict. Meaning, you can't just immediately switch because what happens is, oh my god, if I switch, then I'm going to stop selling customer.
(02:36) If I stop selling customers, stop making money. If I stop making money, I'm going to lose my business. But I also need to switch who I'm selling to or I'm never going to grow. You're in a rock in a hard place, which is why the seven deadly sins of business are so hard to break through or break free of. The main meat of this is that you have misalignment between your maximum potential product or service value and customers ability to realize and pay for that value.
(02:58) You can ultimately provide more value to a different customer than you can to a bad customer. But as a result of only selling to bad customers, you have to translate that into a lower quality or lower price service. becomes this very vicious cycle of you wanting to lower your price and then not being able to deliver as much service but they need more service but they can't afford more service and around and around you go.
(03:20) Everything that I'm describing right now actually falls under a term that happens in business which is called structural churn. Structural churn is the percentage of customers that leave every month not because they hate you but because of something else that happens that's core to their business. So, I remember I had a friend of mine who had a CRM in the gym space.
(03:43) And I asked him, I said, "Oh, I imagine that you're, you know, you probably keep 90 100% of customers every single year because you're a CRM? Like, no one's going to try and leave that." He said, "No, you'd actually be pretty surprised." And I was like, "Okay, well, what's churn?" And he said, "Three%.
(03:54) " I was like, "Oh, per year? That's not bad." He's like, "No, per month." I was like, "3% a month?" And he said, "Yeah, the biggest reason is that gyms just go out of business." And I was like, "Oh, so what do you do when 30% of all the customers you have go out of business every year? What do you do? like is there anything you can do to change that level of turn? The answer is no. They go out of business.
(04:11) There's nothing you can do. That is structural term. Your business at best in the hypothetical maximum case scenario when you're selling to small businesses in that example could only get to at best 70% of customers retained year-over-year. Now, is there a version of this business that sells to a better version of the customer? Yes, of course there is. Which is step two.
(04:30) Now, if you're being an enterprising mofo and listening to this and thinking, well, there definitely are big businesses that smell to sell to small customers. There are, but they're typically not hight touch service businesses, which what the vast majority of people do. It's very much like a barbell for most businesses.
(04:45) On one extreme, you have custom, and custom should only be sold to high-end customers. These are people who can afford it, who have good businesses, who are good for their word. when they say they're going to pay for 12 months, they actually pay for 12 months because they have assets and they know what they're doing.
(05:01) On the other extreme, you have your very small businesses. You have VSMBBS and SMBs. So, small business owners and very small business owner or proumers, if you will. When you have these types of customers, what do you do? You certainly don't offer custom. You offer templated solutions. You offer DIY solutions. You offer things that they can go at their own pace because fundamentally they cannot afford the amount of help that they need.
(05:24) That's why a lot of businesses fail and that's also not your responsibility. It is your responsibility to make your business succeed. Making sure that we're picking the right customer to maximize the likelihood of success is part of strategy. The middle is certainly where people go to die. This is where they go kind of mid-pric and they sell to small customers.
(05:45) And the reality is this is that these small customers, you can sell on mid-pric. It's not hard to sell them. The issue is it's hard to keep them. If you are dealing with short customer lifespans, people are staying on average three or four months. You have excessive support, so they're demanding a ton from you.
(06:01) They have other requirements besides your core service that they came in on. They have price resistance and they constantly are trying to ask for discounts or like, "Hey, can I take off this month or can I have half price this month? This is a tough month for me. Can you extend the terms of payment?" Any of those types of things.
(06:15) Number four, if they are dissatisfied despite you going above and beyond kind of a reasonable level of service based on the expectations that you set. Now, if you set crazy expectations, then you got to deliver like crazy. But if you set appropriate expectations and they still are to satisfy despite you going above and beyond, that's a red flag.
(06:32) The fifth red flag is overpromising just to get people to buy. This is why this is a vicious cycle where they're like, "You have to be able to build my whole business for me and maybe I'll pay you $1,000." It's just ridiculous. Only an experienced business owner is going to know. Of course, they're not going to do that. I'm an experienced business owner.
(06:45) They're going to go run their business. I'm going to run my business. But a small business owner just thinks that because this thousands means a ton to them. It should mean a ton to you. There's a disparity there between their expectations and sometimes it doesn't even matter what you say just because the amount of money means so much to them that you will ultimately have a dissatisfied customer no matter what because to them that $1,000 might be 50% of the cash they have.
(07:08) If someone said, "Hey, I will help you for 50% of the cash you Imagine the expectation that person might have. Probably a lot, no matter what you say. And then finally, number six is that selling people you know will suck. This is the red flag. And you do that just to deliver and ultimately pay the bills. It's a bad way to sell.
(07:28) To recap on paper, what we just went over was the what. All right, these are all kind of the symptoms and the flags that happen when you're selling to the wrong customer. So, we've gone over the what, like what is this problem? So the second is going to be why it matters. So there's three kind of forces in acquisition.
(07:46) You've got LTV, right? Lifetime value per customer. It's basically what's the gross profit you're going to collect off a customer over their lifespan. You've got CAC, which is how much it costs you to make that amount of money, what you got to spend to get it. And then this happens within the context of payback period, which is how quickly can you recover the cash that you spent before you can make that money.
(08:05) Because this is going to ultimately be the cash flow constraint of the business. As much as these are the two things that matter on paper, which is, you know, what does it cost you to make the money that you're going to make, time is obviously a huge component of business, because cash flow happens over a period of time. All three of these things, number one, number two, and number three, payback period, are all negatively impacted when you have the wrong customer.
(08:27) Because from an LTV perspective, you're going to have operational strain. You're going to have to increase your cost basis to deliver for these customers because they cost so much. And on top of that, you're going to have price compression because there's always going to be someone who's willing to serve this customer for cheaper who knows less about business than you.
(08:44) You're always going to have people. They're going to be price comparing you. They're going to say, "Hey, this guy down the street can do it for less." And because they're unsophisticated, they might go to that person even though that person might have terrible delivery. And they're just going to put all of their crazy expectations on this other person.
(08:57) You have costs that go up because they're super demanding. Price pressure on the way down, which leaves very little here. But on top of that, your team morale typically continues to suffer because the team gets burned out from this revolving door of customers where they never feel like they can really make an impact because they feel like all they're doing is onboarding and offboarding, onboarding and offboarding and onboarding at the beginning with people have way too many expectations and offboarding at the end when the
(09:19) people are very upset and all they feel like they are is just lots of customer service, lots of fires. Here's the real real that people don't talk about which is that you also have the opportunity cost here which is what could you achieve with the right customers, right? like what could this look like if you had the best customers which I'll talk about in a second.
(09:37) So we have morale, we have ops that hits in terms of cost and then we have price. But on top of that, this is where it gets even more now. You're like, I thought that was enough reasons to not do it. Let me give you another one is that your reputation is going to suffer because in the beginning you're going to be able to sell customers because you're promising more than anybody else does and you're doing it as a reasonable price.
(09:55) And so you'll have a lot of flock of customers in the beginning. But what's going to happen? One is the first people you're going to sell are people who know you, who might try a little bit harder. But as soon as you get into the mass market based on the results you get for these first customers, all of a sudden these colder customers don't trust you as much.
(10:08) They're far more fickle. And they will then trash your reputation because you didn't save their business because what they're really looking for is a savior. And I promise you, you never want to sell to somebody who wants you to be their savior. Only you can save yourself. And that goes for them, too. What you'll know from a red flag perspective is that your cost to acquire customers will continue to rise disproportionately from the cost of CPMs going up, meaning the cost per thousand eyeballs. If the ad platforms haven't
(10:37) doubled their rates for CPMs, which they typically don't over any kind of period of time, that's like a year or two, and your cost to acquire customers have doubled, then usually you have this invisible hand that's working against you. Many people believe in the power of word of mouth, but some reason people don't believe in the power of word of mouth when it comes to negative.
(10:56) Of course, word of mouth affects you negative. It actually is usually five or 10 times more potent on the negative side because negative news spreads far faster. People tell far more people about their bad experiences than their good ones. If your costs continue to rise in terms of getting customers, your margins continue to compress.
(11:12) It's because of this effect that bad customers have on your business. But wait, there's more. Not only is our LTV suck and it's a miserable existence to have. We have price pressure, operational pressure, team morale sucks, our reputation takes a hit. Cost to acquire customers continue to rise over time.
(11:28) Also, our payback period increases because you're making less per customer on LTV in terms of gross profit and it's costing you more to get them. That means that extends out how long it takes you to recover the cost of getting the customer to get the next one. something called your cash conversion cycle. How quickly you can return the cash to the business so you can continue to expand increases in in duration.
(11:49) Meaning it takes way longer to get that money back and all of a sudden it's even harder to scale which means growth gets limited. Your business stops scaling. So quick recap, we talked about what this problem is and what it looks like. We talked about why it matters and why it's going to impact the actual dollars and cents of the business.
(12:09) So, if you're listening along, you're like, "Okay, I feel like Alex is telling me my life story right now." And if this sounds so familiar to you, I do not say this from a pulpit. I say this as somebody who has been through it and I know these pains so personally because I did it and I made this mistake. So, just please don't do this.
(12:25) But when you are like, "Okay, this is me. The doctor's reading my symptoms. What's the cure? What's the solution?" Well, let's get into it. So if any of this sounded very familiar to you, what I was describing is some of the problems that happen around stage four, which is prioritize. So this is where you first have kind of like your first team.
(12:41) You operate as a manager. Typically, you have maybe five to 10 employees, sometimes contractors who are helping you out. And if you're looking at this, it's like what are the constraints here? It's like you're getting too many unqualified leads. So you have to make better free stuff and more creative to book volume.
(12:54) You have to add qualifications and friction. So the extra volume becomes self- selective, right? This is the whole like we have to say no to people. We have to specialize our product and we have to price to serve this now new niche down avatar. Now, when we say niche down, it could be niched up to be clear.
(13:08) I'm just saying we're being narrower about the customer. But if any of these things sound familiar and you'd like to know, man, I wonder what other problems I'm going to be dealing with in the business. This is from the $und00 million scaling road map, which my team and I spent so many hours putting together because when we looked at businesses as they scale, there's clear problems and clear solutions at every stage of scaling.
(13:26) And so if you want to know what stage you're at and obviously what to do next, you can go acquisition.com/roadmap and you get this whole thing for free. Just enter your business information. You'll spit it out. If you want my team to help you figure out what basically take this and then get really narrow on your industry, where you're at right now in the business, I'd love to invite you out to one of our workshops.
(13:44) We hold them monthly at our headquarters here in Vegas. On the thank you page, you can book a call. We'd love to help you out. It's honestly like it it's very very fulfilling for me. And ultimately, us continuing to deal with businesses is how I continue to make this content interesting because I can see the problems that people are dealing with on a regular basis.
(14:00) So, that being said, get your free thing, book call on the next page, and otherwise, let's enjoy the rest of the video. How to fix it. Okay, the first part about fixing it is realizing why this is so hard to begin with. Emotionally, it's so difficult because you're in this rock in a hard place because you do have bills, you do have payroll, and you probably expanded your team because you learned how to market and sell, but these customers suck.
(14:22) you had to get more and more headcount to support all these customers. But now that you have this headcount, you have to keep selling every single month or you're going to quote lose your business or you're going to have to lay people off, which is going to suck and it's be a hard decision for you. But the other situation is that you stay in this very m miserable land where your margins continue to compress and continue to be volatile over time until eventually there's nothing left in the business and ultimately you've kind of driven yourself out of business. I would
(14:42) encourage you to not get to that point and if you are at that point then now is the time to act which is that you have to pick a better customer. The reason you want to pick a better customer is that all of the things that were negative before over here get reversed. So your LTV is going to go up. Your CAC might also go up, but your LTV to CAC ratio will ultimately go down.
(15:00) You start to have a better reputation because you only go up market. Oh, that guy only serves legit people. Oh, all of a sudden you start associating with these bigger businesses because you're also become a bigger business. Your team and your morale is going to improve because they also are dealing with more legitimate business owners or legitimate customers.
(15:15) And then on top of that, these people can pay their bills and they stick with their commitments. you're gonna have better cash flow that's going to get freed up. What's very interesting about this is that you can often make more money taking your service that was once $500 of cost to you and making $1,000 of cost to you, but selling something for three or four times as expensive.
(15:32) And that happens all the time. Rather than trying to drive like, okay, you know, $500 and we're going to charge a,000. It's like, no, man, maybe it cost you a,000, but charge 10 or charge seven. you're going to make way more money both absolute and relatively by selling to a customer who can afford that because they're going to actually be able to get the value because fundamentally the whole point of business is to think about what customer can I provide the absolute most value to.
(15:55) That's the person you sell to. That is how you make an exceptional business. I'll just give you the quick hitter list of the of kind of the pains that you're going through and then we'll talk about the solution. One is you're going to have the emotional pain of overhiring and you're going to have to deal with that.
(16:05) Number two is you're going to have the uncertainty of whether this path is going to work to make this transition but you know your current one is only getting you worse and worse. So read the writing on the wall. Number three is that you have some sort of emotional attachment to your level of revenue today.
(16:17) You know, I don't want to go from $200,000 a month back to $100,000 a month or I I don't want to go from $50,000 a month back to $20,000 a month or whatever your revenue is. Add or subtract to your zeros as possible. It happens at any level. You have this ego attachment to this level, but it means nothing. Would you rather get to your goal in five years or would you rather get to your goal never? Sometimes the fastest way to build a $10 million business is not the fastest way to build a $1 million business.
(16:42) Because of that, you have to build a different foundation upon which to build your building. If you look at every great entrepreneur, they've been willing to go backwards. So sometimes you reach something called a local maximum. You climb this hill here and you're like, why can't I go any further than this? Sometimes you have to go down in order to go back up.
(16:59) You have these local maxes where you think you've climbed the mountain, but then the clouds disappear and then you realize because you see the world more clearly. Oh my god, this is actually the top, but I don't want to go from 100K down to 50K. I don't want to do that because it would hurt my ego. Well, a lot of entrepreneurship is the ego death of realizing that you will inevitably get things wrong more times than you get them right.
(17:21) But the thing that keeps you down is never being willing to admit that. Because here's the thing that no one tells you is that if you don't change, you're going to get to 50K no matter what. Anyways, so you might as well do it on your own and actually do it in a purposeful way so you can get to where you're trying to go. Because the business is just going to compress over time anyways.
(17:36) One of my big kind of rules in life is that if I know something has to happen eventually, I might as well do it today. It's one of my big rules because like I maybe it's my own like agency ego or whatever. It's like if I'm if anybody's going to destroy my business, it's going to be me, right? It's like I want to put me out of business.
(17:50) You probably heard this before. You want to put yourself out of business. I don't want the world to put me out of business. I don't want the market to put me out of business. I want to read the writing on the wall before it happens. I want to skate to where the puck's going, not where the puck is. So, what are you going to do about it? So, this is super tactical, but this is actually how you fix this.
(18:07) So, number one is you're going to conduct a customer profitability analysis. So, the way it works is this. You look at all the customers that you've had to date. You probably have some customers that you actually like and that you actually have gotten good good results for. Now what you want to look at here is demographics.
(18:24) So this is who are these people? What do they come in like? What do they look like, right? Like what do they look like? How do they behave? What are their psychographics? The next is what are they doing currently? So do they have certain headcount? Do they have certain revenue levels? Is there anything else that we can say that has nothing to do with their demographics but everything to do with their behaviors? And then finally you have done, right? which is what actions did they take as a result of entering my business that are different than the
(18:49) results of the people who didn't take those actions. Said differently, if we've got lots of customers that we've been selling, maybe there's a certain revenue level, maybe there's a certain amount of weight they have to lose, maybe there's certain, you know, emotional problem that they're dealing with.
(19:00) It's like, you know, I did really well with female divorce over 45. Fine, whatever it is, and they are making over x, y, and z. And when they entered my business, they immediately got on their first call and started a crash diet in the first seven days. I'm making this up. The point is is that we have who they are, what they're doing when they're coming in, and then what they did as a result of our product or service in order to maximize value.
(19:21) These are the steps here. So, we do this to try and say, "Oh, you know what? What is the 8020 of my business? If I could cut and only clone one specific type of customer, what would they be?" Now, you might hear this and be like, "Yeah, that's convenient, but I have to pay bills.
(19:37) " I'm telling you, sometimes you have to walk down the mountain to walk it back up. Because here's the crazy part. the amount of times I'll talk to a business owner and they're like, "You know what? I I I would service these customers except they just don't pay enough." Then you can just say, "Guess who gets to pick what your prices are?" You do.
(19:54) If there's a price where it's worth it to you, charge that. And if someone doesn't want to pay it, fine. It's capitalism. It's volunteer exchange. So once we know who they are, what they're doing when they're coming in, and then what they have done in order to be successful, we then redefine our new customer profile. Some people call this an ICP, which is an ideal customer profile.
(20:12) Some people call it your customer avatar. I don't really care what you call it. It's the person you want to be selling. Once we have this new ICP, this ideal customer profile, we now have to basically do everything top to bottom and realign the business in positioning and messaging. So, what that means is your offer has to match that type of customer.
(20:29) Your headlines have to match that type of customer. The testimonials you show should be those types of customers. The onboarding experience should be for those types of customers. Your sales team should not be allowed to sell people who are not this type of customer. You have to be willing to say no to small money today to make big money tomorrow.
(20:44) That means that you have to implement some sort of qualification process. Yes, you have to say no to customers. Do you think you can go to Olga and Mathers, one of the biggest marketing agencies in the world, if you're a local dry cleaner? No, you can't. They won't take you. They won't accept you as a customer. One of the telltale signs of a small business that they suck is they say yes to everyone.
(21:05) you didn't know any better. Continue to grow this business where you do everything for everyone and then you're surprised about the fact that your margins suck and it's very hard to operationalize this business and you have a hundred other problems that you think exist when the reality is that you just haven't decided who you're going to serve.
(21:20) You're like, "Okay, I get it, Alex. I'm going to go do this customer research report and figure out who are the people who are the best customers. I'm going to say these are my new customers from here on out. I'm going to match all my messaging and my funnels, my offers, my price points. key point because if you only sold to that top 20%, what would your new price be? Probably way higher.
(21:38) Why? Because you can provide more value to those people. So you instead of having this lukewarm price where it's like cheap for the good customers and and expensive for the bad ones, just make it appropriately priced for the people who are going to get the most value. And then make sure that you only sell to those people.
(21:52) That's the qualification. Once you have this, what do you do to get from where you're at now on this little peak here to over here? All right. to the top of our little mountain. Well, you have to transition. All right, you have to transition away from the elf customers. Now, what that's going to mean is that you're going to number five, stop selling brokies.
(22:13) And that may mean that you have to put a cap in the short term, which is like we could only sell 30% of customers below this amount. Maybe each sales guy gets a quota of like gimmies they're able to sell in order to hit whatever your monthly cash flow is. If you make this transition correctly, the people who are paying more and are better customers will be more profitable. they will stay longer.
(22:29) And then you'll be able to basically do one of these. You're going to decrease the percentage of the pie that's these bad customers. Increase the percentage of the of the pie that's the 20% and then over time the 20% becomes the 80%. And then at some point, and you'll know that point because you're going to be so happy to do it, you're going to stop selling that negative percentage of customers altogether.
(22:47) And once that happens, you will have transitioned from your very painful business and maybe have taken a half step back in terms of revenue because you have to tighten the ship up. Now, this may mean that you might have to lay off some people. And as terrible as it is, it's reality. Here's a very tough line, which is you made a mistake and you should get fired as CEO or founder from your business, but you can't get fired.
(23:13) And so, it means that someone else is ultimately going to have to pay the burden. You have to take this. What you will have is you'll start to have a healthier respect for hiring people because it shakes their lives. They change, you know, cities sometimes. They change prof, you know, professions. They go for periods of time where they're unemployed.
(23:27) if you have to make this mistake. And so you become far more respectful of the process. But in the beginning, you don't know anything. So you just hire all your friends and your family. You just say, "Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. We're scaling like crazy." But you don't know what you're doing. So you're going to quickly hit this wall and you're going to quickly realize that you built a terrible business.
(23:43) But you can either just say you're going to stay there because you're unwilling to have this uncomfortable conversation or what I would recommend doing, give them a little bit of severance. All right? So give them some money saying, "Hey, I messed this up. So instead of me taking money out this month, I'm going to give you some money so you can have two weeks or four weeks or whatever it is.
(23:59) If you're smaller, I understand that that's a lot. The bigger the biggest the business is, typically the the longer that severance experience will be that that you're able to pay. That also saves your reputation from a business owner perspective, which yes, that matters. But when you make those changes, you just have to take absolute responsibility.
(24:15) I've been through, you know, this process many times with companies, and you just have to be like, I up. It's on me. I feel horrible. this blows, but there's nothing else that I can do because ultimately I have to keep the ship afloat so that maybe in six months or 12 months, maybe I can rehire you.
(24:34) And I've had so many times where we've had I would say what a friendly exit where when I reach out to that person and when we do have that opportunity again because we fixed whatever the core problem is, a lot of them are willing to come back. If you kind of leave the door open rather than slamming it shut, you'll also maintain better long-term relationships.
(24:48) those people are willing to do some contract work for you on the side and then maybe long term. And the thing is is like guys, especially if you're getting into business, business is long. Life is long. I have people who, you know, worked for me many, many years ago and then they come back many years later. They go through a whole another chapter and then they come back with a whole bunch of new skills, which is great.
(25:05) But the thing is, if you slam the door in their face, you never get the opportunity again. I would rather always leave with and especially if it's something that's involuntary. It's in like they didn't do anything wrong, you did something wrong, and that result of your mistake is that they have to get let go.
(25:18) And if if you're like, I just can't do that. Well, then you are ultimately choosing to doom everyone. Unlike the Hollywood movies where like you can save everyone, that's not the real world. The real world is like sometimes when you play chess, you have to sacrifice pawns. There's not a single chess master that I know of who has ever won a game without losing any at the highest levels. It just doesn't happen.
(25:38) It doesn't work. You have to be able to pivot and make mistakes. Otherwise, you lose the whole game and then everyone loses their job, including you. You want to have a shot at tomorrow. Sometimes you have to make the hard decisions today. So when you make this transition correctly, what will happen is you will begin to grow again and you will be able to grow because you will have more cash flow because you are serving better customers and the main point is that they will continue to stay.
(26:00) At this point, if you've got this area where you're selling these bad customers, you know how to market, you know how to sell at a basic level. You know how to get people in the door. The problem is that your business is capped because you have more people leaving than you have coming in.
(26:13) But if all of a sudden your amount of people who leave goes to zero or goes to very very small numbers, you grow pretty much no matter what. That's ultimately what you want to solve for is how do I sell something that people don't want to cancel out of? And sometimes the way that you do that is you change who you're selling

Transcript:
(00:00) i own a portfolio of companies that does 85 million a year and i was recently invited to taki moore's masterminded keynote for his eight figure and up group and it was a really fun discussion and presentation that i was able to give i was very humbled to have been invited and we talked about two main things that those business owners wanted to know so if you're not at that level this may not be for you but we talked about two things the first was how to scale a high performance sales team so among our portfolio companies i think the biggest team we have in those companies is a 26
(00:25) person sales team so we know what it looks like to recruit hire manage incentivize and drive high performance sales we've done that before with inbound and outbound sales meaning cold calls versus taking you know phone funnel type type inbound leads through applications so we've done both of those and the other was more high level so the conversation is kind of split into two pieces one is focused very very sales focused and the second is focused on what i would consider high-level observations of entrepreneurship of things that we've learned lessons
(00:49) beliefs that have served us well um in creating the portfolio company that we have so uh if you don't know who i am i'm alex mozy i own acquisition.com i hope you enjoyed the video uh so this is alex and layla power team uh they run a portfolio of companies uh probably many of you guys know them from their gym launch days and times uh team what i'd love to chat with you about is scaling legion with um with outbound uh and then uh let's talk about uh scaling and exiting dude can we talk about outbound because a while ago like when we first
(01:20) met you were like the king of the ads right yeah and then you then you weren't and the ads kind of disappeared and i want to know kind of what i don't want too many people to know that though are we allowed to know that or you don't no no no no we're we're cool everybody here we're under a friendly a that's my understanding right friendy a yes 100 for india if you're cool with that can you type friend da into the chat it means everybody's officially signed so um i think i think it would it would serve everyone to do a little bit of
(01:48) backstory in terms of why like why would you even start something like this right because you're like i'm already killing it on facebook and going on tick-tock i've got youtube guides going et cetera i will say that i'll tell you why i started which will probably lead into the second half of this story which is what um i i told taki was like i want you to talk about this and i was like i really want to talk about this and he was like okay well how about we talk about my thing first and then we start with your thing
(02:10) yeah so um uh two years ago legal and i uh you know we were we were you know the we at that time only had two businesses we had gym launching prestige labs one is the supplement company one is a gym licensing company and the company at that time was doing about a million a week and we just finished our best month ever and we're walking outside and she looks at me and she's like i don't do this anymore she's like let's shut it down and i was like well uh okay uh maybe um let's you know let's see if we can
(02:40) get anything for this right so i just immediately was like i just agreed i was cool i was in tons of pain as an entrepreneur just you know doing all the things and um anyways i called up a friend of mine who was in space and he was an investment banker he had sold similar companies and i was like hey these are our numbers like what do you think we can get for this and he was like holy he's like you get like 250 million if you just finish the next 12 months at this rate and i was like 250 million with an m
(03:10) he was like yeah you did 17 million profit your second year like yes i can yes we could do that so look at later i was like well you got 12 months in and she was like i got 12 months for 250. i was like okay let's do this right and so that began what became a two and a half year journey um that eventually uh resolved in us selling the business and so i want to walk through kind of that process and the first year of that was us realizing that we didn't actually have a business we had a big guru brand
(03:40) right um at the end of the day i was at the events i was the one who made the products i was the one who did the coaching calls every week probably something that some in a similar spot that some of you guys are in and so um the the biggest kind of weakness was that i was inextricably linked with the brains that was number one number two and this is what i'm going to focus on first and this i'll hopefully tie both these stories together is that we were we were channel dependent all right and so we were selling uh gym owners right so business owners so we're not in like the online fitness space
(04:10) we're hardcore brick and mortar the i talked to a couple of bankers a couple private equity firms people that i knew through the network asked them for people and i was like what do you see as the weaknesses in our business like how can we make this better and the two big the three big things they said were churn uh in terms of how long customers stayed they said my name being the brand and the fact that we were channel depend on instagram and facebook and that was it and that was 100 of our of our sales sales point
(04:35) and so we kind of set out to to fix that and so um i'll just talk about outbound since that was the channel that we chose to be our next thing and it was because i could never get youtube to work in my niche um you know if you're a little more mass i think it's maybe i'm a it's very possible but i couldn't get it to work um we have seen tiktok working as a side note but for today we'll talk about outbound so the outbound process takes significantly longer than most people expect that being said it's part of the reason that private
(05:05) equity and potential acquirers will value it is because it is this sturdy machine because if tomorrow facebook ads shut me down it doesn't matter because if i literally have a phone we can make money like a phone which is crazy like the concept is still foreign to me and so i want to tell you the sales numbers so that you can have perspective in terms of how long this took so the first month we made one sale the second month we made two sales the third month we made four sales i like whether the and mind you this is months so you're like 90 days in
(05:40) at this point you're like we've been putting effort towards this etcetera right and so one of the key differences to note with manual outbound whether you're doing cold calls cold emails cold text whatever it doesn't matter which like the primary way of doing it we do a combo and i'll get to that in a second um is that every aspect of the funnel that we do digitally is the same except it's purely manual so you have human variables that contribute to every step in the pipeline right so we did two we did four uh the next month we did uh i think it was six or eight uh and then
(06:16) we jumped to uh 12 and then we jump to 16 and then we jump to and you'll notice that this isn't uh quadratic so it's not exponential what you will see there is that it's more linear in nature it's because we continue to add so our price point is between right now 20 000 is the cheapest thing we sell which is a great point bill so thank you for bringing this up if you want to do outbound your ticket has to be at least 15 000.
(06:45) like the the the uni economics don't really work i guess they do i just prefer to have lots of margins but in theory it should be 15 times a 15k or more right and so for us our lcv is 40 000 at current right now it's gone up but when we started this the ltd was 40k because i started this in corona for brick and mortar jibs because we're brilliant right so if you continue this thing out um it took so we're now we passed we're at month 14 from when we started and now uh 14 months in uh it does about 45 sales a month which for us is roughly 60 of our sales
(07:24) volume so we we we hit the halfway point and now we're a little more than half um in that industry yeah it's probably better than me pretending to draw i'll get to my drawing thing in a second or you'll be able to do it better so i i wanted to set this as a precedent because i had two different times where my leaders came to me and were like dude should continue to do this and i just remember looking at them and i was like this is why no one will remember your name um i'm kidding i didn't actually say that um but but i
(07:49) was like guys as long as we are seeing progress through the funnel we have to continue because the end goal is i either have to own this thing for the rest of my life which is okay or and i need to do it without it being dependent on a single channel which i should do as an owner regardless and that'll feed into the second part of the story or or we'll never will never be able to get out of this or or exit it either way because you have to exit right every you know we have to sell and we're either selling it from our old self to our new self we're selling it from our old selves to a new acquirer but either way
(08:19) we have to get out of it um the channel dependency at a certain point if you're below 10 million i don't think you need to worry about this but once you're you know once you're at 10 million i think adding the second channel is important in terms of the uh tactics around this understanding the organizational chart which creates the sale and the actual process of the sale is kind of where we should start so there are three different roles in our sales system all right the first is we have we you know different there's sdr bdr the whole point is that it's the cult it's the first touch point it's the
(08:50) outbound person sdrs and bdrs i think we call them what do we call them little bdrs i remember whatever yeah yeah i think we call them bdrs so and this is an important point for everyone it's good that you leave this this three the three lines because this is cool because there's going to be more detail in each of them so we've got bdrs as level one level two we've got sds which is sales development specialist these guys qualify the leads and provide the value that the original person was promising the third person is what we call bc so
(09:24) business consultants and these are the closers right we technically have a fourth for we have another team that does all of our ascensions um that sells the the 40k product but this is uh and it looks like a christmas tree if you were to look at the org chart like this right you got the base of bdrs who feed half as many uh sds you then feed half as many uh bcs in this model if you replace a bdr mentally with what an advertisement used to do that's exactly how this functions the exception to this process compared to your uh uh
(10:00) inbound efforts are there's usually one additional call typically so what we do is that you we scrape lists off of google we have vas in the philippines enrich the data which just means that they make sure that these are real real gym owners that have actual facilities and these numbers work and these emails are verified um the actual like what software they use i honestly have no idea because the person who manages that team is too substantive for me but that's what they do from there bdr team calls this list through phone murder so phone burner is the tool we
(10:36) use we really like it it's it's been exceptional i highly recommend it those bdrs are required to make 100 calls a day the way that we structure this is that they get four hours to work per day all right and we purposely set it up that way so that we can have good sales people who want to who want a moonlight so they've got extra hours and they do call blocks the other reason is because the sales manager that i hired to build this entire team his experience was that people cannot be productive for eight hours straight cold calling he said if you give him eight hours of pay he's like they'll do five and a half hours of calls he's like so
(11:13) you might as well do four hours of pay and get three and a half and so that was an efficiency thing they are still expected to make 100 calls a day from those hundred calls they are expected to have two appointments that show now we have been doing this a long time now and each of these steps took like each one of the things that i just mentioned probably took two to four weeks to figure out where do we scrape the data how do we how do we enrich it because we're calling all these bad numbers right now that we're getting people to uh pick up
(11:42) which by the way phone burner wraps it with a local area code if you don't have that feature there's no point in using it like you need to wrap in a little gear code or your picker braids can be  all right so from there you'll get your 100 dials you'll get 20 to pick up so it's 120 from the 20 we will have two who schedule and show i only know the two because that's the only thing we compensate them on all right and so the expectation is that they get two in the beginning it'll be one yes all right uh 100 to 20 to two what's the
(12:12) uh dumb question what's the 20 what's the two 20 is 20 uh pickups so 100 dials 20 pick up hello of the 20 to pick up we get one to two uh to to show uh and that's to show for the sds yep exactly now this is a good thing for you guys too is that every once in a while you'll get you'll get a savage and you'll know because they'll set five of them because if you guys picked up the phone and do it you could set five points if someone picked up you could probably set it up right but somebody who's newer the nice thing
(12:43) with the bdrs is it takes two days to ramp them up it's not a hard position to teach yes here's the list here's the phone say these words the phone calls are like five to ten minutes like they're not hard to train and if you have a big repertoire of existing calls which you will uh it's easy to just have them listen to those so uh can we can i be a gym for a second yeah oh i've never done the calls i have no idea do you have a rough idea what they say what it's about so our our whole pitch is basically like hey we've been calling some gyms in the
(13:11) area um they've been struggling with xyz you know biggest concern one two and three and so what we're doing is like if gyms don't exist our company doesn't exist and so we'd like to just give you some of the stuff that's working well for them is that okay this is from our private client thing which normally we charge for but we just want to help jim's out cool okay so what i'll do is i'll set you up with an appointment uh with sean tomorrow and he'll run through each of these systems for your gym uh so that you can insert dream outcome that you want which is get more leads make more sales charge more for it yeah
(13:42) awesome okay that's super helpful yeah right right and the bdrs will typically uh if they're good they'll look up the gym before they make the call um and so they can be like hey saw that you posted that thing yeah i'm calling you know from gymlodge don't worry like just want to help you guys out we're talking a lot of gyms in the area like tonality matters right like that's the stuff that the manager will teach them um but it's like this is a good well play for us it's like we just wanna help you out we're gonna give you some stuff no no strings attached they say cool and then they show up for the sds right now
(14:13) getting getting them to show for the sds it's like you got to get them to show sooner we need to make sure that the thing that you were giving them they truly perceive is valuable and this is probably one of the biggest things that i can that i can if i can this one took us longer to figure out is and i don't think like lead magnets and stuff like that is valuable like it's got to be like it has to be something that people really want in your space so even if it's something that's unscalable do it unscalable and then figure out a system to scale it once you get the um
(14:44) once you get the flow going right because in the beginning you're gonna have one or two callers it's not going to be a ton of volume i promise you um and then you'll you'll be able to figure out what's the thing that gets them to show up that they really want right can you get on i mean back in the day seo is sorry yes sorry dude can you give us an example of what a valuable not lead magnet useful thing might be i think we walk them through uh how to set up their sales room and the scripting that they use that that we get
(15:08) you know double the amount of people who sign up or whatever so it's a really valuable thing right and then it's like yeah you'll walk him through he can show you around blah blah blah blah and then amazing yeah the cool thing and they can sell the benefits like if you had twice as many people signed up and nothing else changed in your life would that be cool cool all right he's going to show you how we do it because this is what the top one percentage you're doing we should help you out okay loving the script we just want to
(15:31) help you out high valuable thing old school telemarketing rob nixon you love this sharon says stud so once we uh once we get them to the sds the sds's full requirement um is that they provide value crazy as i know is that you actually deliver the thing that they think is really cool now here's the key point is that we want to show expertise so the sds for us almost exclusively is ex-clients now we may be in a situation where you know our clients are able to do that like you have to show some domain expertise especially around this thing and the idea is if we can show a couple
(16:08) of like really in-depth nuggets that are like i didn't think about that while they're going through the process they're like these guys know what they're talking about and so what happens is we we terminate the uh the the value delivery and we purposely leave about 15 minutes at the end you know of dead time that we would transition to getting them set up on another call how long is this call i think it's 45.
(16:31) so it's 30 to do the thing 15 to set the next uh deal perfect the the sds is like hey you know i couldn't can i can i switch hats for a second i know i'm just here to help you out but and we purposely make that to change the the frame right we're trying to make a little little frame shift which is like i couldn't help it here when you were saying some of these things i couldn't like this this stood out to me this stood out to me this have you thought about these things because honestly i just showed you this little thing but that's like one percent
(16:59) of actually the amount of juice you could squeeze at your gym because like if we just did the thing that we just talked about you double your business but but like what about orders of magnitude what we can get to like 5x the business because right now you're running 10 margins and if we can get you to 35 we just three and a half extra take home income only by changing the way you price would that be valuable okay cool so do you know what we do because at this point we haven't talked about us at all so think about it first
(17:22) call all about them value second call providing value second half of that call couldn't help without xyz i don't normally do this blah blah do you know what we actually do and they're like no i was like oh shoot i i feel so stupid yeah so we literally help people just like you fix the thing that you just said you want with the thing you know by overcoming your biggest insecurity and fear and they're like oh my god that's awesome it's like you know we actually do this 100 gyms a month like we can we can walk like this is our bread and butter i didn't know you actually needed this i just wanted to provide this for you to help you out
(17:57) oh wow well okay let me see here hold on let me check with one of the one of our guys you got 15 minutes okay cool we're good um you're a business owner why don't we see if we can um uh set this up for you right now right let's be efficient with your time hold on one second so then we call the closer yeah we call the closer live and then they have a dialogue that's scripted but it's speakerphone yeah the person who's on zoom right now doesn't know that this conversation is scripted but they can hear both sides and this guy's like dude i'm super busy i got so many gyms i got to talk to um i
(18:30) got a hard stop and 15. i can maybe hop on um okay no this guy's really awesome he's he's a qualified gym no he's legit he's big enough for us okay okay you got to make sure he's the right size and that he's got the that he understands what we do oh yeah no no it's all good right okay cool then i got i can hop on for 15 minutes guy hops into the zoom makes the introduction and the goal here is not to sell them the goal is just to connect them and build rapport that's all it is because we could not get the s and this took us like two months to figure out we could
(19:02) not get the sds to show for the close calls like those the qualified appointments we couldn't get them they would set it but they wouldn't show up and so we tried doing three-way text we tried like we tried a bunch of things but if you do the face-to-face where they hop on the call then they're like yeah perfect well i gotta go in five but i've got you down for tomorrow four we're good to go and rock and roll right and just to be clear like this is no longer us giving you thing i'm going to explain how our services work our pricing and see if it's a good fit right and so they clearly set the expectation that this is
(19:32) a sales call and that i will be trying to close it and we're very clear about that yeah and it's cool because we just had two calls we provided value at this point we transition they show up the next day and it's and it's just like your inbound closing dude so here's the advantage to this there's so much more so here's the advantage to this model so four callers sorry sorry uh uh if you're looking at appointments right yep for us we close uh 10 of of scheduled sds so if there's two of these right two of those we close ten
(20:09) percent of those of showed uh set calls we closed ten percent so we closed point two uh in that example right yeah exactly and so for us the cost uh to acquire a customer from an advertising i'll use cold calling as the advertising here is they get they get uh they get 50 bucks for every show so it's 500 right so it's 500 bucks in in bdrs per close which for a 40 000 ltv is pretty cool and so that works out pretty well for us and so the beautiful part about this model is that it takes so the downsides are the upsides with this it takes a
(20:52) long time to build and it's and it also is impossible to break yes and i can tell you i sleep so much better as a business owner knowing that no matter what happens tomorrow we're going to close deals so this is the part that i think everyone needs to uh if you want to scroll up on this is the this is the the more genius you'll need a fresh page so i got you so this is a key point that is sexy as  all right um who here would love to have a sales team system a farm for building sales people so we so my ceo uh was an ex-pro baseball player so we used the pro baseball
(21:34) player analogy a lot so right there in front of you you've and we even used that we even used the terms right so we've got double a we've got aaa and we've got the bigs right and so double a is the bdrs uh aaa is the sds's and then the biggs is like the big leagues right and so the key point here and this is like for those of you guys who are building 30 million like 50 like this is where this gets interesting for everyone right is that the the human resource training system itself becomes an asset to the business because we know that when someone works their way up from being a bdr all the way to a bc they
(22:12) know how to close because these people were never spoiled with inbound leads they got hung up on and cussed at and so you guys want to know an interesting stat our inbound closing percentage and we were considered pretty good at sales before this went from 20 20 to 25 to 60 yeah wow because they were they cut their teeth at the bottom yeah they're like this person knows who we are asked for help and wants more information they're like for real and so here's here's why this is important to titles so bdr there's four levels of bdrs you've got junior bdrs you got associate
(22:56) bdrs you've got bdr and you've got senior bdr and that same four step system applies to all of the levels give me the junior junior yep associate yeah the name and then uh was the top thing i just said um senior yeah so think about your highest churn positions right the reason that the positions are high turn is because they cannot see progress people lose hope when they run out of future right i think i dim or telstra that i really like that so they run out of future so what we need to do is create yeah we need to create future for them and so it's my belief that a sales person has
(23:30) like six to eight weeks of steam in them before they start getting disheartened and so what we did is that we created milestones which are those qualifiers on the right where if you hit a an objective qualifier you move up and so if as a junior it would probably be 50 showed appointments which will take you about eight weeks after that would be a hundred and then it and each one of these increases and you'll know for your business it might be a little different but the point is that you want to pace it so it's about eight weeks of production between each
(24:02) one now each one of these gives them a bump in title and a bump in pay the pay bump is virtually inconsequential we go from 50 bucks to like 55 bucks like it's not a huge deal but to them they feel like they're making progress in both status and they have an objective measure of their of how well they're doing now once they move their way through this and then imagine this you're a new employee you're getting trained up and then boom eight weeks in you get a promotion you're like oh nice i'm doing well this is good and then they gain some steam and then boom dude eight weeks later they're like hey
(24:34) i'm a full bdr you know i mean like this is great i got another raise once they get to the top of this ladder this is the key key nuance you don't get promoted you get the ability to be promoted yeah this is when you get to here senior yeah yeah once you're a senior bdr you now have the ability to be promoted the benefit of this is it also eliminates all the hr conversations for i want more money we're like here's the path that's it this is the career path it also helps people become career sales people for you so if you have issues of churn for your sales team this gives them a like this is what my career
(25:10) path is here's an important point you probably heard what i said about the bdrs they do not get paid very much they don't they're they're on target earnings if they hit all the commissions is 40 grand yeah right now how do you attract someone who can do this job well for 40 000 you don't you attract them because they know that the guys who win the lottery make 200 grand a year [Music] and they know because they have a clear career path in front of them that if they hit their metrics they could get there in nine to 12 months yeah so i'm
(25:41) like what job in the world can you go from zero to two hundred thousand a year in nine to twelve months with no degree here you can because we're pure meritocracy and the numbers don't lie and so at the sds level it's the same exact thing jumer sds uh uh associate the just the word and then senior right so we have each of these levels and there's tiny bumps in comp for each of those and they really should just be almost symbolic more than they are significant because like the title is more important than the cash but the cash just goes okay and because you yeah yeah exactly yeah honestly you could probably
(26:17) get away with this without even changing anything but i like i like to give a little something and then they feel like there's there's some stuff ricky's got a question if someone's level if someone's results stopped or their levels dropped yes okay so you can go for something associate or whatever you have to you have to continue to earn your position if you if you drop below qualifiers you drop down you go back to aaa just like baseball you go back down yeah yeah they get relegated exactly it's exactly that and the nice thing is because of this everyone knows where they stand so it
(26:48) cuts down some of the useless communication of like pay and what am i doing and how well i'm it's like dude it's right here everybody can see it right and it's built like this christmas tree because they see the top closure and they see their checks they're like that could be me right and they know they get they're counting the weeks until they can get there now when we start scaling because we add more bdrs it trickles up the tree and we're going to need another uh closer and so we look at the guys who are who are qualified to be promoted and we pick the one that we think is going
(27:16) to be the best fit and they get bumped they get bumped up to the bigs and then they and then it's it's tried out like they've got two weeks to show us if they can close if they can't close in two weeks they drop back down they get 10 deals everyone's curious you get 10 deals to try you don't close one out of 10 you're out realistically should close more but their first ten they gotta close them yep and the reasoning behind that is i i've run and trained and scaled a lot of sales teams i have yet to find a killer who doesn't close in the first two weeks
(27:44) yeah not once yeah tons of guys who start hot and then fizzle but no one who starts cold and then gets good what are your uh qualifiers for sds and well bc's clearly say you know deals done sds is just bc it's it's qualified shows yeah so they have to they have to qualify them and they have to get them to show that's that's really it yep because for example in that call if they can't get the person to be like yeah tell me more about that and they're like nah i'm good then they missed it right and so that's why the domain
(28:17) expertise for the sds like lots of really cool little like if you have two or three really good nuggets that you always know are awesome weave it into that conversation and they're like and you're like dude this is like this much this is like my fingernail of how big this is like you should like the fact that you didn't know this it both worries me and excites me for the opportunity that i think you have in front of you and honestly i'm not qualified to talk about it but this guy who's got a dick bigger than shaq and you know cured cancer by age six and help 5000 people just like you be better than who you are
(28:48) like he can help you let me see if he's available he really never is he's always booked let me check and then and then he does the thing yeah i love it so we've talked about uh we've talked about this we've talked about that yep uh bc call um my hunch is it's closer framework yeah can you just give us like those yeah yeah so um we use i i like to teach a really simple simple acronym both most you guys on here already know how to close so you know i won't bore you with it but yeah you could use your own or if you don't have one you could model from this there
(29:21) might be something you could steal yeah so we make sure that every script follows close receive points um it's always a question-based framework so we like questions because people can just like say get off into jupiter and you just ask them another question that brings them back um each of these is kind of a milestone along the path so c is clarify why they're there right it sounds obvious right but it's like hey so i know you you know you wanted some help with the sales thing i know that provided some
(29:46) value to you i know you talked to john and he showed you a couple more things so like why did you decide to take all this time like what's what's important to you about this like why are you not getting what you want like why'd you even take the time to show up this fall right and then they're like well they're like well i wanted more information it's like you just get information all day you're trying to solve some of the information you know because that would be that would be a smoke screen right like right so as soon as we get it then we nail them down and we label it which
(30:08) is l so it's like okay so i hear what you're saying this is the reason you show up for the call so i just want to be clear that if we achieve this outcome for you you would be happy right you would be like you guys rock i love you awesome you can imagine that okay great okay so you've wanted this so we go to oh which is overview your past pain right we call this the pain cycle so we're like okay so you've wanted this for however long and what have you done so far to try because you seem like a pretty you know well-to-do person you seem like you've got some work ethic so i'm sure this isn't the first thing you know first
(30:37) phone call you've hopped on so like what have you done so far they go through it we said got it how'd that work for you what was good what was bad whenever they say something good we say totally and we agree with it if they say something was bad we're like oh that's terrible and we disagree unless there's a limiting belief that we need to pop before we get into the close yep then we go right back to the beginning we say what else have you done and we keep going until there's nothing left or like god i can totally understand why you'd be frustrated at this point
(31:01) because it seems like you've done a lot so i feel like you've got a lot of pieces because the goal here is to make them feel like they're six inches away and they need one link to be successful totally right yeah dude you've got all these right things in place you're so close i mean gosh i feel like like you've got you're this close to hitting your goal so you've done all this stuff this is what you want this is why you're here do you want to hear like i think you'd be a good fit for the program how it works and they say yes we get permission and then we go into s which is sell the
(31:25) vacation so the reason we call cell vacation is that a lot of most people here already know this but a lot of sales people will sell your program right which is the plane flight they're selling tsa airbags take your shoes off weigh your mass get vaccinated don't get vaccinated you know sit next to the person who fires you on the plane you're going to get terrible peanuts all of that and they're like yeah but then you're going to get them out and people were like it's like you got to sell them out you
(31:49) got to be talking about the trees and the wind and what it's going to be like to feel and experience that the status increase they will have amongst their peers as a result of this this decision they're like got it okay and when we do the solid vacation we typically will limit it to three main points and i think it's just consuming attention span isn't that good so you probably do tons of stuff we do tons of stuff we only talk about three things right talk about get more customers how to make it worth more how
(32:15) to get them buy more times that's it right and these are the things that we're gonna help them do and we give a relevant analogy to those things so uh you know we just you wanna have a quick anecdote that's 30 seconds or less so if i was selling a a coaching program for whatever accountability might be one of my three things and i'd be like okay well and this would tie to whatever the thing they struggled with in the past it's like you know i signed for stuff but i didn't really get it going or i was
(32:40) struggling to like do it whatever like totally understand it's reasonable what do they do to hold you down when they're like well nothing it's like well then that's not your fault they didn't want you accountable of course you weren't successful that's not that's not you right so let me ask you a question when you were a kid did you uh did you love brushing your teeth at night and they were like no like did you go like oh my god you know they drag you out of bed you brush your teeth right and they kept doing that over and over every night you gotta keep doing that could you do that do you brush your teeth now as an adult they're
(33:03) like well i mean yeah not a disgusting you're like yeah so what that was an example of is you could have external accountability that turned into internal motivation and that's exactly what we're going to do with you here in this program does that make sense great we don't talk about zoom calls we don't talk about support we don't talk about power like don't talk any of that because that doesn't matter they just want to know that something external is going to get them to do something internal forever so we
(33:26) give them an anecdote about that and so this is important because this is the only thing the sales guys have to memorize besides obstacle overcomes the rest of this is is questions that they can always refer back to all right so for ramping up sales guys faster question-based framework not scripting this has just been my experience it's easier to teach people i i haven't found in my experience the super scripted stuff is best for like 20 minutes super high transactional sales like 200 sales and less but that's
(33:51) probably not what anyone here is selling so for everyone else question-based framework kind of a diagnostic approach we follow this e is explaining with their concerns which is like got it this is the thing that makes sense would you be would you be opposed to moving forward today because it sounds like a good fit um then they're like well i wouldn't be a pleasure before today you're like great and if for some reason they say yes what we do is we do the exact same thing every time which was we make some sort of concession which is a bonus and then we say fair enough because all we're doing is concession reciprocity fair enough and
(34:22) people don't like to feel like they are not being fair it's a very human thing is reciprocity's super deep in us and so if someone's like i don't know if i can do this like how about i throw this in yeah three times like okay it's got to be fair enough by now right and so we explain with our concerns which you guys probably already know you've got spouse slash decision maker you've got price and you've got uh delay which is i need to think about it i need more information i got to sleep on it whatever and so for each of those rather than give you the things that we would drill our sales teams on uh a decision
(34:52) maker close is going to adhere to the principles behind getting someone to understand past agreements which is does your spouse or business partner know that you are struggling with this yes do they want you to continue to struggle with this no why would they be against you fixing something they already know you're struggling with and they don't want you to keep struggling with so we're relying on the past agreements to go into the present and then we they're like i guess you're right and then we usually will tag in hey sometimes you better ask for forgiveness information fair enough right and then we will close them that
(35:21) would be for a decision maker for a um for a uh if it's by the way if it's b to c you can usually get away with uh what if they say no and honestly you'd be i'd still blows my mind you were like i'd probably do it anyways you're like then let's do it so you know so it's rock and roll like but if it's if it's b to b you probably going past your grades and then uh and then usually if you have some sort of guarantee or some sort out clause of like three days or five days if you you know get back and your business partners and usually we'll make
(35:49) a joke here hey you get back your best partner says hey man i want you to be poor i want your kids not to have anything i want you to live in the worst neighborhoods i don't want you to have generational wealth i want you to just pass on a spirit of poverty to all of the things that spring you know fruit from your loins if that's if that's what your business partner says like totally understand and we'll just tear this up but if he's like nah man that sounds good then we'll rock and roll right and if he does say that first thing you get have him give me a call and i'll talk to him fair enough great there we go so
(36:16) decision maker we've got price which is always anchored around value this is usually more that you actually have to close on the sales guys not the prospects i'm gonna be really real with you we don't drill price stuff that much we drill the sales team on their conviction so has anyone here ever had like a client event and had all these people there and get testimonials and like your sales team was there yesterday right well i'll bet you for the next couple weeks your closing percentage is going to be  sky high i could tell you that when i had my brick and mortar gyms i
(36:47) would do weigh out days which is like when challenges and stuff would end and people would be losing weight and crying and all that stuff i would stack as many sales appointments as i possibly could while the layouts were happening yeah because my sales team was just watching people just hit their goal and hit their goal and they're like dude just sign up like they would even go through a pitch they're like i mean what do you have to like just sign up like it yeah and they reeked of conviction and the funniest thing in the world for everybody here is like understanding the theory behind
(37:11) sales is that you have a person who has conviction and then you have another person who has no conviction and everyone knows that sales is a transference of conviction right it's a transference of belief and the bridge of that is trust right and so the real intention is that we must make sure that a salesperson actually believes and you'd be amazed at how many times they don't really believe in the product yeah and one of the things that is important to understand is it's not a binary it's not do my sales guys believe in my product how much do they believe in my product
(37:42) hey alex yeah this is epic okay and you know what i love uh i said i'd like you to talk about this and you said no i want to talk about that and i said well let's do both you've done a really good job of doing what i wanted to talk about so um i like talking about sales no i get it uh in a minute what i'd love to do let's just do the third objection to kind of close the triangle here and then let's do a quick q a and then let's talk about scaling and selling is that cool yeah um so last ones uh i need to think about it and so for most people they don't
(38:12) know how to make a good decision they're afraid of making a mistake and so we like to be as direct as possible which is like let's toss best best case worst case this is what happens this is what happens because tell me what your deepest darkest fear is right is that i take your money and xyz that you think is gonna happen is it gonna happen but not only that let's be real your husband thinks you're a failure because you spent money again right your friends are like oh here she is again you know or here he is making another business program thinking he's going to make money right that's what the real
(38:41) pain is right it's not the money i mean sure but the thing is that the money's going to come back right because you're not going to go homeless and even if you do go homeless i've got guys who've lived outside my building for 25 years not starving still good so you really have nothing to worry about right but the real thing here is that we need to make this decision so do you know how to make the we have a decision-making framework here can we can i share with you sure so first question yes or no do you think that we can help you solve this problem yes
(39:05) cool do you like me or do you want to work with us as a company yes cool do you have access to the amount of money that is required to start yes or no if it's yes yes yes let's rock and roll because the end of the day you don't need more time you need more information to make a decision and i'm your source of information and i can do this all day feels like you've done this once or twice this is i'm making this a good uh okay sheila just wants to know the r in closer is just reinforce their decision that's a great one so close was actually my my acronym for like two years when i was
(39:38) teaching and then after really looking at it as the beginning of the customer journey yeah uh we transition to having instead of a hand off it is a handshake between sales and customer success and so the point here is that the moment they close the moment the card goes through they're going to have immediate remorse and so our goal is to totally reinforce the decision personalize video from the next person be like hey just got off the phones john i hear it and this is an important point from an operational standpoint it's like hey i heard you're trying to retire your wife i think that's amazing i heard they were
(40:09) trying to get to ten thousand dollars a month i think you're gonna blow that away you're gonna do such a good job so just to give you a heads up tomorrow it's me tammy forgot to introduce myself and we're gonna be walking through xyz so that we can help you get your your wife retired as fast as possible cool really excited to see you i sent you an email with all the details too see you tomorrow right and so now they're like okay this is a legit company i just got you know i just got off the phone you know the phone thing and an hour later i
(40:32) get this thing i'm like okay this is cool i feel good about this decision and that's what we want them to think i feel good about this decision and we're like great and then it decreases the the the cold feet and walkouts and backups and all that good job tammy i'd love to know one thing you learned one thing you loved any follow-up questions let's do it right now and then we're going to switch gears so one thing you want to kind of nugget you stole and any questions you've got lots of exploding head emojis uh what's the comp
(40:58) at each level well let's scroll up here for a second i wouldn't i wouldn't give you hard and fast what i'll give you is ote which is on target earnings cool uh and that's what that's also what we present the sales guys so this is the number of opportunities if you're getting if you're doing 100 and the nice thing is that here's the cool thing with outbound is that it's reliable ads you've got some days you've got more somebody's got less maybe this campaign maybe it's not outbound it starts with a constant you make 100
(41:22) calls yeah and everything after that is is just formula right 100 calls means means we should get two people to show two people show we should get uh five of those iterations to get one deal and so forth and so if you're getting this many appointments per week this is relatively the amount that you should be closing by percentage right if you close less than this so if somebody's closing let's say 25 or less they get up they get bumped down right and so for us the the guys who are the bigs they make the on the on like if
(41:51) they're doing great they make like 225. yeah they are target earnings range breach that's probably yeah 150 to say 120 to 220 is the range there for a triple a or at the sds they make 60ish and that's a much tighter range probably like 55 to 70 you know i mean like but i don't think anyone said this it's like 55 to 65.
(42:18) it's a 10k range and then uh and then the uh the bdrs are like around 40 grand helpful so you can see how they're shooting for that yeah yeah yeah see it and what they're like how long does it take the answer is right in front of them on the right that's all it takes yeah what i love about this is you're thinking in uh quick achievable win levels and um maria just said love eight weeks probably the same for our clients something to think about yeah uh jackson says where are you finding these people the homeless guys out the back that he talked about before yeah a candidly uh one of the big bottlenecks
(42:48) in the business was finding that and i found out it took me i made a whole youtube video about this but uh basically my team was screening way too hard um for bdrs and my sales manager didn't know and so we're like no no just let them all in and we'll see how they do because the cost because it takes two days to ramp them up and we don't really have any cost per lead yeah i mean besides the data scraping which is not that hard and so we just let them prove themselves because it doesn't really cost us anything to have them work leads yeah
(43:19) love it uh yuri's asking did you consider cold outbound email instead of called calls yeah i'm pretty sure phone burner has a follow-up email uh and text thing that goes with it but i'll be honest with you guys like the phones are the thing that that drive it 75 of it comes from the phones yeah i love it okay so alex when i said hey could you do a thing about a thing and you said yes uh you said i'd rather talk about what i thought i would share with you guys if that's okay with you is a couple of the kind of key lessons i've learned in this
(43:49) process so i started this process because i was in a tremendous amount of pain right and i and i i ran out of future i couldn't see uh a world where i'd want to continue to do this for the long haul right and i think i heard this from sharon and i love it is that operators get burned out business owners get rich and i was still ceo and that was the thing is that as much as i felt like i wasn't doing anything now two years ago i was 100 doing things but this year uh as we transitioned out i went from just making decisions to not
(44:18) really make just to just reviewing decisions which is kind of what we're doing now and so the reason that we got the offers that we did in my opinion um is because we fixed the house and when you fix the house that you're trying to sell does anyone ever try to sell a house and like you fix all the things that they say are wrong with it and you look at the astral like why are we leaving this place this place is awesome have you ever done that yeah well the the biggest lesson that i feel like i've taken from this and i have i have two pages of lessons that i took i documented through this process
(44:48) um is that you only have one outcome you have to sell the business but it doesn't mean you have to have another acquirer you can sell the business from yourself to yourself yeah your own self to your new self and i also got a greater understanding of how the debt system works so if someone's going to buy your business for a big amount of money they're not actually going to pay for your business right they're going to put 30 down like you do for a house and then they're going to get a bank to finance the rest right
(45:17) you have a house that you own 100 in cash you can go to the bank and get the 70 mortgage on your house and just take the money in the us at least tax-free jackson's nodding he would know the aussie so he's nodding he's like yes affirmative and so the point is is that in my mind two and a half years ago the only possible outcome that i could do to get out of pain was to sell and the thing that i had to sell was unsellable and so the thing that we build has to be sellable that's just my conclusion it has to be sellable or you'll eventually burn out
(45:53) and so if you make it sellable then it actually sits as an asset on your personal net worth balance sheet and it continues to provide cash flow um i had so many stories that i would you know that like the story of the sale for me was like i need a big sale to to be legit some of you guys may laugh at that you're like you're doing 85 million here but in my head i was like well and then i had a friend was like dude you've already sold six companies i was like yeah but they weren't like as big as this he's like you really think that matters i was like huh and then it was like what about the what
(46:22) about the story of of the money right about the increase in net worth well here's here's an interesting one for you say you have 100 million dollar sale right everyone talks about it it's so amazing well most of the times it's not 100 million right what it is is they'll probably give you you know 60 million up front and then you'll have a 10 million dollar seller note that you finance for five years and then you'll have uh you'll have a earn out right for another 20 million uh that if you hit y and z over the next year or two right or earn outs can be as long as they want right
(46:59) um and uh you're gonna roll another 10 in equity right and so all of a sudden this 100 becomes 60. but wait there's more so now we've got 60 million well you probably have some bonuses that you want to give to your staff you're gonna have a broker that you'll probably have to pay three or four percent to so let's let's do it so four percent of 60 now we're down to 57 right uh and i'll just wrap in some of the bonuses on top of that uh depending on how your your equity structure if you're 100 whatever then you have your capital gains tax you have
(47:30) an escrow fee so capital gains for us in the states at least is 20. so now we have 20 off of the you know let's say 55 after the escrow that would be actually a size that big would probably be more like 50 after escrow uh 20 that would be 40 million so now your 100 million dollar sale is 40 million bucks it's not as cool right at least for me like hearing how how it would break down and so i try to be as transparent as possible because like there's the there's the story of the sale that we tell ourselves and there's the reality of the sale because here's the second part of it i
(48:06) talked about the money side but what about the attention headspace energy side because that was another story i was like well if i sell then i'll be able to go do stuff that i really you know i'll get all this attention back and all the stuff right well one the amount of stuff they want you to do is gonna be directly proportional how much stuff you're doing now so if you want to sell the business you got to do it in a way that you're not doing anything and if you're not doing anything then why sell the business yeah and so for me i told
(48:31) myself this story but the reality was they wanted me to show up for quarterlies and be available for the occasional uh like strategic like hey can we touch base about something which is exactly what i currently do yeah so then it's no longer so it's not a question of money because if you're selling for that amount of money you've probably been making money for a while right so it's not going to materially change your net worth unless you're in software in which case it's a different you know game but for most of us here
(48:55) who sell service businesses of some kind you're probably pretty high margin pretty high cash flow and you probably have a decent amount of money after you get this kind of downstream impact of what's actually going to be added to your net worth then the question is what am i going to take with the 40 million and buy that's going to create me because if you're selling for 100 you're probably doing 15 million in in profit right so what am i going to go buy with 40 million that i can get 15 million dollars of profit every year from that i don't have to do anything for right and
(49:23) so i had the story of what the sale was going to mean to me in terms of my reputation which was completely living in other people's eyes which was useless and irrelevant and not true i had the story of money which is this is going to be a big change in my life but when i looked at all the numbers i was like this will change nothing about my life in no way like nothing because unless you get into another stratosphere of wealth yep like it nothing's going to change right so then it goes into the energy and headspace i was like okay well i'm
(49:51) doing the same thing before as i am now and so thing by thing there's the story of what we think it is versus the reality of what it is and so um the the biggest thing that i feel like uh has been my biggest takeaway from this is that when i've looked at and i have a big thing on private equity lessons that are really cool too but it's probably running out of time um i learned from the guy who lives above me so the guy literally lives right here he does 3.
(50:19) 8 billion a year in in revenue he owns his company 100 outright and he does 26 net margins privately held that means he took home 935 million dollars in income last year the secret to success he said i've been doing the same thing for 40 years four years and so what i feel like i i continue to witness is that the wealthiest people in the world and i'm i'm stealing this from charon because they buy and they build and then they refinance so you don't need to sell and the only reason that you would sell is because you think the party's over you think that this thing is no longer going to be a thing anymore
(50:54) long term yeah but if i make a bet that gyms are going to be here in 10 years which i do think gyms are going to be here in 10 years right or your business whatever the spaces is going to be there in 10 years well then what's the reason for selling so and i got this from my closest friend because he was like what problem are you solving and i was like well when i started this process i was in a ton of pain he was like okay are you paying down i was like well not really he's like well what do you think is going to happen post sale he's like it's he's like the sale
(51:22) he's like match the conditions he's like what does your life look like after the sale tactically yeah is there a way that we can make your your life look this way before the sale and keep the damn thing yeah and so then we started looking at it from can we match the conditions and so if you can do that then you we build the thing instead of a really high paying ceo job we now have an asset that is sellable and can can carry debt on our balance sheet income tax free that we can then use to go invest in the other stuff that we want
(51:53) and as the company grows it pays off the debt and you have the thing that you're getting the debt who's continuing to grow as well if that's what you want all right dude i got i got two thoughts in my head i just want to throw them to you and you can do something with them or not yeah two things i see happen a lot in boardroom is people hit their you know their number it's not 100 million often but it's that you know like it's like the dream they've now hit it and they're like well  what the hell do i do now
(52:23) um so that's a really common thing and then the other thing uh talking about exit not exit is really interesting but one of the things you've done to um to get exit a ball is to take the name off the door yeah totally so the name off the door i just want to prepare everyone is like it's like a three-year process so it takes a lot more time than you think it will this is i would just share the things that worked for us all right so uh layla's just said we have no youtube strategy honestly alex just likes making
(52:52) videos in as a great teacher yes that's thank you leila i'm packing the strategy yup that is a strategy um so first thing is we edify customers uh into specialists and the key nuance here is that we don't make generalists because generalist means they can replace you and you actually either have the problem of having another face that's not yours or you have the risk of that face walking but either way it's either a face that doesn't make it sellable which is the same weakness or you have a face that becomes a threat to the business right either way it's not good and so we make siloed experts which
(53:23) we call subject matter experts that specialize in a specific thing so you might have somebody who's really good at sales somebody who's really good at lead nurture somebody's really good at add buying something he's really good at pages whatever the thing is so that you can have people tag those clients and they become kind of the the customer support but like with special specialization beyond that you take some of the better customers you have who want to exit their business and just love your brand and you say hey would it be cool if all
(53:46) you did was talk about this all day they're like dude this is all i want to talk about anyone like i don't like dancing anymore i want to talk about dance right see um and what if we just helped you just help our clients better and then they become the head of product right because if you think about the things that we're probably doing you're probably an expert of some sort so you need to replace the products expertise so first you got to get a person then you get the process the process around this is called the beta process every single private equity
(54:10) firm that we talked to loved this process so you can write it down i actually learned this from management consulting the way that it works is that if we need to solve a problem so there's always a problem to be solved right all these ask your customers there's plenty of problems right so ask them these are uh problems your clients have problems is that what you're talking about yeah yes and then they can upvote the ones that are the most salient to them you take the ones that are the most that are
(54:34) that are plaguing the most people and then you say hey who here is doing really well with this and then you get you you draw uh draw a line and ideally it's depending on the client size for us we look at the top one percent so we've got a thousand locations top one percent is ten people so i want a group of ten to twenty that are in the top echelon so cut the percentage wherever you want to get 10 to 20. and then we do a round table and so the benefit to them is that they get to kind of get a bonus
(54:58) mastermind with you for free in exchange for sharing all their secrets yep what we do then and this is the qualitative process is that you write down everything that each of them says step two is that you reorganize the notes and find the common commonalities and the point here is not to do all of the things they do but to do the things that all of them do and so a lot like the list that i had for reducing churn was like 180 items between all the guys but the one thing that the five things that all of them did is the only five that i took to make
(55:26) the solution and so once you have that you consolidate the solution and then you take the guys who are the bottom 10 percent and some middle guys and you say hey i have now productized the solution and you deliver it the same way you would to your customers which is through a portal and blah blah you don't do anything actually because if you did then it would up the results you say i need you to go through this and we're going to report back in 30 days right you can you know have a cadence with them you know once or twice a week whatever you then measure the results here's what's cool about this
(55:51) one is if it works you just have something that delivers tons of value and you didn't have to generate it it process generated it which means it's not you you're not the guru you're not the face a process drives the innovation yep the second thing is if it doesn't work you still report it because every entrepreneur would love to know failed tests yeah i would love to know if this headline worked at this one even if it didn't i want to know because then i don't want to try it and so it still provides value even if it doesn't work because you proved it didn't work so i
(56:20) just want to share that with you because if some of you guys do experiments and they didn't work share them it's valuable so that's on the product side right on the the marketing side we slowly introduced other people in the ads until eventually it was just them in the ads right and then additionally we obviously started the outbound team so that we had multiple channels so there was like name was one issue which we solved by getting me out of the inbound and then channel dependence was the other issue which we solved through outbound right and so those were the you know those are
(56:55) the two solutions uh on that now i want to share something that i think is more important than everything that i've said so maybe you can unshare the the thing for a moment um when when when i'm sharing the things that are working for the outbound team you can't do it like you can't do it like if you get to a certain point if you're at 10 million or 15 million like you can't do it you need other people and you you can't hire people with the intention of training them to do the thing it's not hey we need to build an outbound team
(57:25) together it's i know that you built two outbound teams for similar type products as me i need you to do the same thing here here's some really favorable upside potential for you uh and i need you to build it from here and i'll give you all the leeway in the world i'm incredibly patient as some as long as i see progress yeah so i have very low patience if i see no progress if i see progress you can go as long as you want as long as we're making progress because i know we will eventually get there and so i think that if you use that as a frame of mind that we're not looking for
(57:55) people who know how to run but we're looking for people who have already run an olympic gold and want to run another one and i'm telling you if you find the players you will be able to build something significantly bigger and this was a breakthrough that took me way too long to learn and it sounds stupid because it's so trite and overstated but like you need to find champions and you got to pay him well and it will be worth it and there's a book i don't know if layla put it in there but there's a book called uh the motive which is a one-sit read it's 130 pages
(58:25) with big text and it it fundamentally changed me as an entrepreneur and i really think everyone should read it because you can read it in an hour and a half and it will change the way you see operating a business because at the end of the day it's just an assembly of people if you want it to be a business if it's you with a thousand helpers it's not a business it's just a really high paying job right and so you got to get people who can do it i know it sounds stupid and it's obvious but like that's the belief is that and i was stuck at mid 30 million for three years
(58:56) and i had mark ford who wrote ready fire aim write his book and he said that the thing that you get stuck at thirty and i like skip to the chapter where he had 30 million as a breakdown and he said if you're stuck here it's because you're the only one that's you're the juju you're the steam you're the fuel behind the growth of this thing but at a certain point there's only so much that one person can push it you get the fourth level of infrastructure in the business and they don't know who you are they don't know your vision they don't know how you do things because they're so far they're so
(59:26) far three levels you're okay fourth it's an organization it's it's beyond tribe right um and so i was going somewhere with that uh when i hit when we hit 30 and i read the book he was like you need to find other people who can own their own p ls and become entrepreneurs within your company and what happens is it becomes a shift from being a business to being a conglomeration and so if you think about amazon they're not amazon's not a business right it's a business of businesses it's a collection of businesses that serve a purpose right
(59:57) and so i had to shift my thinking in terms of how mine worked to we have a number of business units that operate off of one shared spoke of shared services we've got it hr legal finance all in the middle and then we've got profit drivers that drive revenue across the business units and the people who drive those are responsible and compensated based on the growth of their business line or their product loan and so then you get people who can start making 300 grand 400 grand a year 500 a year if they crush it and they should
(1:00:28) because otherwise they'll just start their own version of your business and so if you can give them that you can attract the entrepreneurs um who want to drive growth are really good operators who just have a little bit less risk uh you know tolerance yeah that's epic so that's the so that that's that really goes for any of them so like outbound if you're going outbound or you're like man no one can never market like me there's somebody who's better than you yeah that totally is it's it it's bad for the ego and good for the business um so dude can we talk for a minute about
(1:01:00) um about i don't know what the word post exit post exit not even post exit but like post i've hit my number what yeah i'm bored what's my new role uh you know who am i what do i do that's stuff just for a couple minutes yes so i made a video on youtube about this how passive income was overrated and uh it was because we had completely replaced ourselves in the business and it was still making a lot of money and uh and then we started acquiring other pieces of businesses and whatnot and those have continued to cash flow and i was like what do we do like we have nothing to do all day and so i think what i messed up is that i
(1:01:36) continue to pursue freedom right because that's what all of us here at least i did is freedom was the goal right um and i thought that it was freedom from work when when in reality what i should have done was freedom to do things that i wanted um and for me i want to work and it took me a year to give myself permission to work again because i always thought that if the business relied on me it wasn't a business and i was doing something wrong and that was a story that i was telling myself and i love working and i think
(1:02:09) that if all of us achieve the levels that we have right now it's because we love working we love doing this and we still have this dream of this exit in our minds but it's not it's i'm just it's it's a it's a farce it's not true and you wake up the next day and all you do is you know and there's just an another blunk of money there and you're like well i mean you can only go out to so many nice dinners and nice restaurants and nice shows at some point you're like i gotta do some and so like i would say that you don't need to
(1:02:38) go through it because i spent the last months nine months doing nothing and being bored out of my mind and wondering why i even existed and then it just eventually gave myself permission to just do the things that i like doing and if it just happens to be that it makes money great and for me and again i got this from shiran because it's been it was um so good but like the things that light me up are buying and building is it's expansion and so you know if we end up selling i don't know they gave us the offer this
(1:03:03) morning maybe maybe not um but i do know that whatever it is it's going to be the decision will be aligned with what i am building next yeah and if i think that keeping this will help me build that better faster stronger then i will keep it if i don't think that and i will tell you this is when i was contemplating the sale i i could not see past the decision because it was an unmade decision it was like black it was like i lost my vision i couldn't see past this unmade decision because it was this variable this huge fork in the road in my life i immediately and i you not i immediately knew
(1:03:38) what we needed to do to grow the other company to 30 million in ebitda and what we're going to do for the new company because i'm still building the next company no matter what um and so i think that the season that i just went through and i feel like it took me two and a half years um was transitioning from ceo to owner and it took a lot longer and it was a lot more emotionally difficult a lot more emotionally difficult than i expected why identity you know um i mean layla had a conversation with our team yesterday like it's so nice that
(1:04:09) you guys are gone did you say that to them or they said that to you no they said it to us they're like i don't want to offend you guys sorry thanks i thought it was like i'm so great not having you guys in my life sorry no i just thought it was interesting because it you know i think both alex and i had always prided ourselves on you know for me it was like i have to be the example i have to be working my ass off doing more than everybody else so that they you know because they're all a players and so i want them to see that i'm doing the same yeah and i was
(1:04:39) talking to one of our our guys who's really stepped up and he's one of the you know one of the highest ranked people in the company and i check in with him once a month rather than you know the because he's not the ceo or ceo and um i said like how can i support you how can me and alex help you know just want to know at the end of the call he said can i be really honest with you and i was like yeah he said it's really nice not having you guys around he's like yeah he's like you know everyone feels so much more creative you
(1:05:09) know they have to be way more self-reliant and all of us have to be able to step up so much more since you guys have stepped out and so we're just growing so much as a team we're so much stronger and i was like man like everything that you do to get to like 90 of the finish line the last 10 requires you do the complete opposite yeah that's fascinating so everything about every entrepreneur every level of entrepreneurship based on my observation my personal experience has been it's it's relinquishing control or at least the perception of control
(1:05:39) and so you know when you're when you're at zero to a million you're giving up can you force yourself alex because here's what i'd love to i'd love to do and i i think you're going there but i just want to yeah i want a mind meld so we've got this journey and we've got the you know the zero to one and then we've got the one to what's the next jump is it three ten ten perfect and i say it's like 30 to 50.
(1:06:02) it kind of depends on the company perfect and then we'll go up from there a lot of the people on this on this line right now are kind of in this space and we've got some in in this space but can you just do like top three for this for this space right here yeah to get past the million you have to give up um everything with fulfillment so customer success customer fulfillment right yeah exactly life fulfillment you have to keep up your phone um i mean that's the that's the the the key part you're also giving up if you're going one to ten you can't sell anymore right you need someone you need a team of people who are selling on your
(1:06:41) behalf so it's you have to not only be able to sell you have to teach people to sell you have to know how to recruit sales people you have to know how to manage sales people you have to know how to send sales people um and continue to get them uh performing right and that's a different skill right we know how to sell how many people be like god i close these people so easily and no one else can sound like me it's like it feels good but you're still way poorer than somebody's got 20 sales guys closing for
(1:07:04) so like just get over it like there are people who are better than you at closing because all they're going to do all day is close you're still running a business yeah so you got to stop selling it's my opinion that 10 to 10 to 30ish is you have to give up the marketing you have you really have to get beyond that and then at going 50 plus you know 30 to 50 plus it's like you have to give up the leading which is difficult right and the zero to one i'm just i'll throw it in there for fun it's like you gotta stop doing then you go to managing
(1:07:34) and then you go to leading and then you go to decision making um and so you could say leading and decision making decision making is above leading that's kind of the ultimate i would say exit is that people are making decisions on your behalf oh my bad i got this thrown around alex would you say for 50 plus because this is what i was thinking i was making a present like this the other day and uh i think for 50 plus you go from being the leader of the company to you lead like the one soul leader but you're actually just the resource yeah you're a guy you're just a guy you're an
(1:08:03) advisor yeah you provide capital and you provide connections network vendors that's what like pe does that's what you know the big guys yeah this is great so can i just say something to cap this real quick is that so if you're stuck right now you have to think what do what am i holding on to that i need to give up great question and when you're giving away control i'm not saying okay well i'm not going to be involved in sales anymore it's like no you have to learn how to put a good leader in there who knows training systems who knows how to recruit who knows how to hire and knows how to send you know how to keep culture
(1:08:35) and build a team that can that can work together right those are a lot of attributes and you know your skill is how do you find that person because because each one of the skills begs the next skill you have to learn how to close you got to learn how to teach other people to close right then once you have other people close you got to learn how to teach lots of people to close and maintain them then you got to learn how to recruit a sales manager who knows how to do that right and so each of those are kind of the levels and they also mirror if you think about it they
(1:08:59) mirror the levels of of organization in the chart right if you're doing it then there's there's this is you if you're managing it's one right if you're managing a manager is two right if you're now leading this you you're leading people who have business units right it's it's three right so and then finally you know you're advising and you're letting other leaders lead directors who have managers and customers and so right now i think this is our fifth level of hierarchy uh within the organizations and so
(1:09:31) they now function as assets that produce cash flow yeah mini innovators a million this is so great

How to Grow Your Business So FAST it Makes Your Accountant Nervous - YouTube

Transcript:
(00:00) I'm going to show you how to grow your business so fast this year that it makes your accountant nervous. And maybe you're not growing as fast as you want right now. And it's probably because you're trying to fix a problem that might not actually exist. And so most businesses have one of two core problems and they don't know which one they have.
(00:18) And so I'm going to show you how to identify which one of the two you have and how to fix it. I'm Alexi. I own acquisition.com a portfolio of companies that generate north of 200 plus million a year as of 2024. So whenever I look at a business, I always want to understand this one triage question up front, which is, is this a business that is supply constrained or is this a business that's demand constrained? So here's the big idea. You can either have too few customers or too little capacity, but never both at the same time.
(00:41) And so how do you know which problem you have? So a demand problem means that you have space but not enough customers. So like a restaurant without empty tables or a calendar with open slots or you know product sitting on shelves, you built it but people aren't coming. So a supply problem would be different. It means that you have customers but not enough capacity. So you have waiting list.
(00:59) You have to turn people away or you can't make products fast enough or you can't take on new clients. They're coming in but you can't serve them all. So how do you know which problem you have? And so here's the simple test. If you doubled your ad budget tomorrow or you doubled your outreach or you doubled your content, would you be able to double your sales or would you just create a mess that you couldn't even handle? So if it create a mess, then you have a supply problem. If it would double your sales, then you have a demand problem. And so the difference between businesses
(01:23) that grow and those that don't isn't just the hard work, but it's working hard on the right problem. And so, as Warren Buffett says, there's nothing worse than doing well with something that shouldn't be done at all.
(01:36) So, I'm going to give you a number of businesses that are constrained and give you some examples, and then you need to figure out which category you think it's in, supply or demand. So, as we dive into these examples, I'm going to give you some obvious ones, and I'm going to give you some that are a little bit trickier. Now, the good news is that even if it's an obvious constraint, it doesn't make the problem any less painful.
(01:53) and the solutions any less applicable to your business because if you're in a supply constraint or demand constraint, it absolutely is taking up all your attention is where all the pain in your life is coming from. And so I'm going to break down the different strategies we can use for different types of businesses that are in each of these situations.
(02:04) So let me give you the first one. So think about a consultant who's completely booked. So full schedule, 3 months ahead, working 60 hours a week, always stressed out. Yet despite all the work, his or her income has stopped growing, right? So what does he do with his little free time? Well, he makes more content, he runs more ads, and he tries to get more leads.
(02:21) He's trying to fix a demand problem that he doesn't have. So, the truth of it is he doesn't have a marketing problem. He has a supply problem that could also be a pricing problem. So, which is it? We'll dive in. So, you might think, wait, that's crazy. I need more clients to make more money. That consultant might think, and this might be you, too.
(02:39) But what if you try something different? So, he has three options. So, number one is he can just raise his prices by a lot. And so most people when they raise their prices, they're like, "I might add." I literally had a phone call earlier today. Someone said they were gonna add a quarter, like 25 cents to their shipping. And they were like holding their breath.
(02:55) I'm like, "Bro, add $3 and see what happens." Most people are so afraid of raising prices because they're afraid they're going to lose their customers. But if you're in a supply constrained business, it is one of the primary paths to fixing it. So if you're going to do it, raise your prices by a lot. We're talking 50%, 100%. So singles, doubles in terms of how much more you raise your prices.
(03:11) The second thing he could do is create basically change the service to delivery ratio. So instead of having just one-on-one services that are being rendered, he can do one to many or one to small group, right? So he changes how many customers he can take on personally.
(03:27) And the third is that he just hires and trains other consultants, right? So he keeps the ratio the same, but he just adds more headcount to his business. And so there's basically the three things that he can do to solve the supply constraint. Now, he might be afraid to raise prices that much, and he might be like, "Oh my god, I'm losing all my clients." But what's actually going to happen? So, let's play it out. So, let's say about 30% of his clients leave.
(03:46) But if he doubled his prices and 30% of his clients left, he'd make more money while working with fewer people. And so, here's the double benefit of this is that number one, he makes more and he services fewer. So, he also frees up time. It literally kills two birds with one stone. He literally makes more money and has more time.
(04:04) Which is why if you want a supply constraint business, pricing is one of the strongest levers that you should consider pulling and usually a lot more than you think you should. And now here's the secondary, the tertiary benefit of doing that. Now that you have that extra time, you actually have time to create even more capacity.
(04:15) And so if you need to have time to say, okay, you know what? I'm going to increase my service delivery ratio, right? I'm going to figure out what tech I need to do so that I can expand how many people I can take on.
(04:28) Or I'm going to create a training system so that I can bring on new consultants and I can bring them on faster so that they can start taking on clients for me. In either of those situations, the net result would be he'd make more money per hour and bringing this extra leverage in would multiply that. And so by doing this, he's fixing the real problem, which is supply, not demand.
(04:45) And so he could double his income working 15 fewer hours a week and then double it again after he has brought in more consultants or expanded the ratio. And so the main lesson here is that sometimes the path to growth isn't more clients, it might be better clients. So if you have the opportunity, instead of trying to work harder, appropriately charge what the market is saying they want to pay you, and you're the one getting in the way.
(05:03) So that was a simple one. Let's wrap it up a little bit. So second example, think about a software company. So imagine a software company that helps service businesses schedule appointments. So the CEO proudly shows off all the new features that they're building and they're like, "Our product's going to be the best." And he's like, "No one's going to match us.
(05:19) " But looking at their numbers shows something very different, right? So people who try their product love it and customers stay a long time. The product works great, but they're still not growing. So what's the real problem? Is it demand constrainted or is it supply constraint? Well, it's demand constrained. They spend only 5% of their money on marketing while their competitors spending 20 to 30%. is they built a great product, but almost nobody knows it exists.
(05:36) They're fighting against irrelevance. And so they have a ding-ding demand problem, but they're putting all their money into the product. And now this can be tricky because of course you need to continue to improve the product. And if you keep improving the product, you might get to a point where the word of mouth alone can bring you in more customers.
(05:53) Now, the big question mark on this one, and I want to make a clear point here, and this is something that I've it took me a long time to figure out, is that I've been on both polar extremes here, where I'm like, marketing is the only thing that matters. everything else is irrelevant.
(06:06) And on the other extreme, it's like product is the only thing that matters and the product is good enough, then you shouldn't need marketing. The asterisk is you need to have a product that the customers of that product have high surface area exposure to other people that could use that product. So, let me explain. Facebook, for example, is for people. And so, if you talk to other people, you have something that you can refer them to.
(06:25) But if you're like I do IT consulting for Fortune 100 companies, the likelihood that you're going to get like referrals from that, I mean you can, but it's not like you're going to get viral growth. I mean for sure word of mouth is be a part of it, but you're probably going to have to go out and get business.
(06:43) And so there is an element where at some point, especially the more niched you are, especially the more higher end you are, the more you are going to likely be able to keep customers because your product's really good, but it's not going to necessarily grow the business. So if looking at the business from the constraints perspective, we'd be like, okay, let's pull some resources, cash flow, talent, from continuing to invest in the product where we currently have no one churning. So like no one's leaving, everyone loves it. But the thing is is that we want more people in. And so let's go get more
(07:08) customers. Again, I'm not saying make your product bad. I'm saying let that dog lie and then reallocate some resources so you can let more people know about the stuff. Because if the product is that good, then you might be able to just double the customers in just a few months without even changing the product and people continue to stay and pay.
(07:27) And fundamentally, we have this big misconception that the harder we work on something, the better it necessarily is. But often times products get way worse through addition. And so often times you can improve a product a lot by just deleting things. And from a service perspective, if you have a service business, just letting the team work, right? because the constant change often times actually erodess the product quality and the service quality more than the incremental improvement that you think this new change is going to create. And so some of the best years of
(07:50) of different businesses that I've owned have been when I'm like not super involved with it because of like, hey, I've already done the thing. Let them just keep getting better at sales. Let the team get better at onboarding. Let the team get better at customer success and just don't mess with it.
(08:03) Just let the natural improvement of humans improve the performance of the business. So, in this particular business, the founder would likely take their free time and put all of it into getting more customers. And they'd have to just figure out, am I going to run ads? Am I going to do outbound? Am I going to do affiliates? Am I going to make content? Which of these strategies am I going to use in order to get more people in the door? So, let's walk through example number three. Let's say you're a brick-andmortar restaurant. You serve food. So, imagine a 2hour waits on
(08:29) Saturday, but they're empty on a Tuesday afternoon. Same business, different problems depending on how you look at it and more importantly when you look at it. So is a supply or demand constrainted. H a tricky one. Honestly, the answer is they're mispriced.
(08:48) And because of that, we actually they have enough capacity, but it's not allocated to the right times. And so in this business, it's a little bit of both. And the nice thing is is we can solve it. So let's imagine the steakhouse, let's just call it a steakhouse, loves marketing. And he keeps saying, "We need more ads. We need more specials. We need more customers.
(08:59) " And so he's spending thousands on ads every single month. But this is the twist. On Saturday and Friday nights, people are waiting 90 plus minutes for a table and they got to turn people away at the door. And so more marketing would just mean more angry people who got dressed up, pulled up to the restaurant they wanted to go to and can't get in.
(09:17) So here's three different ways that we could solve this potential supply issue that only happens on certain days. So number one is we could just raise prices on Friday and Saturday. So you give a different menu for weekends than you do during weekdays. And that extra increase could have a dramatic effect on the business.
(09:35) Restaurants typically run lower margins than most businesses. So let's just say they run 10% margins. A 20% price increase would triple the profit on those two days. But here's where it gets kind of nasty. Well, if those two days, Friday and Saturday, where half the revenue of the business is being generated, then you one and a halfx the profit of the business just from increasing the prices in those two days.
(09:52) But what are some of the downstream effects that happen from that? Well, if people know that on the weekends it's a little bit more, what happens to that demand? he's good at marketing.
(10:04) Some of them might not come, but a certain percentage would be like, I love this restaurant, but I don't want to pay extra for it. So, all of a sudden, I'm going to spread during the week. And so, what we do is we actually spread out the demand to meet the capacity. Now, what are some other things that the restaurant owner could do? They could let people pay extra to skip the line.
(10:17) This wouldn't necessarily solve the constraint, but it would make the business more money. Or they could just stay open later because they might find out they're like, "Hey, you know what? We close at 9:00, but we still have lines." It's like, "All right, well, let's close at 11:00.
(10:29) " If you did all three of those things, we're talking like 100% increases in profit, sometimes more, just from three small changes. And the real reason is that originally he was like, "We need to market more cuz we're not busy during the week." And all he was doing is just keep jamming more into Fridays and Saturdays where he was capacity constrained. By solving the right problem, he actually can unlock the growth in the business. And if you're in one of these positions, let me give you a little tip.
(10:48) People hate getting prices raised on them. Of course they do. But what can you do that actually has the same net effect to the business? Instead of saying weekends are 20% more, you can say weekdays are 20% less. People are happy to get a discount and then pay normal on Fridays and Saturdays. So it's all how you frame it.
(11:06) And so if you're in one of those businesses and you're thinking about how you want to do it, think about it like that. Let's do example four. So online business. So let's imagine this is an online fitness equipment store during COVID. All right? So home workout boom, all the stores are empty, right? And so overnight their sales go up 4x, right? Sounds amazing.
(11:22) Well, for anybody who's in in some of these businesses that had disproportionate demand during that time, you would prefer to sell out and have that pain, then have no one buying. So, if I had to pick, I'd rather be supply constrained than demand constrained. But both suck. Back to the example, they sell out of everything. Their suppliers can't keep up.
(11:40) But instead of focusing all their energy on getting more inventory and improving their supply, they keep running ads, right? They keep marketing. They think, "Oh, we just need to ride this wave. Maybe we'll pre-sell. We'll keep selling more and more." Well, the result is that shipping times go from two weeks to eight weeks. Bad for you. start pouring in.
(11:52) Customer service gets swamped, angry emails, and all they end up doing is just making the problem worse with each new sale because they aren't fixing the real issue. Supply constrained or demand constrained. Well, this was a little easier after the last one's a little harder. It's supply constraint business. This is a pure supply constraint and it's physical product. So, let's talk about how we can break through it.
(12:10) Now, once they realize this, if they were to actually tackle the problem, there's basically only two core things that this business owner could do. Number one is sell something different. Number two is going to be increase the supply of the business. So, I'm going to break that down. So, the sexy thing to do would be say, okay, we have all these customers that just bought our products from us.
(12:29) Is there something that's intangible that we can sell them that we're not going to run out of to immediately generate more cash flow? And maybe that cash flow could help us pay our vendors more aggressively to put us at the front of the line. Now, some of you might hear this and be like, "What? A vendor would would skip a line? Lines are as old as time, right? They are the only fair system in the world." No, of course you can pay to get at the front of the line.
(12:46) and say, "Hey, if I paid you 20% more, do you think you put my stuff first?" Of course. Right? Money talks. And so, how would you generate this? So, I'd be like, "Okay, I've got this fitness equipment. Maybe I go reach back out and sell a warranty with it." Maybe I talk to a couple of fitness app developers and I say, "Hey, you guys have a product.
(13:03) I have all these customers that just bought this thing. Do you think I could white label your thing or just do some sort of affiliate deal where I can sell your product to my audience?" Right? In each of these situations, the affiliate deal, I'm tapping into somebody else's supply and say, "Cool, you've already got supply.
(13:16) Well, let me sell it through my distribution." Alternatively, I have my distribution and I could sell an insurance product, something like that that doesn't really have there's no supply associated with it. I could maybe sell some services on top.
(13:27) Be like, "Hey, are there other things that you're looking at? Are you thinking about getting flooring? Are you thinking about how you want to design the gym? Do you want to decorate the gym?" Like, these are all different things that we could sell to that existing base rather than continue to bring more people in who even if they had the money, we can't deliver on the core service.
(13:40) So in all of those situations, these are ways you could easily generate the cash to then have leverage with suppliers or reinvest in the supply chain so that you could get your stuff to you faster. And if you look at some of the biggest e-commerce companies in the world or just physical products businesses, they have very dialed supply chain. They have multiple vendors.
(13:57) They have multiple kind of points of failure or rather not they have redundancies to eliminate single points of failure within the system. So I was talking to a friend of mine who's looking at buying a very large supplement company that you've heard of.
(14:09) One of the big things that he was able to do is like one of his core competencies is that he has an amazing supply and so he gets his raw materials and he buys better than just about anybody else. And so if you're like, "Oh, I just it's supply chain issues." It's like that's the core of the business, right? Like if you're in a physical products business, supply chain is it's the constraint. If you have a great product, it will become the constraint. Or if you're good at marketing, it will become the constraint.
(14:28) And if you want to succeed at product businesses that are physical, you got to get good at both of those things. So this is the business you're really in. I want to be really clear. This is definitely not me advocating for you having a woman in the red dress.
(14:40) In this very hypothetical scenario of somebody using CO and they can't do anything else, they need to generate cash so that they can move things forward. I'm okay with what I would consider like one-time or short-term options that you can generate cash in the business. It's the reality of business. Sometimes you got to make those plays rather than saying, "Oh, we're going to start another business.
(14:56) " And that's why with each of those things, the insurance product or white labeling someone else's thing, both those things don't really require you to do much more than just introduce it to your existing base. Sell them, take the split, take the cash, and then reinvest in the thing that actually is limiting the business.
(15:08) If you're hearing this, you're like, "Well, that's nice for a consultant, that's nice for a restaurant, that's nice for an online store, but my business is special. I'm a home services business. This couldn't possibly apply to me." So, let's say you're a plumber and you're running Google PVC and you're booking, you know, every slot out in your calendar and your vans are always on the road, right? And technicians are are working overtime and even with the overtime because you got to pay time and a half or whatever your overtime rates are, profits are starting to compress. So, it's like, wait a
(15:32) second, it's like we're fully booked and we're just not that profitable. So, this particular owner might think, oh, I need to get more customers or I need to get more technicians. But, if we look under the hood a little bit, and this is common, it actually isn't either of those things. You're like, "Wait, what is it?" Well, let's walk through it.
(15:51) So, we might find out that their plumbers finish the jobs quickly, but they rarely offer additional services or upgrades. They're not selling them into the membership on a long-term basis. They're not looking for a repair schedule that they're going to come back. They're not looking or asking for the other units in the house if they need need to take a look at those too.
(16:10) And so, the thing is is that they have a supply problem with their sales skills rather than how many jobs they can do. And so if the exact same number of customers could get sold twice the services, but they're already there, it only takes a little bit more time for them to do the delivery. They could basically better utilize their existing supply to increase revenue and profit within the business.
(16:32) And so what we're actually diving deeper into is that there's basically this Mondo decision tree that ends up, if you've seen any of my cash guys episodes, the first thing I typically look for is this supplier demand. Once I'm in the okay, maybe it's a demand issue. Oh, maybe it's a supply issue. We start diving deeper. It's like, okay, well, maybe they're mispriced or maybe they don't have enough talent or the existing talent there isn't selling enough per job or basically average cart value isn't high enough. And because of that, this particular owner can't spend to get
(16:55) more customers. He can't spend to get more technicians. So, what do you do in that situation? I can't spend to get more of either because profits are thin. Well, we have to either raise the prices, but if they're competitive, then it's like, well, then maybe we just sell more work.
(17:06) And so, fundamentally, this is how you dive through and start diagnosing some of the issues within a business. But the actual constraint, like what would this owner have to do? Well, they would start teaching their plumbers simple sales skills and give them a two, threeline script that says once you finish this, ask them if they want this. Right? They'd role play back and forth every morning.
(17:23) They meet, they see what percentage of people they upsell to a second job. And all of a sudden, they're like, "Wait, we're upselling 50% now to another job." Well, guess what happens to revenue? Goes up by 50%. Guess what else happens? If costs remain just about the same, a disproportionate amount of that revenue drops to the bottom line.
(17:40) Most businesses that run paper thin margins and what I would consider established industries are just missing a core part of the business. And so they're doing like step one and not step two. And because of that, step two is where all the profit is.
(17:52) This particular instance, a lot of times people think the only way to grow is so you get more customers, right? But sometimes the best move isn't getting more customers, it's making more from the customers you've got. So this home services company, they are barely making enough money and they're fully allocated for their technicians. Are they demand constrained or are they supply constrained? Tough. The technical answer is that they would be demand constrained in my opinion.
(18:11) I'll explain why. So if they had more money per customer, they would be able to make more money and have more profit to then go out and hire more headcount. And so sometimes you're in a rock and a hard place where you're kind of like at this stalemate between supply and demand, right? It happened one of our earlier examples, too, where you're like, well, we're barely making enough money.
(18:35) we need more technicians, but we can't afford technicians because we're not making enough money. When you're in one of those situations, you have a strategic problem, which is typically going to be around price or the actual products that you're offering, like this instance, is that they had a sales issue. They're not upselling enough customers to other services while they're in the house because it doesn't cost them much more once they send the guy out to the additional services.
(18:53) And those additional services make all the difference in terms of net profit for the business. Once that occurs, now that unlocks, okay, well, do we want to become more efficient or other guys? Which would then be truly unlock the supply constraint, but they now have the cash flow to solve it. So, real quick, if you're in one of those rock and hard place scenarios where you're like, I can't grow enough, but I can't spend the money to grow, or I I need this help, but I need money to buy the help. If I had more customers, I could afford it, but I can't serve more customers. These are classic hard and rock place
(19:18) scenarios. And believe it or not, I just want to make you feel better. Like two-thirds of businesses, when I ask them like, "Have you been at the same revenue for two years?" A lot of them say yes. And so if that's you, don't worry, it's solvable.
(19:30) All right? And so I put together with my team this $100 million scaling road map. You can check it out. So it's basically all the stages of business that we've broken down for scaling a company from basically zero to 500 plus headcount. And it's all the stages that we found with our businesses and specifically more important to you, where we got stuck and how we got through it.
(19:46) And so if you would like a custom scaling roadmap for your business right now, go to acquisition.com/roadmap. You can get it. It's absolutely free. Just type in your business information. It asks for a bunch of things just so we can personalize it for you. And on the thank you page, if you're like, man, I would love to make sure that what I'm going to do is the right move. Book a call.
(20:02) I'd love to have our team take a look at the business and maybe have you fly out here to our headquarters if it makes sense. To be fair, this is only for business owners. If you're not there, by all means, go enjoy the scaling road map. But otherwise, let's get back to it. So, I'll give you a different example.
(20:14) So, I had a business who came out that was doing some sort of enterprise software for like commercial buildings. So, something cleaning and efficiency related. I can't remember, but I do absolutely recall why the business was stuck. Now, this founder had been stuck at the same revenue level for years, like eight years. He could not crack this revenue level.
(20:31) And so, what we did is we looked at basically all the metrics of the acquisition funnel. And so, he had an outbound method because he had lists of what commercial buildings were in the area that he could service. And I went through it.
(20:43) I was like, "Okay, how many of these are, you know, reachouts you sending a day? What's the messaging?" And all that stuff sounded good. And I was like, "Okay, so how many demonstrations are you doing per week of your, you know, product or service?" and he was doing like 10 demonstrations a week and you're closing two a year and he was like, "Yeah." I'm like, "So, you're closing two out of 500 demos." He's like, "Well, when you say it like that, it kind of sucks.
(21:01) " I'm like, "Well, yeah, it kind of sucks, right?" But the thing is is that in this particular instance, they weren't really even demand constrained. They were basically I mean, they are functionally demand constrained, but the issue was not actually the amount of people who said they were interested in the product or the number of reachouts they were doing or even the scripting of the conversation they're having.
(21:18) They just couldn't close. And so the leaders were like when they came to talk to me, they were like, "Hey, I think we need to hire more sales people." And the literally the plan was to double the sales team, right? So they're going to double the sales team because they're like, "Hey, we listen to your stuff. Do more.
(21:29) Like we're double the sales team so we can double our sales." I was like, "My god, let's not do that. Let's just figure out how we can get 500 demonstrations turn into 100 deals instead of two. It's a 50x right there. And this is an unbelievably valuable business." And the reason they've been able to stay at that level is because they had like 98% revenue retention.
(21:46) and you're like no one ever left the business cuz it was such a complex thing that they were establishing and setting up. And so the thing is is that right now if you look at your process you might find that you're like oh actually we have plenty of leads and people are scheduling calls and they are showing up but they're just not buying or they are scheduling and they're not showing or they're opting in but they're not scheduling.
(22:03) And so you might have this massive leak in your existing demand process that creates the demand drain and then people mistakenly think, "Oh, I think I'm going after the wrong market or oh, I think my my ads suck or oh, I think the targeting is off.
(22:19) " But if people are the right type of people that are opting in, we have a sales process problem. That's where the demand leak is happening. And so rather than say, "Oh, let's double our ad spend or let's double our sales team," like, we got to fix the problem.
(22:34) So after I dug into the business a little bit more, I'll tell you where the actual real nugget was was that they were presenting to the wrong people. So the way this particular business worked is that they had people who own the buildings who wanted to save money and then they had building managers, the guys who actually like ran the buildings and those were not the same person.
(22:51) And so they have something called the principal agent problem, which is basically the person who has to do the work versus the person who makes the decision are two different people. And so all the owners were like, "Yeah, go save me money." But then when it got to that the the manager of the building, they were like, "I don't want to do any more work." Because all this meant for them, they're not going to get paid more. And they had the decision-m power, even though the owners were the ones who were writing the check.
(23:09) And so basically what we did was we rescripted the process to essentially elevate the status of the manager and make it all about them. Just like what business are you really in? It's what customer do you really serve? And so that was kind of the million and in this instance probably $10 million plus question that we got to answer with that business.
(23:26) And so by simply redefining that sales process for that specific avatar, that is what unlocked growth. So let's go completely other direction. Let's say that you're an online course creator. You're a YouTuber and you sell some sort of digital product. And let's say that you've got students and you've got high completion rates and you get great results and people leave great reviews.
(23:44) Okay, here's the problem. They're breaking even. How could this even happen when you have a product that cost you nothing? This particular guy thinks, "Oh, the problem's marketing." So keep spending more on fancy funnels, paid ads, but every time like a new customer comes in, they barely make any profit after they recoup ad costs. So what's the real problem? Well, there's a number of things.
(24:01) So let's break down each of them. So either he's priced too low, right? So often times you'll find that you can double price and maybe, you know, sales might go down by 15%. If that happens, then it's like boom, we've we fixed the business just with that one pricing issue. Sometimes it could just be that the ads suck, which is a real one, right? The ads suck or the ads are good, but they're outdated because they're not making sufficient ads. So it's either quality of ads problem or quantity of ads problem or both. So it's a supply demand constraint. Well, we're
(24:25) talking about raising his prices. But isn't raising prices what we do when we have supply constraints, right? Because you raise the prices then fewer people buy. You create space and you also create profit.
(24:37) Well, then why would we raise the prices when we have a demand constraint? Because we can't afford to get more customers. And so we need to raise the prices so that we can spend more money in ads so that we can get more customers. Because fundamentally, if we're answering the question, could he 2x the number of customers he's handling? Well, yeah. It's a course. It's very easy. They get a login. the delivery is not the constraint of this particular problem.
(24:56) Even though we have a demand constraint, we might have a similar solution to a supply constraint business. So, if he tried raising his prices from, let's say, $1,000 to $3,000 for his main course, people around him might think he's crazy. No one's going to pay that, you know, whatever, right? But what would actually happen? So, sales might drop by 15 or 20%. Which would mean his revenue nearly triples overnight.
(25:14) But then by creating a high-end version for $10,000, which another 10% of the market might happily purchase, he might get another $1,000 per sale. So he goes from $1,000 to $4,000 total per sale. 10% time 10,000 is an extra,000. We had 3,000 is the new change. And that almost made up for the sales drop that he had in terms of number of units.
(25:30) And so same content, same marketing, very different results, all because he found and fixed the actual problem of the business. Now let's say alternatively in his special snowflake market, he can't raise the price. Fine. So, in this instant, we say, "Okay, well, what UGC or what user generated content are you you're currently putting out?" He also makes his own content.
(25:48) We're like, "Okay, well, what are your best performers?" These ones. Okay. Why are your ads not those? I thought they had to be different. Take your best organic content, add a 5-second CTA at the end, run it as a paid ad. Especially if you know that some organic content has generated sales, do more of that and put money behind it.
(26:06) At the very least, if you're looking at your process of how people are are getting into your business, for the love of God, make sure that when you're sending traffic to a page, it's actually structured to convert the traffic. You sending people to a beautiful homepage, have the beautiful homepage, but that's not the first thing they're going to see.
(26:23) Get their information and then give them the thing they want and then they can go and peck around the site, look around. The thing is is that they'll have time to look at it later. But right now we need to convert because people have very large motivation for very short periods of time when they see marketing and in that very short window is when we need to maximize. My website acquisition.
(26:36) com I think is hideous. And I get people DMing me every day be like I redesign your site for you and I'm like thanks for that. And the thing is is that could my site be improved? Yes. The resources required to redo the site.
(26:53) It's going to be such a pain in the ass because every single department is going to have their own two cents of what they think it should look like. we're going to have to make hundreds of decisions on something that I then say, "Okay, with all of these decisions and all of these resources, is there something else we could do that would grow the business more?" And oftentimes, the answer is yes.
(27:11) And so for me, I've had notoriously ugly homepages because at the end of the day, they typically convert fine. And even though I'm like, "Oh my god, this is so ugly." I just deal with it because at the end of the day, it's not the constraint. And so I would say more times than not and like you hear this and it seems obvious when you're looking at someone else's business, but when you look at your own, what you end up doing is you spend all your time doing the stuff you love because you love it, but the business might not need it.
(27:34) And so you spend all your time solving problems that don't need to be solved and investing resources, the very limited resources you have as a small business owner towards problems that simply increase potential but not throughput. Let's say you've got four lanes, one lane, and then four lanes, right, on a highway. Okay.
(27:50) Well, if I take this one from four lanes to five lanes, is the traffic going to go faster? No. But this is what happens when you improve your website and you don't get any increase in throughput in terms of your front-end optimization. Like you don't have a higher conversion rate because of that. You can't handle more customers because of that. And so all you did was you just spent time and money to increase potential.
(28:08) So with this business, is it a supply or demand constraint? Well, this one is a demand constraint, but less so that they don't have strong enough marketing. They didn't have strong enough sales. So the process itself and more specifically they were almost like avatar constrained. They were trying to sell to the wrong person. They were convincing the business owners all day long. But the problem was the business owners weren't the ones making the decision.
(28:26) The guy, the foreman of the factory, the guy on the floor was the one who was making the call. So he's the real customer. So let's do the next example. Let's say that you can vibe code because of cursor that came out. You're like, I can make an app in two seconds, right? And so this madeup mobile app company shows, you know, if you build it, they will come, right? It's the most dangerous myth in business, right? And so imagine that company has built an incredible product that's easy to use.
(28:48) All right, the tech team is world class. The app's fast. It's beautiful. It does all the good stuff, right? But user growth is painfully slow. So they would only have a few thousand users when they really need millions in order to make this business model work. Now, you might be like, thousands and millions? Oh my god, I would just want my first 10 customers. Everything that I'm talking about right now applies. Just add or remove zeros. But the same concepts apply.
(29:06) All right, so let's say the founders are blaming the product. They're like, maybe we need more features, right? Maybe it's too hard to get started. So, is this app demand or supply constraint? Obviously, demand constraint. And so, they're fixing the wrong stuff. And so, the app isn't the issue. Awareness is the problem, right? They're spending almost nothing on marketing and relying instead on word of mouth.
(29:24) And so, they have this serious demand problem, but they're putting all their effort into product. And so, they've shifted that focus to the right problem if they could change. So, let's let's walk through what they might consider. So, number one is they could probably optimize their app store listing.
(29:36) So, if you convert a higher percentage of traffic, then a couple things happen. One is that you get ranked higher because your sales velocity goes up, but also Apple also push you more traffic, right? Because they get a percentage. So they want the highest converting products to be on the store in the highest and most prevalent positions so that they make the most money too. That's just organically.
(29:54) On top of that, they could pay for user acquisition. They could take some of that extra talent that they're focusing on the back end and say, "Okay, well, how do we maximize downloads and activation?" They could go for an affiliate play and say, "Okay, what apps already exist that serve this exact market? Is there a way we could run a banner ad on somebody else's product which absolutely exists? You could run into marketplaces where you can buy those types of ads, right? On top of that, you just build really strong referral program depending on the nature of the product. And so in each of these
(30:18) ways, these would be things that they could do to capture more demand on the front end rather than being like, okay, well, no one's leaving and everyone loves the product. We get reviews, but it's still not growing fast enough. And so within a a year, if you just shifted all that effort there, the user base could grow 20x larger, right? or 100 times larger, whatever, because the product was good enough.
(30:37) They just needed to solve their real problem, which at the time is demand. Now, again, so let's wrap this together. Is it always a supply or demand constraint issue? The answer is yes, but it's not always going to be the same one at the same time. Meaning, as soon as you solve a demand constraint, guess what happens next? You have a supply constraint, right? And then you'll solve your supply constraint and be like, "Okay, finally we we got all of our inventory back in place. The warehouses are full.
(31:02) We're not running any ads. Oh my god. Now that the fitness equipment, you know, is back in place. It's like, oh my god, we got to spin this up. Now that we just hired four more accountants, now we can we can take on more clients. Oh wait, we don't have any more clients. Now we got to go get them. And so it's this accordion, this back and forth that happens. It's the natural flow of business.
(31:20) But when people get stuck, it's because they stayed working on the demand constraint after the demand constraint went away and it became a supply constraint. This ping-ponging, this back and forth and the lack of awareness of the founder realizing that the constraint has moved in the business is why businesses will get stuck for years.
(31:38) And so, if you have been stuck for a long time, it's not that you're an idiot. It's not that you're doing something wrong. It's likely that you started solving a constraint, you solved it, and you solved it so well, you created another one, but you didn't switch to where your attention was being allocated. And so, if you're like, "Okay, well, where am I at today?" Here's an easy battery list that you can kind of walk through.
(31:56) So, first answer these questions honestly. If more customers showed up tomorrow, could you serve them? Well, at the standard that you want, yes or no. Two, are you turning away business or putting people on waiting lists? Yes or no? Are your most profitable time slots or products always sold out? Yes or no? Do you run out of inventory or having long shipping delays if you're in physical products? Yes or no. If you answered yes to any of those, you likely have a supply problem.
(32:19) And so, if that's you, this is what you focus on. The easiest one first is raising prices, right? It's the fastest fix for a supply problem. The second thing is that you could add capacity, right? The next is that you could just clean up operations. This means you get leverage for the existing people.
(32:38) So, it's like how do I get my one person to be able to deliver for three people instead of one-on-one, right? This then creates tech systems behind that. There's three ways you can solve the constraint on a service business outside of pricing. Number one is technology, as in this tech allows one person to do five times the work. Great. The second is training. So I got this person who's a level B talent to become level A talent and they can now do five times the work.
(32:55) The third is that you then just bring somebody else on at the same B talent and you just have twice the B's. In each of these situations beyond pricing these are the doors that we would knock on to feel like okay which of these is right for our business right now. Once you do that let's say you solve that supply control.
(33:09) You say you know what I I got my on my uh my onboarding and training system for for for getting you know new new people up to speed and now I can do twice as much per account rep. So, whoops. Now, we have a demand issue. And so, if you answered no to those questions that I have, the things that you'd be focusing on obviously fixing the acquisition channel.
(33:34) So, be like you're going to get you're going to either have to do some sort of outreach, some sort of affiliates, some sort of ads that you're going to have to run or some sort of content strategy or combination of those that then generates the first level of demand. But you still have to convert that demand. If you're getting those people, but you're not turning them into sales, you have a sales constraint, right? This is all demand side.
(33:47) But you have to look at your own business and be like which one of these is it to double click into the advertising and sales side. There's the advertising of like how you're generating the demand and then there's the technical component of like how are we capturing leads right now? The way you capture leads and this sounds like a very small thing is huge because the way you lay out your landing page, the headlines you use, the images you use, the copy you use, the the lead magnet, if you have a lead magnet you give away, something free, the assessment, the the call, whatever it is
(34:09) that you're giving away, the benefit for them taking the next action that might just not be good enough to convert a high percentage of the traffic. Fundamentally, you're going to have a people problem. The people suck and they're not following the process you have. You have a process problem, which is the process itself sucks and is selling to the wrong person, the wrong thing at the wrong time.
(34:27) You have an offer issue, which is like you're getting in front of the right people and you're getting in front of the right time, but the offer you give them is not compelling. Or price doubles on both of these constraints. You might be doing everything right, but you're just not charging enough.
(34:38) And because you're not charging enough, you can't spend enough on marketing to get their people in so you can be profitable. Because once you have that, let's say, fine, we fixed the advertising and we fix the conversion rate. Well, now we have sales. So, here's the trap. If you fix the wrong problem, it actually not only wastes money and time, it often makes it worse.
(34:56) And this is why so many business owners are like working their faces often in so much pain is that the constraint switched. You didn't switch what you were doing. And by succeeding really well at the thing that's no longer the constraint, you're actually further straining the system. And this is really hard. And this is me personally. I've almost always been able to out advertise any business I've ever had.
(35:14) I've almost always had supply constraints my whole life. And so the problem is like sometimes, and I've had to learn this as an entrepreneur, sometimes I just have to take a step back and be like, we're just going to let marketing or mediocre marketing or mediocre conversion continue because even if I fix it, it will literally make my business worse.
(35:30) And even though it breaks my heart to have leads not get followed up with sometimes, it's just like we can't even take them on if we could. And that's ultimately going to hurt my reputation more than not following up with a lead. So if you have a supply problem, more marketing creates chaos and unhappy customers.
(35:47) If you have a demand problem, better operations isn't going to help much when there's no one to serve, right? And so, the most successful businesses I've ever worked with, I've invested in, keep finding and breaking through their current problem, their current constraint, and then moving on to the next one. Because this is not a one-time fix. It's a way of thinking. So, if you want to see supply or demand constraint thinking in action in a real business, because when it's real business, it's always hairy and it's not always as clear as some of these examples, I have two examples I can give you. So, Ashley, she was a demand constrained business in services. So, if
(36:09) you're a service business, that would be for you. And Raymond also a service was brick and mortar with supply constraint.

(00:00) dui mom's in the hospital i just lost everything holy [ __ ] i had nothing how the [ __ ] am i gonna get out of this so i was hanging out with my team and they asked me some of the biggest struggles that i had gone through in building the companies that we have now and the wealth that we have now opening my gym i thought it was gonna be really cool be like yeah i'm sleeping on the floor i'm like hustling because that's what i thought like sounded cool it was incredibly lonely i was in a state that i didn't know anyone in a
(00:21) city that i didn't know anyone in a warehouse that there was cars that would drive over all night long and it was like a gunshot it was like and it was all concrete walls and there was no ac and so i would just like sweat and be awake and i was working the other hours of the day because my first client would get there at 4 o'clock my last person would leave at 9 00 pm i was just like incredibly sleepless i live there my clients would do my laundry for me and then i would shower at le fitness that was hard that was very hard after i
(00:47) like built all the gyms up i got out of that and then i sold them put all the money into this new venture and the money was gone the processor got shut down so i couldn't get the new money that i had made just felt like it was quicksand it's like every time i took a couple steps i would just sink again that was very frustrating this was like the worst six months of my life it started in october mom got sick went to the hospital i flew out while i was there to get myself occupied i started launching gyms that's when jim lunch
(01:10) actually started because i left my own gym so i was like i gotta keep myself occupied reached out some people in my hometown and i was like hey you know anybody and they're like yeah i know a guy so that's that was like the first big gym launcher so i had the mom thing and then i got in a dui and then the money that i put into the business got taken after i sold all my gems to go all in on this new thing because it was working so now i have like a dui mom's in the hospital i just lost everything we had to do this launch to cover the
(01:35) refunds from the last gym that i had to shut down and so we got the 100 grand from the first launch was able to pay all of the refunds and i was back at zero again did another launch had 100 grand that was what got taken by the processors because they thought it was like a regular activity i had six guys selling 8 000 a day in sales that i can't collect on and i had no money and so i put it on a credit card like this could [ __ ] go horribly wrong that was that whole month the last day of the month i got a processor for 50k i ran
(01:59) 50. the next day was the beginning next month i ran another 50. so it was 100. we did 30 or 40k in profit and i was like did i just escape death and then the next month the gyms from january february started refunding the clients and telling them to sign up with them and so then all of that money that i had made in profit the last month went back in and we were 150 negative and i was like how the [ __ ] am i getting out of this because the thing is the more i sold the more i'd have to refund was there a moment in that time where you
(02:25) were like maybe i'm not cut for this i didn't think about it i had too many other problems i was just in so much pain i just wanted to like get out of it i just had to pull like something out of my ass that was why i had this big belief that like some of the best businesses get made out of desperation i was 100 backed up i had nothing and so that's when we were like you know what jim's been a good run it was that was when i i called the guys up for the next month and was like hey we're out sorry they were like can you show us how i remember
(02:50) saying this to the first guy i was like call up my my uh getting out of the gym business sale selling my secrets that's what i said i was like i'm selling my secrets of everything i've learned from all my gyms and all my locations and filling up 30 plus gyms and doing turnarounds i'll give it to you it was like how much and i said six grand i'm still a salesman i mean i can recognize when something goes easy and i was like [ __ ] 6k sure done it was so fast and then i was like eight and it was like yeah 10. yeah that
(03:16) works i did 60 grand that day yeah so i was like holy [ __ ] i made 100k in like four days and that day was when like we switched to licensing that was the lead up and i remember like putting the money into my bank because i didn't have like another location to open or like more equipment to buy like that's mine i'd repaid the processors employees i'd pay back the refunds from the closed gym i was clear of everything and then there was like a hundred grand left and i was like i'm rich i mean i remember a buddy of mine
(03:45) calling me because i'd like checked in with him a couple times and he knew that i was like just going through a lot and he called me like a month apart he's like how you holding up and i was like bro i was like i just made 400 grand last month and he was like what i thought you like had the is it selling the membership thing i was like no no like selling the membership system and he was like dude run in as hard as you can we went 400 780 a million it's one two one five one eight two it was nuts it was literally me layla and i we had we had
(04:12) an assistant i was it over the kitchen table my rent was 1200 bucks and i told layla i was like i don't know how long it's gonna last that's why i kept our expensive solos i was trying to make money like that was it i'm not trying to build a company i don't want to make something that's gonna change the world i was like i'm trying to get rich i was gassing the [ __ ] out of it pure getting away from pain i had feelings that i didn't want to feel and so it's just like anything that would make me not feel that way was what i wanted to do
(04:34) business became my feel better drug i really didn't want to be poor again and i really was getting reinforced heavily by the marketplace that i was good at this thing and so it just gave me like complete alignment of just like rocket fuel that way and then magnet this way we didn't take a vacation we didn't take weekends we didn't see friends we didn't go out we didn't drink i was like if i drink and [ __ ] this up i will hate myself we can go get friends later i just took everything out of my life that was not this like what about work-life

How to Become Ultra Wealthy (4 Methods) - YouTube
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BO_59sGxztY

Transcript:
(00:00) there are only four paths to getting ultra wealthy I crossed $100 million net worth by age 31 and then I started acquisition. comom our investment firm I spent the next year studying how to go from 100 million to a billion and there are four paths we'll start with the first so in the first path you have other people's money being invested into your business now let's look at some of the business Titans that followed this path so here you can see three pie charts with 177% 10% and 4% if I were to show you this and say do you think the people who own these pies are very rich you might think well no they own so
(00:45) little of the pie but if I then said this is Tesla this is Amazon and this is NVIDIA would you all of a sudden then think oh wait this is Jensen hang Elon and us some of the richest people in the world who are all stiil billionaires and now at this point multi-billionaires and these incredibly successful people understood the first path of getting ultra wealthy which is the combination of other people's money into your business now the way that it works is that you raise funds by selling a percentage of your company so what this does is that it actually dilutes you as a Founder meaning you no longer
(01:27) own own 100% of your company but now you might own 80% of a company that now has an extra $20 million for example that you can then use to grow now there are some businesses that this is the only strategy to successfully realistically accomplish the goal and then there are some businesses that this would be a terrible idea to pursue now one thing that I think took me way too long to understand as an entrepreneur is that every single business incurs debt the moment you start it the question is what type of debt you're going to incur and
(01:59) so for example if you bootstrap a business as then you take no outside Capital when you start it you just fund it yourself and you own it you grow it organically then the debt that you take on is going to be that you're not going to have enough money to get the best talent in the door and so you're going to have talent debt you're probably not going to have enough money to get the right technological infrastructure in place to to to run the entire business so you'll take on technological debt right and you can go down the line and
(02:23) start thinking about all the other anel non-financial versions of debt now businesses that choose to take on financial debt choose to take on that debt instead of the other types of debt because of the nature of the competitive dynamics of the market they're in and so those types of businesses typically are in businesses that take a tremendous amount of capital to start up uh and scale or they are in winter take all markets where speed is the primary objective of the business so that they can capture the opportunity and then
(02:52) fundamentally become monopolies of a new type so Facebook for example became a monopoly of attention to a large degree now because there are other social media platforms they get away with that but they have created a big moat around all of the attention that exists in media and so for them there's only one real big social network that was going to exist and so they then captured it of course LinkedIn was like well is there a version of that we can do for business professionals and then they captured
(03:16) that now can you imagine now another professional social media platform being like oh we're we're now starting up it's like there's no room for you right it's already done that that market is captured and so when the there were other companies that were competing for the same Market and the people who were able to raise the most money spend the most money the fastest attract the best talent were able to capture it the fastest then sealing their competitive mode to keeping that as a long-term Cash Cow over the Long Haul which means that those businesses lose a tremendous amount of money for a short period of time and then they were able to kind of
(03:47) get over the hump and then become cash machines and so for example Amazon was unprofitable for 9 years famously and there's an interview of Jeff basos getting grilled on uh on The Tonight Show I think with John Jay Leno is it J Leno yeah with j Leno and he's like you guys don't make any money and Jeff Bezos just gives us he does his like weird laugh uh and he's like yeah we don't but we could we just choose not to because we get better Returns on our Capital by continuing to expand our um our infrastructure so that we can eventually
(04:18) support literally delivering things the next day to every single customer in America not withstanding the fact that they have the single most successful subscription in history in Amazon Prime more people are subscribed to Amazon Prime than own a Bible they have over 300 million subscribers that's almost every single person in America is subscribed to a digital subscription for $99 per year which I think now is$ 135 to have the ability the privilege of shopping on their platform and getting faster shipping and so when basos was making the investment of capital into
(04:51) the business he asked the question not what do I think is going to change in the next 10 years he said what things won't change in the next 10 years and so he realized that there are some fundamentals that will never not be true people will always want things to be faster people always will want things to be easier people always will want things to be risk-free and if you can create an outcome that is desirable fast easy and risk-free then you have an incredibly valuable business and so this corresponds
(05:20) with the value equation in the $100 million offers book and so time delay is speed ease is going to be effort and sacrifice perceive like of achievement is your risk and then the dream outcome is making sure that you're not just making things fast easy and risk-free that no one wants right and so that's the dream outcome component and so getting things to your door a lot of people want that if you can do it faster they like that more if you can make it easy for them they like that even better and if you can make it so that the purchase they had is very likely to be good aka the entire review system that
(05:47) Amazon pioneered reviews were not a thing think about how crazy this is they were not a thing and a lot of people were afraid and pushed against basos when he wanted to roll out reviews because they were afraid that sellers would hate it but he bet on the fact that customers longterm would want the transparency so in Jeff bezos's very first capital round that he raised he sold 20% of the business for $1 million to around 50 investors and so imagine the return on that today for that $1 million for 20% of Amazon it's more than
(06:18) he still controls to this day for context and he took that to buy the initial inventory get the uh website established hire the first developers to get this going and so if you're going to take on financial debt use other people's money into your business if you have a market that must be captured quickly in order to get a network effect of some sort or you have huge amounts of capital that are required to make the business start to begin with so if I wanted to start call it a a pharmaceutical business then I would probably have to have capital for an extended period of time to start a new drug to do the research and then maybe
(06:49) five years after we get the licensing then have the ability to print money but that Capital would have to come from somewhere and so unless you start as a billionaire to begin with which you absolutely could do that hypothetically but the vast majority of these businesses are not started by billionaires they're started by everyday people who have a good idea and then they go to people who have capital and say hey I will give you a piece of this upside now this is the uh live fast you know Die Hard uh style of making money the reason it is that way is because it
(07:20) will typically be very investor favorable uh especially the earlier it is because they are taking on more risk and so the big thing about these Mega wealthy paths is that the underlying thing that occurs in all of this is one return on invested capital and two the risk that you're taking in order to validate or justify that return so some guy in 1995 says he's going to start a bookstore on the internet whatever that is and you give them a million dollars it's like I need 20% of this thing at least because no one's ever done this
(07:54) before you've never started a business before what's the internet and are people even going to buy stuff on it right so there are so many unknowns here that it makes sense that they had a tremendous amount of compensation for the veritable guarantee that they would lose the money they were going to give and that's probably part of the reason that Jeff basos didn't just raise it from his friends and family despite the fact he was a Wall Street and uh Insider so he could have easily gotten the million dollars uh from probably a handful of people but he also probably
(08:23) knew that there was a very low chance of success which I think he says in his early interviews he figured that there was a low chance of actually making this work and so when you follow this path the other people's money into your business path there's really only two big kind of potential outcomes one is as a Founder you're going to drisk along the way which means that sometimes you will get something called secondary so when an investor puts money into a business they're going to appraise the business based on how quickly it's growing how How likely it is to continue to occur and uh well for them the ease
(08:56) of investment is uh High because they just have to make the investment but the still the fundamental value equation exists for them as investor where your business is the product itself and so let's say that we have a business before the money that is worth we'll call it $10 million and then they say I want to put $2 million into your business so if they put $2 million into your business this misses is now a $12 million business where they now own 20% and then everyone else now owns 80 and so the founders the original shareholders are going to get diluted it means that they now own a smaller percentage but now the business has more
(09:32) Capital that can help it grow now a different path to this is instead of putting 2 million into the business they could have put let's say $1 million into the business and say we're going to pay the founder over here into his personal bank account $1 million and so that's called secondary and then most people don't even say primary but it's kind of almost assumed that money is going into the business when you're raising round around of funding and so some Founders will drisk along the way because at some point you know when you have a billion dollar asset and you have $100,000 in
(10:02) your bank account some investors will understand that the founder themselves will become a little bit volatile and so they want to give them a little bit of money so that they're not constantly freaking out and actually can make better quality decisions so it's not uncommon for Founders to take a little bit of chips off the table as they continue to scale and raise funding now this is along the way they're making this money but they still have this monster asset that's worth billions of dollars or hundreds of millions of
(10:27) dollars and so there's basically two paths from there for them to actually get paid path one is that a big private Equity Firm which is now kind of a a new thing is that there are some firms that can buy billion- dooll businesses and not have them be public this is a new thing of probably the last call it seven to 10 years where there's enough private funds and enough private money Sovereign wealth sometimes overseas uh that can take down companies of this size when I say take down I mean put the capital in and buy it so a simple example of this would be like a company like kajabi uh
(10:58) which is a uh a learning platform where tiger Capital came in and bought majority of the business and the founders basically now a minority and they kind of had a full exit and almost all of that cash went to the founders and very little into the business and so in that setting it's like they had a lot of capital they bought this company and so now they're you know what's their exit and so most of these paths especially when you're raising funding most of the time is going to be some IPO so an initial public offering that then
(11:27) allows those shares to be made public which allows the person who owns the whole pie and all the shareholders to have liquidity meaning they have access that they can either sell those shares or they can lend against those shares either way they have a way of making money from the business not counting distributions which many businesses that are like this don't ever give distributions because they continue to reinvest the capital in the business because the returns from reinvesting the capital are superior to just getting a dividend and so one of the difficulties with raising money is the nature of the
(11:57) money that you take on and so all of these are completely unique deals depending on the risk profile of the company the risk appetite of the Venture Capital firm or whoever is making the investment and how what their investment thesis or philosophy is and if you look at a 100 different VCS you'll have a 100 different investment philosophies in terms of what they're thinking about now all of them just want a big company of course but how they're going to get there is different so there are some firms that only take on one company in a specific space and they say we're going all in on this company and we're going
(12:27) to provide all the help we possibly can to help them grab right there are some companies that say we want exposure to this entire market and we're going to take a bet on 10 different companies in this market with the hopes that one of them will win so they don't even care that they're competitive they just like we want to make sure that we're with the winner whenever whoever the winner is and so if you're in the latter example each of those VC checks might say well we have to 10x this business in the next two years or it's going to massively
(12:52) lose valuation and so they will force the founders to take aggressive growth measures that may sometimes be not in the long-term benefit of a the founder but B the business which might mean that they're over spending on Advertising they're over hiring on talent that they let the culture uh you know get diluted or suffer because they can't have enough filters in place because of the rate or the pace of growth that they are requiring and a lot of this growth is almost artificial because they're just injecting so much cash into advertising oftentimes to get the business to grow
(13:22) that they actually didn't solve the core fundamentals of the business so one of the the dark sides of this that doesn't get told is that as you do more and more rounds each VC or venture capitalist often times gets a board seat or two board seats and all of a sudden you might find out that you have a minority of your business and you no longer have voting power and you can get ousted from your own business from the investors that invested money in and so a classic example of this was Steve Jobs there was
(13:45) a period of time where he ended up getting kicked out of Apple for years before being able to come back now mind you at that point it was still a public company and it had a board of directors but it works the same way with a private company I have a good friend of mine who raed a uh who who exited had a had enough of an exit it was a billion dollar value valuation he didn't get a billion dollars but he had enough of an exit that he could retire and uh he continued to work but then they just said we don't want you to work here anymore and so he got fired and then three years later they asked him to come
(14:09) back and so it's very common to think oh this founder doesn't really know what he's doing but the thing is the founder always knows the heart and the pulse of the business because you're the one who knows each of the problems and why everything exists the way it does in terms of wealth creation when you take let's say a hundred of these bets you can get supremely wealthy so believe it or not uh venture capital is the highest returning asset class of all asset classes the problem is the amount of capital that you can allocate into that
(14:33) asset class typically is very closed or very small because most of these funds and good companies are oversubscribed there's many investors who want to put money in when these deals are really good or the likel that the business succeeds feels really high and so what happens is uh you may take 100 bets and the winner you have may offset the losses but you're still never going to get richer than the guy who's has a fully concentrated bet on the one business and so there's 99 entrepreneurs who failed and didn't make money but one of them who still gets even richer than the Venture Capital investors who put
(15:04) who put money in they use that one winner to offset their losses whereas if you were the only guy who went all in on that you don't have losses to offset you just went all in and the reason you would take path one is because you have a business model that requires you to grow quickly or have tremendous amount of capital for an extended period of time before it could become profitable and using other people's Capital rather than saving up let's say 10 lifetimes worth of earnings to start a pharmaceutical company uh makes sense if
(15:30) you've ever heard of like XYZ company raises money at a $500 million valuation they're not saying they sold the company for $500 million they're saying that the founders diluted themselves and the other investors by some percentage and it could be as little as one or two% um at that valuation so for example if you had a $500 million company uh and you sold 2% of that business then you would have $10 million in cash that you could then put inside of the business to then help it grow but you'd only sell 2% for that at that valuation and so hopefully
(15:59) this puts some uh relative numbers to some things that you've heard before so let's say that you don't want all that risk I guess we're going green now uh you have your money and your business and so this is probably the most common path that entrepreneurs take and I will say that a lot of the entrepreneurs that I aspire to and like to model tend to fall in this bucket now within this model I want to make a very big Point Clear which is that many people who are bootstrapped or could otherwise be bootstrapped businesses as in the founder themselves funds everything and doesn't take outside
(16:40) money they sometimes act as though they are venture-backed and that they must grow at all cost and they chase growth for the sake of growth and my first big thing that I will share with you is that Rush is imaginary 99% of businesses don't need to have some aggressive growth timeline because whether you're starting a Chicken Shack or you're starting a lawn care business there's no network effect that you're going to build up you just have to keep out competing and doing a good job in the local area or in the service vertical that you're concentrated in in order to achieve good returns for the business
(17:18) and so if you look at Chick-fil-A with estri Cathy they had a competitor at earlier on in their career called Boston Market some of the older people in my audience might have remembered this I used to go there after baseball games um and Boston Market was kind of like chicken and homestyle cooking and they were a direct competitor with Chick-fil-A now they raised a gazillion dollars and went super super fast and everyone told Chick-fil-A that they should do the same thing but estra Cathy being a lot more prudent of a man who was not who didn't want to take that
(17:44) kind of debt on who didn't want to just chase some imaginary um title for ego he said we just need to get better and if we get better our customers will demand that we get bigger and fast forward 10 years after Boston Market was you know kicking the tail off them and was a Wall Street darling they eventually went bankrupt meanwhile Chick-fil-A 75 years later has 2600 locations and they're all privately held and they have no debt and so now you might think well I don't want to wait 75 years it really depends on what kind of vision you have as an entrepreneur because you know for me my belief is like if I could build
(18:16) something that outlasts me I think that would be amazing um and sometimes the way to build something for the long term is to not build it for the short term which is not fast and growing at all cost because sometimes you grow bigger by giving yourself the time to grow longer yeah and I share the story because this is how I've started every company that I founded so I haven't founded a company and taken on Capital I have invested and co-founded um but I if I'm if I'm the sole founder of the business I have typically bootstrapped
(18:45) it meaning I I funded the original business so when I had my my online uh Fitness business was my very first business uh that was just me and I spent the $5,000 so start that up um my gym cost me uh I think $37,000 total to start my first gym and sign the leasee and get it kind of outfitted um so that was on me that fronted that capital and when I opened up each additional location it was the same thing and there's a key point there that I'm going to talk about return to invested capital in a second so stay tuned um the the
(19:16) next thing I had was gym launch which was started by me Prestige lab started by me Allen started by me acquisition. comom started by me and funded and so when you do that you don't have any delution but you also have complete control and so if you can think long you can grow big now back to the return on invested Capital every business you want to have a compounding vehicle within it so what I want to do is walk you through uh a little company example that will illustrate this so let's say we have company a and we have company B and let's say this is year one year two and
(19:48) year three all right so let's say year one company a sells 100 customers Company B sells 100 customers next year for company a they lose 100 but then they sell 200 customers so they're plus 200 and then minus 100 right uh yes so like they lost 100% of those customers they still did 200 Sales okay this company gets plus 100 and then minus Z so they're now at 200 in total 100 from the first year 100 new customers from the second year and let's say year three company a sells 300 new customers and now also loses the 200 customers from the year before and year three they uh Company B sells another 100 customers
(20:32) but has the 100 from year one and the 100 from year two now both of these companies are going to have 300 customers in that year which business would you rather have hopefully if you watch anything that I talk about you would want company B why because this is a company that is stable that will continue to grow year over year over year and they don't need to necessarily grow they don't need to grow faster if they just do a good job and keep the customers they have they will just consistently grow year-over year and I'll tell you this knowing that no matter what happens you will always get
(21:02) bigger is a very nice value proposition for an investor or for you as an entrepreneur and so the key is that you want to have some sort of compounding vehicle within the business and so to accomplish that there are pretty much only two ways to do this so the first is that you sell stuff that people never stop buying and so that can either be a recurring or reoccurring membership so a reoccurring business might be something like Coca-Cola right where you start drinking Coca-Cola and you go to Costco and you buy it when you go to restaurants you buy it and so you buy from a number of different places now
(21:32) you're not on a subscription for Coca-Cola but you might just buy it on a regular basis and so because of that once they acquire you as a customer you keep paying them Starbucks is the same way once someone goes to Starbucks the average customer spend $14,000 in Starbucks they just keep buying products from them right you're not on a subscription but you do keep going back the other version of this is something like Netflix where you have subscription you have a membership of some sort and people stay on and keep paying and so in either of those situations as you acquire customers the business just
(22:00) keeps growing and so every new customer you bring in just grows this big bolus of people that over time makes you more and more money now the second scenario is where uh and I this happens all the time in Like Home Services uh solar you know Roofing uh a lot of a lot of real estate adjacent type stuff uh where you have a business I mean even physical products can be this way um where you have a product that doesn't have a lot of return business so if you buy a house and sell a house it's like maybe somebody comes back to you 3 or 4 years later there's nothing wrong with that
(22:30) but you probably wouldn't describe that as a recurring or reoccurring business and so instead if you owned a business like that what you'd want is a growing network of people who never stop selling for you so here you have customers who never stop buying and here you have a distribution base of people who never stop selling and so for example Prestige Labs the sub company we had um people who go to the gym and try to lose weight that's a very cyclical thing people try to lose weight for a little bit and then they fall off um and that's common now that being said what can make the
(22:57) company more stable is if have a thousand locations that are consistently selling product every month now the who they sell it to might change but the fact that they are continuously selling becomes the node of kind of recurring revenue or reoccurring Revenue but just one level chunked up and so this is a distribution based model this is a customer-based model but both of these compound and so when I look to invest in a business or start a business I try and solve for this once you solve for this growth becomes inevitable right and because of this when I was 26 or 7 years
(23:27) old was the first year that I made like a lot of lot of money and I took home um I think just under $17 million in profit personally uh in income and so um this stuff absolutely does work so this is just like armchair e theory that I'm just like talking about something I haven't done um which I can understand any skepticism around that um because of a YouTube video on the internet that being said the key to growth in this path so when we're at so when you're in this box it's your business and your money your key your path to growth is something called return on invested Capital so it's
(24:03) roic now return on invested Capital basically is how much money does it cost me to make more money and so for example there are multiple levels of this within a business and so if I have a brick and mortar business you're going to have the lowest level of this which would be LTV lifetime value to CAC which is how much does it cost me to get a customer versus how much do I make from that customer over time right that's the base unit of economic Arbitrage in the business this is how you make money fundamentally now leveled up from this you have roic which still talks about the same concept
(24:32) return on invested Capital how much does it cost me the return this is basically LTV capital is the cost right it's just one frame so I'm trying to give you the real terms rather than just use some of the the third grade third terminology so that you can actually learn it all right so return invested Capital typically will describe the larger unit so if my my uh my massage business for example cost me $10 to get a customer worth $1,000 then that would be an amazing LTV to CAC but the question is how much does it cost me to open a massage studio well I I mean this doesn't take into account
(25:03) the lobby the buildout the licenses the recruiting costs administrative costs Tech costs um you know construction whatever right and so at this point it's like okay maybe I have amazing El to C but my return on Capital might be not as good or it might be amazing right and so here is basically the bigger money multiplier within the business over the longer term and so let's say that we have a business that does $1 million Topline and we own the whole thing okay million dollar Top Line and let's say it makes $250,000 in profit okay now if we are
(25:37) entrepreneurs then we have two options we can reinvest that in our business or we can put it into another business or another asset but if we know that our Returns on invested Capital are very good then it would behoove us to put it into our own business and so let's say that my return on invested capital in my brick-and-mortar chain for example is that I get uh um let's say that it costs me to open this Million Dollar business it cost me 50 $50,000 it's an S $50,000 to open a store and within 12 months it makes
(26:07) $250,000 back and if you hear that and you're like whoa that's amazing this happens all the time this is not that uncommon I mean I told you about my gym cost me$ 37,000 and I was making 20,000 a month within six months and so uh you absolutely can have these kind of uh these metrics okay so at this point what would make sense for me well I should probably take my 250 and basically this times five and then this gives me this times 5 and all of a sudden the next year I make 1.250 million and what I do the next
(26:39) year this is how compounding occurs so then I I split this up and what would this allow me to do I would open up 25 locations and then that would make me 5.25 million in net income right now of course when you're at this point the constraint will quickly be operational constraint you'll actually have a people issue of trying to staff all these things get all the locations signed um and this is why some people turn to franchising and things like that so that they can expand a little faster and that being said it is the most expensive form of equity because you're giving away basically the entirety of your business for a percentage of the top line but
(27:16) then you have to still service all of the locations almost as if you own them and so I'm not the biggest fan of franchising there are times where it does make the most sense but most times it's because Founders are in a rush and so if it's your first business ever my strong recommendation is that you start here because you have to pay down so much ignorance debt so much so much tax from the universe for not knowing what you're doing that the last thing you really want to do is risk the money of your friends and family that's just my two cents you can do whatever you want
(27:45) um that is my opinion if this is your firsttime business I would strongly recommend doing your business with your money because there's so many things that you don't know and you have to pay down your ignorance debt you have to pay down the cost of not knowing what you're doing and I i' rather you do that on your money than someone else's now if you do start to have this business that starts doing well and you start having this exx cash are $250,000 in the example I just gave let's just do a different color to keep things keep things zesty so the third path is that you can have your
(28:16) money with other people's businesses so remember here we had our $250,000 in profit from this business that we created well of course we could put it into our own but if we put it into someone else's then we want to understand what our return profile is going to be and so this is what I would consider the path of the investor and so if the first you know category is the path of kind of like the venture-backed entrepreneur the second path is the bootstrapped entrepreneur the third path is the path of the retail uh or just traditional investor you have some extra cash and you want to put it into something else
(28:50) so for example you guys have probably seen the show Shark Tank where there's five sharks that are all wealthy people and entrepreneurs come to them and they in in their companies now what they get what they get what they give is money and help and what they get back is some percentage of The Upside depending on how the deal is structured and so those sharks tend to have less time and so what they're compensated for is risk and so when you become an investor your Chief form the the chief thing that you give is that you drisk the founder and
(29:22) you incur some of that risk you shoulder some of that risk not in exchange for work or time but in exchange for Capital which fundamentally means I took time somewhere else I did work somewhere else and I'm going to throw that into your business so that I can offset your personal risk now the benefit of an investor is that you can diversify to a wide degree meaning you can take a 100 bets you can take a thousand bets so every single share that you own in a public traded company is a small bet that you're making as an investor and every share that you own of a a privately traded company works the same way it's obviously not privately traded
(29:52) but just off Market uh it works the same way now investors in general tend not to be the wealth wealthiest people in the world and so this is why in my opinion real estate has created more millionaires than any other vehicle but private Equity has created more billionaires than any other vehicle and so it's because of the nature of the concentration of risk and reward and so when you are when you are the business that goes all the way to the investor you might represent one% of their portfolio so you
(30:24) might have a they might have a huge win with this business but it's only going to be 1% but if if it's your business in either of these scenarios then you're probably going to have a Big Slice of that pie which means that their 1% win might be a 20% win an 80% win for you but what we don't see is the other 99 entrepreneurs who just go to zero and so this is where I think that from a personal level you have to know what you are shooting for because if you're like I just want to get rich then investing in sound assets that can give you a good
(30:55) return over a long period of time there's probably no sure way to become wealthy to become the richest person in the world or the top hundred richest people in the world you will almost invariably have to do one of the other two paths that I just described the fourth path that I'll show you last is one that also gets you on the top 100 list too and I'll share how that works in a second but the beauty of being a traditional investor where you take your cash and you invest in businesses is that it's Unlimited in its scalability it's for the most part passive with the
(31:24) exception of the active work that you have to do in finding sourcing negotiating the deals which is is work uh but typically less than running a business um and so since I am an active investor why don't I share with you some of the things that I look for in businesses that I invest in now to be clear this will be my investment thesis there are many so for me I create content like this so that I can get exposure to entrepreneurs so that they can come towards acquisition. comom and say hey I'd like to do a deal with you
(31:49) or I'd like your help to help us scale and we happily do that and this is how we get to know businesses at early stages so that we can be with them throughout their careers I mean the smallest company that we that we started working with had done $2 million the year before and this year we'll probably finish around 110 million in revenue and that's mind you over years not like a couple months all right and so number one is that I try to invest in uh High cash flow businesses that are profitable so I like getting distributions every month because it offsets my principle and it tells me that the business is
(32:19) doing well uh very on a much faster feedback loop so number one is I invest in high cash flow businesses and mind you this is in my active arm at acquisition. which is kind of our private Equity portfolio we have a venture arm which is acq Ventures uh where we write smaller checks for smaller slices of businesses where we are not involved and our primary uh value ad is risk and a light amount of help compared to what we do when we're heavily you know investing in a company where we're taking you know 30 40 50 you
(32:56) know plus percent of the business in those instances we're going to be working we're going to be recruiting we're going to be work you know we're going to be leading the the strategy that business versus just saying I believe in this entrepreneur in this team I believe in this concept and I'm willing to write write a check and take on some risks so I can get exposed to some upside so this is my private Equity thesis the second is that I want something that can grow and so fundamentally for growth there's only two ways that a business
(33:24) can grow right we can increase the number of customers or we can increase lifetime gross profit or LTV per customer so we can get more people or increase how much they're worth and if we see a path that's very clear that we can say oh we know how we're going to get this company more customers or we know how we're going to be able to double triple quadruple how much customers are worth which one will immediately make us more money but then also allow us to spend more money to get more customers so school for example is uh one of our largest Investments at
(33:55) this point um I wanted to take a very big swing on something that I think could change an industry and it's an industry that I understand very well uh which is education and media and I feel like very I have Edge there I understand it now could something happen it could go wrong maybe but in the last year we you know 6X uh the business so it did uh we had a good year um and so with school it was like okay do I clearly know uh how we can help it get more customers yes and so that was fundamentally what we drove now the lifetime gross profit is very much product driven which is not
(34:27) the role that we decided to take on for this particular investment but I did know that I have a huge part of my audience that wants to start a business and so I said okay well I don't have something for people who want to start a business all my stuff is really for business owners but people who want to start businesses still want to learn about business before they start businesses and so I wanted somewhere I could say well if you're not sure go there and if you're not even sure about that just read some of these
(34:50) books so you can get a little bit more context on what you could potentially sell the third thing that I look for is focus and I talk about this a lot which is is the founder someone who can say no who's focused on a specific Avatar specific customer has lived the life or the problem of that customer and I don't want to have to Niche slap a Founder all right so Niche slap is where they're like I sir I do everything for everyone which really means nothing for no one and so the benefit of being very focused on one specific customer Avatar or ICP ideal customer profile depending on what
(35:20) Market you listen to uh if you have that you can solve people's problems far better because you can be more nuanced in the solutions you provide you can also charge more because the actual value is higher and you can tend to acquire customers cheaper because your messaging will be more targeted and the target of your advertising itself can also be more targeted so both the words the offer the deliverable the pricing all of this is a strategic question which is why I want to make sure the strategy of the business makes sense and
(35:49) then fourth and this is probably the biggest one of all of them if we're being very real is jockey over everything now now I'll put one caveat out which is I'm not going to try and enter a market that I think is going to die so if someone's like hey I have a new gas powerered car that probably wouldn't be the bet that I would make if someone says hey I have this brand new print newspaper that I want to start probably wouldn't be the bet that I would make but if they're in a market that I don't foresee is going to disappear tomorrow then all of my
(36:19) emphasis is going to be on the jockey which is how good is the person the founding team um for the business because the thing is is that the founding team is going to encounter innumerable problems as they try and scale this thing and you have to trust their ability to solve problems because it doesn't matter how good the idea is your ability to consistently solve problems in a cash efficient manner is how you can grow a business over the long term and so you want someone and I I'll use Uncle Warren's you know three three big three big values is you want someone who's incredibly industrious and
(36:48) hardworking you want someone who has very strong ethics and someone who's competent and intelligent right and so you have competence you have work ethic and you have integrity and so he famously says well you know if uh if you have just uh competence and work ethic but you don't have integrity you've got a crook who's working really hard against you he's like very bad he said so if you are going to have that you'd rather have somebody who's really competent but lazy and disintegrate because at least that way he's not going to do you as much damage right so you want to have all three now what's Difficult about this is that even one of
(37:20) those three things is hard to find somebody who truly has character even when the chips are stacked against them because that's the only time that it matters or someone who has tremendous work e I think especially especially when it matters most in the business when when things are tough or you're going through a growth period that's just like it's just requiring you to work 20 hours a day because you just you just there's there's not enough people but you need the business requires it right now or you just have someone who's exceptional product or Prospect
(37:43) knowledge that they that ingly gives them that gives them tremendous Edge over their competition because they they understand everything down to um I love this uh analogy that a VC who invested in a Regal which is now you know in a pretty tough situation but for years was a a cash C Business Regal Cinemas um he said when he talked to the founder he said that guy understood the cost of everything down to the colonel of popcorn he said he just knew everything about the business he said he's like and there was really no reason that I should get into Cinemas he's like but when I saw this guy talk about it he was like
(38:13) he was so energetic and so passionate about it and clearly had good character and he just understood the business so out he was like there's no way this guy's not going to make money in it and he did and that and that is a great example of a business that required a ton of capital to start opening a movie theaters cost a ton of capital and so it makes sense that that business owner even though he knew everything about it probably been there for a long time he still asked for investors rather than saying you know what I'm going to take another 10 years to save all the money on my own just to start one when he's like you know what I could leverage
(38:42) other people's lifetimes of work so that I could basically be at year 10 at year one and have a smaller slice of a much bigger pie and so fundamentally betting on the jockey the is the highest leverage bet you can make because you're betting on someone's ability to solve problems in a dynamic environment and businesses if anything think it is dynamic so the environment may change the market May shift uh some of the variables or assumptions that you thought were going to be there aren't and some of the most famous Founders were companies that started not even with that intention like slack was a
(39:09) video game uh uh company that eventually just had this engineering slack thing well slack thing right this engineering messaging tool that ended up being good and then they shifted to that right because they just had exceptional Founders who were able to Pivot and be adaptable and so in some ways betting on the right jockey is almost like insurance for an investor it's like I just think this guy is brilliant and hardworking and I think when something happens he will figure it out and so when we're looking at all four of these things it's a high cash a business it has high growth potential there's a focused founder and they they they they
(39:41) exhibit High character High work ethic and high competence then it's like okay well if there's companies that meet all of these criteria which is still rare what makes you pick one versus another and so for us we operate under at acquisition.
(39:57) comom uh one thesis which is the theory of constraints which is that a system will grow until this constraint and then it will grow no further and so once we find what the constraint of the business is then we attack that constraint with all the resources and all the brain power and all the money we have to try and solve that constraint to then unlock the next level of growth until the next constraint and so to give a simple example if we were to Simply 10x advertising for you know a lawn care business if they don't have 10 times the salesp people to take those leads the next con like us just blowing the doors
(40:20) off the front end is just going to lead to the next constraint then we have to hire more sales guys but even if we did the marketing and then we did the sales then we'd have to hire more guys to do the the to mow the Lawns right and so the constraint will continue to move down the the pipeline until the entire business is DEC constrainted and then you will realize the throughput increase of having this huge influx and so for us if we understand the business well so it has all of these things and it happens to be in a space that we feel like we understand better than other people then that's where we
(40:51) will be more likely to take our bet and the better we understand it the bigger the BET will make and so to give you context on this the company Founders within our portfolio uh not including school because this metric would be stupid if I put School in there uh the average founder in our private Equity portfolio has had a 13x return on equity and so think about it like this if your company was worth $10 million when it started your slice I'd have to the circle would be much bigger than this page your slice of equity let's just not draw to size right your
(41:25) slice of equity later would be worth aund 30 million and that's at the point right now today of making this video and so uh independent of how much they quote sold to us they are significantly wealthier than they were before and I think we may be the only private Equity Fund that even tracks what the return on Founder Equity is and that's because longterm I believe that me getting great deal flow from Founders who want to do business with me is the long-term strategy that is going to make acquisition. comom into a Powerhouse um with a new model of private Equity as an
(41:57) investor you can think through these things and invest in companies that meet these requirements and ideally are in companies that you have some sort of edge in that you understand better than other people the final way of getting ultra wealthy is other people's money dot dot dot dot dot and other people's businesses you're like wait a second okay so you've got other people's money and your business that's raising funding you've got your money in your business that's bootstrapping it you've got your money in other people's business you're an investor and then you've got other
(42:26) people's money and other people's businesses which makes you a fund manager so let me explain for example when I sold gym launch and Prestige Labs I sold those to American Pacific group in 2021 they are a $500 million fund which now has a second fund that's another 700 so they it have $1.
(42:48) 2 billion under management now they bought gym launch and Prestige Labs together as a package for $ 46.2 million now that check they did to me represented a small amount of the overall funds that they had and so let me show you exactly why people who run funds make a huge amount of money so a typical fund manager typically not always but it is common for if you wanted to raise call it $100 million okay let's say that that's the amount of funding that you wanted to raise a fund manager which would then be typically the general partner the GP would put something like 5% in so they would contribute $5 million of their own
(43:24) capital and sometimes it's between multiple partners to fund the the 100 million cuz most investors want to make sure that you have some skin in the game that you care all right now that means that they're going to get $95 million from other people's money okay stay on track with me now the question is what is a $100 million buy me well in private Equity $100 million can then lever so you can leverage this and get $200 million in debt to buy $300 million worth of businesses so think about the leverage here you put $5 million in and
(44:01) you're able to buy $300 million for the businesses so then the question is okay but then what do these guys get for taking this risk great question so the typical front structure is something has a has a two in 20 structure this kind of industry average there's obviously some that are different than that but this is the most common structure and so 2% the first number that people say it's like what's the structure if you hear someone say 2 and 20 one in one and 25 whatever what they're referencing is the
(44:25) management fee which is charged off of funds raised every year and then the 20% is off of the profit that's generated at the ultimate conclusion of the fund all right so let's say 10 years from now we've exited all of the positions that we had and we turn this $300 million of companies into $900 million so over 10 years let's say we triple the money in general we triple the triple the value of the companies okay now what do we have to do well over let's say this is 10 years over the 10 years that 2% equals so this is management fee equals $20 million so
(45:06) you get $20 million in management fees just for that 10 that 10-e period of time now mind you you have employees you have costs and so fundamentally the management fees are supposed to help you run the actual fund without having to put more stress on the companies that you're buying the 20% so this is called the carry what's cool about this is that there's no tax with uh carried interest sorry the cool thing with carried interest which is kind of the The Profit part for the fund manager is that it gets taxed like capital gains and so basically they
(45:35) can make their income in a tax efficient manner so let's say that we sell our all the companies and so we have to take out the debt that we owe right so we have $200 of debt that we owe and then we have to return the hund I'm just going to say rout numbers we have to put the 100 million back into the Investor's pockets all right so we have $600 million back now there's going to be some interest cost here so maybe it's maybe it's uh you know if it was over a 10-e period we'll say $100 million in in uh in interest payments that we had to pay uh to also carry this debt okay
(46:07) let's just say hypothetically all right so we've got $500 million left over now we have our 20% carry which means that we're going to get $100 million for doing this so we took our five we got paid 20 and 100 in that 10-year period and and this 100 also post tax is $80 million and so all in all you're making $100 million plus with a $5 million Slug and so mind you this is when you start with $5 million what happens when you capitalize a fund and you put a $100 million in and you raise a $2 billion fund well just multiply these numbers by
(46:54) 20 it gets really big really fast and so fund managers employ uh one of the key principles of wealth and I'll have a follow-up video on on on the principles of wealth but one of the key principles is leverage and so they have multiple forms of Leverage that they're able to multiply it's why acquisition.
(47:13) comom is two like in my opinion the two strongest forces in business are leverage and supply and demand and so supply and demand is this these two little curves here and then leverage here is this fulcrum all right and so they first leverage their $5 million to get $95 million from investors then they leveraged the entirety of that $100 million to buy companies which then they use the companies they leveraged the companies to get the debt off of these initial cash checks that they can write and then all of a sudden that five becomes 60 times bigger in terms of the assets that you can
(47:42) control and so obviously APG ran this exact model and they had a $500 million fund right um but if acquisition. comom one day in the future wanted to have have a fund saying hey uh I'll put money in and if you guys want access to deals that I have access to and want my team to work on for you basically then we would have some fund structure in place that would allow everyone else to participate and so a fund typically should get structured because you have one of two key things in my opinion this is now just me talking Alex's opinion
(48:19) you should have access to deal flow that other people don't have so proprietary deal flow the recent proprietary deal flow is Super Value is two things number one is that you will get better negotiated terms on the deals meaning that you could buy assets for maybe less than intrinsic value or less than a competitive process might yield right like if you're in an auction you will pay more than if you're just making a one-on-one deal which is why when you sell a house you're like I hope a lot of people bid right that's really good if you're a seller really bad if you're a buyer right and so you want to have
(48:48) deals that you can just be the only person bidding on it so that's thing one so so for example what that looks like is for acquisition. comom it'd be businesses that are applying on the site at acis.com saying yes I'd be interested in selling a business or I'd like you guys to help me you know help invest uh in the business to help it scale that's what that would be now the reason that it's proprietary is they're not typically going to other people they're not saying I want investment I'm going to pick acquisition. comom of 10 people
(49:12) they're saying I want to work with Alex and his team right because of their proven track record the second thing that you want in my opinion U as investment thesis is some sort of edge you want some sort of Insider knowledge not insider trading to be clear Insider knowledge know on the industry or prospect that a company serves and so you will find that there are some private Equity firms for example that just specialize in manufacturing they're just really good in in heavy manufacturing businesses some uh private Equity firms are really
(49:41) good at uh cpg so consumer package Goods direct to Consumer uh physical products e-commerce right there's there's whole whole fields of great private Equity firms around that and they typically have Founders or ex-f Founders who funded that with their own exits and then basically redo the Playbook with more leverage um there are some funds that just specialize in software right there are some funds that just specialize in Professional Services there are fun some funds that just specialize in media and
(50:06) so uh you want both propriety deal flow so that you have deals that no one else has ACC to these are off-market deals right that they only want to do business with you so you can get better more attractive prices in terms and then you want to have a way to accelerate value so if you want to think about investing as a business right we have LTV to ca too these things are not uh the these things completely apply to investing business so the CAC is if I have proprietary D flow then I'm going to be able to acquire customers or acquire deals for lower prices and on
(50:38) better terms and if I have a way to grow those businesses then I will have higher lifetime deal value than somebody who doesn't and so when you combine those two things you get better returns so you have more value on the buy and more exit value on the sale and that discrepancy is what creates the outsized alpha which beats the market and so fundamentally this is what this has been my thesis for acquisition. comom now I haven't talked about this as much publicly mostly because it applies to fewer people than
(51:05) the vast majority of my content but our team decided you know what let's let's talk about what we do and so so within the private investing world the fund world there's typically kind of two big buckets you've got private equity which means that they are buying equities that are private or off Market which is about a 60 or 70 year old industry and then you've got VC or venture capital and within Venture Capital you have growth funds you have seed stage funds you have series a series B and these will typically be defined by their check
(51:43) size now an interesting tidbit for you is I was talking to David Weissberg who runs 10x Capital uh unaffiliated with uh Cardone um he just actually owns 10x Capital kind of funny um and they he exclusively talks to LPS so big endowments that have many many many many billions of dollars and that's like his entire network good podcast if you want to check it out if you like really like high high level investing um and so they did a meta study and they found out that uh VC or vental Capital assets so think
(52:17) uh software companies in general have the highest return of any asset class they average about 14% per year which is uh I think the second highest one is REITs so real estate invest trusts I think average like about 12% a year um and then you've got you know the Public Public Securities so normal stocks is uh is something like nine and change uh they kind of go down the the gamut of uh different asset classes now mind you this is just the class of assets not just a specific stock obviously in every one of those categories there's some you know real estate buildings that have you know 100x and there's probably not 100x
(52:48) but have gone up a lot there's software companies that have definitely 100x um and even individual stocks that are not software that have also 100x right Tesla for example and most most of these still Follow That kind of 2 and 20 structure there are some like there's a there's a famous one that's 0 and 35 so like it's really about how you want to shift risk with the founders sorry shift risk with your limited partners to give you context private Equity tends to manage tends to manage bigger amounts of money
(53:18) so if you look at Blackstone has about a trillion dollar of assets under management Apollo has about 600 billion uh under management uh KKR has has $500 billion do under management so monstrous sums of money and there's a reason why private Equity has created some of the wealthiest people in the world the fund managers of these groups are all Deca you know Deca billionaires and above Stephen schwarzman I think is at 40ish billion just an absurd amount of money um and they do that because of all the leverage that I explained earlier now Venture Capital uh tends to not always but tends to so if you have like a16z
(53:54) which is Andre and Horwitz has about 50 billion under management uh seoa one of the most well-known uh funds in the world has about 56 billion so they're about the same in terms of size so you can notice there's an order of magnitude difference in terms of the size but they're usually making bets on what the next Facebook is going to be whereas these guys tend to buy more traditional businesses that are already monstrous and they do a little bit more of the financial Arbitrage meaning they're it's more about how they can buy it at one price sell it at another price or combine assets in a way that makes it a creative so a fancy word for just value
(54:25) additive to the overall Enterprise value whereas these guys tend to do zero mergers and Acquisitions and bet on the organic R viral growth of the companies that they take shares in and so these guys typically focus on inorganic growth and these guys F focus on organic growth meaning the company itself grows and these tend to grow by globbing in multiple things together to make the overall entity bigger and so that's where like for example if I were to buy an auto repair shop I might be able to buy the auto repair shop at a five times multiple and then get debt for half of
(54:58) that so I put two and a half times uh their their income uh into the deal and then buy five other ones with that and then altogether sell them for 10 and I can triple my money in that period of time without actually having grown any of the companies that's where it gets wild now in this game all they want to do is see this company just keep hockey sticking now if you're like okay well where does acquisition. comom sit within this world so we kind of sit in the the middle so obviously we have acq Ventures
(55:29) which is just traditional VC but our actual private Equity side we do little m&a um we like we do if it's if it makes sense and typically it's because it's like an adjacent purchase of a business that we're referring a lot of business over to and it makes sense for us to just kind of bring them in more than we're like actively seeking out 10 follow-on Investments to glob together so we do less Financial Arbitrage and more value add in terms of our ability to help businesses scale and for us that's less Capital intensive and I would rather this is me personally it's
(56:01) it's I would rather allocate my team's effort to Growing something we're get it because is the most efficient form of growth in terms of return on Capital not the easiest necessarily but it's the most efficient so if you can do it you do that but most people can't do it and so they just do Financial Arbitrage but there's nothing wrong with it's just a different way to play the game and so private equity for example will have traditionally somewhere in the neighborhood between five and 10 Investments for a fund so if you have a
(56:27) $500 million fund you're going to have five to 10 Investments and so the fund size will typically dictate the size of the investment or check that they're going to be writing Venture Capital um and many times they have multiple funds within one kind of uh fund you know company that will be talk ones for seed companies ones for series A's ones for growth Equity uh so it just depends on um what stage of growth they're investing in but these companies can sometimes have 50 to 100 Investments per fund and so because of that there are
(56:58) significantly more hands-off and more betting on the few that go big knowing that they're going to have 99 losers and one Facebook that's going to make up for the whole fund here you really can't afford to lose very much so here they're looking for the very consistent triples and quadruples and five X's here they're looking for one 100 or THX and then a bunch of losers that aren't obviously looking for losers uh they're hoping for more winners uh but fundamentally that is the difference in terms of the investment thesis and so if you are
(57:27) accepting a venture check you have to understand that those are the odds that they are playing with and that they're betting with on you that you like the thing is is for them you're 1% bet for you you're 100% bet and so for the investors they can distribute their outcome and diversify which decreases their risk but also decreases their upside and if you happen to be Mark Zuckerberg then you will make more than everyone else who invested in you but you got to be Mark Zuckerberg and so if we think about the CAC of a requiring deals the same advertising laws always
(58:00) apply and so you're going to have so you're going to have four ways that you can get customers and then four other ways where you can leverage other people to get you customers and so if you look at acquisitions.
(58:19) com if we find a company that we think is interesting we'll reach out to them I post content like this video to generate deal flow to get people to pay attention to what we're doing and show interest in our stuff uh we run paid ads for the same same reason um now if I were a traditional private Equity Firm um I would probably have Affiliates or agencies so these agencies basically function as uh Brokers right who will take a percentage of the deal um or there are kind of outbound agencies that do this work to uh to kind of like um bird dog Deals they go and Chase out they do a lot of this outbound stuff on
(58:49) behalf of a priv firm to generate deal flow for them and so in all of the traditional advertising laws apply it's just that customers are now deals and products are now companies and all you're doing is adding zeros to your transactions and so APG to be clear used other people's money so they used you know endowments from Big universities like Harvard and Yale and and you know the Teachers Fund uh to basically seed their investment and they pull all of those funds to then make the F or 10 Investments they're going to make and ultimately get a good return on it but it was other people's money and other
(59:26) people's businesses and so for that they didn't even have to start any of these companies and they were still able to make more money than most Founders do on their exits so APG bought my company other people's businesses using other people's money like the teachers endowments the uh the police fund the fireman fund the the the you know Yale Princeton Harvard the endowments that they have they have these massive war chests of money that they give to these fund managers as a small allocation of their overall investment uh for their
(59:58) University or for their limited for their for their investees if you will um to get a return and so the key point that I think is very interesting here is that the fund manager of a fund like this will often make more money than any of the founders of the businesses that they buy and so when I when I saw that I was like oh this is a very high leverage vehicle and so this is what kind of kicked off my journey to thinking through what are all the ways to make Mega Money and that was the point of this video and if you like this video
(1:00:31) and want to take any of these four paths to Mega Money and you want to compress the timeline that you achieve it in the number one video on my channel talks about exactly how to do it

This Business Was Stuck. Here's How I Fixed It. - YouTube

Transcript:
(00:00) [Music] one of our portfolio companies went from stuck to $10 million per year in 4 months and in this video I'm going to walk you through the actual marketing and sales tactics we use so that you can apply those things to your business too so one of the newer companies in our portfolio was doing about 570,000 per month and they had plateaued there month after month after month for about 6 months so let's start with marketing so we had in this business a webinar-based business meaning it's running ads to a video that the founder would get on and
(00:32) basically pitch a call to find out more all right so I'm going to give you current state so our show rate for this webinar was 18% which is really not good you want it to be 25 or kind of higher the schedule rate from the webinar meaning people who booked to then take a sales call I actually don't have that number but we didn't prove it so I'll tell you what we ended up doing and before we made these changes we were getting 58 calls booked per webinar all right so that's where we started so so the problem starting with this was the show rate so the issue is that we were only doing one time per week for the
(01:06) founder so they only wanted to do kind of like one pitch per week and the issue is that means that if somebody books on let's call it Monday and she does the webinar on Sunday then it means all of this time in between is where people could forget about it get busy fall off and essentially just not show up even though we paid to get the opdate so we did four things to actually fix this so number one is that we introduced a long email sequence we had nine emails that we went that went out and these were we just basically improved the email so we
(01:38) uh simplified the language we put it more benefit driven uh and basically sold the reason they should attend and we tried to hit it from different angles so we try to hit from pain we try to hit from speed we try to hit it from ease we try to hit it from being stuck in plateaued because the big thing that you always have to remember is that pain is what drives motivation all right that's what gets people to actually take action the second thing we did is we added an SMS because if people uh aren't showing up then you want to communicate in more
(02:07) places and more ways and so some people me like me specifically I'm way more text responsive than I am email responsive I rarely check my email but I do check my texts the next thing that we did on top of that was within the emails we actually did some sort of behavior response all right so you're like what the hell does that mean and so Behavior response means that if someone engages in any piece of content they click they uh they open it we then sent them behind the scenes content so think about this is exclusive or secret stuff that made
(02:38) it show that we saw what they were doing which is also something every business wants is like oh W this is pretty cool I didn't know they could do something like this just showing kind of some more sophistication in marketing and then the fourth thing that we did was again with more places more ways we had voicemail messages that we sent out to them and so that means that we cover people who like text people who like email people like voicemail and then we also had video essentially for people who took an engagement so we had all four ways that people consume information that we added in prior to the webinar and so one of
(03:08) the other things that you can do obviously besides pain is that you add in proof and so you can alternate between proof and pain but big picture is that you always want to use the value equation which you've got dream which is what's the big thing that they want to have happen you've got risk so you want to decrease the risk this is where proof comes in and you want to uh decrease the time so that's speed and you want to decrease the hard right which is you want to make it easy and so we want to show how easy it is how fast it is how risk-free it is with proof and we want to make sure that we're very accurately
(03:37) describing what they want to have happen yeah if you especially have people who have you know your avatar doesn't respond to email because sometimes there are Industries you know if you're in finance a lot of people respond to emails if you're in painters uh and maybe bluecollar workers you might have fewer responses to emails so that's okay so instead it's like making sure that we have these multiple ways like text for example has a 95 to 99% open rate so people will get the message and so obviously you don't want to abuse it but having just a few strategically placed texts can massively increase the show up
(04:06) rate to things and I would bet that if I had to put between all of these things this would be the biggest one that had the increase in show up rates and so because we had ctas inside the email to get them to engage we also long-term keep the health of our email account because it shows that we're not just spamming people instead people are getting our emails they're opening them they're reading them they're taking an action all those increase the overall health of your uh your email server and your deliver ability and so that way you
(04:31) can continue to get your emails delivered rather than getting into the promo tabs is getting a little bit tactical but you get into a second tab with an email which is like oh no one ever checks the spam folder essentially the big reason that we have to do all this stuff is because no one remembers what they signed up for this morning let alone five days ago and so we do this because you have to remind them and don't worry about quote bothering people now do you want to send five a day no that's probably not smart but if you
(04:56) send one reminder a day between a certain time and an event there's nothing wrong with that and so the most important part of the sequence I'll tell you right now is 24 hours before so you're thinking the night before you have the morning of which is am and then one hour prior these are the three most important reminders that you want to send out these are the ones that you definitely want to have as SMS so you might be wondering well how much did we increase the show up break percentage well we went from 18% to 24% which means
(05:23) that this increase was a 33% increase right off the bat and so one of the things I think is one of the most underutilized ways to make a business more money like a lot of people obsess about close rates and we're going to talk about what we did with sales but you can get a 33% increase in show up rates and have the same result as having a 33% increase in close rates but getting 33% more people to show up is usually way easier and you're able to automate a lot of that to a great degree so it's onetime work to have permanent increases in revenue and profit rather than having to consistently drill a team
(05:53) on how to close which you absolutely should do it just takes more work so the next problem that we had was that people who were actually attending so now we have our 24% of people who are showing up is that they weren't actually choosing to book a call and so problem number two no bookings right and so what we did is we solved a few things inside of how we structured the webinar to get way more people to show up and I'll show you just how many so the first thing that we did is we actually looked at what was and so I think people skip this step but like this is the real work is
(06:24) you look at the webinar you look at the attendance rates you look at the drop off points you look at where there spikes in engagement engagement are going to be the interest points where you're like okay this is something maybe we should expand some of this stuff and where you have huge drop offs then you're like o we need to improve this and so for us we saw we were losing a ton of people right at the beginning of the webinar and so we're like okay this is where we're going to put most of our attention which by the way if you're doing anything content sales webinars
(06:47) whatever the first five minutes and even the first 60 seconds is where you should be obsessing even in a different company we have in our portfolio which does a tremendous amount greater volume than this particular company we rescripted the first five minutes of uh presentation and got a 20% increase in close rates Ju Just redoing 5 minutes and it was on a three-hour presentation so based on the research we did four things the first thing we did is we scripted a faster intro basically getting to the point much faster and being clearer about why they are here
(07:17) and what they're going to get from it and so if you're like well what would that actually look like well it actually follows the exact same format that we use for our content which is proof promise plan so proof is is hey I helped someone just like you and you want them to identify with the proof that you were showing so they can approximate oh this is just like me the promise is clearly defining exactly what they're going to get both from the webinar and potentially after the webinar and then the plan is to set expectations for how the next 60 90 however many minutes your
(07:49) presentation is so they know where they're going and the key Point here with all the faster in stuff is you just want to get to the meet when I look at a beginner sales call or beginner sales presentation or vssl video sales letter often times people spend a minute 2 minutes just like Meandering like trying to figure out what they're saying and they don't know that they're losing like 40% of Their audience in the first two minutes before they figure out what they're going to start saying so get to the point number two is we mention live
(08:17) that this is live so this was a live webinar they were doing and the thing is is that we weren't actually showing so we're incurring the cost of being live but we want to say the date you want to say the time you want to say the weather you want to say any current events right these are all things that give indications that this is happening right now and so for whatever reason and I don't know why this is but when you do live stuff it works better no idea why I just know that it works and so we want
(08:41) to lean into the fact that it's actually happening and so mind you if you do an automated webinar or you do a video SI letter that's recorded there's nothing wrong with that obviously it gives you scale because you can't do a webinar every hour of every day but in general if you are struggling to make something automated convert better I would recommend going live for a while and doing it more frequently live so you get the reping get it tighter and get the benefit of just the magic of liveness so the next thing we did is we had a takeaway all right so you can always you know it's like uh the only guy the girl
(09:13) wants at the bar is the guy who's not chasing them whatever right and so there's two main things that we changed tactically to make this a little bit more of a takeaway so number one is that we were very clear about who our qualifications were so we said listen we only sell people who are this this or this if you are below this or above this or adjacent to this this is not for you and so by clearly stating those things we got to ward off the wrong people and magnetize the right people to be like oh
(09:39) this is actually just for me the next thing we did was we put scarcity in play all right and so this is one of my favorite ways of ethically providing scarcity which is saying we only have this many times to take calls or consults because I only have two guys on my team I only have four guys on my team so we only have this many slots and so typically we will book out of slots within this period of time and so if you say typically then that does excuse you as long as more than half the time that does happen or often times you can say that uh you can preface it in that way
(10:07) not an exact language that it happens often right and then with the scarcity you just say the actual constraint you have and so I see this as one of the most underutilized scarcity strategies in existence if you're an agency and you can only take on five customers because you couldn't take on 100 anyways then say you can only take on five customers if you can only take 20 phone calls then say you can only take 20 and if you know that there's the urgency component which is it's first come first serve then say
(10:30) that and so by doing the qualification and then adding the scarcity and a little bit of urgency around its first Comfort serve and we we can only service so many that though that sounds simple people don't do it and yes it does work so the fourth thing is we uh I would say this is scarcity on steroids you're like wait I thought you just did scarcity well we just put more scarcity in so we did a couple of things around this but we added proof all right so one is this is theoretical but as soon as people begin to take action we want to show
(10:55) proof that they've done it so the first thing that we did is we said hey as soon as you do book let me know in the chat and so let me know in the chat then shows this proof that's happening in the chat that people are booking all right so that was number one the next thing we did is that by doing this it creates an open loop and so it's like if you were on a sales call say hey I'll wait here and then I'll make sure I can see it on my side then what we did is we did call outs so it says hey I see that Rosie
(11:22) booked hey I see that John booked hey I see that Susan booked right so we can say in real time and it creates this this frenzy around booking and the last thing that we did is that you actually want to call out the soldout times now this is a little bit of language use here but we say the word sold out because it again it creates more buying Behavior and pre-framed the sale and so You' say hey Wednesday is sold out Thursday is sold out Friday is sold out and so as the times are booking out we want to show that even though we said we have a 100 slots we basically chunk it
(11:52) down again and say oh this day is sold the morning is sold out like if you're like getting worried about like you're not even sell just say hey the morning on Wednesday is sold out up the afternoon on Wednesday sold out maybe you only have three slots whatever but you can still basically approximate some sort of mini urgency mini scarcity by just saying what has been taken and it's completely compliant because you're just stating the facts and telling the truth and by the way if you're a business owner and you are doing a million bucks a year and you are looking to scale and
(12:18) either you're not scaling as fast as you want or you just feel like you're stuck I get it either way um and these tactics are helping you out if you want specific help on your specific business we open up dates at our headquarters sporadically to invite people out and so if you want to see if we have availability and you want to see if you qualify you can go to acquisition.
(12:39) comom my team will get on the phone worst case we'll try and set you up with something that could help you in the meantime and best case we see out here in Vegas and I would love to meet you and help you grow so those four tactics that I just outlined for you gave us a 33% increase in our booking rate from the webinar so we got a 33% lift in people who are showing up and of the now greater amount of people we got another 33% lift uh in increased number of people who then booked calls and so our total book costs went from 58 to survey says 102 so nearly a double this was 77%
(13:16) increase in total book calls from the same ADP and if we had only done that that could have just absolutely demolished it for the business we could have done nothing else and we could have rode enough in the sunset but we wanted to make more and so let's talk about sales now so for the sales process all we're really looking at here is Clos rate now technically you could have a drop off between the uh booking webinar and the show up on the sales call that was not a constraint for this business it had super high show up rates I didn't even lift it here because it wasn't
(13:44) worth doing and it didn't change because we didn't really focus there because it wasn't the main thing but we did have a low close rate once people are actually showing up to the sales call and so we focused there too and so the Clos rate before this was 14% so to be really clear this is bad you don't want a 14% close rate that's tough especially after a webinar or some sort of long selling event so we were just missing the ball here and so we took some steps to fix it and we chose to fix it in four ways and so I'm going to start at the front and move backwards so number one the thing
(14:14) that we had was bad framing all right so what a lot of people don't know is just like in the beginning of a video proof promise plan right what you say at the very beginning has a massive uh impact on what people end up doing at the end and so most people do look at the end rather than looking at the beginning and how they got introduced to the sale to begin with and so in the beginning a lot of the team that they had was kind of wasting time trying to like build report like how's your week going great I know we've got limited time here blah blah blah blah blah like no we wanted to fix
(14:47) the theum and get right to the point so let me tell you what the bad intro was before this so it was like hey how's it going my name's so and so how's your week going oh cool great uh I know we have limited time here so ready to jump in you know do you have a pen and paper to take notes with right now that was the old way of doing it and I think that's a fairly common way of doing it but I tend to think that there's a better way to do it and so that's what I'm going to share with you and so what we started with was hey my name's John
(15:13) I'm here from this company and I have a background in ABC which is specific to whatever problem that you want to solve I work closely with so and so edified person that you saw in the webinar and I would love to know what resonated most with you now they're going to then answer because now now we're we're we're reminding them the value that they got on the webinar and kind of getting them back in that state where they took action and we say great so the real purpose of this call is to see if you qualify for our guarantee not everyone does and it's really based on these three factors so if it's B2B you'd be
(15:43) like business size industry and you're being the owner now fundamentally you're going to be going through b which is budget Authority need timing and you want to use those as the qualifications for the guarantee now if you have guarantees obviously this is sexy now instead of a guarantee you could also say hey we want to make sure that you qualify for the bonus or hey I want to make sure that you qualify for starting this time it doesn't really matter what it is but the thing is you're immediately taking it away and saying hey I'm not here to sell I'm here to
(16:06) First make sure that I can even give you something and automatically they're leaning in and they're like o I want something that I'm not immediately having so you're in the driver's seat they're the ones who are on the other side hoping to earn your favor and so then after that you can clarify what it is it's like and to be clear the bonus is X Y andz or hey to be clear you know our guarantee uh we have to be strict it's kind of like college admissions whatever uh and if you don't qualify this is what we're going to set you up with and help you out but if you do do
(16:30) then we'll start buying back some time and make you some more money or and we'll start x y and Zing benefit that we originally promised on the webinar and so the big thing and this is like it's it's everywhere through the entire process from marketing to sales to customer uh success all all the way through is that you want to have congruence all right is you want to have you want to basically have the customer feel like you have this Baton Pass between every single step in the business and so from the ad to what they see as the headline for the webinar once
(16:59) they opt in the first few lines of the webinar should match with the headline that they opted in for once they get on the call it should match what you talked about on the webinar once they get sold the onboarding and success person should be matching what they said on the sales call and this sounds so simple and yet no one does it and literally if you have complete alignment all the way through your process you will make so much more money and this sounds simple and it is simple to understand but hard to do because you have to coordinate multiple parties along the same line but this is
(17:29) what creates streamlined lubricated sales we're talking Diddy Lube so the second part of the sale is where you get in Discovery so in the beginning it's like what what's the frame you're setting what's the agenda we had a much more takeaway version that was still congruent with what was promised on the webinar the next thing is Discovery and so a lot of people waste time in Discovery and this is where they get caught they get caught in traps and I I made a whole video about this you can probably find it on my channel um but they go into traps and so traps are basically where you get too far in the
(17:57) weeds you get too into the details and both you and the prospect forget why why you're there to begin with and so you want to stay chunked up at the highest level humanly possible because when you stay chunked up you can focus on the few things that matter that are going to move the needle that are ultimately going to be tied to the biggest Roi around whatever it is that you sell stop getting cute and sales calls and so a lot of sales people will start doing this as they get a little bit more experience and this is a mistake and so
(18:19) this is why sometimes you have somebody come into your sales team they they you know they quickly ramp up they do well and all of a sudden their sales number starts slipping it's because they get cute they get fancy they start to start saying words that they've heard around and trying to play business consultant or start to play expert but they're not the expert because they're not the ones doing the delivery and so you want to always get out of these very detail oriented questions because as soon as
(18:42) they ask those questions then they're the ones in control of the conversation and not you because the way you answer could to turn them off and say oh actually I didn't want that but now you're the one answering their questions they're in control so during Discovery you ask the questions they give the answers and you stay high level to make sure that you're staying on the line to get to the end once you've gone through Discovery and you've hit on the pain you've clearly defined a reason they should be motivated to take action then
(19:05) we go into the pitch all right now I am a big advocate of a three-pillar framework and I talk about this in the closure process and let me tell you some advanced stuff on this so the more do-it-yourself done with you the product is the more you want it to be simple you want it to be 1 12 3 ABC whatever the more implementation you have the more done for for you it is the more you want to show here's 11 steps 27 steps that we follow because what you want someone to see is oh my God this is so much work and then you say right so they believe that it works but they don't want to do
(19:40) the work and so you're like yeah oh I believe that if I do 38 steps to improve my YouTube videos they'll improve but can you just do it for me and that's where you want them to go and but if you're selling a solution that they're supposed to do a certain percentage of the work or a greater percentage of the work then you want it to be as simple as humanly possible and if you're curious like why is Do-it yourself and done with you more or less same is that I actually see done with you as basically a d
(20:02) do-it-yourself sale plus accountability help troubleshooting getting you unstuck so it's really just that theoretically if you just follow the steps you could do it yourself but just to make sure that you're successful will add this extra help in rather than oh we're going to do it all for you which is a true done for you offer and so instead of the three-pillar pitch what this company was doing was they had a feature pitch or a feature stack so they were making it seem really complicated and having way
(20:27) too many steps and overwhelming the prect but then after the pro prospect's overwhelmed and Confused it was like great you got that so you're going to do it and then you're like uh right and so they're like no thank you now if you're like hey all of that I'll do it different pitch three-pillar pitch if you're not sure stick with that usually crushes and if you're like wait I have six steps in my process you just Chunk Up it means like you just gather two of them together and just make it a larger bucket and one tiny tweak that we added
(20:52) before the pitch was basically getting them to invite us to sell them and so we said hey given everything that you just said and you're doing X and revenue you mean y qualifications uh and the fact that your challenge is this I think that we'll be able to help you out and that you'd be a great fit and our experience is in solving this exact problem for your Ty type of person and if you want I can uh walk you through that but where do you want to go from here and so then they have to say no please walk me through that and then basically they're giving you permission to launch into the
(21:22) three pillar pitch now this last step step four was actually execution and so there's a lot of things that we did here and so uh this is not me selling you a done with you solution this is me actually just trying to help you out um so we did many things to improve execution and so we actually had a conversation with the founder um and they said you know uh I watched some of these Discovery recordings and they look pretty bad and we said yeah well when was the last time you roleplayed Discovery with your team and they were
(21:47) like uh I don't we're like hm interesting and so what we did and this is going to be mind-blowing to you is number one is we role played we actually had the team practiced it all right and uh this isn't with wigs and handcuffs we actually had them roleplay it with one another but maybe that increases Stakes so you can do whatever you want on your sales team um the next thing is that there wasn't very good tracking and so we wanted to track kpis more closely and so sometimes if you have two chunked up
(22:13) kpis if you just have Clos rate for example it doesn't give you more kind like double click ability to look more granularly into how a closer is doing and so we want to see okay what percentage of people are you getting to show what percentage of people um when you're on the phone are you actually making the offer to uh what percentage of people are missing because of what specific obstacle are not and so this gives us a lot more insight into how each individual closer is doing and then from there that allows us to personalize the coaching that we have for each of those individual sales guys now if
(22:43) you're still looking at this and you're like man what else was there well sometimes it's a who thing which is do I believe that you can train anyone to sell yes do I think it's worth it to train everyone to sell no some people just start further back on the line is it's not worth the resources for the business and so we ruthlessly prioritize who gets the best calls who gets the best times and we do that by who closes the most and if you eventually get kind of weeded out you can almost manage someone out of sales if they consistently Show Low returns for us
(23:12) giving them and feeding them opportunities and so what we did is if you were below kpi we cut your calendar in half if you're still below kpi you have basically a week or two to prove yourself or you're out and so the next thing that we did is that uh we routed the best leads to the best closers so best to best and this is one of my my favorite ways to uh to increase sales overall like if your best closes get the best leads you'll sell more stuff if your worst closes get the worst leads you'll lose the least and so this is an optimization for any sales process
(23:41) across any business and then finally and this is a big one we incentivize the paid and fo because I think this particular business if I'm not mistaken uh the closur got paid the same if they closed or didn't but I prefer to close off cash collected all right which means that the closers have the same incentive as you and so let's say you have a $110,000 thing that you sell well if if you have a payment plan let's say that's five payments of 2K then the closer is going to get call it $200 for that because they get just 10% of the $2,000 they close and if they get the paid in
(24:15) full then they get $1,000 for that sale so they get paid five times more and so this incentivizes closers to actually close instead of these kind of like limp wristed closes they're rock hard wrecked closes no flaccid closes in this house uh and that way you know uh that the the prospect actually has been sold on it and is more likely to stick with it in the long term which for real is actually an important thing and often times these types of issues come up like these lacks of execution when a Founder gets a little too far away and so I like to say you want to know where the bodies are
(24:46) buried like you want to know in every Department what is going wrong as a founder and if you get too far away from it then you don't know which means you don't really add value because you have no context and I think a lot of people get too far away from sales or especially Revenue generation too quickly because they like want to scale and they want to give you know hand off responsibility to people underneath of them but if when you hand stuff off stats go down you have abdicated not delegated when you delegate stats stay the same or go up because theoretically
(25:15) if you give someone who has equal skill more time to do it because they have more time than you then stat should improve and so when you give it to somebody who has less skill than you and you didn't prepare them and you didn't give them a checklist then it's more likely that stuff's going to go down and that's where you have to stay there and they stay sty side by side with you until they get it all right and so with all of this stuff and you're like holy cow that actually when you think about it bad framing for you know we had to make it congruent we we we chunked up
(25:38) Discovery to make sure they avoided traps and stayed high level we simplified it to a three-pillar pitch with a little bit of a pre pitch and we did all the these things on execution to make sure that the team actually was reading the script and actually saying the words the right way the result of all of this work was we got to a 35% close rate so that was more than a double whatever that is 2.4 I think 2.
(26:03) 4x increase in close rate monster all right so we're going to talk about the results of this and at the end I'm going to give you the takeaways that I had for this business that you can use so the result of all that work is we took our CA from $ 5,763 to $2,868 so more than or about cut in half what it cost us to get a customer on top of that we went from a 1.
(26:32) 6 2 which is very bad Raz to a 3.96 Raz much better and we took our revenue from 5 169,000 to 860k per month so we passed our $10 million run rate and we have sustained that since these improvements have occurred and then profit we got to a 30.7% profit margin off of that and so now this business is making $250 $300,000 a month in profit whereas before it was kind of plateaued and just kind of teetering at that edge so let's talk about the big takeaways so what you can do from this for your business no matter what size you're at so number one is that you have to keep the main thing the main thing obviously this business
(27:11) was still generating a decent amount of monthly Revenue but the thing is is that people discount how much an increase in Revenue can prop disproportionately drop to the bottom line and so let's say you've got a business that has 10% margins if you can increase Revenue by 50% you can in a very real way disproportionately increase profit so you could increase profit by 5x when you increase Revenue by 10 or 20% and so understanding the relationship between revenue and profit is something that a lot of business owners don't do and so
(27:41) sometimes it's cool to trim from the bottom line but it's so much better to dra the top line and have that extra Revenue fall through and so big picture here all the way chunked up the constraint was acquisition we weren't getting enough customers now underneath of getting enough customers you'll notice that there's just a pipeline of things that all could be improved it's like can we improve our CTR can we improve our opit can we proove our schedule can we proove our show right can we prove uh can we improve the close rate and so what we did is we just looked at all of them and the key Point
(28:10) here is that we actually looked and so when we tried to improve the webinar we weren't just like shooting from the hip we're like where are people dropping off let's fix it when we looked at the sales we're like where are people suffering well if you're watching the calls you can see that wow the discovery sucks all right well then we need to focus more there at the front and I will also o put this point is that the front is where a lot of times where the cash is so in the beginning of the webinar we pre-loaded
(28:35) it in the beginning of the call we pre-loaded it right before we did the pitch we pre-frame it and so a lot of times people don't understand how powerful the frame is for setting the expectation about what's about to happen next the next one is execution over plan all right so let me explain what I mean by this if you have call it a mediocre script and you have exceptional execution you will still outperform somebody who has an amazing script and no one reads it right or you have an amazing webinar deck but you still sound
(29:02) terrible when you do it you're not going to do as well as somebody who doesn't have as much of a deck but sounds really smooth and great and so a lot of times this is the boring work that people aren't willing to do they're not willing to watch game tape they're not willing to roleplay with the team they're not willing to practice themselves when they do repites or when they do presentations or they're not willing to take a Content piece get to the end of and be like you know what we can do that better we can
(29:21) do it again and so even for this video we redid the intro five times before you actually saw that and so you have to be willing to repeat successful actions and just get 5% better over and over and over again because that betterness across this whole thing compounds and so one of the big things that I've learned around improving anything is that you can actually have measurement as intervention and it's like okay that's a big fancy word is that a is that a drug rehab thing no that's not what I mean um if you want someone to lose weight the first step is to get them to measure
(29:52) their weight and you can actually just have someone measure their weight and they will lose weight if you just have someone report on their profit they will make more profit if you just have them report there show rates schedule rate close rates and reinforce that on a regular daily basis where it affects their behavior in a Cadence where they can change it then they will and so one of the easiest things that you can do to improve any business is start measuring the stuff that matters and if you hate
(30:18) looking at the stat you should look at it twice because it means I want you to feel the pain so that it causes you to change and one of the bigest things is that better is often times one of the lower risk ways versus new all right so if you want to expand or improve a business let's say you're strugging for whatever reason part of you wants to do new because new is sexy new is fun new shiny object but the thing is is that what you're currently doing is already proven to a certain degree and so simply doing more or doing the same thing better is a better risk adjusted move
(30:49) because you already know this works and so fundamentally if we get more people to show we will close at least as many as we did before if we pre-frame with more urgency and get more people to book we will close more sales on the next call right is that fundamentally thinking through this is that more or getting an improvement to augment or get better will always fundamentally in the same system improve it and so just focusing on those things which usually just takes work will give you disproportionate return and oftentimes that drops to the bottom line and one of
(31:19) the first rules of Entrepreneurship that I have is use what you've got now if we look at the team that they have had and the process they had we didn't change them from a webinar we didn't change them from a phone sale we didn't even change their calendar or availability but we just stated the facts and tell the truth we said hey we only have this many slots we only have this many sales guys this is actually live and so we wanted to reinforce the things that we were already doing but simply telling them that we were doing it and you get zero benefits from doing
(31:48) something that you do not communicate everything in business is about perceived benefits perceived scarcity perceived urgency so if you have a deadline but don't let people know there is no deadline if you have scarcity there's only so many slots you can take but you don't let people know you have no scarcity if you are live but you don't tell people you're live you're going to have the same effect as a recorded webinar or as a recorded event which eliminates the competitive advantage that you did this to begin
(32:13) with so we got greedy in this business because YOLO why not uh so what we did was we implemented an upsell and so rather than covering this video because this is front end I want to talk about what we did in the upsell in this video and if it's not out yet check this one out

Transcript:
(00:00) i've had a massive shift in how i view business and it has fundamentally transformed everything that i'm doing [Music] hi my name is alex for mozy um i own a portfolio of companies that has 85 million a year in revenue and this is purely because i just want to help more people not be broke so that's the goal all right so one of the things i'm going to tell you two stories that significantly changed my uh career all right hopefully you'll be able to you'll be able to take the the message from the story because i think they're they're
(00:27) really really good so when i was just starting out in my gym launch business i had a gym owner who said hey let's partner on this like you keep filling these gyms up in full capacity why don't you just fill them and i'll come behind you and operate them and i had a gym that was doing 4.2 million dollars a year um this is what he was telling me and i really know how to operate the business you know all the acquisition stuff so let's just partner up on this and i said sure sounds fair enough it ended up being a horrible partnership
(00:51) but that's not the point of the video the point is what i learned all right and so we had two locations and the newest location had a whole new staff and they were just lackadaisical right they weren't they weren't they weren't caring they weren't really doing a good job and he said you know we need to we need to you know have a meeting and i was like okay and so he said we'll have a meeting at the first location call everyone there tell them to show up at four o'clock and the first location was probably like 45 minutes away from the
(01:16) second location right and at four o'clock so everyone's everyone's everyone's coming in everyone's sitting down it's kind of awkward it's silent there's clearly like some tension right and so at four o'clock he looks at uh his assistant and he says hey go down to the front um lock the door right of the gym and she was like okay so she goes and locks the door mind you some people hadn't shown up to the meeting yet right they were a couple minutes late whatever and so all of a sudden as they lock the door like 30
(01:42) seconds later someone's like banging on the door and it's like hey open the door and he's like ignore him and and they're like like why aren't you letting me in because obviously there's a meeting going on right and then another person comes knocks on the door another person comes knocks on the door now there's like three or four people and they're like what the hell like why aren't you opening the door whatever right and so he tells uh his assistant he says go outside and tell them they're all fired and he says this before he
(02:01) starts the meeting and so i'm sitting there right and everyone in the room is like oh [ __ ] right he just set the tone all right and he reset the bar and i remember witnessing this and being like wow so what he did was he reset the bar of this is how we perform when we say we're going to be somewhere we're going to be somewhere at that time if we say we're going to clean up after the session we're going to clean up after the session if we say we're going to follow up with leads we follow up with leads and what i have figured and i'm going to
(02:31) tell you one more story and then we'll tell you the moral of both of them all right so pause on that for a second now when i had my first job i was a actually i think it was my first it was my first job i was a blender tender at smoothie king all right and so um i learned a lot about what to do what not to do when i was this business it was a small business owner i think he had two locations three locations at the time his name was dave really nice guy what's up dave and i was trained personally by dave so dave trained me
(02:55) and i was you know enterprising young man i wanted to do a good job and so i started my first day at work um at one of his newer locations you know after you know between people walking in you were supposed to like mop the floor clean the counters like just clean it just make it look good restock the shelves and so i started doing that when someone walked out the door it's my first shift right and the manager was like what are you doing i was like i thought like i was worried i was in trouble so i was like i thought i was
(03:18) supposed to am i not supposed to restock the shelves like i thought i was supposed to do that right now because like there's no one here and he was like oh yeah you don't need to worry about that he's like we don't do any of that stuff and i was like oh okay boom new cultural norm all right so what i was supposed to do and what the owner had trained me to do and then was always complaining about how no one ever did what was supposed to do the manager was telling me that i didn't need to do that stuff what i learned from this
(03:42) right and i'll just call that manager john right actually i'll call it manager vince this is the name i'll use so i said so do you in your business have events are you the vince in your business do you have someone in your in your business that's the vince that's secretly destroying your business all right so let's rewind to the the original story about the first show that i was talking about so think about the difference between both of those styles of management i'm not saying the first is writer the second whatever the second
(04:09) one is definitely wrong right but when you look at that what it was was setting the tone and the reason that my views on business have dramatically shifted is that i have always had a tendency to lean towards strategy acquisition monetization pricing structures and all of that stuff is important but i think within a business there are two components to it you've got the smarts and you've got the hearts and you have to have both and i think that most people overestimate the importance of smarts myself included and
(04:38) i think that there's a lot to do with the hearts because business strategy overarchingly is not that complex like you really think about it right it's like you got to find something that's good that people want and you sell it for a lot more than it costs you to do it and you do as much of that as you possibly can like that's kind of the idea right and the thing is is it gets lost in the execution it gets lost in the doing right as soon as you hire first employees you're like no employees can't boys can't do what i can
(05:05) do it's like well that's a horrible belief you should probably change that before you try and move forward that's a limiting belief right do you want to have a big business and so when i think about this from a cultural standpoint and this is what has shifted for me is that it's become so much more about the soft skills it's so much more about coaching and developing the leaders of the company it's so much more about addressing behavioral dynamics of someone that are limiting them more so than it is about tinkering and i
(05:29) can't help but think that so many entrepreneurs myself included i spent so much time tinkering and tweaking things what if we change this in our sales process what if we change this on this page what if we change the offer like this would you change this on the price and what if the payment turns blah blah blah all these different things right and think about this for a second for yourself how many things have you tinkered with in your business over the last however many years how many months and your business hasn't changed at all
(05:50) right because the real problem is not the strategy the problem is not the smarts right the problem is the heart right the people are not doing what you want them to do because they don't understand why they need to do it and why it's important right and that's the soft stuff and you've got you know people who don't want to talk to each other because they don't like each other because one guy's really annoying and so it's like it would be it would better serve you to fix that problem than to try and come up with some new strategy right realizing
(06:14) that has been one of the biggest breakthroughs that i've had in my career those two stories should illustrate the difference between having a championship mentality and having a loser mentality and what might be going on in your business and i'll leave you with one more story really quickly so if any of you has ever been on a championship team right if you've ever played in a sports uh arena or whatever and you've been on a winning team you've been on a losing team right and you've probably been on a losing event a lot of good players but
(06:40) you guys were not connected you weren't concerted you weren't aligned right on the flip side you had a winning team and it was like everyone showed up to practice everyone you know tried their hardest it was the effort and the consistency and the alignment of the team that accomplished the goal the rules are the same everyone was trying to do the exact same thing and so when you think about the entire business landscape right your competitors have access more or less to the same talent pool that you do they can see what your strategy is
(07:05) overall and most people are not that dumb right and so as long as you have a relatively sound strategy like you're not selling things at a loss right then the difference between the two is going to be your ability to execute and have people execute on your behalf and so that's going to become that like for us as ceos we do shift towards becoming championship team coaches which is why john wooden if he had run a business would have had a championship business because he focused on the fundamentals and one of my favorite sayings of all
(07:29) time is advanced people never don't do the basics advanced people never don't do the basics i would go to i would go to these stages and i would watch guys get on stage and they'd say you know we follow up with all of our leads you know within five minutes you know when we get on sales calls we always ask them why they're there we label them a problem you know we overview some of the passings they've done and then they felt they follow a clear framework then as soon as someone buys we you know we have a good onboarding process and nothing
(07:52) they say is revolutionary it's just that they actually do it and the people are actually on their behalf they're not the vince or don't have a manager like vince who's telling them they don't that they shouldn't have to do that work right who's sabotaging the business what they did is they set the tone and then they carry the bar and so their job is to be intolerant of anything but excellence and to reinforce that in the culture so that it's consistently executed across the company because that between two companies with the same
(08:19) strategy will make the difference between somebody who who yields disproportionate returns on advertising crazy profits good growth great retention on employees low turnover from a company that doesn't have that right even though they both have the same strategy even if the smaller company has the better strategy this guy will win and this has been one of the most profound shifts that i've had as a ceo now owner of companies is what i'm looking for is i'm looking for just as much soft if not more soft skills interpersonal dynamics
(08:46) self-awareness then i look for skill in particular you know like this guy's really good at finance which is a really good product this person's really good at marketing sales like i'm looking way more for character traits now and now that i think about it when you if you're thinking about yourself right then i would look in the mirror and say like am i really are we always doing the basics because if we always do the basics we will be advanced because that is what advanced people do is they never don't do them and they have a culture that
(09:13) reinforces that standard so i hope you enjoy the first story hope you enjoyed the vint story make sure you don't have any vince's in your business uh my name is alex shmozey i own a portfolio companies like i said earlier that there's 85 million in revenue lots of broke people on this channel to make sure that you are not one of them keeping awesome click subscribe and i'll see you next video bye

7 Ways to Get People to Buy More Times - YouTube

Transcript:
(00:00) I sold my last company for $ 46.2 million that was gym launch and one of the keys was learning how to grow businesses and so you might not know this but there's two ways that you can double a business one is you double the amount of customers that you sell every month the other is you double how much they're worth this video will give you seven things that we did to double how much customers were worth in our companies and the ones that we buy and invest in today and so this is a money checklist that you can literally
(00:25) immediately do by the end of the video that I do when I buy a company to make all the customers more valuable and ultimately make way more money so here's our outline and just to give you a little bit more context on this I uh gym launch was a company that licensed to gym owners we had over 5,000 locations that licensed our uh business model and one of the things that I did in the Consulting process which I learned before this as a white collar consultant for defense Contracting which you don't care about but that's okay is the
(00:50) Consulting process and the way that we discovered answers to hard questions was we would survey a large percentage of the population then we'd find the people who represented the solution that we wanted so in this instance I looked at all the gym owners and said who is the top 1% of gyms that have the lowest churn and I said if you've maintained that for six months or more tell me what you're doing and so I hopped on the phone with every single one of those gyms and then each one of them gave me 30 different things that they were doing
(01:17) to decrease turn to get people to stay longer but when I looked at all of the data across every one of these gyms that were in the top 1% all of them were doing five things and so I'll give you those five and I'll also add two more that we decided to do that cut our turn in half which ultimately made Jim launch a sellable company and we've now implemented this since in all the businesses that we buy so the first one is exit interviews now if you're in a business that you can't do that uh that's fine but I'd almost recommend
(01:45) that you do it and I'm going to break down each of these in detail on that board as soon as you get into it so I'm going to go through each of them as we go so let's start with exit interviews so exit interviews have this amazing thing that we figured out so the gym owners would say hey when somebody wants to cancel we obligate someone and we discuss it UPF front meaning when someone signs we say just FYI if you do choose to cancel or when you choose to cancel we just ask that you do an exw interview and the main
(02:14) reason for that is so that we can make the product better because if every time someone cancels we get to learn one thing then over time we'll be able to plug all the little holes in our product and people stay again and again and so what happens is you get on the on the phone with this person and you say why so sad right more or less and then they will then usually need to vent and so let me give you the rule of the angry boat so my first or second business Mentor I worked at his he was a fer and he said only one person can be
(02:43) the angry boat this is how it works if someone's angry about you or your product or your business the only way that you can actually solve the problem is get more Angry than them but you're getting angry not at them but at the problem and so they're angry at the problem and then they feel validated when you're even more angry and guess what happens if someone comes in and they're like this is talk I had such a terrible experience you're like that is ridiculous that they had that experience I can't believe you went
(03:06) through that that's absurd we have to get to the bottom this right now we will We I promise you we will fix this for you thank you so much for telling me but it's I I'm more upset than you are about this now what happens is they will then say well I mean it wasn't that big of a deal like I I appreciate you're a business owner things happen like thank you so much they feel validated and they start trying to calm you down and guess what happens you win right and so half the time when we'd get on the phone with
(03:28) these people half we would just say hey we're angrier than you and we said let me make it up to you and so we'd say hey all the money that you've paid up to this point I'm going to give you and you can pick an amount or you can give the whole thing say I'm going to credit that towards you stay so that I can make it up to you and if after that period of time you still aren't happy with the solution that I now have given the fact I know you're upset no worries but at least let me help try and make it up to you by doing
(03:57) that you can either save them or if they say something to the extent of like well I thought I was going to get way more help I thought I need more implementation I need more whatever I need more handholding believe it or not this is what's crazy many of these people actually get upsold and you say you know what it's our mistake you were actually sold into the wrong thing you need way more help than what we currently giving you at this silver level but you'd be perfect for gold because that actually what you described
(04:24) as the problem is literally what gold does and so let me make it up to you let me take everything you paid for silver and credit it towards gold and let's get you taken care of and by doing that we took a negative and actually made a more valuable customer and so if half your customers or half of that half upsell to something that's two times or three times more expensive your Revenue turn just disappears like very smart business move when I say Revenue turn means the amount of Revenue you lose because if you lose half the customers but the
(04:50) other half spend twice as much money you actually don't lose Revenue now the other half say F you and then they leave and that's okay all right and that's part of the game but if you can save half of the People by simply adding this one step guess what you cut down on turn so that is number one exit interviews the next one was reach outs now let me explain what this means so I had to come to this conclusion after looking at all the data across all the locations we had who were doing really well now a lot of
(05:21) them did this in different ways but my hypothesis around why this works so well is they basically approximate a real relationship so the reason that most gyms and many small businesses that are recurring especially in the service industry get stuck around 100 to 150 customers is because of something called dumbar number and so dumbar number is a postulate that people can only manage 150 close relationships or medium relationships in their mind after that it's just too many people and so because of that without any systems you can
(05:52) usually manage about 10050 people which guess what is what most people's business cap at until they have systems and so the reach outs essentially approximate what you do to have a personal relationship with someone but you put it into a system and here's the key part about these reach outs is that the reach outs don't need to be necessarily about the product you sell or their experience as a customer but more checking in on the human being overall and it doesn't need to be every you know every 14 days and you don't
(06:18) necessarily even need to sell that and this is a key point is you're not selling the reach out you sell the product you sell the membership you sell the subscription you sell whatever and then you just do this because on the back end you overd you like and one of the like the key points of this is you can do more than you say you do like your offer that you give someone you don't have to tell them everything you do you need to tell them enough to get them to buy and then everything else becomes surprise and delight and so you can know that every
(06:47) 14 to 21 days you're going to reach out to them and say hey how's life or hey I saw that your daughter uh is going to college or hey I saw that uh you went to that concert this weekend how was it what it does is it creates a relationship and and it's a lot easier you can write this one down a lot easier to quit a membership than it is to quit a relationship and so what we want to do is facilitate that bond that people will have and so what we did is we systematized this so that every trainer I'm just giving you what we did so that
(07:13) you can make it work for your business every single trainer had 40 or so customers that they were responsible for and they reached out on a every 14 to 21 days so if you got 40 customers it means you reach out to 10 or 15 people a week not a big deal and you just check in which hopefully you want to do anyways but by systematizing it we created personalized relationships at scale and cut down turn also that becomes an early warning system because if someone does have an issue they reach out to the person they already have already in
(07:39) communication with so it's not this like who do I talk to they just talk to the person they're already talking to right so you get way faster feedback from the front lines thing number three so we got this guy reach outs next one was events so this is member events now no matter what business you have whether you're a real estate agent you're a plumber you're a gym owner you're you're an agency it doesn't matter having events for your customers shows that you care but more importantly you can also make money from them so let me explain so at
(08:05) the events we made the events for everyone so customers could bring their friends they could bring other potential customers and by doing this it actually became lead gen for us too so we more than paid for the events in the sales that we're able to do with the events and so if you say hey I'm just going give you the gym example hey bring a friend to our event everybody brings a friend great you have twice as many people there as you normally would and then of course you make a crazy offer while you're there for anybody's a
(08:29) friend say Hey cuz as an aside if you don't know this referrals are typically worth two to three times more than than normal cold customers and so if anyone if you should pay for any lead the most it should be referrals or be willing to pay the most for referrals and so out events the way that we do this and I I'll give you the I'm going to give you a little tip here so number four is handwritten cards I'm going to show you how these work together all right so that means handwritten card we found out that handwritten cards work every
(09:00) sixish weeks that also tends to coincide with the Cadence that you can run events for your members now an event if you run it afterwards your turn will go up people get a lot of value and they say you know what I got enough value I want to leave and so the key to making events work is the open loop you have to tell them when the next event is going to be while or right before they have this event so they always have something to look forward to otherwise they'll get the value and then they'll leave and I found this out the hard way which is why
(09:28) I'm telling you always have the next thing in place place now the key to making the referral thing work is that you send them a handwritten card with their name you sign it whatever you say hey we appreciate you we know that you could choose you know a lot of places to fly thank you for choosing Alex Airlines whatever now here's the PS statement this is the important part you put PS at the bottom and you say take a picture of this card and text it to a friend in a three-way keep your mind out of the gutter in a
(09:57) threeway and that way you're your friend is invited to so you write them the handwritten card you remind them of the event that's coming up so that one they it shows that you care you took the time two you're giving them a benefit to the theme of the event you call it crazy sock Wednesday whatever who who cares all right then that's obviously a gym scenario if you have marketing you would make it themed around something else then you say invite another business owner and if they have this picture at the door they'll get LED in and so they
(10:24) then get kudos from their friend to inviting them to a free event where you generate leads from it and so you reinforce the relationship with the customer you reinforce the personal tie and you give them a benefit while also allowing them to give a benefit to somebody who becomes a customer of yours and by doing these two things together check check we kept more customers so the fifth one and this is this is if I had to I'm I'm I'm getting to the best ones last because uh YOLO all right uh this was attendance tracking all right this one's
(10:55) big all right we're getting into the mey the mey mees the double meets the double meet retention tactics calm down Jason all right all right so so we have attendance tracking so what we were able to see from tracking attendance at our gyms is let's say it's it's somebody on a three times a week membership so you have three times a week they show up then three then two then two then one then zero and they'd cancel all right this is pretty much you could see it you could just see it clear as day people just start they fall they
(11:25) come down once and then they slowly trick off and then they cancel which by the way the easiest correlation with cancellation is lack of consumption so if you want people to stay and pay you got to get them to use it and one of the things I had in the gym world that I I think is worth writing down for anyone is that no matter how cheap a gym membership is a gym membership you never use is never worth it and so whether it's $5 or $50 if someone doesn't use it even if it's the most amazing thing in the world they will not keep paying for
(11:53) it at some point because it's a waste is a waste and so on the flip side almost no one complains about a gym membership they use every day no matter how expensive it is because if you use it every day you're going to want to keep using it and so the goal is consumption and so attendance tracking helped us get an early indicator that someone is about to fall off and if you don't have early indicators in your business that's what you need to have because churn people canceling is a lagging indicator it means it happens after the bad thing
(12:22) happened we want to find out the moment the bad things happen so we can turn something from tragic to Magic that's a Disney saying but what we found is that if we found that somebody went and they missed one session of the three that they were supposed to go to if we reached out to them a bunch of times here the next week in this scenario same Miss Boom they're back at three back at three and we saved them because they found out that someone was actually paying attention to whether they were coming or not and so they felt accountable to
(12:52) showing up because someone was paying attention and so this works for whatever it is that you sell is you want to make sure that they know that you're paying attention to whether they're consuming it or not and the way that you actually do these reach outs is reverse of leads okay so let me explain with a lead like a marketing lead you reach out a lot of times the first day fewer times the second day fewer times the third day few times fourth day and eventually you stop reaching out to them right because they didn't they didn't buy they're not
(13:20) interested whatever with customers when you reach out you reach out once the first day if they don't respond reach out twice the next day if they still don't respond you reach out three times basically you escalate rather than deescalate when it's a customer because you're like hey we need to figure this out and by mapping this Reach Out structure to attendance tracking you can go from this scenario to this scenario and that's exactly what happened for us and for all the memberships that I've been a part of so that covers attendance
(13:47) tracking let's go to number six also a big beefy boy calm down Jason which is onboarding all right this one is like one of those silent killers that you would not believe how important and effective it is to implement this within within your business so now if you have a on to many type solution where you're onboarding you know you have 100 customers a day they get they get sold because you have a $5 a month $10 a month whatever thing you just want to automate the onboarding if you have any type of service that you
(14:14) can possibly I would say honestly even if it's a hundred bucks a month you can still do group on boardings right and so the idea is that you want to have a clear choreographed experience for day one all the way to day whatever day x and you want to tell them this is what's going to happen and the key word in this whole thing is expectation setting is you want to set expectations and you want to reconfirm the buying process buying decision so essentially you're reselling them on why they chose to buy from you
(14:53) to begin with a lot of people in the first 24 hours is where they get cold feet they back out they just say hey you know what charge you know charge back refund whatever it is they don't even consume the thing yet and so you want to reconfirm the buying decision tell them why it was a great idea give other reasons that they didn't mention and also confirm the ones they used to buy and then you say this is the road map this is what you can expect to see from us and the ideal client relationship you simply set expectations meet
(15:19) expectations set expectations meet expectations and if it's up to you I would rather you set and meet multiple times rather than set 20 and then meet all 20 on this day so let me give you an example if I had a marketing agency and let's say we did website design and SEO and whatever a bunch of other stuff if I had a weekly Cadence with them where I said hey this is all the stuff we did in the last week it would be more effective to say this is what we're working on today and then the next day send them an email be like
(15:48) hey we finished that part and tomorrow we're working on this in the same seven days they're going to get seven positive feedback Cycles with you and your business of you setting expectations and meeting expectations even though it's the same work simply taking a second to reach out to them at each of these scenarios to let them know what you did will get them to stay longer imagine you sign up and the next day they're like hey we already did this we're like oh that just reconfirmed the buying decision and they met the expectations
(16:14) they set and then you do it again and then again and again and by the time day 30 comes around they're like man these guys are amazing they're so on it and that's what you want customers to think about you and so you want to set the expectations you want to reconfirm the decision and I like to think of something like a walkth through which which is how do you use the thing whatever it is how do you use our service if this happens what do you do and this process you want to have this all over the place like this you're
(16:38) going to repeat over and over and over and over and over and over again because they're not listening they're on their phone they've got their kids in the backseat they don't really care that much about your business they bought it one time on a whim whatever you want to make sure that at least one of the times they hear part of it and they can assemble the whole Mona Lisa picture together through the many times you told them so onboarding if you're not doing it please for the love of God do it because you will be amazed at how many
(17:05) you will get you could probably add one or two months to your uh recurring Revenue by simply setting the acation properly reconfirming the decision and walking them through exactly what they just bought so that gives us our onboarding and finally lucky number seven unlockables all right so what's an unlockable great question Jason unlockables and Milestones okay now this is going to be so painfully obvious and yet no one does it what do you want a customer to do like really you're like what do you want a customer to actually do besides continue
(17:38) to stay and pay there's other stuff too right so right off the bat what I want someone to do is I want them to activate now if you haven't Define what activation is you look at the customers that have stayed with you the longest and you ask them what are the things they did early that provided the most value you can also survey this depending on the size of your customer base you say hey what was the thing that provided the most value and you can try and guess at this once you get this point right everything you do drives to activate
(17:59) customers so for example uh if you had a software that built landing pages you might find out that if you get someone to switch to a customer URL rather than you know XYZ software dot whatever their name is as soon as they make that switch they stay five times longer you want to figure out what that activation point was for gym launch it was if we get someone a $2,000 sale in the first seven days the likel they stay and continue to pay was monstrous and so we drove a lot of attention to try and make sure people
(18:21) actually made a darn sale that was really big in material in the first week duh right if I have someone in weight loss I want them to lose five pounds or more in the first week duh so these are these key points that seem like duh things but if that's actually so important why aren't we driving all of our effort towards that thing a different software company that I know uh they called the first five clients problem they had to get um trainers onto a software and they realized that if they just got the trainer five clients
(18:45) then they would never cancel and so everything drove towards getting the person the first five customers and all of that is Activation so that's step one step two is what else would I want from our customer well I I don't know about you but I would want testimonial right I mean if I activated them and they're happy now let me see if they can get me more customers so I want to get a review I want to get a testimonial and you can do that a variety ways they can do a post they can leave you a review on a on a review site they can leave you a
(19:11) personalized video number of different ways you do it or all the ways you can ask them to do those things and you get something else from them number three is I want a referral right you know people why do you hate me why don't you want to tell your friends about my product do you hate them or do you hate me you hate one of us right so we got to figure out what it is and I think I I used to like again this is where Rapport comes into place and how big your business is but like when I was like younger I'd be like why
(19:35) do you hate me so much Sarah and she's like what are you talking about I don't hate you i' be like you haven't sent any friends or do you hate your friends and be like I don't hate my friends I'll be like then let's meet let's hang out introduce me let's do a three-way and they're like whoa just kidding haha same jokes every time anyway and so you do the text intro you get you get it you're like hey take a picture with me and Sarah and we take the picture I take it on her phone we send it to her friend with me me as the third person that way
(20:00) they can't ignore you and you have it on the iPhone so it's all blue and everyone knows everyone's legit but because of that they have a face that they don't know the face they do know and the face they do know is in the text message thread so they can't be a dick to me because they know that Sarah likes me and that's how you can get referrals referrals number three number four you're like wait how's this Ty your retention don't worry don't you worry we'll get there is Ascension so uh this is actually wild uh there was a great
(20:26) research study that was done by one of these big Fortune whatever companies and they found out that the single greatest thing that you could do to retain customers is get them to buy something else because at a certain point people get this itch to buy like it's been a year since I bought something in this space and if you don't satisfy them by literally providing another offer to them they will just go buy somewhere else and so as silly as this sounds sometimes the best way to retain someone is to sell someone again and sell them
(20:54) something else or bigger and so if we think about this from a reverse standpoint if I had a customer I would want them to activate I want them to leave me a testimonial I want them to send a referral and I want them to buy more stuff and more expensive stuff well if that's what I want them to do then for God's sake why don't we make these things the unlockables now the unlockables are another fancy word for bonuses that someone gets after they do a certain thing so if I want everyone to activate then I might make whatever my
(21:24) kpi is for Activation get a big carrot on top of it they get a big jackpot for doing doing this thing right and so if I was in a digital environment let's say I have a school community so you can say hey if You' stayed for 3 months you get this big Mega training on ads that I did and the reason I have it at three months is because you got to do the fundamentals but if you stay past month three this unlocks wow boy do I have a bigger incentive to State a month three if I know I'm going to get this big jackpot of value and guess what I'm
(21:49) going to do a month three a month six and month 9 and the thing is you want to go some little human behavior thing you can actually extend this timeline it can go three and then you can go eight then you can go month 15 like you can extend the time Horizon between the big positive reinforcements and then just make them bigger and batter every time and they look forward to them more and more and more and so unlockables can either be on activity meaning they did something I'll give you this ad training if you leave me a testimonial I'll give
(22:20) you this ad training if you send me a referral I'll give you the as training if you buy the next level or it can be off of tenure which means they don't do anything besides stay and pay which hey we're also happy to do that you get this at month six you get sorry you get this at month three you get this month eight you get this month 15 whatever and so the unlockables can get people to stay that extra time and if you're not tracking this every month which you absolutely should be you should be able to tease that number up you should see
(22:47) every month okay we're at 3.7 months all right we're 4.2 months all right what do we do to go from 4.2 to 4.7 what do we do from 4.7 to 5.6 and you just keep adding and plugging the holes in the bucket because I promise you with retention it's not the bullet it's all of these things put together and when we did this it took our turn from 11% to 6% monthly now let me walk you through the final thing to explain why this is worth it so we're going to talk about retention why does this matter all right so let me give you a very simple
(23:17) example let's say you sell something that's $100 a month okay great awesome Alex $100 a month now let's say your turn as in the percentage of people who leave every month is 10% so you've got 100 custom customers month later you've got 90 so 10% churn now my lifetime value per customer is $11,000 that means they stay on average 10 months this is V1 this is pre everything I'm about to show you now if all we do if you follow everything I show you in this video is you get that 10% let's say what do we want to get it to survey says give me a
(23:48) number what do we want the CH to become 6% all right that'll be tough for math let's go 5% so we get turn from 10% to 5% doesn't seem like a big difference we go from 10 to 5 right we decrease it by 5% big whoop right well let me show you how big of a whoop it is calm down Jason all right it's that means that my new lifetime value per customer is $2,000 and while everyone else in your industry is obsessing about how do I get more customers how do I get more customers if you can double how much your customers
(24:17) are worth you more than d one you double your Revenue but secondly you'll more than double your profit because you don't have to pay the additional cost of acquisition every time to make that extra revenue and so all the savings drop straight to your bottom line so the incremental margin on this is huge and guess what other jackpot bonus you get if everyone else can only spend let's say if they're doing three to one $300 to get a customer guess what you can spend $600 to get a customer that's if you're keeping three to one which I
(24:45) recommend all right so you can get whatever 650 you get the point all right per customer so here's the crazy thing is that if you can only spend 300 you might be you might cap out at say $1,000 a day in ad spend but if you can 650 you might cap out at 100,000 A Day In AD spend so getting a double on LTV I'll give you an example for one of our businesses one of our companies we took we 1.
(25:09) 9x LTV actually really similar to this it was actually it was so it was 2,000 to start and we took it to uh 3,800 and we did this through a massive list that I'm going to show you in a second but by putting by going from 2,000 to 3,800 that's an eight we went from $2 million per month in the business to $2 million per week that that's why this matters so let's dive in so we talked about what retention is we talked about why it matters you can massively make way more money by just changing the things you do inside the business also you'll be a better
(25:42) business overall but the third one was how to actually change it so I'm going to give you a bonus number four which is okay Alex I haven't done any of these things which should I start with if I was going to give you an order to order these things and I was just a nefarious which I which I am um I did these not in reverse order um I would probably think about this both in cost to put into place and then return from it because some of these things might be really powerful but take a long time and I'd rather you do this in order of like
(26:10) bang for buck all right so number one would be onboarding you literally just add one step in the process after someone gets closed and then you reaffirm the decision you set the expectations and then you give them the road map you give them the walkthrough what's what's going to happen next it's all you do all right and you talk to them make them feel like a human that they didn't justay money some glom big gray box of money making all right so number one we on Board number two is I would probably do unlockables main
(26:38) reason here is that you pretty much just set the incentive in place once you have it it's like a one-time fix like you do you figure out what your unlockable is and then you just set up when you want it to be and for example if you're currently people are currently staying four months then put it at month five just try and get them to get over that edge just give them something to look forward to Edge them on right so you want to just put it just path where they're currently cancelling so that would be the second thing that I would
(27:00) do the third thing that I would do would be the exit interviews that's a three there we go because you can pretty much implement this quickly and I think you as a Founder uh especially if you're getting into this this is so valuable like you get so much great data on what you can do better and you have the opportunity to save the customer and you have the opportunity to ascend the customer like so so high value definitely worth it uh if I had to go number four here attendance tracking this one takes more work but huge
(27:31) returns and so I would say this one has is super effective in terms of uh Power it just takes more work to do but this would probably be number one or number two in terms of like actual effect on on retention it just takes a little bit more work so i' do one two and three first all right let's do after that I would say survey says number we're five right here I would go reach outs we want to facilitate a human relationship this takes a little bit work because you got to you got to disseminate customers between people and if you don't have
(27:59) that then you have to set up systems to automate some of those reach outs and make and here's the key if they know it's automated it will not work it has to be systematized not automated if it's automated like how many times do you respond to the green text that's like obviously automated never you don't care because it shows that they don't care and so the best way and this is aism the best way to get people to think that you care about them this is a really key trick is to actually care about them that's it so reach outs and then I would
(28:28) say these these two I would Implement together so we'll go six and seven because they're just such a perfect little marriage of doing the events and the invitations via handwritten cards um this is something that's like fun it's value at it's the key is the open loop between the events and you get the referrals you get from the handwritten cards so that's the order that I would do these in and I've got something else for you something extra sexy because you know I love you little Easter egg for everybody else right now we've got the
(28:52) school games running and if you don't know what that is I'll tell you the the outcome of it which is that right now 3.44% of people who start the games and finish their first month all right first month just finish their first month make their first dollar online which I cannot explain to you like going from here wherever you're at now if you don't have a business to making your first dollar is the hardest bridge to get over there's so many things that feel unknown and so the fact that we're getting 3.
(29:26) 44% I like could not be more excited about and so if you're somebody who's trying to start a business we help you facilitate a lot of the stuff in school automatically um and so automatically if you will uh and so uh you can give it a shot I've got a course we do a bunch of calls in there I put articles inside of the group there uh that are specific related to that business model uh and you can start absolutely free uh so if you want you can give it a shot school.
(29:53) com games everybody else keep crushing and if you have a business you want to sell go acquisition. comom see you later

Transcript:
(00:00) in this video i want to talk about how to close a higher percentage of deals and how to close more deals overall and it's all sent around a single concept which is the belief continuum all right and so if you think about this visual that i have right here so you've got your salesman here and you've got your prospect here right and you see this bubble that i put over head the prospect has no bubble inside it's completely empty and they might have a negative bubble as well and then you've got the salesman who's
(00:21) got his belief bubble so many people like to think like do you believe in what you are selling right they ask the question as though it's a binary answer yes or no i believe or i don't believe but it would be much more accurate to say to what extent do you believe in right because belief is not a binary question it is a continuum it is how much do you believe in what you are selling because if you thoroughly 100 believe with all of your heart and mind that what you are selling is true i guarantee you that you will sell significantly more
(00:47) and so what i want to show you is these two equations that i wrote down as simple equations for how to actually sell many people focus i would say a disproportionate amount of people focus on the skill of selling and there absolutely is a skill to sales you have to know exactly what to say you have to know how to say it but you can shortcut that path to success by having conviction and the way that you have conviction is by a dramatically understanding the needs of your prospects so that when you are talking to somebody
(01:15) you know exactly what their problem is so that if your product perfectly matches their problem you can have conviction in order to sell it most salespeople don't even listen to the prospect at all and simply want to deliver their pitch which inherently means that they can't believe in the product that much because they're not even thinking about whether it solves the problem for the prospect because you can't be convicted that it's going to solve the problem if you don't even know what the problem is and so they haven't taken any time to
(01:39) understand the prospect most sales training is currently focused on educating salesmen around the product when it should be most time focused on educating the salesmen around the prospect and their problems not the product all right key understanding shift that has to happen when you're educating a sales team and or yourself especially if you're entering a market that you are not the avatar right one of the reasons that many successful businesses happen from somebody who suffered from a pain and then went to go solve it for themselves and then ended
(02:07) up solving it for other people is because they desperately and they so clearly understand the thoughts needs and pains of the prospect and they know how the product solves those problems the first equation here is for increasing closing percentage and so if it's you that's selling or if it's a sales team that's selling it's the skill of sales multiplied by the extent to which you believe it is not yes i believe no i believe this number can be a hundred right and the thing is is that i believe that this number of conviction can grow far
(02:39) higher than what skill can give you you can be a very skilled salesman but let's say the skill of sales is one to ten right i'll put this on here so who can see it let's say your skills tails can be one to ten i believe that your skill your your beliefs around conviction can be one to a hundred right so even if your skill of sales is a two you could have a hundred belief and i guarantee you that you will close because people can sense whether you believe what you are telling them is true and they believe that what you are
(03:07) selling them is going to solve their problem right and so most people most sales teams most sales managers do not focus enough on this bubble which is conviction which is this part of the equation right if you think about what sales is it's fundamentally a transference of belief and so how can you how can you transfer an empty cup how can you transfer a cup that is only one third full into another empty cup and expect it to be over the threshold of the amount of belief that's required for a prospect to make a purchasing
(03:36) decision of course not right and so we still try and get the person to say a certain thing or pause in this way or have this tonality or this emphasis and that is important right and there's definitely a place for that you have to have the basis of sales in place but a much much bigger lever that is often and most underutilized or unutilized at all is the conviction or the extent to which the salesman believes in what they are selling and to what extent it can help solve the prospects problems all right and so that will
(04:05) influence the closing percentage of an individual or team the second piece is going to be the work ethic right so a lot of people have probably seen really good closers versus really bad closers based on their closing percentage but also total number of deals closed personally when you have somebody who has really high work ethic then they can make up for a lower closing percentage by having more activity so that means that they are following up with their pipeline faster they are following up more times right they are reaching out to people on
(04:31) their own in their own time to give themselves more opportunities and they can compensate for a lower closing percentage by simply having more at bats right and so if you think about the expert salesman as having these two things together which is you want to have a high closing percentage and you want to have lots of units sold all right and so there's three variables here you've got skill you've got conviction and you've got work ethic but conviction counts twice because if you believe that what you are selling is
(04:55) genuinely going to help people you will follow up faster you will fall more religiously you will follow up as though you were trying to help someone and so let me let me ask you this question as a is a good mental thought process if you could go back in time let's say you could go back in time five years and you could talk to yourself and say hey i want you to put a hundred percent of the money that we have right now mind you you couldn't tell the person that is you your past self that you are you in the future right so you you can't
(05:21) say anything like that but in this thought experiment and you went back in time and you said hey we've got this money in the bank account i want you to put 100 of money into this thing called bitcoin or hey i want you to put 100 money into something called amazon i want you put all that money into tesla or whatever right something that blew up over the last five years all right if you were to tell yourself that let's say you were talking to you and you were like um i'm good thanks right how many times would you follow up with yourself to get
(05:50) yourself to do that thing or do that action or make that investment a lot and it's because you truly believe that it would solve your prospects problem and you have pure conviction that what you are selling them the investment the opportunity that whatever it is is 100 going to work think about how you would approach that how many times would you follow up how how convicted would you be when you spoke would you even be focused on the skill of selling or would you be focusing on how true what you say is and if you can make that perspective
(06:21) shift and if you're a sales manager and you're trying to manage a sales team i would implore you to focus way more of your time around the thing that counts twice in the equation of selling and creating great sales people which is the belief to which the extent the extent to which they believe what they are selling and to whom they are selling then boring with the with the uh the monotony of the skill which which don't get me wrong it is very important to sell there's lots of videos that you've probably heard where i talk
(06:46) about the skill of sales but i think when you when you rate this and you were in a forced multiplication standpoint i don't think that they are equated i don't think they are equivalent right and the the proof that i have in this is that if you look at every single religious you know movement you are selling something very hard to sell which is a completely new frame of view around the world the people who believe this many times they don't train them in the skill of selling they just get them to believe wholeheartedly in what they are selling
(07:12) right and so if your salesman and your sales team are not drinking the kool-aid quite literally of the products that you sell or the services that you sell then that is your problem not whether or not they are clarifying the problem the beginning now they should because they should be listing and they should believe they want to should make sure that the the prospect is is going to be best served by this right but big picture if you fix this everything else will happen and i'll tell you this is the one last story around this if you believed
(07:37) wholeheartedly in the the solution that you are selling would you not then spend lots of time honing your skill probably because you would want to help more people because you believe in the thing that you were selling them right you would you not if you believe in this thing wholeheartedly follow up with as many people as possible be quick to respond because you know how much it's going to change their life probably and so i think that just like simon sinek says start with why i believe that the skill of sales is
(08:06) fundamentally a transference of belief and we do need to start with why for salespeople because it is not a question of whether or not they believe it is an ext it is the question of to what extent do they believe and if you can get that to 100 you will never have problems selling ever again so hope you found this valuable click subscribe lots of love and i'll see in the next video

Transcript:
(00:00) going everyone i've got a super special podcast video for you today um what i want to talk to you about is how um to answer the hardest questions in business using one math equation that only has three variables all right and don't worry it's like it'll be worth it this is the number one thing this is the number one equation that i use in my entire life all right uh for business it's the one that i use most frequently and where this all started for me was um i remember when i had my gyms which is a recurring revenue business obviously um
(00:30) i just i wanted to know how we were doing but you know my data tracking wasn't great and and i you know it's just like stuff was all over the place and i just didn't know how what we were doing and what we were on track for and i just know how it worked and i was like man i wish i could just like see into the future i wish i knew what this would end up like right and so i was uh playing around with math stuff and this is actually at a time when i was trying to get better at math because i'm not i wasn't naturally good at math
(00:57) and so i would just like try and like write out what like how i would try and calculate this and i really struggled with it and one day i was driving and it actually just hit me i was like what if i just divided it by this and that would just tell me the number and it turns out i was right and so what i want to explain to you is the number one equation that i use the most in all of business and i call it the pi equation all right now it has nothing to do with pi p i right and it has everything to do with any kind of
(01:28) just i mean really just all business it is the sweetest equation ever i love it i use it all the time all right so what is the pi equation why is it called pi um i actually think i was dieting at the time so i called it pies it looked like a pie when i drew it out pi like the pie you eat no actual real reason i call it this and for some reason it has stuck all right and so it is a simple equation it is a division equation all right very simple draw a big line here all right and what it essentially is i'll draw a
(01:57) smaller one here just so you can see it is inflow divided by outflow all right so why is this useful so for me i like to have a very good idea of where my business is at where they're growing whether we're shrinking what if we just did this for the rest of a year or forever what we'd end up at and that is exactly what this question answers what's important about this is that the inflow is actually a rate thing so basically you're dividing rates to get an outcome all right i'm not going to get like super into it because that's not what's
(02:33) important what's important is understanding what it will give you which is your hypothetical max right and it gives you three different hypothetical maxes uh so you can calculate stuff for your business all right so for example let's say i have an inflow of five new customers per month all right i get five new customers a month and let's say that my churn on my membership am i recurring my service whatever right is let's say it's ten percent all right so that's point one ten percent all right so if i want to know
(03:06) what the max amount of customers i will be able to have given this inflow i can project that so right now if i have let's say 30 clients if i'm doing this and getting five new clients a month and losing 10 percent it means that i will be growing because 10 of 30 would be three and i'm getting five right but at some point in the future right as i go on there will be a point where 10 is equivalent to 5 and at that point i'd reach equilibrium and so that is when i would have reached my hypothetical max and so why this is so
(03:41) important is that when i do this little equation let's say it's 5 divided by 0.1 which is 50 right which means 50 is going to be my hypothetical max so i know that if i'm signing up five people every month and i'm losing 10 of my clients every month that i will reach a business that has 50 clients on average and i will not be able to increase that number ever unless i either increase the amount of people i sign up the rate at which i sign them up or i decrease the rate at which people leave and that's it pretty cool right like
(04:15) this equation has like changed my life so what it does is it allows me to make very quick uh calculations to understand where i'm at whether we're doing well whether we're shrinking etc so for example if we had the same equation where i said i had 30 people right now and i said i'm signing up two people a month right and i've got 10 churn then i know that the hypothetical max of that is 20 right is 20 which means that i'm going to be shrinking from 30 to 20 over the next how many months unless i fix this and so
(04:47) it gives me a very clear snapshot of what whatever i'm currently doing extrapolates into the future now you probably already have some ideas of how you could use this in your business right this gives you a hypothetical max it projects out your current rate so you can understand where you're going that's the point all right now let me draw a little dotted line here that is the first use of this equation the second use is understanding lifetime value all right so let's say that we have a client and the average revenue
(05:17) per client that we have per month let's say is uh 500 all right so let's say it's let's use a different number i'll say a thousand dollars all right that's a little simple all right so a thousand dollars per month is my average revenue per client now let's say that i can keep a thousand dollar per month client uh for five months so my churn right the percentage that would leave every month would be twenty percent all right so twenty percent which would be point two right is my rate of people leaving twenty percent of my customers so if i have ten
(05:48) customers two leave every month it's twenty percent all right let's churn now when i phrase the equation or whatever when i when i frame it this way i can now extrapolate how much this person is worth to me so if i know that my average person pays me a thousand a month and i know that on average 20 of my customers leave every month then i know that my customers aren't average worth five thousand dollars which is 1 000 divided by 0.
(06:15) 2 pretty sweet right so now i know that if all customers that come to me if i change nothing are worth five thousand dollars then that gives me a number that i can go and market with i know that i can spend at least a thousand two thousand dollars to go acquire this customer right i'm using rough math it'd be less than two thousand you want to be a three to one i'm not going to get into that right now but that's that's the point here is that this would give me rough math to know how much i could spend to acquire a
(06:37) customer that's super useful now with these two things together i can know where my business is going to stall i can also see how i can manipulate these variables in order to know where my business is going to reach now i can also see if i'm increasing if i'm if i'm growing my business or if i'm my business is shrinking simply by knowing what my inflow of customers in versus my outflow now you can also do this on a bigger scale i said it's it's three variations of the same concept all right now let's say i'm signing up ten thousand dollars a month
(07:16) of new business all right so this is the same concept as this what i was talking about over here where you know i'm signing up five customers a month but this is just basically combining the first two things into one overall number right so i'm signing up ten thousand dollars a month of new business all right that's what i'm setting up in new business per month all right now if i know that i'm losing again ten percent of my revenue per month then i know that's ten percent oops which is point one right or point one
(07:47) then i know that this business is going to cap out at a hundred thousand dollars per month now again the reason that that's important and the reason that i use all three of these variations of this equation is because i can see if i'm shrinking or i'm getting bigger if i know that we signed up ten thousand dollars uh in a month and we're doing ten percent turn and we're we're i know we're going to extrapolate out to a hundred thousand dollars a month but if we're currently at 200 i'm like that's not good we need
(08:14) to fix something or if we're at 50 i'd be like that's awesome we're going to double but the thing is is that you're going to double and then you're going to cap and what's more is that as you do this unless you have negative churn which most people do not have in service-based businesses what's going to happen is that your rate of growth is going to slow all right so it looks like this all right and so this is going to be your hypothetical max right at the top here all right and so what happens is you quickly like when
(08:46) you have zero clients when you sign up 10 people right boom you have a huge explosion in growth right percentage-wise it's like a vertical line right but the next month when you have ten and you lose two now you have eight but then you gain another ten but you only gained eight right but then now you lose ten percent again right so you lose or sorry twenty percent again but now you lose three because ten percent is bigger of eighteen right so you drop down to 15 but then you add another 10 right but now you're at 25 but you notice how the
(09:11) rate goes from 10 to 8 to 2 to 7 right the growth continues to slow down over time because churn eats out a bigger and bigger percentage right and so with this you can know that this is going to be your hypothetical max realistically though most businesses have enough volatility that once you're at about 80 90 of your max which would be like right here right it's realistically where you'll usually end up capping out because your your your fluctuations in business are such that that's around where you're going to be
(09:44) now i'm going to add in a bonus thing for you which is called the golden ratio and so the golden ratio is the way to beat this equation so that you actually never end your growth here's how it works we're going to have two rates so you have the rate of people leaving right leaving percentage you can put that as whatever you want the fancy word is turn leaving percentage x is percentage cancel percentage whatever and then here you have your referral percentage this is where things get magical so if percent of your customers were to
(10:18) refer a new customer every month and five percent of your customers leave every month then you have ten percent over five percent and it means that your business will double every growth period or sorry it uh basically it just it will continue to unendingly grow because the more people who come in from referrals a smaller percentage leave every month and this is called net negative churn this is where you have a business that grows faster than it turns on its own without paid advertising because your product is so
(10:51) good that is where we all want to go this is the promised land this is the golden ratio which is what i call it and when you can achieve this you can grow forever now re realistically you don't grow forever because you'll get big enough and you'll mess something up and then all of a sudden your referral percentage will go down or your turn percentage will go up one of those things happen but when you can achieve this for a period of time that is when you have crazy growth right because not only are you getting
(11:18) customers from your normal acquisition channels but you're actually the percentage of customers who refer which is why it's important uh is it stays fixed and it's greater than your percentage turn and so it just continues to grow and grow and grow which is awesome um so as a quick recap for you the pi equation is the most used equation that i use in all of business especially if you have a recurring revenue based business but even if you do not it's still an awesome equation and i use it in three specific ways one
(11:46) is so that i can know whether i'm growing or shrinking number one number two i used to extrapolate out what my current uh my gr acquisition versus my outflow rate how much i'm going to level out at this equation gives me that answer to the same degree it also gives me my hypothetical lifetime value per client so i can know that how much i can spend to acquire customer because i can know exactly what they're going to be worth to me give them their churn and what they pay me on average per month and again i can put all those things
(12:17) together into one number where i say i'm starting up this much new business per month and this much business is lose is leaving and this is going to be my overall number this top number is going to be the overall number that i'm going to be able to generate per month in my business all right um and so putting all these things together is i use this equation i mean i five times a day i use it all the time i use it when i'm coaching people i use it when i'm thinking about how we're doing and this is the type of back in napkin
(12:44) math that i feel like every entrepreneur needs to have in order to be able to understand where their business is and how it's doing and let me show you one more way to use this because like i said i use this equation literally every day all the time and it's by combining two of those pieces so if i had uh like i said earlier let's say i had five thousand dollars was the lifetime value right that i had calculated right which was based off of uh you know a thousand dollars per month uh divided by uh twenty percent churn right
(13:15) that gives me my five thousand dollars now let's say that i know that i'm signing up 20 clients a month i can know that simply by these two numbers if i know what my inflow is 20 clients a month and i know that they're going to be worth 5 000 total then i know that my business is going to level out at a hundred thousand dollars per month all right this is like the biggest thing ever this is how this like the whole game works like this is the equation this is how everything that i do extrapolates off of this thing all right and so
(13:50) 20 right per month now here's where it gets tricky because you're like well that makes sense it's math yeah but it doesn't look like that when you're in it because when you're in it you signed up 20 customers and you're at a thousand dollars a month per customer you're doing 20 000 a month and you don't know if you're doing well or not because you don't can't see into the future to see that if you just keep doing what you're doing and you don't break it and you don't get entrepreneurial 80d and you don't get
(14:11) shiny object syndrome if you just keep doing what you're doing and every month you drop another 20 in right you drop another 20 and you drop another 20 in then you're going to get to 100 000 a month right it takes time for recurring revenue businesses to gain traction and so if you understand this it can give you kind of this peace of mind and understanding where you're going where you're at whether you're growing whether you're shrinking and what you need to do to fix it because with these equations you can say either i have to increase
(14:37) the lifetime value i have to by either increasing the price or decreasing the churn which is one of those two things or i have to increase my inflow and simply by understanding those three pieces piece number one which is your price piece number two which is your turn piece number three which is your inflow if you understand those three pieces then you can understand exactly how to make your business however big you want so that is the pi equation this is the most used equation that i use i wish i could have a sexier title for this um
(15:04) because everyone needs to watch it and understand it in absolute depth because this is everything when i when i talk to a business owner when they're struggling when they don't know what to do this is what i use this is it like this is what i use when i'm trying to figure out what their business i'm like what's your inflow what's your turn what's your average price per user it's the first thing i'm asking literally it's the first two questions i'll ask and then i'm like what's your revenue right now and just by knowing that i can
(15:28) know whether they're growing whether they're shrinking how fast they're growing i can know where they're going to level out i can know how many customers they're going to level out at i can know all of these things simply by asking those four pieces of of data and having this equation in my back pocket and so i use this every day it's like i breathe this equation and the more you play with it the more you understand it uh the more powerful you be as an entrepreneur and i promise you it will be worth mastering so anyways

(00:00) what's going on everyone alex was here ceo of joomlas prestige labs and alan and a number of other portfolio companies that we have we did 120 plus million so what i want to do is show you some of the the lessons that we have learned along the way so uh volatility and risk so i had a conversation with um somebody on my team and it was such a good conversation i wish i had recorded it and so this is going to be my attempt to break this down for you so this is if you are an entrepreneur and you have a sales team you can send this
(00:29) to your sales team if you are kind of still in the selling mode this will apply to you and if you're an employee and you're looking at making more money and you want to become wealthy this will also apply to you too all right so the employee question came to me you requested like a 15 minute time which i knew something important because it doesn't happen very often and so i was i was kind of looking forward i was like hey what's up man and what was interesting in the first you know four to five minutes of the call you know the
(00:52) person was just like i just really want to pick your brain on like the direction of my life and i was like well that's a really big amorphous topic like what problem are we solving right which is always if you ever talk to me it's usually like what problem are we solving right because then we can start tackling it and i don't think they knew what the problem that they were solving was because what it was is in reality they had family members who were saying hey you you shouldn't you shouldn't be in this job you need something that's more
(01:14) secure all right and so as i dug deeper into this conversation there were so many nuggets that came out of it that i think i've wrote them all down on a list and i'm going to try and hit as many as i can all right and so the first thing was this person in particular is on our sales team we have a lot of you know 20 plus sales people and they they uh their family said you should get out of sales you need something that is less risky all right and so the first thing i asked was do these people who are giving you this
(01:44) advice make more money than you and he said no and i was like rule number one do not listen to people poorer than you about advice on money so for everyone who has family or friends or parents who make less money than you or make the same amount of money than you at a at an older age uh don't listen to them all right listen to people who make far far far more money i don't even think you should listen to millionaires listen to billionaires i think that's great advice from grant cardone listen to billionaires so number one number two
(02:12) they had a misunderstanding of volatility and risk all right this is a classic poor person thing all right so i'm gonna break this down for you with an example let's say i own an insurance company okay and i know statistically that every nine years there's going to be a super catastrophe there's gonna be a hurricane katrina hurricane maria something that's gonna destroy everything and i'm going to lose a butt load okay now that means that one out of nine years i'm going to get destroyed but the other eight years i'm probably going to make a
(02:45) lot of money right right so the question is is my insurance business risky the answer is no i'm going to make the assumptions that i have a sound business model and margins and all that stuff but the reality is that my insurance business is not risky it is volatile those are not the same things all right and so if you if you flatten out the curve over the nine years and look at the growth that's going to occur in my business based on those metrics i will be far better off than something that might be less volatile less up and down
(03:17) but not grow as quickly alright sales is an example of a highly volatile profession that still is low risk and let me explain why who do you think is the most secure in the company somebody who generates revenue or someone who costs overhead someone who generates revenue so sales people are by definition people who generate revenue which means they are the lowest risk in a company now for them they may have more volatility from paycheck to paycheck but in general people in sales generate make more money than people who are not in sales right
(03:53) and if you're good at sales even more so which this individual is right and so with the concept of volatility versus risk i said what you should do if you want to decrease the volatility in your life and get the upside benefit of your position is you need to decrease your expenses to your salary all right so his salary and i said now your salary is what you need to assume your is all you're going to make now i'm not saying live on your salary i'm saying you should be saving off of your salary now think about this let's say this
(04:23) individual is living as it has a salary of let's say 40 000 a year all right now if i can get them to live on 25k right a year then that delta can be invested in the s p 500 and within 20 years they're top 1 percent crazy i know and if you split where you live with other people and you really try and live down you can do that faster right but the reality is that this isn't all the person's going to make but you should plan like it is because then what happens is all of this becomes gravy and even if you have a bad
(04:57) month which there's no sales person in our company that would not that would not make any sales it does it doesn't even make sense right but even if you had a bad month they still this person would still feel like they're making progress towards their wealth freedom and independence goals all right but the reality is that they would probably make you know another 100k per year on top of that but now they've set up their lifestyle such that their expense income ratio is so favorable that that they can save so much of their
(05:24) money they get to their goal faster which is the next point which is wealth and i've said this before and i will say it again is not a number and this is one of the things that i had to tease out in this conversation wealth is a ratio it's a ratio between how much you spend versus how much you make it's inflow versus outflow not i need to make x to be free now if you want to have a crazy lifestyle i have another video about about what living like the ultra wealthy is but the reality is it's a not that fun not definitely not fulfilling and
(05:57) i'll tell you what is way more fulfilling having the freedom and the peace of mind which is actually what people want knowing that you're going to be set up for life and the way to do that is to have a strong income to expense ratio and so this individual if he's making 140 000 and he lives on 25 he's making nine times more or whatever the math is there whatever six times six times more he's making six times more than he's spending that's a great income to expense ratio his wealth is going to build very very quickly right and with
(06:24) that that extra money will more than cover his 25 000 a year right like the 140 that or sorry the one 115 that he's saving in this example right every year in pure cash he's already saving four and a half years of income every year now let alone the fact that if he's just gaining at 10 right s p is nine but like just for math sake let's just say 10 that he's he's going to be generating himself compounding growth with which means that in two years two years he'll be at 230 right he would technically be able to retire on his current income
(07:00) think about that right now if you want to if you want to spend more then fine but literally there's a 24-month way of of saving your way to wealth right now would i want to retire in 230 000 no but if you worked for a decade by the end of that period of time you'd have two you know two point something right and at that point then he could he could he can totally just retire and not only that if he keeps his expense ratio at 25 000 maybe even bumps himself to 40 or 50 000 which for most people is is a really comfortable living you know it's like
(07:29) you're not doing anything crazy right and if you do it that way life will be better now the next point that uh that that came up was he was like okay well i've got i've got some debt um so what should i do he's like so i've got student loan debt i've got credit card debt that's that's about i can't remember i think it was 20 grand right between both of those and i was like okay your student loans have super super super low interest so let's not worry about those let's worry about your credit card because the credit card has
(07:56) 16 compounding and so if you think about that it's like a negative investment right you've got something that's compounding against you versus something that's compounding for you so the way to guarantee a 16 compounding rate of return is to d is to take away the drags that are at negative 16 right so if you're in this situation the first thing you do is you pay off your credit card debt all right number one after that you're gonna have your your student loans and then your investments the reality is the student loans the interest because
(08:24) with the government's setting them you know have set them up it's it's basically just it's the cost of you learning this however long ago i think it's horribly uh unethical that they they do student loans i think i'm so wildly against student loans in general in what world would someone ever give an 18 year old access to 200 000 who has no skills whatsoever to then get something that has no return more than what their current earning potential is it makes no sense and if you if you if you can't even bankrupt your way out of
(08:52) it it is purely a scheme by banks to make more money purely it makes you a slave to the bank for the rest of your life but there's no interest on it and so i'm not going to think about that for right now all right so credit card loans first and then you stack into investments now me personally i just don't like having any debt and so if you want to it's a personal choice it doesn't even make mathematical sense it makes emotional sense you can pay off the student loans and then everything else gets plowed into
(09:15) the s p 500. the reason i say that is because warren buffett the own the advice that he's given the people who are managing his will is that he just wants everything put in the s p 500 smartest investor of of all time that's what he's doing so i think it is worthwhile advice and very easy to follow all right next one and you do this every month it's called dollar cost averaging so that even when it goes down and goes up you're gonna participate at all times so when it's overpriced you're still buying and when it's underpriced
(09:40) you're still buying don't try and time it i have another video about trying to time the market you're gonna lose so just dollar cost average in and then get rid of any of the anxiety around getting a good deal all right next one so he's like okay i want to make uh you know i want to know how i can grow all right so this is for anyone who's in any company the closer you can tie yourself to an acquisition channel the more valuable are the company because you're you're driving revenue right and so what i what i explained to him was i said listen
(10:11) you've gone through all my trainings you know you know you know the different ways of getting clients pick a channel that we're not currently using and in your in your off time try and figure that channel out and we pay more for for leads or for sales that come that don't that that someone goes and brings out brings in on their own compared to stuff that comes in from our marketing right i was like so you're gonna get disproportionately paid for those off the bat and then as soon as you figure out that system i said come to me
(10:36) and say hey alex i figured out the system i figured this process is getting us more clients i want to build a team and i think that i can show five other guys how to do this and generate revenue and i just would like a piece of all of their of their um of their sales and i would say absolutely and so if he does this he would be able to two or three x's income as a result of that right and so that is a way of figuring out how to provide more value now the next thing was a debate i think this came up from the family too was going off on your own
(11:07) right now obviously as the owner of the business you would think that my incentive is to keep it keep everyone and over time my my incentive has shifted my incentive is i want to to be the best human i possibly can be and if that means that that this it's time for that person to go and spread their wings then that's fine and i encourage them and i and i wish them the absolute best and i mean that genuinely because i never want to be the person who holds someone back from accomplishing their dreams that being
(11:33) said understanding risk is important so many many many many many people many many many of my sales people make more than many entrepreneurs do in fact it probably got the stats i think the average small business owner makes like 78 000 a year all right so if my sales people make 150 or 200 000 a year and if he does all this thing he could make five times with the average small business owner makes five times five times and that's income right that's what's important and so sometimes you can see the alert and this is a
(12:05) classic employee mistake is you look at all the revenue and you say oh that must be the owners that must be alex's and every business owner who's watching this is laughing to themselves because they know that is so far from the truth that is is hilarious um but but people still make that logical fallacy and so for perspective if you if you are a 200 000 a year sales person you own in my mind a million dollar business because if you're running a 20 net margin after everything that and the thing is is it's not just profit in the
(12:34) business but it's net free cash flows the amount of money that you as an owner can take out after reinvesting in the business right and so if you have a if you're a salesperson and you're making 2000 a year it's the same as you owning a million dollar business and so many times and in this instance depending on your skill set you may not want to deal with hr and finance and and figuring out fulfillment and generating leads on your own all the other aspects that come with owning a business legal and all the other crap right
(12:58) and so i'm not saying don't be an entrepreneur obviously i'm an entrepreneur but i'm saying understand adequately understand the risk and i think that if i adequately understand the risk i'm being very very honest with everyone here i don't know if i would have become an entrepreneur i really don't know because i'm pretty risk-averse believe it or not and i think i've told you i had a really good paying job before i uh before i quit and it was because i was so miserable that i decided to do something else but i did not have the typical
(13:24) entrepreneur story of like i was always bad at school and i knew i had to do my like i didn't have that at all i was good at school i got a good job and i i just i was miserable so i did something else anyways next point oh last one okay so i'll give you another saying to work off of track don't slack all right easy to remember and so one of the easiest things that you can do to increase your net worth is start by tracking it all right this is one of the easiest things so right now every week i get a i get an email that has every
(13:58) single one of my assets every single one of my bank accounts all of my portfolio and it has one number at the bottom and so i know every week how i'm doing and whether i'm going up and up now you might be like well man isn't the market volatile sure but i also have other investments too etc but the point is especially the earlier on you are you can you can decrease that cycle now you could do that every quarter i'm just i tend to be obsessive about it i like looking at it because i like making progress if right now you are the sole provider
(14:28) in your household or you're a solo business owner or an entrepreneur or even you know you have a seven or eight figure business right but you haven't like your your actual net worth hasn't surpassed you know a million five million tracking every day the cumulative amount of your bank accounts is one of the single greatest things that i ever did ever like ever ever ever and so it became this habit that first thing in the morning i would open up my my my chase app i would and the nice thing is if you have one of the big commercial
(14:58) banks you can you can they give you dashboards you can you can pull all your accounts in together so if you have you know two business accounts and then you have a savings and checking personal and then you maybe have like a portfolio all of that stuff you can have in one place so it's actually pretty cool but anyways i had an excel sheet that had all my assets on them all my bank accounts all my investments and everything and i would take five minutes in the morning and i would update it and every single and i did it daily so i saw
(15:21) every single day and i could just scroll over time and watch my bottom number continue to go up and here's what's magical about this is that when you look at your bank accounts every day you start to get a pulse on the flow of money you start to get a feeling for oh yeah tuesdays is when this goes out oh yeah on the first week of the month this is when this goes out but then what happens is all of a sudden you're like hey i went down by 200 bucks let me examine let me investigate and you look in there and you're like holy
(15:47) crap i've been using the software for however long cancel right and so as soon as you start doing this you'll start decreasing you'll plug the holes you'll decrease the uh the outflows of money in your life because you're tracking and not slacking so as long as you're not a slacker become a tracker track your net worth all right and so for this individual the the action plan that i made for him so that he could create the wealth that he wanted was this kind of recap for you all right number one track don't slack you have to
(16:17) track your net worth if you wanted to improve so how can you even track like how can you prove something you don't even know what it is track track don't slack now your debt should also be on there so if he's paying down debt his net worth will go up because right now he's got 20 000 net so his net worth is negative 20 000 compared to his cash right so boom track don't slack next pay off high interest credit cards or high interest loan debt first next dollar cost average all of the money that you that you make in excess of your
(16:44) expenses into the s p mind you this is not investment advice i'll probably post a legal disclaimer under the video do whatever the hell you want investment has risks there's no guaranteed returns life is risky you know no one comes out alive okay back to the main point so dollar cost averages to the s p and actively decrease your expenses as much as humanly possible if you have a salary with variable compensation on top of it try and save off of living off your salary and if that sounds crazy cool don't be ordinary be extraordinary do
(17:15) things different because the average person literally retires with nothing don't be like that you can be different and the thing is is all of these things that we aspire for which i made this other video about right all these things we aspire for private jets exotic cars penthouses uh expensive clothing fancy restaurants i can tell you firsthand they're not what they're cracked up to be i like i like bj's and chili's more than i like ruth chris i really like the cheap my cheap jorts more than any of the fancy pants
(17:43) that are out of fancy pants i can tell you that when i lived in a 1200 a month apartment um in in in albuquerque new mexico which is a really nice place um i was happy as could be it my happiness is in no way changed having the place that i have now i regret the exotic car that i have and private jets are wildly expensive and you can you can get anywhere you want on spirit for way less all right so decrease your expenses all right and um in terms of increasing the income tie yourself to an acquisition channel try
(18:13) and find a new way of acquiring customers that the business that you're currently in is not doing do that and then build a team underneath of you that can do the thing that you just learned how to do all right because then you will be closer to what i call a rainmaker and rainmakers are always paid the most in every business and understand that when you do that if you even getting to 200 000 a year you own a million dollar business it's the same thing right except you have way less risk because if you want a million dollar
(18:42) business you can work your ass off two months in a row and become poorer whereas if you work your ass off for two months in a row in a business you're gonna get richer all right and that's the difference between being an entrepreneur and employees that a lot of people don't adequately um monitor the risk all right and finally understand the difference in volatility and risk overall something that goes up and down a lot is not necessarily risky it's just volatile and if you can understand that words matter and how you
(19:09) describe things matter and understanding the definition of words you can put better concepts and frameworks around your thought process and make better quality decisions so anyways i hope you found this valuable um this was a great conversation i wish i had recorded it but hopefully you got the the nuggets uh from that you can apply to your own life and business keeping awesome leave a comment and i'll catch you guys next vid bye

Transcript:
(00:00) you know a lot of [ __ ] and like you've clearly packaged this in really easy to understand ways it's almost exhausting listening because it's like every it's like when you read a really good historical book or something it's like every sentence is packed with a fact you seem like a grinder when you were building these businesses were you just like doing 80 hour 100 work weeks and what about now because you're like yolked you're huge you're like a bodybuilder so so like how did you balance like being fit and getting
(00:27) married and you but i don't know you well but you seem like you'd be grinding hard so my wife works in the business with me so we are true 50 50 partners like it's very rare i like i recognize how rare it is she actually is 100 matched with me and like should just as much be on this call because she runs the other half like she from a work standpoint she has more output than i did she is the operator so she builds the infrastructure she does the recruiting she sets the they are the hr stuff she does the culture she like she
(00:52) does i mean she runs everything um i just you know occasionally come up with a good idea and try and stick with it long enough um to see it come true but in terms of grinding like i love business like i love this and there's nothing that really stimulates me like this and so i do as much of it as i can and if we want to go out to dinner we'll go out to dinner you know but like worst i was just saying we're single so we don't have kids and so we work from like five-ish to four and then you know usually in the middle of the day we'll
(01:19) probably go to the gym for an hour or two and then come back and keep working and go out to dinner at night and that's that's kind of our lives you seem pretty um this isn't i would say i'm a little bit i'm i'm definitely this sean has a little bit of it too like manic's not the right word but like neurotic maybe is a better word um where it's like uh there's something that's deep rooted inside of you it's not like you want to do something necessarily it feels like you're it's more compulsive or obsessed you're obsessed about stuff which i am
(01:46) as well if that's true what's that rooted in what are you trying to get done so i think originally the drive was from just crippling insecurity and needing approval right and then i think from like a behavioral conditioning standpoint i got immediate feedback that was positive and then i was conditioned to continue those actions now i continue to do them without the original catalyst that got them going to begin with i don't think i suffer you know from the insecurities as much as i used to i'd say i'm probably 30 better than i was at
(02:15) the beginning and it might just be because i have this massive big pile of money that i can use as an emotional crutch to why i'm not a piece of [ __ ] that would help i'm just being like i mean and if it were all disappeared i'd find out how much actual growth i had or if i just compensated by circumstance and you know compensate for the division yeah i don't know you can send it to me and we'll we'll find out we'll see let's run the experiment i like so there's the compulsion and like this last year i pretty much took
(02:38) off like i did not work that much and so i saw the difference and i have come to accept that i love working and i don't need to judge myself for that or or take in other people's judgment on how much i should quote do like this is my life and this is what i like doing and their ideals that they've arbitrarily made up as what they define as balance are irrelevant to me you said you took last year off what'd you do what'd you get up to um we traveled a lot uh went to cabo went to scottsdale went to sedona went
(03:09) to flagstaff traveled all over one out felt felt honestly pretty empty like you can only eat so many times like there's just not a lot to do it feels good having that rest though like you can't be in the trenches i think like or rather you need breaks from being at war i think and maybe even phrasing it i'm just throwing this out there like phrasing it is instead of a like a break is a shift in how you're thinking because like it's going from dirt to clouds but i still think it's high leverage activity you know i mean or
(03:33) like output it's just a different type of output you said something on one of your videos that uh you're one of the only other people that i have heard say this phrase i use it a lot which is yeah i had a season like or this season i'm doing this or i had a season where i was really just focusing on x and that's been like a game changer for me my personal trainer and kind of coach she's like my mindset coach plus trainer he does this all the time but he's like he's like i'm in a season right now where i'm i'm just uh he'll be like you
(03:58) know i'm practicing not waiting and he's like he comes up with these little themes or he'll be like right now i'm in a season where i'm going to eat whatever i want and it's kind of like in the entrepreneurial world it's like time boxing's like all right i'm going to give myself two hours to get this [ __ ] [ __ ] done or i'm going to launch in the next two weeks no matter what right like we i've used time boxing for productivity and now this season's thing it makes every like decision you're making less heavy of a commit because
(04:20) you're like it's okay yeah because there's yeah there's beginnings and ends and this season is gonna feel a little different just like winter feels different than summer that's how i use it do you do you use it like that i just noticed you said that phrase 100 yeah i mean i i think about it in terms of entrepreneurial seasons and i at least for me might have been like five-year chunks and so this is gonna be my fourth season and they've roughly been about the same length so i think that it probably takes me like three ish years
(04:44) to like really see something through and then two years to figure out how i'm going to transition from that thing or realize or mod you know whatever that's right it's kind of like a pe cycle almost give us kind of like um give us an example of normal like here's the default way people are doing something and then here's the rephrase of the reframe that has better results um i would love to get two minutes of learning sales from alex sure so it's my belief if you look at belford you look at bradley you look at grant cardone
(05:12) some of the big sales trainers that are out there almost all of them invariably have the same story which was i started selling and was the best guy on the team by a [ __ ] mile and then i tried to figure out what i was doing and so i do think that some people naturally based on their childhood their upbringings their whatever or just have a higher proclivity for selling which yeah just a gift of gab and and empathy yeah and i think it carries over into how you recruit for selling too because we built a lot of sales teams and i actually have
(05:38) a very short allowing for people to fail at sales cycle probably much shorter than most people and it's just because i've never had a killer salesperson who didn't do pretty well the first week and so for me we you know we turn through this quickly but as a result of that the team is just killers and they know that in terms of uh sales stuff i think people don't know how people are really freaked out about the idea of selling and the front part of that is that i do think that the number one predictor of good sales is conviction fundamentally
(06:04) you have one person who should believe in something another person who does not believe it yet and trust is the thing that transfers that conviction so if fundamentally there's the two things you need you need trust and need conviction most times sales people don't have 100 trust sorry 100 conviction and so the also the idea of conviction as a binary is false so it's not like i believe it or i don't believe it is to what extent do i believe right and so that's why like in terms of if i want to improve a sales team i can do the drills which we
(06:29) do and that's like blocking tackling but the thing that really juices the sales team is hearing the testimonials of the people that they sold last week and what they're doing today and how their lives have changed and so i noticed this because on my sales teams when we were in person whenever i did weigh out day which is when everyone finished their challenges and everybody was crying and so excited i tried to stack as many sales appointments as i could while people were weighing out and during those days we closed like 100 because
(06:51) people were like dude how can you not think this works it's right there and so the thing is is like you can either trick yourself into having the right tone or you can train yourself and i think that it's much easier to trick yourself into it by just simply believing because if you talk if you truly believe in the product you will talk about it differently and so in terms of an understanding of selling if you need to have conviction you need to have trust trust is going to come from expertise and some level of rapport
(07:16) right i think that overarchingly to help someone sell we just have to ask the right questions to get someone to come to the conclusion on their own and so most sales conversations follow more or less the same framework if you know what you're doing otherwise people are just chasing their tail and trying to chase a prospect to an outcome that the prospect doesn't know how like we've had this conversation a hundred times they have only had it once we should be the one knowing how this conversation's supposed to go right we should also come in with
(07:39) a massive advantage to how to have this conversation go the way we wanted to because we do it on [ __ ] day right and so big front end pieces is like why are they there what's the problem what have they done so far understanding where they failed seeing why our product is different from the things that they failed asking for permission to explain about the product explaining the product not in any way based on features but only based on the experiences that they will have as a result of it and using analogies to explain those experiences
(08:06) and then having a close at the end which the the tick tock i think that you he references like a no base close and i think a lot of natural sales people do this anyways like if i want something i might be like hey can you do this for me i'm like hey would you mind and they say no they don't i don't mind right like it's natural communication dynamics that most people who naturally know how to persuade people or at least influence do that on their own this is just retroactively looking at it and saying what did i do different like why is this
(08:29) different in terms of like overcoming because people are afraid of confrontation right that's what they're afraid of and so i believe that you can sell without ever having confrontation and you can do that with what i like to call childlike curiosity and so if someone says well my husband's not going to approve that i'm like why wouldn't he like huh that's so interesting tell me more about that rather than like all right let's like your husband's an [ __ ] like that's not going to work because in arguments no one wins right
(08:54) and so you're like why why would he think that because because i would think that he wants what's best for you right yeah he wants what's best does he know you're struggling with this right now well i mean yeah he knows i'm struggling with it okay so he wants a specialty he knows you're struggling with it so why do you think he would be opposed of solving something that you're currently struggling with just so i understand would he be happier if you continue to struggle well no it's like well great then would you be opposed to moving
(09:16) forward today and that way and hey if you go home to your husband and you make a joke in the lightning scenario then you close it right and so it's i think child like curiosity is the immediate that you have to train because people get defensive so that is one thing that like fighters talk about when they're in the ring like in the beginning you breathe in too much right i don't know if like if you've been like sparring and stuff like you breathe in you breathe too much you hyperventilate and so the guys who've done it enough they slow
(09:39) down their breathing because when they get things get intense they can slow it down and so i think sales is a lot the same way where you're like your adrenaline kicks in start breathing faster as fight or flight so you gotta be able to slow down and be like huh that's crazy i wouldn't have thought that okay tell me more about that and like now you're interested and then they don't feel like you're combating them they feel like you genuinely are interested and want to help them which is what you should be doing because you
(10:01) should be only if it makes sense you are full of like interesting insights and like you know a lot of [ __ ] and like you've clearly packaged this in really easy to understand ways it's almost exhausting listening because it's like every it's like when you read a really good historical book or something it's like every sentence is packed with a fact yeah and it's like oh my gosh like i cuz i got it i want to pay attention i was like exhausting this is awesome nation if you enjoyed that video smash the subscribe button and hit the little

How to Get SO Rich You Realize Money Has No Meaning - YouTube

Transcript:
(00:00) when I was 27 I had just over a million dollar in my bank account in cash by the time I was 29 I had over 20 by the time I was 31 it was more than that here's how to get so rich you realize money was never the point But first you have to get rich there's three strategies and the first one is building a brand so the first time I saw the power of brand was when he released a new product to my existing distribution base of gyms which was a software called aln which then later became Allen there was a certain percentage of gyms in my distribution base who weren't able to attend the launch or see the webinar live and what
(00:30) ended up happening was crazy all of a sudden we started getting hours later calls and texts saying hey I heard that Alex offered something here's my credit card just sign me up for whatever it is and I was like wait they haven't seen the actual pitch the realization was they just had a history of positive experiences when giving me money that they got more back that they were like oh here's another time where I can give money and get more value back great I'll utilize the opportunity and so I was like whoa this is something different I've never had this before and so I was like I need to protect this as much as
(01:01) hum possible and is there ways that I can do even more of it and so let me give you four visual examples of how branding even came to be and so back in the day you'd have bulls look at my beautiful Bulls those Bulls would originally be unmarked and so people had no way of differentiating between their bulls and other people's Bulls they started branding literally searing their own logo or whatever into the bull and so let's say we've got our our Nike bull here great now we recognize that as a logo and we like that person if we have that experience then we're going to
(01:37) treat the cow differently than if it were unbranded now let's say that there's a brand that we don't recognize we would then treat this bull like all other branded Bulls in that it's a category that we just know that it belongs to someone else the third scenario might be let's say that it belongs to somebody that you hate and so we have branding that you recognize and like well then you'd be nice to the cow and take it home branding that you recognize and hate you might capture the cow kill the cow and eat it for yourself or steal it branding of somebody you
(02:09) don't recognize but know that in general it belongs to someone which would then change your behavior and then finally a cow that was unbranded in general and you would treat it like you treat all cows that have no owner and so the reason this is important is that fundamentally the point of branding is to change behavior of the person who sees it all of this is an indication of past experience it's saying hey treat me like you would treat me like you'd want to be treated treat that cow like you would want to be treated uh which is exactly the point no but the owner is is is communicating something to anybody
(02:40) else who sees the cow that's the point we want to Brand our product so that they treat it ideally like something that people like and love which might mean that they buy it quickly at higher prices and over and over again and tell their friends versus not buy it tell people Terrible Things dissuade their friends from buying it versus I don't know maybe I'll take a risk on this thing and then it's going to be the the quality of the creative that's going to have to communicate and this is again why if you had a really fancy brand and
(03:09) it looks high-end then they're just going to extrapolate what they know about high-end brands in general to the purchase okay this looks like a premium brand I understand why they're doing these things but I don't have history now if you make the purchase and they have history then it would shift into one of these two categories in a word Steve Jobs describes brand as trust I Define trust as predictive power based on past experiences just as much as you can trust someone to do a bad job you can trust someone to do a good job and
(03:38) so the idea here is obviously to build trust that we will deliver on our promises and so fundamentally you build that by making promises and keeping or overd delivering on the Promises you have but brand is a big Amorphis topic and so how do you measure this in dollars and cents and so there's basically three things that brand translates to in terms of economics for a business and so the first is conversion rate now what does that mean so conversion rate is the percentage of people who when presented with your offer choose to buy it and so let's say
(04:10) that you have a bad brand or no brand at all a bad brand would be that you have a past history people trust you to do bad stuff you have lower than neutral if you have no brand it would be based on their experience with other businesses that look like yours and so this is also why quote good branding even if you don't have a history of reinforcement can still be important because if you walk talk and Quack Like Somebody who is a scam artist you will have people treat you like one it's not just your experience but their experience with people like you fundamentally like this is what racism is about but people
(04:47) prejudge people because that's how we go through life if we had to start at zero for every single person we met we would use up all of the cognitive load that we have and consumers like all humans try to use shorthand we want to learn based on the things put a label on it put in a bucket and not think about it as fast as possible and so from a conversion rate perspective a good brand means that let's say neutral would be let's say you close 20% of people who you get on the phone with at a specific price point at negative uh which actually get that I'll just put I'll put the zero here negative
(05:15) one and then positive maybe and this the thing here is that this could go as high as you want like if you have an unbelievable reputation like plus plus plus maybe you close 80% and what's interesting about this is if you look and maybe here it's 0% because KN one everyone hates you uh and you basically have to rely on people who don't know who you are advertise wider and wider to find people who have yet to meet you which is a terrible way to live so brand gives you an increased percentage of people who will buy when presented with your offer just like the guy who didn't even need to get presented with the
(05:45) offer just knowing that I had an offer he was willing to buy it and the reason I use apple as a great litmus test for this is that I think Steve Jobs was one of the best brand builders of all time I mean people lining up to buy whatever his next product was because of his past history of keeping his promises and overd delivering on it and so number one is conversion rate this is like if you had nothing else this would be worth it if you could forx the amount of people that bought your stuff at a specific price that would give you a material advantage over everyone else but branding doesn't stop there in terms of
(06:16) its B business benefits the second is CTR now it's like okay what does that really mean so it's actually conversion rate again but just earlier on in the funnel and so let's say again you have eyeballs you've got people who see your promotions in whatever way you advertise so that could be making content that could be Outreach attempts responding to emails basically the number of engaged leads having a higher click the rate means people take the first action they then convert on a landing page or a you know a Shopify page or whatever they're either buying a product or they're
(06:44) scheduling a call and then on the call they have a higher conversion rate as well and so basically you can think about this is conversion rate throughout the entire process from the beginning to the money and then obviously if you continue to do a good job on resales repurchases Etc so let's say that generically at1 one and then zero and then plus here you might have a 5% click theough rate and then here maybe you have a 1% click through rate and then maybe here you have something like a 3% click through rate and this is super standard like this happens all the time especially if you're going after markets that already know who you are when I
(07:17) launched my leads book we had never run ads before and so this was all novel and there was a past history of the first book so the first book has I think like 26,000 five stars at the point of making this video there was a lot of anticipation for the second book and so the ctrs were like 6% for our ads and so people were signing up for the book launch for something like a dollar which is crazy and I'd never had anything like that before especially at scale and so I was like man these are some of the benefits of building trust with an audience and so from the conversionary
(07:47) perspective if you think about those guys who bought at the aln launch who weren't even presented the offer they just found out that I had something to sell those are people who otherwise in a neutral or negative business certainly wouldn't have purchased they would have either needed to be convinced if they were neutral or or they just would have not wanted to buy to begin with if they were at the negative side of the spectrum that's how you can just demonstrate visually what the experience of having a higher conversion rate looks like more people buy when they're
(08:10) presented with the offer and I'll give you another really tactical example my offer is book on Amazon the actual page itself converts at 30% so basically a little bit less than one out of three people who visits the page buys the book now I think there's a variety of reasons for that one of them is that many people who go there got referred via Word of Mouth which will get to one of the big compounding things from that later but the second thing is that even if you don't have word of mouth when you have you know a 4.9 rating and you've got
(08:37) 26,000 people who rated at that then you have high confidence that it's going to deliver at least a decent product now the third Big Brand benefit is price point and so this is one that I think is probably more commonly touted and Warren Buffett describes it like this he says if you have to say a prayer before you raise your prices by 10% you have a bad business and so the idea is that if customers love your product they will be more will willing to pay a premium to get it rather they are paying down the risk of buying somebody else's product and so they buy your product with the
(09:08) existing promise and then the extra is basically their insurance that they pay you knowing that they're going to get exactly what they expect I can't overemphasize how important it is to pay down people's risk like Risk is one of the the three primary levers in terms of value creation and so this is why McDonald's for example even another product in it of itself is not that good it is consistent and consistency in it of itself reduces risk and people just like to have their expectations met now what's interesting about this is that to meet everyone's expectations it means
(09:44) that you'll have to go really high because some people have high expectations some people have medium some people have low expectations and so if you want to meet the expectations of a large percentage of the audience you will have to try to overd deliver when the people who are the most amending you will simply have delivered now other people you will have overd delivered for but I think this idea of like you're always going to overd deliver I don't think is true I think you just have to try as hard as you can and a larger
(10:06) percentage of people will be satisfied now with this price in any competitive market if you can raise price by let's say this is your revenue and this is your profit before so this is our neutral brand versus our plus plus brand okay so let's say that they have the same base economics so the cost of doing business is the same between these two businesses but this business can simply charge 10% more by doing that they basically double the amount of profit that they're able to make as a result of their brand there's one more point that makes brand
(10:42) make you even more money and it just took me way too long to realize this because I got really good at marketing and sales early and I came at it from the perspective of like I just need to go find more people when it's so much more profitable to find the existing people that you have that you already have done business with and they want to continue doing business with with you and so I solve now for how do I get people to always want to do business with me again rather than how do I find more people and so the fourth piece is
(11:11) repurchases and so just like apple like I was mentioning earlier they have such an amazing system of getting people into their ecosystem and then buying again and again and again and it would take a tremendous amount of effort to get someone to deconned of digital hardware and so the fourth benefit is that not only do you get more people to respond more people to convert at higher prices so you can make more profit that profit then gets multiplied so if we have our our neutral example let's put I'm going to have to put the other one over here now we
(11:45) already have a higher price point so we're already making more money than this guy but not only that the next year some of these people might buy again what do you know now our cost basis is going to go up because obviously they're buying something else right but so is our absolute profit Uncle Warren for example every single year for Seas candies has raised the prices and that's typically in accordance with costs of cocoa and butter and and you know the Commodities that actually create the product but he has I think on average
(12:15) and I'll have to look this up again but I'm pretty sure on average like some of the highest years were 177% increases and that's like year-over-year but his average was much higher than the price index increases and so basically he was able to continue to see that once someone bought their chocolates they would continue to buy them over and over again even with a higher price which then leads to okay from a repurchases perspective he said this he said if you buy your darling C candies for Valentine's Day or her birthday or whatever and you guys enjoy them together he said we've got you for life
(12:50) and the point there is that they now cost they spent the money to acquire you one time but then after that you keep buying again and again and again and again and that extends the LTV of the person so you're getting more people interested who are then going to buy at higher prices so there's even more gross profit per unit and they're going to buy again and again and again I can hardly imagine something that would be more powerful for a business there's a concept of the give to ask ratio and I talk about it here in my leads book in the content chapter and the reason that
(13:20) this is such an important metric is basically this is a history of reinforcement how many times have you reinforced positively before you ask for something but this is the part that people miss and it's because most people's productss aren't that good their ask in their mind is perceived as a negative and the give is obviously perceived as a positive and so you make this media you give out this free stuff that gives you more and more pluses some people like to think about it like a bank account you add more deposits and then you can withdraw but when listening to jobs talk about this he actually
(13:49) purely talks about it from an asks perspective he says if people buy our product and they absolutely love it then we have provided more value we put a deposit into our relationship he said if people buy our product and they hate it or they was just mediocre then we've withdrawn from that relationship this whole idea of give ask many people talk about this in terms of like content and then monetization but it actually extends all the way through the business and in the perfect world you give in the content and when you ask for money it becomes a give because as soon as they
(14:19) buy the product they're like oh my God this is amazing which is why for example I think that like I try to get people to start with the books because it's the thing that I've spent the most time on and cost relative devalue is pretty insane that allows me to give yet again and create a positive history of reinforcement with an audience Brands compound over time not because necessarily media compounds but media is just a measurement tool for word of mouth because like your audience will grow because people will share your
(14:48) stuff like try and get it down to the people when analyzing these kind of like amorphous ideas like what happens when a brand grows it means you did a good thing and then that person tells another person and then that person experiences the benefit themselves and then that person tells another person and so the output of the brand is the trust with an audience that grows rather than logos and color schemes and fonts like it's none of that it's just how many people trust me but the reality of building a
(15:14) brand is that it's kind of like a friendship like imagine meeting somebody and being like we're best friends if they said that the first time you met you'd be like that's a bit weird right and so building a brand is a lot the same thing it takes time to build trust and trust is predictive power based on a past history of experience and so you you have to develop that past history of experience if if somebody did something nice one time for you you're not immediately going to be like oh I trust this guy with my life it's like well he did one thing but if he does thing after thing after thing after thing after
(15:39) thing for an extended period and then makes an ass you're like well I kind of owe him one he's done a bunch of stuff for me right and so that's the ideas that it just takes a long time now here's where it gets where there is high Arbitrage with brand with media and Technology one person can give to a million people at once in a very small way and so the idea is okay how can I give to a million people at once over and over again even in a fractionalized manner such that in 10 gives or 20 gives or 50 gives I've now given effectively three full gives or four full gives to somebody so that they might be willing
(16:12) to quote return the favor based on their cultural rules and so in those four ways building the brand makes you so much money that you will have the first step taken towards realizing it wasn't the point to begin with the second way to get so rich that you realize that making money was never the point is to know the inputs and outputs of your money-making system and you want to break those down to the absolute smallest action that way you can scale it while sustaining your margins so whenever LEL and I get overwhelmed right because it happens all the time you basically clear your plate
(16:43) and then you add more stuff to your plate and then you're like oh my God I'm overwhelmed then you clear your plate again and that's I honestly I think a lot of that is just like entrepreneurship when we look at our plate what we do is I look at every single activity that I'm doing on a weekly basis and I say how does that tie to how we make money and it's trying to understand what are the inputs that pushing into our money-making system and are there things on here that are either too indirect or just not actually
(17:06) driving anything at all and so for example I took over uh a department recently and I cancelled all meetings that were recurring where people were just sharing data and the main reason was that that that data was not being used to change behavior and so either the data is not correct or useful or we need to learn how to do something about that data and so if we spend all this time going over data and doing nothing about it then that time is completely wasted both in the collection storing and Analysis of data but then also the reviewing it with a team of people and so unless something changes what we do
(17:46) we don't need to track it and so this gets you much more targeted on the few things that matter so shiron svat he's a he's a public CEO he and I talked about this at length he basically uh posits that for every per every company it's on/ tenth of the employees that are actually creating the majority of the economics in the business like there's a core team that really is the one that moves the whole machine and a lot of the rest of the people are there more or less for the ride and the idea is what is it that those 10 people do what are their inputs that drive this machine and
(18:16) I think that being able to identify what those activities are not the general morphous words but what the actual activities are like is it writing an email is it writing ad copy is it filming content or filing filming ads is it reaching out to a certain amount of people is it reaching out to customers is it hopping on a certain number of calls uh sales calls like all of these are activities that will drive Revenue in the business you basically look at a lot of other stuff that many people will fill their calendars with and the majority of it doesn't make money and if
(18:46) the point of a business is to generate a profit through providing value to a Marketplace outsid of the cost of delivering that value then you want to put as much into the value creation as possible as little into the cost basis as possible and do it as many times as you can and everything that's not those things ultimately detracts from the efficiency of the system and so think about it like this you have a money-making system you have a box now in that box is your general activities of doing business so you sell tables you sell books you provide services whatever
(19:16) your thing is is you have a cost of delivering that thing and you have a price that should be above that cost and then that discrepancy between those two things is how you make money and you spin that wheel as many times as you can where this gets important is you have to understand understand the inputs into this system and you have to break it down to activities like I can't explain to you how incredibly powerful this is to both understand this for yourself and explain it to your team and be able to revisit it on a regular basis because the inputs will change and so for
(19:44) example if I were to say hey Alex what do you do what are the inputs in the acquisition. commonym system there's many things that Ur in acquisition. comom but you as the founder or the entrepreneur you're basically pushing the first Dom over and then there's many subsequent activities that happen after and sometimes there's two or three dominoes that are occurring that you're pushing but what happens is when we describe what we do we use lots of amorphous words that have very little connection to what we actually do for me for example like what are the things that I actually do my inputs for
(20:14) acquisition. comom right so let's say the acquis geez let's see if I can spell my own company there we go acquisition. comom um there you go.com oh God now it's ugly as hold on there we go there we go nice nice clean C there for everybody see all right so I script stuff okay cool I record that's something that I do I check in on status of stuff I review things and give thumbs up or feedback I review deal metrics for deals that we're considering doing in uh acq uh.com or acq Ventures which is our Venture arm we just started I present to the team when we have kind of like New
(20:55) Direction that we're taking I also review portco metrics and decide where the money goes both within acquisition. comom and then within the portfolio companies when I say money I say generically like the resources that we have so we're going to allocate this person here we're going to allocate these resources here and so this is like what it actually is and this is today now these things Shuffle over time but you can notice here that these are me describing actual activities right so what you need to do is now if I'm going to look at this there's going to be some things that feed them this machine and then there
(21:27) going to be some things that are me actually doing the stuff in the machine and so this for example these are feeders this stuff feeds in this is you know me providing feedback me driving stuff these are all for feeding this machine is how do we get more attention how do we get more business owners to know about our stuff how do they you know they can buy our books so they can learn to trust us and then eventually you know maybe there's a deal down the line big picture we've got these feeders that feed into this machine and then we kind of have what I would consider these are all the things of delivery right these are how I how the actual machine
(21:58) works and makes money the reason that defining the inputs is so important is that many times when you look at what you actually do you aren't doing things that drive an increase in number of customers or an increase in LTV and so if you think about this like this is the LTV this is the number of customers and you can basically Drive growth in only those two ways and so you have to dial in what is actually the thing that makes money here and whenever you have a deadline for example all of a sudden your ability to to focus gets really clear and I think the reason for that is because you have no time to waste and so most people do like spend like 90% of
(22:35) their time on stuff that doesn't actually drive the needle and then only 10% of the stuff when they actually need to make money that does it but what would happen if you actually spend all of your time on the inputs that mattered most for example I write two emails a week for the mosy minute uh which is what I send to the to the whole list which is kind of like very tactical business Concepts it's very high leverage for me it takes me about an hourish per email that I send and that is something something that drives
(22:59) awareness it drives business it drives value it drives portfolio companies it drives everything right and so that's an input right and so it's betting very clear on most of the things that people do that are just not that and so whenever you scale an input or like the inputs that you have in terms of your money-making system or the inputs of what you do in order to feed that system you essentially have three options for scaling option number one is you can automate so you can get a machine to do it all right now some things are very
(23:26) difficult to automate AI can automate a lot sometimes in the future there will be an AI version of me that can probably make content better than I can and we'll cross that bridge when we get there but that would be something that could happen the second is that you get other people so that means that I'm having somebody else then make this content for me now there's I want to be very clear there's degrees here a lot of people like to think in binaries it's like okay well can I get somebody else to script this stuff can I get someone else to
(23:51) check in can I get someone else to record re review and give feedback so then the only thing that I would have to do is record yes of course I could and so the idea is you don't necessarily need to replace every single part of what you do but you can just basically chunk down the inputs into okay this one someone else can handle this one someone else can handle and then the final uh component of this is that you can do one to many now what does that mean if like this is already a very leveraged acquisition system right because it's me
(24:17) one to many you're watching this it takes me one time to say it but many people can see it but if you had a a one-on-one method of reaching out to people say cold outbound as your way of getting uh people in or maybe you get Affiliates one-onone then you're either going to have to automate that way of getting Affiliates one-onone you're going to have to get a team of people to do it or you're going to have to switch to a mechanism that allows you to continue to do it but do it to many people at once and so I think through
(24:40) this whenever I have to kind of scale any kind of delivery or marketing is is this something that I can get other people to do and this also works on the back end right here so it's like okay can I get other people to review portfolio metrics can I get other people to decide where the allocation is again these things are very high leverage for me meaning I don't have to put a lot to get a lot from it and so it's worth me developing that skill set even deeper rather than potentially delegating it but long term in my opinion every
(25:04) business can be delegated it's just that uh you have to find Stars and you have to find people who are better than you and often times that's tough like could Steve Jobs delegate being Steve Jobs well I don't know I mean they have yet to really make anything as good as what he made you know if Elon died would would all of the companies do as well without him I don't know that's where it's like okay he has to automate or get other people as many people as he can to do all the other stuff and the stuff
(25:27) that matters most to him like for example he says all my companies have zero marketing except for the fact that they have the most popular men like in history being the person who's running them and when I say popular I just mean it from an an absolute perspective people know who he is when he makes a tweet a gazillion people see it and so if we were to we probably could add this up and see what his total impressions are per month both directly on X and then also in terms of shared volume of the amount of pages that share his interviews and the Rogan stuff and
(25:56) YouTube and so like there's no marketing department because they have a oneman marketing department that in of itself is worth I mean billions of dollars and so I see everybody as an individual contributor at the most basic level like everyone does things and they are just either directly tied to some sort of outcome that gets customers or makes them worth more or they are not right and so I would encourage you this is especially for this is me talking specifically to business owners right now so there's three questions that I like to ask an employee
(26:28) number one what do you do and they will use amorphous terms and you're like no no no like not analyze what do you do what does that mean right until they can Define it in a way that like okay you look at numbers on an Excel sheet and you try and then you see if some are above a certain threshold or below it okay got it so that's what you do now do you know what I do or what we do as a business now a lot of times people can't even explain it back to you and they work for you so if they certainly can't explain it to you they're definitely not doing something necessarily that's going to help it all right what do we
(27:03) do and then here's the third question how does what you do help what we do and it ties what they do to the outputs of the business and so fundamentally let's say that someone says I am in finance okay cool what do you do I compile and tabulate our expenses versus what we generate and when something looks above Benchmark above our historic average I flag it to make sure that it is worth spending money on and if we do well in a business line I flag it to see what we did better and if we do poorly I flaged
(27:37) to see why we did worse and so that is what you produce now I would then say how does what that does influence this and this now the intelligent Finance person would then say I influence the decisions about what we spend to get more customers and how we make them worth more through doing more of the things that increase value and taking away things that add to costs and that would be a very real answer as to tying their inputs into the outputs of the system and so you have to be able to dial these things in first to connect
(28:11) your actions to what makes a business money and then scaling those actions through automation other people or gaining leverage on that activity I'll give you three major money sucks that people do that are not this so number one is they will work on projects that are not going to drive the main objectives so it's like they want to reorganize a AA in some way right or whatever your project management thing is okay we have this massive reorganization fine okay great now it's taking up a lot of time or you redo your
(28:36) entire website which takes you a ton of time but is it really the constraint of the business is it the thing that's going to generate money or you should should you just split test your headlines on your landing page right like there are other things that will drive more customers and so basically like I can give you a list of a thousand things that you could do to grow a business the question is which one of them will grow it the most and so most people spend time on activities that they enjoy that drive very little business to the business but they can mentally masturbate to the idea that
(29:04) they're being productive because it's business is it's related to business and so it's like it's almost like they're doing like arts and crafts and hobbies while they're doing business but those aren't the main drivers the second thing is that they spend too much time on meetings and this is a really common one which is that people are social people like to talk to each other and so if they get an excuse to do it they will do it one of the most frightening things in the entire world which I recommend you
(29:27) do is actually look at how much everyone makes per hour so look at their annual pay divided by 2,000 and then look at a meeting when you when you have 10 people on it right and then all of a sudden you're like I paid $500 for this meeting and if you went out to dinner and took everybody to dinner and then you paid $500 for dinner people like oh my God thank you so much it's so generous of you it's like every meeting is that and so unless you can show how this is going to generate US $500 plus now mind you you need to get a
(29:54) return on that so you probably need to get something like four or five times that amount amount of money from that meeting then you probably just shouldn't have it and where this gets really really nasty is once your your business gets big enough employees in general start meeting with each other and so it's like you're not even involved and these these losses are occurring on a regular basis sometimes people call it time theft I don't think the intentions there but I do think that the end result is still the same which is that the
(30:19) business becomes less efficient and bears more cost to deliver the same product the third big kind of like hole that I see a lot of times is people who spend an inordinate amount of time on data that doesn't change what they do so I'll give you an example I could track what the temperature is of every room that I walk into I could track the amount of words that I say on a meeting you could track anything right some people especially small business owners and sometimes even on your team will just love to show you all these Excel sheets of all this this data that they've tracked it takes a huge amount
(30:48) of time and they get all these percentages and all these ratios and then you just have to ask the question why should I care about this how does this change what we do and I ask this question over and over and over again because so many people love to be like oh no we're data driven it's like are you data driven or are you data distracted and this is the limit test this is the very easy limit test if this number goes up does it change what we do if this number goes down does it change what we do if this number changing doesn't change what we do we don't need
(31:17) to track it when you ask that question over and over again because people are like well we want to keep an eye on that I'm like why let's take it to the Natural extreme why the world is increasingly Quantified and being able to with with automation and software and wearables like there's so much technology out there that wants to quantify everything because they know that people have an obsession with data but not all data is useful and so most businesses you can figure out the metrics on the back of a napkin and
(31:42) figure out if you like it or not that back of napkin way of running a business in my opinion is an exercise and thought discipline of the entrepreneur if you know the clear inputs that drive the business which for you might just be I have to script record and edit content it could be I have to script record and edit ads it could be I have to do a certain amount of Outreach attempts or manage a team to hold them accountable to to doing these Outreach attempts like there are certain number of things that
(32:07) actually drive the business if the data that you collect does not change what you do with your inputs then you don't need to track it you can reverse engineer this to figuring out first what are the inputs that actually drive the output and then secondarily what data would change how I do these inputs if you find out that the CTR dropped on your ads then you would probably change your hooks you change you're targeting that would change what you do so it makes sense to track that if like number of tags on a social platform you could
(32:36) track it let's say it goes up in general over a month what are you going to do now you might say well I'll make more of the content I made that month but if you made a variety of different pieces of content would you then have to track it daily and see if there was a spike okay I got more tags in this okay okay wait stay with me how does getting more tags translate into us making more money I can show you a number of people who get lots of tags tags and lots of likes and lots of views that don't make more money and so again it's not only
(33:02) like maybe maybe it tracks to what we would do but does does that track to us making more money if you want to get so rich that you question the meaning of making money then the first thing you can do is make sure that all of the work that you do makes you more money and stop spending time on things that make you nothing although they are fun distractions which leads me to the third way of getting so rich that you realize that making money was never the point which is get other people to advertise for you I remember the first time I ever
(33:36) had someone else sell for me so I had to go home for Christmas this was the first year of owning my gym and had to go home for Christmas I went home for Christmas and uh this is why I was still going home for the holidays while I remember I was driving home and I got a call and I had hired this uh sales gal and I had taught her my script and we were still running ads even though I was the one selling and I had I was the one who had done every single sale since the beginning of the business she sent me a text that was like oh I went two for four and I remember I like
(34:06) I got so emotional in the car while I was driving that I felt like I almost had to like pull over because I like I I got got choked up because I was like oh my God like this could actually work without me and it was like the first time where I realized that like this could actually be a thing like it's not just like Alex working really hard and I have to make the money if no one else makes makes the money then like like it transitioned it was the first like leading indicator of transitioning from a job to an asset once I had that loop I got really addicted to it I was like man
(34:37) I wonder if there are people who could train without me training I wonder if there were people who like and I just looked at all the things that I did and that that that Obsession has not really ended since then you have to get other people to advertise for you in order to have more leverage okay so Leverage is about getting more for what you put in and fundamentally like in my opinion all of Entrepreneurship is mastering leverage it's why it's core to our logo for acquisition. comom this is a full Chrome and because all of us have the
(35:02) same inputs at the base level which is time and so the people who get the most for their time are the ones who get the most money for their time by doing activities that generate most Revenue per minute or second imagine I had to just get customers well at some point I would max out the amount of hours per day that I could spend doing it no matter how efficient I get I'm going to have to trade time to get it if I'm doing it on a inputs outputs that are directly correlated a one to one ratio I can do the the ratio faster but I'm still going to have that that connection I can be more efficient in terms of getting better at that skill but as long
(35:32) as the base metric is still there I will be capped based on hours per day so walk you through four levels of this and I talk about this in in in my leads book which is the second half which is talking about lead Getters all right so I'll draw this out uh in real time for you so you can actually get a voiceover on it so basically at the very at the very beginning imagine that you are getting leads for your business okay so this is just you all right and so let's say you get 100 leads a day that you're calling or you're reaching ing out to or whatever now you can do this now your
(36:01) work's going to be high and your throughput is going to be fixed there's nothing more you can do to it right now the next level here is that you do this thing but then instead of getting leads you get a lead getter meaning you get other people to advertise on your behalf and so functionally instead of getting like you reach out to 100 people you then get someone else here's someone who's not you Tada let's make him Smiley there we go he's smiling he's very happy to make you money okay so this person
(36:29) now spends their time getting you leads okay so we we just had to do this once and then this created this node how I like to think about it of lead generation right and so boom this this one day created this node ongoing so who's more efficient the guy who just continues to work here or the guy who works gets one person and then that person works on their behalf and doesn't even have to do this he still gets the same output all right you sticking with me like look at our return here return was 100 versus 300 in terms of units of effort versus return but here we're
(37:05) getting way more and every single month this guy does more we still keep getting a higher return on this initial base now let's say that the next month you do this and you get another guy right and this guy gets you more leads so now you're working the same amount you were before but now we've tripled the amount of well here we've doubled it because you're getting lead Getters first but the third day you'd have tripled it right you keep getting more leads via these other people that you've been attracting and so there are different types of lead Getters that you can bring into a business you can bring employees
(37:43) into a business so imagine I recruit somebody and then I pay them to help me make content I recruit somebody I pay them to help me make media right of course you can do that the alternative is that you can go recruit an agency who does this work on your behalf and the only real difference there is just the nature of the the pay relationship but it more or less works the same way now I will say this the businesses that grow the fastest will typically have two different types of lead Getters they will have the lead Getters that come naturally from their existing advertising activities and so you let's
(38:12) say are continuing to advertised to get customers but these customers now become lead Getters on your behalf they then are the ones who are bringing more people into your world and that is what will end up compounding because over time in order to have a compounding business which is what you need in order to get a really big business you can't scale media indefinitely like at some point like you will get such diminishing returns that it won't make sense anymore you have to eventually rely on Word of Mouth mind you this is if you want to
(38:41) get super rich if you want to just get medium rich like you can make $10 million just knowing how to Market and sell and just find people who don't know who you are you can absolutely do that but I'm trying to talk about getting Mega rich and so you have to get leverage over basically lots of other people in a decentralized manner all right so if you get employees or you get agencies those are centralized those are people you have direct relationships with you have to scale that those those relationships right whereas if you had
(39:06) Affiliates which are other businesses that basically operate independently that have your have your customers and then send you business or customers that operate independently and then bring you more business that decentralizes the activity so that they continue to advertise on your behalf far beyond your ability to manage them right and this is really setting up a system of incentives such that they want to do it without your prodding poking and uh well I guess prodding and poking I don't know why you're poking your customers Weirdo And
(39:36) so a big visual here is that you've got customers Affiliates employees agencies right and so these are businesses these are individuals these tend to be more centralized these tend to be more decentralized and the reason this is so important is that like if you think about how this flow works it's like you're going to do the core 4 and these are the inputs that we were just referencing these are the puts and then these are the outputs of those inputs you're going to get employees you're going to help you're going to get customers you're going to help you're get Affiliates or business owners who then promote to their audiences right so
(40:05) you tell other people about your stuff and then other people use the core for to do it on your behalf and so the more times you can spin this wheel the more customers you ultimately get in a decentralized manner and if you want to skip like if no one shared the content that we have it would be very difficult to grow a brand I would have to go oneone and you can do that it's just tough right now the people who don't don't understand social media so like sometimes you've seen like these old school business guys like who just like haven't realized like the world moved on I see them all the time and so what they
(40:34) do is they go and they will do one to many they'll do like a a circuit of in-person events now that's cuz they realize that they have to get more leverage so they just try and attend as many of conferences as they can and it totally is effective it's just a different way of doing things but that's their way of getting now if the LTV is high enough you can still make a tremendous amount of money in that setting but if you are business to Consumer business you're typically going to need a decentralized manner of acquiring customers so like for example
(41:04) School needs a decentralized manner like we have to have Affiliates which last year 55% of all of our customers came from uh Affiliates or referrals right people with on the platform refer to other people which is awesome and so we're like you know like hey what if we actually like tried to do this a little harder and that's what we're doing this year right and so the whole point is you can either do it and you will get capped or you can find a system that allows or enables other people to do it on your behalf so the first mistake of getting lead Getters is having a bad
(41:35) product and thinking that a good incentive system is going to outweigh a bad product imagine you go to a restaurant and the sandwiches are mediocre or soggy are not that good right and then they say hey we'll give you 50% off your next sandwich if you tell your friends to come here we were like I mean I just I don't want to tell my friends to come here it's just not that good right and imagine this let's level up from a soggy sandwich just like a mediocre sandwich if they say you get 50% off a sandwich if you get somebody else are you still like are you going to refer somebody for a mediocre sandwich
(42:05) like I don't know probably not right and so the big thing is is people try and Jack more into the incentive when the most efficient thing to do is just make the product better because you want to get it so that they this is just my this is my two cents on this I want people who are like I'm about to refer all my friends cuz your product's really good is there some sort of incentive that you have that I can get paid for it and so it's like I want people who already want to be doing this anyways and then maybe reach out and ask so I can just
(42:35) lubricate the incentive system more so than go from zero to one I want to go from like one to n like I was going to refer people already but with this incentive I'll refer everyone that's where this really gets magical rather than trying to use the incentive as the 0o to one and I think me too like me personally I also probably in my earlier day spent too much time on like how do I give even crazier incentives rather than how do I just make the thing better so that's thing number one is like if if people don't want to refer your product it's typically because the product's not that good and so like we can obsess you
(43:06) can read every referral booking in the world you want but it's always going to still come down to how good the sandwich is so the second big mistake for getting lead Getters is a poor incentive now think about this is like a good product requires low activation energy like there are some products that are just so good that you want the credit you're going to get from your friend by telling them about how amazing these sandwiches are they don't need to give you a dollar for every person you refer you'll just
(43:28) do it because you want your friend to think you're awesome because you turn them on to this great spot but the incentive AXS is a little bit of a counterbalance so let's say that you've got a seven out of 10 product but if you've got a 10 out of 10 incentive system you're still going to have a lot of people referring you business right and so I mean there's some businesses that do have mediocre products but they have exceptional affiliate programs where they basically Affiliates make so much money selling their product that it's almost like their main product and
(43:51) I think that most people think their incentive is good and it's just not that good like you giving 20% to somebody or 50 % off the next sandwich is just not that good of an incentive now if I said if you get a friend here to try my sandwich that's mediocre and I'll give you sandwiches for Life I'll probably get people to prefer more people to get sandwiches right but the thing is is like it can't be it can't be so big that people are like hey just eat the damn sandwich for me so that I can get this incentive because then you're you're you're you're circumventing the whole point of this the point is that they buy
(44:21) the product they try the product they like it and they buy it again right that's the point and so a lot of times we try and Jerry rig our way around around solving the main thing but the core economics of every business are always going to come down to how good the product is and so like this is something that has taken me way too long to realize and I think the reason it took me so long to realize is I got really good at marketing and sales early that was kind of my my foray into into the business world like I mean obviously had my gyms but I you know the first
(44:46) offer I ever really ran was still the greatest offer that's run in the gym industry for the last like 12 years or 13 years like and so like I I wrote a rocket as my first try and so in some ways like I got lucky on my first shot and so I did what most people would do which is like I had a very fast feedback loop of reward for doing that so I did more of that thing and I did it harder and I did it better but you can only spin the marketing wheel so many times because at some point you will run out of customers and if your sandwiches aren't good you'll have just told the
(45:16) marketplace very quickly very aggressively that you're mediocre and that's what you want to avoid and so like I remember hearing people talk about this who are further ahead of me saying like marketing is just gasoline it'll just like let it'll do whatever you're doing faster so like if you suck it'll just let more people know that you suck faster the problem is that it doesn't take into account numbers meaning like you can tell a lot of people that you suck really fast and still make a profit and this is fundamentally why I think like the education space the information space gets a very bad name and it's because
(45:46) like if once you know how to Market and sell you absolutely can make millions of dollars and you can deliver a pretty bad product which I try to do my very best to try to reverse that Trend and give a very good product with the things that we educate like grab the books like they're my biggest gift I can give you like but big picture I I am a I'm a product of the alternative education space like I didn't learn all these things from college I learned these things from other business owners who taught me specific skills that I was able to Cobble together and piece
(46:15) together into building businesses that made money but the thing that I didn't learn until much later and honestly the best people to to to consume product stuff from is in Silicon Valley like listen to software people talk about product they're obsessive about product and there's a reason that some of the biggest companies in the world are all product driven tech companies and it's because product gives you the most leverage right because if you think about it you can like you could conceivably not do any promotion you have to do enough to get the first users of course right but once you have those
(46:43) first users if those users then continue to advertise on your behalf these so like this is where you get the most leverage this guy this guy brings you another another guy who does the does the promotion for you right this is and now like think about this like imagine this doesn't exist so this doesn't exist anymore this doesn't exist anymore all you did was make the best damn sandwich you've ever made for somebody and this guy tries a sandwich and he's like man this sandwich is num right I don't know he's he's a weirdo he says n I'm a lot
(47:15) and so he has it and then he says dude I'm going to tell all my friends about this and what people don't realize about referrals is that they typically are not like a one:1 ratio so it's not that like every person refers a person it's typically like one out of 10 people refers 10 people and so we have these kind of like micro influencers within their Network that they have enough trust that people will listen to them like if Alex goes and get sandwiches like I'm a bit of a sandwich uh a ficado if you will I do I do love me a good sandwich and so if I'm like dude this place is great I don't give compliment I don't give cheap compliments and so if I
(47:47) say that then a lot of people are like well one he's had a lot of sandwiches to he doesn't say that most sandwich Ops are good and he has the means to buy whatever sandwiches he wants and so he probably has high his his recommendation carries weight right and if I recommended a sandwich shop in the past and it was good then they will even be more likely this is where brand comes in more likely to listen to my referral again and so the problem for the business owners is that we don't know which guy is going to be the 10 like
(48:10) which of the 10 is going to be the one guy and so that means that you just have to overd deliver for everyone understanding that nine out of 10 aren't going to be the person who's the Magic referrer I got very lucky with my first store at United Fitness at the time was Transformation Center Huntington Beach uh was my first gym I think in the first 10 customers one of the customers that I signed up in that first two weeks I think brought me like 20 more customers and I'm telling you for a small business owner like it was I mean it was like the difference between making rent and not making rent and it was a nurse who knew
(48:41) all these other nurses and and her she brought her hair stylist in she brought her friends in she brought other nurses from work in like she brought everybody in she brought her like she brought everybody in and I was like man this is so cool and you just want to look at what happened with that person that Happ on accident and do it on purpose for everyone so that when that next Super referrer comes in you're ready the third big mistake is not reinvesting and so I'll explain what I mean by this so if you decide that you're going to have a referral strategy or an affiliate
(49:12) strategy is the primary of getting business which I honestly think that you should figure that out with a business like it is the way that you create a compounding business that is viral in terms of its acquisition and as you scale any company especially BTC you need word of mouth and at the very least the nice thing is that word of mouth for product also translates into retention so if somebody refers Somebody To You the likel that they stay and continue to pay you is pretty high and even if someone doesn't refer to you if you structured something that was so good
(49:36) that most people do refer the likely that people who don't refer still continue to stay and pay is still also high and so you end up solving for both acquisition and retention with the same core activities which for me is like high leverage right like if you fix the product you get more customers and you get the the customers who stay to buy more once you find an affiliate system or referral system that works it's just letting it go on autopilot and I think that is a mistake and so like I I mentioned earlier like school for
(50:01) example we like we did a lot of things this year to promote it and then we saw that 55% of our our customers came from Affiliates and so now we're like doubling down we're like how can you make this even easier how can you lubricate the process how can you remove steps how can we give them more training how can we you know like how can we just make this even higher likelihood that people who already have a low threshold because they like the product we just lower the activation they need even lower so that more people can hop over
(50:25) and bring business our way I told you at the beginning that would give you three ways to get so rich that you'd realize that making money was never the point and so the first way is that you build a brand and the translation of that into making money is that you get more people to click on whatever you do for your advertisements you get more of them to buy you get them to buy at higher prices you get them to buy more times all of those compound into lower cost per customer and more lifetime value per customer the two primary ways of growing a business the second way is that you
(50:53) track your inputs and outputs so that you do more of the things that actually generate more customer customers and get your team to do more of those things that actually generate more customers or get them to be worth more and basically remove everything else and avoid all the mistakes and pitfalls that people get time sucked into that don't actually move the needle the third is getting a higher leveraged way to get customers which is getting lead Getters so that they can get customers on your behalf
(51:17) and basically every Mondo business you've ever seen has this and if you're like man Alex that's hard welcome to becoming Super Rich there's a reason that that many people have it and so you have to find ways to get leverage and the strongest way is to build an exceptional product the second strongest way is to have an amazing incentive and then the third best way is that when you have a great product or a great incentive that you reinvest in the thing that's making it work and when you do all three you will make the amount of
(51:42) money because you have this amazing brand you know the inputs that generate those types of returns and you will continue to reinvest in higher and higher leverage ways of getting customers to get you more customers so that eventually it's decentralized and it grows on its own without you it becomes a monster that you have to feed rather than dog that you have to pull by the neck to grow and there's this great visual analogy for what this feels like at the end so they say this in y commentator and I just love it which is in the beginning a startup feels like
(52:10) pushing a boulder up a hill and then as soon as you get product Market fit which is where the customers tell their customers about the product you start getting referrals and that wheel starts spinning it feels like you're chasing the boulder down the other side of the Hill running after it and so I love that visual because that's where you want to get and to be clear it's painful on both sides it's just most people would prefer the pain on the other side of the hill so I'll get real for you a second I you know I'm 35 now so the the numbers go
(52:36) over here now and I had a big kind of existential crisis right around this age when I sold uh Jim and Prestige labs in Allen uh for 46.2 million and well Allen was sold separately but whatever and my big realization was okay I no longer materially need to make money like I can just sit this thing in a treasury and live on a few million dollars a year doing absolutely nothing and that ended up making me really sad and I'll I'll explain something that that may be real for some of you which is I remember when
(53:07) I was in college the the Powerball lottery had gotten over a billion dollars and so I went and I bought a ticket with my girlfriend at the time it was more just cuz it was like fun it wasn't cuz I thought I was going to win but when the drawing actually happened I remember having this moment of sheer dread where I was like What if I win and the dread was that if I won I would never have had a shot to prove that I was good enough and that the only reason I was successful was because of luck and even if I built success with the cash that I got from the lottery it would it would basically be meaningless now you
(53:40) could talk about all the self-work you want there of like well you should you should take a billion dollars if someone offers you a billion dollars yeah I think you should but I still wanted to have the shot of being able to prove that I could do it and I really wanted to prove it to me I think more than anything else and when I did lose our remember feeling relieved of course I didn't hit the billion dollar Powerball but selling my company for a material amount of money so much that I didn't have to work anymore it did help me realize that making money was never the
(54:11) point it was just a way of measuring whether I was doing a good job in the thing that I was building and so it's over basically an entire year of me being relatively sad because I didn't know what to do and so sadness is as I Define it a lack of perceived options which is you don't know what to do it's why I feel so hopeless you don't know what you don't know what actions to take which is why you just want to stay in bed and do nothing anxiety by the way is the exact opposite of that which is you have many you have many options and no priorities that's why it's like you you
(54:38) have many things you could do but you don't know which one to start with and so for me it was definitely sadness at that time and so it took me that whole whole year of the sale which is right here this year is when I sold to realize that hard work for me was the goal and so I want to take this quick second to to make this point which is that I get a amount of flack for talking about how I work and I want to be clear do whatever you want like I just know that when I didn't work I was very sad and when I
(55:05) work I'm much happier and so I work and if you don't aren't that way then that's amazing like you won I talk about what worked for me and I talk about that because it would have been helpful for me to hear somebody else who was like me say these things like it will be hard regardless I mean I think a big part of the suffering that I've had has come from thinking that things should be different than they are like I should be happier I should be like I think most of human discontent comes from thinking we should be happier than we are we just have an expectation of the universe that that life should always be happy but
(55:39) it's like it's it's so rare that that occurs and I've gotten significantly more feelg Goods out of looking back at what I've done and being proud of myself and I think that that's something that I can kind of chew on day after day after day even if what my day-to-day is isn't always funny games you know what I mean like if I have to record Another Piece of content cuz I'm like oh okay we got to do that then I do it you know what I mean but and and I'm okay with that but it's because I I like the output of that I like the amount of businesses that I see that have come that been like dude I
(56:09) had my job I read your first book and I made $100,000 I read the second book we got $2 million this year like I love that stuff and I'll die and no one will care and we'll all move on in weeks and that'll be it and so I live this way because when I looked back on the years when I was at this point and I knew I didn't need to make any more money I looked at the happiest moments of my life when I looked back and the happiest moments was when I was going through it was like when I was working and I had this very there's this saying that I
(56:38) really like a lot which is like you're always going through the good old days when I was going through it like you know I could tell Leila like man remember when we were like broke as and trying to make this work it's like yeah it's like you look back nostalgically on those moments during the moment it's tough but when you look back it's actually like some of the Fondest Memories you have and and so reframing the fact that like all of my Fondest Memories were during my hardest times I then was like well shoot maybe I should reframe how I see hard maybe I
(57:05) should pursue hard things and so that's what became my kind of like my life thesis which was hard work is the goal like I want to leave nothing in my tank I want to I I want to leave on empty right I want to have nothing left like those are the days that I enjoy the most is that I I work at the end I'm like I I know I can look back on my day and be like I moved all of these things forward and to me that's meaningful and to other people might not be and if you're like why don't want to work like like don't
(57:29) like by all means don't for the love of God don't do whatever you want like if I had if I had one big message it's like do whatever you want like the Queen of England died a year ago or whatever it is and you haven't thought about her but she was like one of the most significant female monarchs of all time she was one of the wealthiest people to ever exist and you haven't thought about her until me saying this right now think about your great great-grandfather you probably haven't thought about him until
(57:54) right now in this moment and no one's going to think about you either like it takes three generations for you to be completely forgotten where you see pictures of your relatives and you don't know anyone in the picture they're just humans to you right and we're going to be humans to other people and so I think in some way it actually it's a really nice like humanitarian angle which is that like in four generations like one everybody who's in your progeny is so far removed in terms of Gene poool that they've been mixed with other people so
(58:16) much they are so much greater not you than they are you that like it's just humans right and so like in some ways like we're all family not to get all Kumbaya on you but like in a lot of ways we are and so I'm good with making stuff that helps a bunch of people and using whatever unique genetic predisposition I have which is like I'm willing to work for a long period of time I don't lose focus very easily I can keep kind of working for extended periods of time without losing energy and so like I do that and there are some people who are painters and there's some people who are
(58:46) musicians and like they contribute in their way but I think that I will always have respect for anyone who works their ass off it's just one of those things like like you might not like him you might not like what he does you can't say the guy doesn't work his ass off I was talking to a friend the other day and he brought this up he's like hey man I think I think your content is sounding like a little hardcore right now and when people meet you in person he said like the number one thing they tell me
(59:10) is like he's a lot nicer than I thought he was and he's like kind of funny and cracks jokes and stuff and I heard that and he was like I think when you you started out like people think that you just do this to make money now and I also say that to be clear so that I have brand coverage which is if I just say I'm only here to make money then no one can get ever upset that I make money I think where people get in trouble is where they're like I only do this because I want to love Humanity it's like well if you do that then never make money fine just give it all way for free
(59:38) like you basically you set yourself up for a trap to be destroyed later so that's why I say that now is it possible to both make money and do things that help people yeah I think that's the nature of capitalism like when I had this period of time right here where I was like what am I going to do with my life I originally thought I was going to start a charity that was my whole that was like going to be my whole angle and the the more I thought about it the more I thought that Charities were not sustainable they they can't feed themselves right you have to keep always
(1:00:02) asking for more money really begging people for money so that they can like care about your cause but basically it's an inefficient allocation of capital like you take from one side you give to another but in order for something to be sustainable it has to it has to have a cycle and so then I ended up reading this book by John Mackey called conscious capitalism and to be really clear I think I only read the first third and I was like this is whatever anyways I I I like I was like I I get the point of the book so basically it's just that in order to have something be sustainable it needs to benefit all
(1:00:27) stakeholders it has to it has to benefit the investors it has to benefit the employees it has to benefit the environment it has to benefit the customers it has to benefit everyone and so I essentially like rederived capitalism from from from from base units of like how do I do good how do I do good in a sustainable way oh I need to have a business that does good but because it does good it generates a profit because there's value to all stakeholders and so fundamentally like that's why I had this whole like okay well then I'll just give lots of value here which will create these businesses
(1:00:58) or attract businesses to then invest in and then that will be the cycle I get when you're broke like it's very hard to think about other people but you will end up getting to that point now everyone's numberers different some people are like I just want $10 million some people just want $1 million some people want a billion dollars like everyone's different in terms of your in terms of your uh requests of the universe but I will say something that basos said which is that small expectations are a self-fulfilling prophecy and so like if you shoot small
(1:01:22) you win small and so if you're if shooting if shooting's going to take the same cost either way it's going to be hard and it's going to take time and years and effort it's like I think Peter steel said this he said if you want to compete open a restaurant in Chicago you can just do that if you want if you also want the monetary goal which I just like because it just shows me how how if I'm improving in the game and back to what my friend was saying at the very beginning he said I don't think a lot of
(1:01:44) people understand that you just actually just like love business and I think that's like I I just so happen to have fallen in love with something that rewards financially but like my LPM test for this is that I actually don't have tremendous affinity for any one business I'm not like oh I love I love sneakers I love I love insurance I love whatever I love software like I I just kind of like love business and I think trying to fit myself into a box caused me a lot of pain and suffering and so I will like when I think about the the the moments where time stands still it's when I'm
(1:02:19) talking to a business owner about their business about how it works and I get to ask like a million questions I'm like oh what are the margins on that oh and like when I ask questions they're super invasive because I'm just like how much profit do you make like what what do your return on ads spend like what's your conversion look like what's the like and I ask all these things and some people thinks I'm like I'm trying to steal their stuff I'm like oh I have no desire but I I just want to understand it and so I think that's why like I
(1:02:41) write books about this stuff I make videos about this stuff I draw pictures about business because it's it's what I love and it just so happens to be something that makes money and that is why like if I were if I were playing video games all day no one would care and it's just because there's a wider percentage of people that can play video games all day and people understand it it's just that fewer percentage of people understand that I would work all day and talk about business all day because why would you ever want to do
(1:03:05) that well it's just like I feel like I have this very odd enoy like I have this like I have this like business fetish and I remember because I was very obsessed with Fitness for like over a decade I was I was I competed like I was very into fitness like and I'm a pretty obsessive person and so enough that the people that I worked with were like dude like please quit here and and and start start something Fitness related and so I ended up doing that cuz they were like dude I can't hear you talk about Fitness anymore like it's so annoying but the
(1:03:31) thing here's the crazy part two weeks into starting the the Fitness business I had once I had my gym I realized that I loved business more than I loved Fitness and I love Fitness a lot and I still I still work out to this day but I loved business even more and that was weird for me because I was like I'll never like anything more than Fitness there's no chance and until I found it and so if you are fortunate enough to love a specific problem or love a specific Avatar by all means like my hope is that Just Lose Yourself to that romantic love and just go all in on it but I am
(1:04:00) hardcore I'm willing to be hardcore in my content even for the sound bites even though I know it makes me look more binary more black and white than I really am because I think that for the younger version of me that was out there that was like I felt very misunderstood I felt very lonely was like I just want to work all the time and I want to work on weekends and I want to work in the morning and I want to work while I'm awake basically and it's because it's the thing like it's the thing I'm into and I I had a lot of suffering when people would judge me on it and would tell me that I was doing something wrong
(1:04:28) and then like I was unbalanced or like and and it's really tough when you don't have the proof to show that you're good at it yet and that's what it was for the I mean like these are years guys like this isn't this isn't like six weeks six month like this these are years and I started here right like like the years and so I bring this up because like you might be on year three year three is before this graph even starts for me to put this in context like this is year four for me like 26 this was year four I
(1:04:55) started too and so I I bring this up because like you're not on the wrong path you're just early hey guys this channel grows and helps more people when you guys share it and so if you found this video valuable or have found it valuable so far it would mean the world to me if you shot as a text or you shared it on your you know your Instagram stories or you made a post about it it helps more people see it and ultimately hopefully change their lives for the better if you like this then you'll like these two other videos on making lots of money and finding meaninglessness in life once you do it

(00:01) what's going on uh if you are not acquiring customers every single week week in week out then this is for you all right so fundamentally two ways you can well there's six ways you can search for clients but two that i want to talk about today is going to be outbound and inbound all right so outbound being like you're actively reaching out to people and getting a certain small percentage to respond and the other version of that is paid ads which is fundamentally again outbound you're displaying stuff it's just you're
(00:29) paying a platform to have the eyeball rather than doing the manual work to get the eyeball but the result is more or less the same a certain percentage like one percent click from the ad and then they go through the process whereas when you're doing outbound you have one percent that might respond to your outbound response and then it comes inbound right so what i want to talk about here is the number one thing that i see people that mess this up is that they do insufficient volume and so what i want to do is give you a
(00:55) rule of thumb that i'm coining the rule of 100 all right and what it basically states and i'm i haven't heard this from anyone so i'm i'm claiming it as my own all right is that if you do a hundred of something every day you'll likely get better at it and you'll likely be doing enough that you will be able to start seeing an outcome so in theory if you were like the biggest master of all time you would need to do less volume to get the same outcome if i was the best paid advertiser of all time then i wouldn't need to do a ton of paid advertising
(01:24) to get a lot of sales right right to the same degree if i was the best cold caller in existence i would need to do far fewer calls in order to generate the outcome they're looking for more sales right but here's the twist how do you think you become the best paid advertiser of all time how do you think you become the best cold outbound cold messenger cold email or cold caller of all time volume and so the volume begets the skill but the thing is as you get better at something you like doing it more and so this is actually a circle that
(01:56) continues to reinforce itself and the thing is is that most people do not start with the first thing in high enough quantity they do not do sufficient volume which is why i'm introducing the rule of 100. and so basically it states that if you are not acquiring like right now if you're not acquiring customers then you're not doing the rule of 100.
(02:16) it's very simple if you're not spending 100 per day on advertising or doing a hundred reach outs per day then how do you expect to grow right and i'm saying this you can add zeros you can remove zeros whatever but the idea is that at a base level and this is per person this is per per human being right that you have that's working if you are not doing this then you're not going to grow right and so most people do outbound and they do it one time a week or one time every two weeks when they feel motivated they don't do it every day to the same
(02:55) degree they're doing uh paid ads and they're like well i spent you know i spent 100 bucks it's like so what you got to spend 100 every day right and then what's going to happen is you're going to suck in the beginning and you hope you can break even and then over time the skill will improve and then you will get more back from your volume right but everyone wants to have a a huge skill and do low volume to get their outcome but the reality is that to generate the skill you have to have the volume and then in so doing you do more volume
(03:26) times the skill and the skill gets better and then the outcome continues to increase and so right now if you're not doing 100 outreaches a day in your business where you're not spending 100 a day on ads how are you going to get clients like what's the plan like how like like how is this working and so one of the number one things is like when someone's reaching out to me and they're like man i wish i could get more clients i'm like well are you doing either of these first question and if they're not then it's like well then
(03:55) don't pass go do one of these two pick one it doesn't really matter the thing is is that if it's just you running in your business then this is going to be the cheapest thing to do because it's just selling your time right in the beginning and you'll be able to do this and then you can teach another person and then another person and then another person how to continue to do this because you will then have the skill that you can drop into their brains and so that they can replicate the same results you will and reality is
(04:22) they're not going to replicate the same result they'll probably do it half as well or a third as well but if you can still get uh you know thirty to one ten to one returns on on the reach out efforts that you're doing then you can stand to have a you know fifty percent as effective person but have ten people doing it right at the end of the day most people especially when you're in the earlier parts of the business the people you hire aren't going to be better than you are at these things but 10 of them will be better than you are at those
(04:51) things and that was one of the biggest jumps i had to take is that sometimes you have to take a short step back when you go from you not selling to somebody else selling right but you can quickly go from one person to three people to five people selling because you are no longer the bottleneck of the constraint all right and so just recognizing that and using the rule of 100 as a rule of thumb for any of the any of the acquisition efforts that you were doing i guarantee you uh will will serve you in your life and
(05:18) so it's like if you have not spent a hundred dollars every day or if you have not done 100 reach outs every day and you are struggling to get clients then do that first and then keep doing it not one day do it every day for 90 days right do it every day for 90 days and i guarantee you you will have customers by the end of that process all right so anyways lots of love put those value before you um if you did enjoy this drop a like drop a comment and um i'll see you guys soon bye

Transcript:
(00:00) I have zero desire to become famous for the sake of being famous like none there's actually just a lot of costs with that what I wanted was business owners and so we tested out actually the last 90 days lead so leading up to two weeks ago I made almost exclusively very wide content so it was like relationship stuff we made uh Fitness stuff like food you know food video we made um like you know advice to my younger self like things like that and so we got more overall views but in terms of throughput of from those views to high quality like
(00:31) applications into the business or just even Book Sales which I use as like kind of a a looser metric for quality of of eyeballs went way down and so we have completely like so one of the big shifts I'm doing is I'm basically making almost exclusively business content now so I mean like I have no marriage to anything like if relationship videos is what would generated the most business owners because there's this theory in the in the content world that like so there's there's two theories that I at least the
(01:01) data that we looked at just completely didn't agree with which was one is that shorts viewers become Longs viewers and I just haven't seen that like I hear it all the time but when I looked at it that just wasn't the case people who watch Longs want more Longs people want shorts watch more shorts caveat if you find me in shorts in one platform but you're a YouTube's long viewer then you might watch my YouTube Long View like uh content and so but it's like if you only watch YouTube shorts you're not going to become a Longs viewer you will just keep
(01:29) watching whatever you normally consume so people have consumption preferences by platform and so I kind of see them as they're like in separate tracks in terms of bringing people in for the CTA like the give to ask ratio right um as soon as you start running ads in my opinion everything becomes gives and then the ads do all the asking for you which will help you out as a content creator because then it's like I'm just trying to push as much value as I possibly can in shorts I do Zero ctas Store wories um
(02:01) I do think is appropriate for ctas I don't think it hurts your reach and so if you do like one one or two of those a week I don't think that's going to hurt anything um Longs I see as somewhat different in that it depends on the CTA and so if I was like like I see me providing free stuff as also gives and so me having a CTA for free stuff I don't see as a take from the audience and so the reason that I have the like the books for example that are free on the and free on my podcast and whatnot is so that it's it's like it's free you can
(02:35) have it if you want to and if there's alternative formats where they can do it like for a fee then that's because of their consumption preference but if you're broke then use use whatever and so the the tldr of this is that I think you can absolutely have ctas in content um that drive to stuff that's as long as it's relevant and how you integrate it I think it actually works fine so like my number one YouTube video across my whole channel has a 14-minute CTA at the end number one video what what what do you define as your CTA though because I think CTA some people have this
(03:07) perception that it's like go do this now click my link but what is what does a CTA mean for you so I say if you're a business owner who's trying to scale I've got books and courses that you can check out acquisition. comom if you're someone who's you know trying to start a business or get started I put all these resources together for you and you can start you know you can start on school and so I just do that so you just point them towards your free stuff not even just to buy yeah just for my organic now
(03:34) ads then turn around and just scoop so like by they're I mean all ads are ctas so like that's that's how I basically you you chunk up a level and then you think about the give ask ratio across everything people see and so ads now take up a percentage of what people are going to see in the marketplace and so I have to compensate for that ask with give does that make sense now the gives that I have I still have ctas for free stuff so they can still you know join Thea list and they still might buy books or whatever it is but that's that
(04:04) that's been the evolution of now that we run ads with school I was like okay I have to I have to compensate for that you've seen homos ads right you want to win $1,000 I'm giving it to you for free I want $1,000 that's how they scoop up right like you you've engaged with something of hosi so the ads follow yeah yeah so I see the purpose of organic as getting free free facial recognition and ideally like at the coldest edges of this it's how many people recognize my face that in and of itself is going to create higher ctrs higher conversion
(04:39) rates and at higher prices one level underneath of that is people who recognize my face and have gotten some sort of positive experience with the content that I had even if it was just one video they're like you know I did like that video that guy made cool like the next level is like they also know my name you know what I mean and then believe that is like oh I watch a lot of his stuff like all the time and I'm a regular viewer right so there's there's these Circles of awareness and so the purpose of content as I see it is like shorts absolutely have Roi just way more with ads than they do with like trying
(05:07) trying to take a short and then like provide value and have CTA really tough yeah yeah really really tough and so I don't even do it because I throw in you can't I don't even mention the community my in my shorts I'll just like talk about a relevant um subject in that's involved in the community then then I'll be like like a meals video I do a grocery Hall if you want recipes for these meals in like the last 3 seconds it's only 5% of the people who watch the video all the way through get to there but the conversion still pretty good I
(05:33) me personally just cuz like this how I think I put it in the in the description and I put as like first comment and I and I have it in profile and so I kind of see it as like if someone wants to take the next step they'll they'll immediately be able to do that and that way like I might get 10 times the views by not having three or four more seconds where people want to dip does that make sense so that's that's the trade that I make in terms of short content um in terms of what we do on Instagram we just
(05:58) do reals right now um for for the most part because they just get the most views in terms of new audience I do see like a picture on Instagram as like an email now so if you've ever seen it like you'll get way more likes and way more like and you'll almost like I at least for me I get like guaranteed reach but it goes to No One new and so it's like if you there's a picture of me or doing something whatever or Carousel I'll I I basically almost like Guarantee Way higher reach just within people who know who I am and so I think those are like you mark it with the reals and what the
(06:31) platform is saying like this is what we're going to show to new people right now but then I make you could make your kind of like ctas with the um with the images does that make sense so it's like nurturing through the like pictures more nurture your audience is that why you do your um your Tweet as reals like yeah yeah they bang too they're really good yeah they Crush yeah super high Lage one thing we've seen a lot of f success with on um organic CTA is like if you have to do if you can't run Fay outs but you also need CT to make money is instead of offering more like instead
(07:05) of here's this one recipe if you want more go to my school group offer custom so like I can make custom recipes based on your Macros because like if you're on organic there's an infinite amount of more content like they you just keep scrolling but to get custom they have to go through your thing and if you offer like one-on-one coaching or a group coaching or whatever like that's their option to get C to at school cuz you over more is overuse like everyone says you can get more really good so how do you give something custom to each member if you
(07:38) really want to scale like thousand plus members group calls small groups is good just split that Up Customs good how how close does your content need to actually be to the people that you're trying to find so if you're trying to find business owners and now you're going Broad and now you guys all talk about going like you're doing load of different things if you're just trying to find like I sto that's the point of me doing that 90-day test is I'm not doing that anymore yeah so if if now you you now you know what you know if you had to go back in time to find businesses only businesses to get them
(08:13) onto school to build a platform in school how would you do that you make business content and business adjacent content so I see like I see personal development as like one step below but still adjacent like Rel like productivity stuff I see is adjacent to business I see like time man well time management is kind of like productivity like things like that I see as both wide but still semi- relevant to the audience um but the idea that like I do a relationship video and then business owners also have relation like it's it's too many steps to get the right people because it's really just people who consume relationship
(08:46) stuff just want more relationship stuff which I have no desire to make the the thing is what I struggle with the most and obviously everyone here probably doesn't because you've gone through is like that that first kind of step to start when you like who am I who's this guy like why is he talking to me like so when you click on a profile that has zero followers and zero views like is it just the content that you're saying the words need to carry your profile that's the only thing that's going to build that trust with you and the client to
(09:10) get them over to fill out a form it's just evidence it's just so how would you use sorry how do you use someone that has business experience and background with results to then showcase that to get them that you use that in the profile to edify who you are doesn't come across the arant and like so there's I mean there's different like one of our Big Marketing laws my team can tell you is State the facts and tell the truth just like it's just like that's the big bold thing and underneath of that it's say what no one else can say and show what no one else can show from a marketing perspective and I do
(09:42) that in ads I do that in content it's like one time State the facts and tell the truth say what no one else can say show what no one else can show because there's always things that you have unique to your brand that only you can show a lot of people just don't show it and there's things that you can say that no one else is saying so your your unique your unique setting proposition no not even this is just for just just for proving who I am right so it's like even even when I had like like to your point like how's it like you see me now but like when I started in the gym space
(10:14) I was a very very small fish and there was like very established players who were like jimm Gus who were all older than me who all like were just older than me just put it that way right they're all way older and so I just had to overcompensate by just being so much better than they were in terms of the that I was putting out and I was like this is a model that everyone's teaching here's my model mine makes more money I was like it doesn't matter if he's been here forever I was like these gyms I'll compete these gyms I feel like the only thing that
(10:42) I've got I I I feel like this platform like just has this massive like opportunity for businesses agencies like what I've done for me but I feel like no one else is doing that so now I finally have something I feel like could bring to social media to Showcase to be look I did this for myself with no following you can too bring that P yeah I mean you put the proof so as far as I'm concerned the content serves the audience as the give if they're curious for more they will then click your profile which is what most people do if
(11:09) you see something new you click over like at least for me that's almost always what I'll do if I see something interesting and then the profile tell me in one snippet who this person is and why I should listen to them and then you have your your link or your DM or your you know whatever your CTA is that's in their profile and again you can put that as the first comment you can put it in the description like you have three different places you can put the CTA outside of the actual content itself that I think will carry
(11:34) the content a lot further in my opinion I think I think one thing as well that you mentioned where it's like say what no one else is saying I feel like that for me at first was something that was very overwhelming because like I'm talking about wellness and and eating healthy and fitness which is the most saturated information on the internet and so in my head I was like okay it's going to be kind of hard to not say what iOS is saying but how can I say it differently right and so I think with whatever you're doing is like you want
(11:57) to be able to explain things in the most digestible form imp possible um that that at least is something that's helped me a lot so I speed faster than normal just to like uh you know keep people engaged and stuff like that I'd really try and dump things down did you just find ways to like distinguish or like how did you you know create that separation between that saturation um so before I was making Finance content I had like this one day I just had an epiphany I was like dude like how can you turn people's heads like these like you need to like I mean
(12:27) unless you're like extremely professional know what you're talking about like you need to be able to turn people doesn't make them listen to you and then I was just's like dude I'm going to start speaking faster like really bringing the enthusiasm and passion and big shift is how to to how I I say this a lot but it people still don't do it like if you say like how to three ways to blah blah blah kind of sucks like everyone says it like the amount of people's profiles that I see that have like five followers that are like six neat tricks that just like no one gives a [ __ ] right it's six ways I
(12:57) helped this person do something or six ways I because the thing is is like how is it unique well there's only one of you and you have the clients that you've worked with like my case study stuff are videos that I make I'm like no one else can make this content yeah I've noticed that too I noticed in in the school games it's like opinion pieces versus like a story about something that happened right like the worst thing I hate it when I see someone do a post and it's like how to be successful six things I look at their
(13:26) profile they've got one member in their group which is them yeah and they haven't even commented on anyone's stuff so I'm like shut up basically like in my mind um but then you see Evelyn for example say I over the last 30 days I spent this much money on a and here's what I found and she just lays out the facts that's the difference right it's state the facts and tell the truth cu no one's doing anything everyone's just talking [ __ ] on the internet so so if you don't have evidence so this is for everybody who's listening who's back
(14:03) home so the best version of this is like you know I I helped all these people just like you do this thing one degree below that is like I did this thing that you also want to do and you just are like me and so you want the same thing a version before that is I did this work that you're not willing to do and so I will show you the result of that work and so I could just as easily have a title for the YouTube video that I have for the the six big shifts that we're making our content as like I got eight
(14:29) million people across these platforms like over the last 3 years this what I learned if I didn't have the proof from the 8 million I could just say I made 35,000 posts this is what like I'd be like well [ __ ] I mean he probably learned something you know what I mean and so like that is the edification and so like the action creates the proof are the people at home that don't want to do the actual hard thing like they're not the expert they don't want to do the actual art thing you can make an observation of like how someone else did the heart thing and like back into their process and then it's even unbelievable
(15:03) because like ideally you're doing it about a big person who's like really successful and the metrics are easy to to prove and you're just like connecting the dots for the audience yeah when I started my channel I had no credibility so I talked about stoicism and what Marcus Rus said it's like no one cares what I say but people care what he said because he has The credibility super strong yeah with education content everyone wants a deal on time so if you think about fundamental what education is it's like I spent this time learning math and I'm going to teach it to you in
(15:33) less time than it took me to learn it and so people were like wow I don't want to do all those 10,000 problems show me the three-step way that you do it from this big thing you did and so I mean I think this how civilization moves forward is that like it takes us all this time to learn this thing we then distill it down someone starts one step further and then like that's how you put a brick in the wall and so like if we are quote Educators which almost everybody here is I think is anyone here an Entertainer no okay so if everybody here's an educator then all we want to
(15:58) demonstrate is huge Roi on time for them and so the more time you can show the more cost you can show so Evelyn did both she's like I spent all this time making these ads and I spent all this money doing it and it's like well wow I don't have to spend that time or that money and I can get the same lesson this is a good deal and then they they listen they buy and then they they follow her whatever that that was definitely one of my biggest takeaways in the last three years of making content in the beginning
(16:23) um cherry-picking facts and not wasting a damn second of anyone's time and just delivering the value as quick as possible is the only way is the fastest way to build that initial audience because once people know who you are then you can kind of fluff it up a little bit more because they going to listen unconsciously but I mean like you were saying before in the beginning that portfolio that Garden of content that you're building in the beginning it's just straight delivery cherry picking and in my theory is that you keep doing that and actually don't get fluffy well I yeah that's like this is what we saw
(16:54) in our stuff you can because you have a because you have an audience right and so the idea though is if I like if by percent I I grew the most when I treated everyone like they didn't know who I was and I had to earn every single second it's continu like the guy who dates his wife like it's at the first date on the on their 10 years keeps the wife right the one who keeps the audience is the one who treats them like they don't know who he is and he has to keep earning it every day and so like one of the six shifts that we have from
(17:21) the 35,000 pieces of content we put out is that we are no longer doing basically what I would consider branded content meaning the basically like Al Mo's diet Alex Mo's version of branding because if you don't know who I am who gives a [ __ ] and if the point of me making content is to get more people to find out about me then I have to not say who I am I have to say what I've done and then that becomes the reference point for the content just as something I mean do whatever you want but that's what I'm doing so first off I'll open up to you guys what's been working well for you
(17:49) right now um in terms of getting members of school off organic man chat what was it man chat many chat so running so you post and and then have a Min chat link and then yeah just have them comment and then a man chat will automatically BM them the link to join so comment CCA is this on Instagram yeah I've heard many people using this successfully Yeah we actually have a funnel buildout so instead of sending them straight to school cuz some people can't really articulate it they just see SCH so s to a funnel yeah it just warms them up you can send them like a lead magnet like something free
(18:26) for example I've made this free guide for you uh as well while they see the free value they at the bottom there'll be like the vsl there um the the sales that are there then like oh wow he really helped me so I'll I'll join the things so it warms them up for the school he maybe we should really cuz I know this works well maybe we should really flash this out it does really work so first of all you got to have an Instagram page with a following right and then you post you do a post what do you saying your what does this post look
(18:59) like so we do we do direct DM um CTA is like send us a key word you can also do a comment I haven't done the comment before but it's been the most effective strategy CU you can pre- automate voice messages and and then at the end bring in the virtual sales letter which is the offer so but what is the actual post so basically it's like it's like you giving free value at the start here's how to lose weight in three different ways and then you say the free value after that You' be like I've actually made a full guide if you want more on this so
(19:29) because you really giv them value you say DM me uh fat loss um many chat will see that and they will send that over to their DM so when something's sent over to DM it's more warm because it seems like we sent it so when you do that they're like wow this guy messaged me they'll click it and they'll consume the free guide uh allowing them to be more warm to get into your program so you use the call me and Trigger so we I do if if I'm on live and they comment certain way my live they'll get s a DM if they comment a certain word on my post even if they can spell it well oh so you get on the live too
(20:12) get a ton of I'll bet you get a ton during the live yeah during the live and then also if they send me a DM um they'll get it so one of the I just had one of my first posts that just went viral um I actually learned this from Jose where I'll start the post off with a hook so the first thing I said was um this is what I do if I had less than $100 in my name and I wanted to make 10 or $20,000 and so that right there just grabbed people's attention and then just throughout the post it was like maybe a one minute or less post I just gave a free like game on step by step do this
(20:41) that there made it real simple you want more information about this comment the word deals under this post and I'm going to DM you a link to my community and then they'll get set to our funnel we get their um phone number we get their email address we get their name so even if they don't sign for the school Community we have their contact information so now getting text messages or getting emails so we're just C some marketing to them so you lead capture and then it's a school on the thank you page like a school like redirects after you after they opt in exactly they'll opt in and then it'll take them to a
(21:11) second page and then they just it'll collect the payment and then that'll send it over to the school okay got it understood to add on to what Rashida said with the like Instagram lives and Tik Tok lives what you can do is you can automate the live as well so what we did to actually really get oursel in this position is to go live literally twice to three times a day and yeah and what we did was um we've give out profile reviews so we're basically help people grow their social media so we sent we told them comment down um in the live um guide and they will like get sent the
(21:51) school so we did profile like reviews so we're like holding their profile up and reviewing it giving them like personalized value and people would be like wow I want that and so if you want a full review hop over to my school we have group calls like this every single week imagine if I gave you this every single week right and speaking actually one-on-one with you and you can run that automation through through live as well I like that a lot so either a comment CTA which you can do on lives I feel I mean me just shooting from the hip here if you're live with a lot of
(22:26) people and you're saying comment this if you want it you're going to get a ton of comments right and then all of them get shot over to to Min chat and then they get either the lead magnet which was your method or for your method you just send them straight to the funnel to opt in and then go to the school Community after they collect you collect a payment the cool one about the comment is it probably boosts the reach of the post because as soon as they on it then it'll automatically have me send a comment comment under their post and check your BM and it's a lower friction thing than
(22:57) sending a DM I think yeah yeah have you tasted the comment one we haven't done the comment one yet that would be interesting yeah the follow-up comment's a nice little nugget too cuz then you get you get double the comment what's the follow-up comment I missed that so yeah go ahead it'll just little comment where it GS and then it'll leave a follow I saying I just sent you a DM or check a DM buy yeah like in like you can say like in five minutes like if they've seen it in like 10 minutes they'll follow up hey bro how'd you go with the
(23:25) link or hey bro how' you go with this yeah so then it like allows them to follow up yeah so check your DM comment you send the DM and then if they haven't responded yet 5 minutes later it's like hey did you like it or exactly exactly yeah yeah yeah and you just set like a a string like a t like a board and he just goes yeah it's it's quite seamless anyone else have any other strategies they did organic yeah go for yeah so me just pulling out my camera and just recording like just very non-edited raw content for so I don't understand it it's working very well to
(24:02) shorts a day um I used to do a long videos that's how like started and this is doing better and just posting those same reals on every single social media is it's just doing everything I don't know why I believe it I posted a raw uncut one the other day and it's done very very well I know yeah Raw and Uncut it's just fa anyways so the M way we grow are we just talking about social media cuz we do have another or the main way we grow our community is through free webinars yeah so we do weekly webinars every week you email your list
(24:36) say do you email your list how do you get people to the webinar yeah fre we'll send out emails send out text messages promote it on social media my business partner has a huge Vol way um so we'll do weekly webinars and then at the end of the webinar we offer them a bonus if they join our community so at the end of the webinar we're upselling into I 3 to 5 day boot camp usually those boot camps or a few hundred but now we're telling them if you buy a ticket to enter into our school Community you'll get you'll get a free ticket to the uh the boot
(25:07) camp and so that's the biggest way that we can grow on a community that's in the most successful so the bonus is the free ticket bonus for joining School joining school and then you get a free ticket to the 5-day boo camp and the 5-day boot camp is really sell upselling them to a high ticket mentorship but for those who aren't in position for the high ticket we can still keep them in the low ticket in the school and it we're just nurturing them so they ready for a high ticket so free virtual event which is the webinar and then from there join my
(25:38) school and if you do that you can attend this other event that normally you'd have to pay for but it's also free is that one virtual too yeah it's virtual so um the webinar is we're selling the boot camp okay so yeah we're selling the boot camp and then okay you get free access if you join a school community so you do the whole pitch of selling the boot camp and say you could pay for it or just join cost one of my favorite pitch strategies yeah so that's that's been success love that so did you already have that boot camp established
(26:09) before you launch your school we did but surprisingly a lot of people haven't really don't go about it the b c is valuable like we just give them so we pack so much information in those five days so that they don't want to miss that boot can we just make sure that we make sure yes a five so so do you pay for the like you pay for the like like the place where they stay or it's virtual it's a 5ay virtual boot camp oh gotta how's it how's it built out on your school is it just like a couple different sections of the modules saying boot camp part one boot camp part two or
(26:41) um we just put the link on the calendar we just have the in fo the Z links on the cabin so you have to be in the school Community to access the boot can also it's interaction in col or pay $10,000 which they and then everybody that's already in the school Community have access to every Bo Camp every month cuz again we shy it up sste of high tiet so you hold one five day boot camp every month three to five days yeah and so that's a huge part of the delivery from the school perspective is that they get do they only get one or they just get that free
(27:12) boot camp every time as long as they're in a community they can attend every how do you get 450 posts out in two days worth of effort like what's your process where's my guys work um a lot of work I mean is it like writing to like then shooting the big the biggest secret secret weapon that I have is Twitter or X whatever um that's actually like no one no one knows that but like everything is so I just I tweet all day long on X and then the stuff that does well we then use the crap out of so that then obviously gets me people on X I
(27:52) take that that turns into Instagram reals from there I will read the Instagram reals that I know perform into a camera and then those become clips that also Crush literally different format for the same thing and then I'll take 20 of those and string them together and make them a YouTube video and then when we caption all of the posts that we do we use other high performing tweets to caption the other tweets like my captions are just two tweets it's tweet one which is the real tweet two which is the caption is just another tweet cuz I so if you ever see anything written from acquisition. me I
(28:28) wrote it everything it's just all on my Twitter and so they'll search like friendship loyalty sales whatever and there's you know 50 tweets about it and they'll just grab one that goes you know as closest with the tweet that they made for the real and that becomes that so you just like get inspired twe yeah and then you just take the best one yeah I wouldn't even say inspired there's just like stuff happens and I'd be like don't do rev shares for Equity like don't do advice for it does not work unless you're doing minuscule amounts and even then people hate you that's super interesting she used Twitter as the
(29:04) smallest friction just proof of concept whatever tweets do the best you use those to create reels generate a question from that and then you bulk those for the bigger higher value YouTube videos and there's zero penalty for tweeting a lot the platform is BU for it so so what so if you had uh let's say you were to start your Twitter account from zero like how I start from zero yeah yeah yeah like uh let's say right now you basically had zero followers zero no one knows that your power towards your value towards scripting how would you start a Twitter
(29:36) account and would you even start a Twitter account if you already have Instagram 100% I it's literally the core of everything I do so yes I'm a so which so I'm a writer first people don't know this like the reason the books do well is like I write them like no one else writes I don't a ghost writer I write them that's why they're good um and so well I'll say this the reason they still sell two years later is cuz they're good like if I had had a ghost writer I could sell a million copies on one day because people will buy something that's associated with me but not necessarily
(30:04) they won't tell their friends about it and that's what I I want the long tail um so from uh if ICI had to start over from Twitter I would have two proof points that I try so one is going to be in the description which is like who I am what have I done now if you've done nothing then everything has to be around documenting stuff that you've that you're actively working on like the the person who's like here's how to like get yourself to be motivated it's like dude you have three or like I hate this it's like I help people grow their their
(30:30) Instagram followings and they have like 79 followers I'm like what are you doing you don't pass the first check of proof it's just OD like duh you have a Vegas sign that just says like [ __ ] description and then because of the way Twitter works you can pin one tweet and so that tweet what I would have is a long tweet that's like here's Who I Am by the way and then the tweets everything after that is going to be consumed within that context do you guys database your tweets in anyway for rafson or that just search
(30:56) you can sear I mean it's searchable already as is there's a Chrome extension called tweet Hunter yeah or there's Twitter Advanced SE do all that stuff I don't even use any I literally like I only have one thing that I use that just allows me to schedule tweets out cuz sometimes I'll think of like three or four and I'll just like o well I'm not going to do them in a row so I'll just space them out a couple hours that's how I do it and the clips where do you post the clips the like you said you do the reals
(31:21) and then you just re-shoot a clip so we do we do different so our content is different across YouTube shorts you don't need to do this we do this it's different on all platforms and so YouTube shorts Instagram short uh reals uh Tik Tok are the three short form platforms that we're on right now and so that's what we do and then we have a couple uh Longs per week to go out on YouTube uh I do podcasts as well which a lot of the audio from YouTube turns into podcasts um and yeah that's like that's the content system we just do like five or seven YouTube shorts a day I do I
(31:59) tweet like five to seven times a day we post just this is just my account we do two or three um Instagram reels a day I think we do like four Tik toks a day and then we have whatever one I'm missing that one has it too and then I have Leila so times two what's the why do you guys have a different strategy for what you post on Instagram or what you post on Tik Tok because Instagram penalizes you you can't it doesn't like if I post it 11 times we wouldn't get the same we we we I mean I'm happy to do volume um but no we saw two two to three was where
(32:34) we kind of max out that's what most people don't realize like you can't can't span Instagram cannot yeah it still functions more like a u like an email list still compared to like Twitter and Tik Tok which are Tik toks actually move more in the Instagram Direction but um where your stuff gets shown to followers even if it's not as good of content um but the original Tik Tok was like anyone could go viral because they just prioritized the quality of the content and and basically followers had zero influence on who saw
(33:03) your stuff and I think I think just based on what I'm saying it's it's shifting a little bit more towards like some like they will put your stuff towards some followers do you ever I mean I'm sure you do you AB test let's say one tweet does well um you shoot you say it one certain way for reals and then a different way for YouTube shorts or 100% we remix and repurpose as much as we can so same topic different different structure if we see if we see that a tweet really well that I know that that topic is interesting to people or at least that phrasing is interesting
(33:32) to people and so I'll say direct to camera it'll go into an email it'll be a caption on a different platform like we use the crap out of it like tweets are my my home base that's where that's that's the actual only direct content that I make everything else is Multiplied from there do you have a plan to repost the same exact content over a long enough time horizon or do you yeah like Greatest Hits Greatest Hits yeah I'm fine with Greatest Hits we actually think we do a bad job of doing it right now I would like something I was like
(34:01) hey we should you know maybe post this stuff again um but yeah that's that's actually something that we're working on but up to this point it's been almost entirely denovo yeah so recycling like your top 10% of content and then just sprinkling that back out even once or twice a week you're greatest hits from a year ago because you have new followers to them it's not it's new how how long in advance would you post that for example I made a piece of content that banged um depends on the platform so I can take something that was a tweet from 6 months ago and I could do it
(34:33) again today and it'll crush the same if I think I think basically the more like Instagram I think has the longest the longest memory and the least amount that you can post per day um like YouTube you just can't do it at all like you can't repost a video because the videos kind of live forever so like I guess YouTube would be the extreme on this on this side and then Twitter is probably the shortest shortest memory most forgiving um in terms of volume and reuse TI Tok kind I say Tik tok's like here yeah
(35:02) exactly so the amount of time that you that elapses between reusing the same thing I think it also depends on how fast you're growing I think your definition of repurposing is like like sometimes re-shooting as well right and not just reposting yeah so do you just have two or do you have more forms of reposting sorry repurposing those are the I mean crossplatform different format and then literally just redoing the same thing and just posting an old clip again it's like four different ways you can remix the same thing YouTube's content ID system was
(35:34) really really good because they check the copyright they've got those processes built out you can't repost like doesn't work how long did you go from just you independently doing your content before you brought in the whole team and stuff because I like my screen time is just outrageous like between shooting on for reals take talks YouTube shorts and long form YouTube I thought about adding Twitter last week but like at this point it's like I need to out how many how many hours do are you getting I'm curious like nine nine every day and I was in school so it was like all day it's just like stimulation and S
(36:07) yeah [ __ ] no I uh I immed so if you've read the leads book I talk about agencies there's a chapter on agencies I that's the strategy I use so day one I had agencies for everything for Content creation and then I told them day one like my goal is to bring this in house over time and so I'm going to learn whatever I can and a lot of those guys like they don't know as much as I know now but they knew more than I did then and so I just learned what I could way faster and just like try I avoid like a lot of new new be mistakes and then I just make intermediary mistakes and just
(36:39) had to learn how to like not make those you know what I mean um but yeah a lot of for me though like Capital wasn't an issue and so it was just like I'm willing to pay to just almost like be accountable to making three YouTube videos a week or whatever it was yeah and then they would like trim them cut them put a pack you know put the the headline and the thumbnail on it which I hated half the time and I was just like whatever we'll deal with it later I know along that same line do you ever do you ever get tited like I mean like never I've been slept since the 90s it's so much Belling for so long
(37:11) consistent like do you ever feel like I think it's just as long as you talk about stuff that you like and so my team knows this and like there're some sometimes they're really good about it and I think setting that precedent with the team is like hey I need you to come with like 10 cool video ideas and like honestly half the time I'm like cool I don't want to do do any of those uh I want to talk about this cuz it's top of mind and so I I talk about the stuff that I want to talk about and I think so
(37:34) that also just kind of gives natural like kind of variety to the content in general because I'll be like really focused on LTV stuff for a while um and I'll be like you know what like I'll get into like there's a sales issue for one of the companies and like I'll just kind of like rewash myself into sales stuff and I get in sales mode and I talk about sales and all my content for a little bit and so I just kind of let that happen naturally rather than if you're like I have to do one thing on family I have to do one thing like I have we have never had content buckets ever if
(38:00) content buckets happen it's because they have occurred more than because we planned them um which you you had the observation point this total side note the amount of like Alex rosi breakdowns that are just completely false I find hilarious um I'm like oh is that my four pillars I don't do any of that um and so no it's way more I talk about stuff that I enjoy talking about and from a constant strategy perspective I had this roommate brilliant one of the two smartest people I've ever met in my life um and he had this he read this book and
(38:29) it was called too good to fail and I was like what's your marketing strategy he was like that he's like if I just make the stuff that I have so [ __ ] good like if I just make it so that even if one person sees it they will share it then eventually I'll win and he now runs a $100 million do company and so like and we were roommates back then and so I I I very much have taken that perspective like if you're brand new you just need to make this stuff as good as humanely possible and the reality is that it will still suck but you still have to have that bar because you'll look at what you did two years ago be like oh my God that was dog [ __ ] right
(39:00) but just like holding nothing back like the reason I I talk about that a lot is because somebody who's new holding nothing back is still like barely valuable right and so like people still will consume the stuff see that you're really good and then still pay you for help they will like they will pay you for implementation so just give away the secrets it does not matter are you are you happy that you're as famous as you are now it's it has pros and cons honestly it has pros and cons what's what's one what's one biggest con and what's one biggest Pro biggest Pro is
(39:31) that we can recruit anyone from anywhere that's what I want but I don't want any attention privacy is the cost of Fame like it's a price um the con is privacy it just doesn't exist so like every single time I go out to eat with Ila I'll have three or four people interrupt us because it's the one time they're going to see me and they want to take a picture they want to tell me about their business and and like the first two times it's awesome you know and then like the 100th time it's like you know you still want to be really excited about it because the thing is is like I
(40:01) also don't want the reputation of like yeah I met him in person he's a dick and it's just cuz like it's my 10,000th of this and it's the first time and the last time this will ever happened for you and just trying to and so I think on some level it actually changes your behavior because if you basically realize that everyone is recording you at all times like mentally or literally recording you um you just you're like okay I just can't have bad days sorry do you guys get that because like you're obviously done there with like you guys
(40:28) are big but like do you get recognized interrupted [ __ ] stuff like that I choose to Little Alaska I mean for me it's just been I mean it's been 10 months since I started and it's definitely like it's like surreal at this point like now just like I'm in college so if I go to like I went to a college bar I was just like what the [ __ ] um walking around like yeah it's it's weird but I feel like it's that trade-off you have to kind of accept especially if you I mean in my head it's just like I want to continue to grow on social media and then
(40:56) leverage that to grow my business like I want to do that that's just yeah it was a choice I did it on purpose and like it took me a long time to get there cuz I was like I really don't know if I want to do this but it was a choice and the one thing about it is that it is like a tattoo is like having a kid it is irreversible which is why it took a really long time to like think about whether I wanted to do it or not so like if you have a skill and you don't really particularly care for it then I would say don't worry about it just go get the businesses the way you know how to get them and then just let them funnel the
(41:24) people into it and do the work that you know how to do okay so we covered I think we covered organic stuff let me see if there's any other um if you had to assign a value like a network to your social presence what's what valuation did you give that break it's probably worth about a billion dollars right now honestly like that's not me exaggerating that's um just from the amount like if I were to just quantify what we like the amount of media that we get and the conversion value of that media so like if if like if I had an elegant like the most elegant conversion system would be like
(41:56) we go public and I said hey do you guys want to invest in this I've taken this thing from here to 250 million a year I think a lot of my audience would be like yeah in and then that would immediately acquisition knom would be a multi-billion dollar company

Transcript:
(00:01) what's going on everyone super excited it's breakdown what we're talking about today which is the kind of four big you know chapters in the growth of a business so zero to a million dollars a year one to ten million dollars a year ten to thirty million dollars a year and then thirty two hundred million dollars plus all right and this was this is now taking me a long time to figure out painstakingly so hopefully uh this will be a value to you it's kind of interesting though because when i learned more about this it's hard
(00:25) to even learn things without having the context and a framework to apply them on right like unless you have a business it's hard to understand all the bottlenecks because none of it's real for you so this will probably be more for the people who have businesses but if you don't have a business then you know please enjoy um that being said zero to a million really really simple it's just one product on one channel very simple all right that means you learn how to figure out how to sell one thing on one channel all right a channel would
(00:55) be like cold email facebook ads instagram ads youtube ads referral partners you know what i mean uh all off of organic you know earned media so all of these are different channels that you can use to acquire customers and the reason people get stuck in like 100 300 ish like range is usually because they still haven't really nailed this it's still haphazard they get clients from here and there but they don't have a reliable system for acquiring customers all right literally that's it zero to a million it's a reliable system of acquiring
(01:24) customers and doing it and most people also get stuck here because they have personal problems like they're they're they're super angry and they hate themselves and they're not good with people that's that type of thing like they a lot of times they have the right system they execute it and then they crash themselves because they have they're you know sleeping with their customers or sleeping with their you know employees just like it's just crazy interpersonal drama is in this range but the business from the business standpoint it's very simple
(01:47) it's just one product on one channel and then you just make the math work so it's not a thousand dollar thing got to sell 100 a month that's it that's all it is at this point though right million ish two million ish a year now mind you these are rough you know sometimes it might be one to three it's just the range here but once you're in that kind of one to three range getting to 10 is an entirely different thing all right getting to 10 is multi-products right now an important note here is that you're not starting multiple businesses
(02:16) right it's going to be cross-sells and upsells all right so that's in another way is creating a value ladder it's creating a it's creating a back end right it's what's the what's the next level of service that we can provide these people what's the next thing they're naturally going to want to need or want and need after buying our initial product right and so thinking through this like it's most people who are in this million dollar range are like man what else should i sell them like you're asking the right question exactly
(02:43) the right question that's what you need to do to get from one to ten all right now from 10 to 30 in mind you uh it's multiple products and uh and depending sometimes it's multiple channels all right um you can you can kind of do it either way either single product on more channels or you can do multiple products on single channel or you can do multiple like that's a little bit wiggle e but i would say the easiest for most people is just focusing on their back end which is the cross cells and upsells what are the things that
(03:11) this person is actually going to need next which is going to increase our ltv so basically what happens is you're selling the same same number of units as before like i was saying let's say you sold 100 people at that at that 1k ltv but then you you you 4x your ltv and all of a sudden or 5x or ltv right this is how it happens you 5x4 ltv and it becomes 5k over the lifespan and now you're at 500 000 a month and then because you're at 500 000 a month you can start going to another channel because you can afford to do it because
(03:36) your ltv's higher so basically what ends up happening is you learn how to cheaply acquire customers on one channel that you're very well suited for right then you extend and expand the ltv of that customer by introducing a backend and then once you have that back in it now opens up other traffic platforms uh or channels that you wouldn't otherwise be able to afford but now that you have a superior backend you can now go broader right that's kind of how it works from a from a business day to day standpoint all right so zero to a million one to
(04:00) ten million all right next line here is 10 to 30 million this is another one where people you know massively screw up uh which is professional design professionalizing the business all right uh and this is honestly really painful and it's it's hard to do and i'm thankful that i had mentors early on that were like this is what you need to do now because i probably wouldn't have said this is the next thing but what ends up happening when you're at like 10 million million a month type you know ranges then like the thing that made you
(04:25) special your special sauce here which may have been a lot of you as the founder um is it starts to get diluted out right and then you have customer complaint and customer support issues and then you know things it's just like you're basically still a really big small business uh at that 10 million like you don't have the systems the infrastructure to build more on top of because it's still like google sheets and and you know and trello boards you know it's just like it's just craziness to try and manage this and so this is where you have to hire
(04:52) some more corporate people and this is you know what every entrepreneur fears more than anything right is that we fear bringing in these corporate suits you know who just gonna suck the life out of you you're like i started this business to not have to do that but you know what every massive business in the world was started by a founder right who probably didn't like that and the reason big businesses run like business big businesses is because it's the only way to run big businesses like you have you have to have corporate
(05:16) structure you have structure you have to have hierarchy you have to have you have to have hr you have to have you have to have these things in place so that employees feel more comfortable but also so that you're you're protected from a liability standpoint right uh because honestly once you get into this range you become a target right this is where lawsuits start coming in this is where lawyers and contracts start mattering and all of this stuff right um and so professionalizing the business especially from hr
(05:40) legal and accounting standpoint comes here and then the it systems all right so this is really like really strengthening the ops of the business the operational infrastructure because what this does is that it makes all of these things that we learned how to upsell before it really makes them methodical right it becomes people get the same product every time same product every time and so then client happiness goes back up and things are good now the problem is the people who come in at this 30 million a year you know are getting from 10 to
(06:09) 30 is that they're not innovative at all if anything they stifle innovation because they want things to go through a certain way and then they just they you know you want to choke them to death um but you have to do it all right but the thing is is that if you go these are all like pendulums right if you go too far in that direction then you lose the creative energy and the drive of the business uh because you kind of have these suits that are trying to control everything all right and so this is the gap that i have
(06:31) struggled to make is going from 30 million plus to two to a hundred million dollars a year and so i'll share what the mentors that have shared this with me um hopefully it'll be useful for you but yeah i mean we've been we did 28 37 32 i think the last three years uh so we've just really been stuck at this level and it's because of this last piece right because the thing that made us right was frankly was was me and the entrepreneurials like drive and i'm not saying i'm the sole responsibility obviously our team's
(06:58) amazing and they're the reason this works but it's saying like what's the you know what's the soul right and so what ends up having to happen is that at this level you actually have to have more souls you have to have more people with the juju right more people who can drive growth who can take initiative and seize opportunities right and so this is kind of the entrepreneur versus the intrapreneur dilemma and i'll break this down for you so an entrepreneur is somebody who wants has entrepreneurial tendencies within
(07:30) within a corporate structure right um an entrepreneur wants to own their own thing and i have made horrible mistakes so many times um hiring entrepreneurs and treating them like entrepreneurs when in reality i should have just never hired them right um because they're going to tell you no i you know what i had a business before i don't have any interest in doing that and so you really have two kind of two outcomes that happen here either have the entrepreneur who comes into your business lost their juju right and now just sits in your business
(07:58) and continue complains about how they're not getting paid as much as they could make on their own but they can't make it on their own which is why they're with your business right or the person is right and can make more on their own and so they come into your business basically regain their confidence start doing well and then take as much of that business with you as they possibly can and so either way the outcome's poor and so i had to learn that one the hard way multiple times in our business which is don't hire
(08:22) entrepreneurs all right what you want to do is find entrepreneurs all right these are people who um really prefer they love the entrepreneurial drive of like driving growth driving change taking initiatives building out new things innovating right um but they don't have the same appetite for risk right and so because of that they like having this kind of safe place to go experiment and do all this stuff but they still know they're going to get a paycheck every month now that paycheck's variable but even if they you know suck they're
(08:49) still going to get paid or paid well right and so this is what i have i've been trying to you know imbue into our business right now and it is working um is is putting on intrapreneurs in places where they can drive change because if you really think about it what ends up happening is that your business becomes a conglomeration of smaller sub-businesses right if you listen to jeff bezos talk about his directors she actually calls them ceos he's like oh that's ceo of that business that's ceo of that business but
(09:17) they're all within amazon right but they're kind of sub ceos and this is the thing is like you need you can only provide so much willpower and spirit to a business once it gets to this size because there's just so many people that you just get deluded like your spirit your care your drive your vision just get diluted throughout an organization and so you need you need heads that can kind of reinvigorate the business and drive new uh innovations and so what ends up happening is the way this the structure looks like and the way it
(09:51) shifts to i'll show you real quick [Applause] is it shifts to something like this all right so you've got your your core here right which is the the operational infrastructure that we put in place from 10 to 30 million so this is your um this is your your hr right legal uh i.t finance right that's your that's your core all right that's the core ops of the business that has to happen or everyone goes to jail right people need to get paid you need to pay taxes contracts need to be signed you know crms i'd see all that kind of
(10:29) stuff right and then what ends up happening is that off of that spoke right you have profit centers right and inside of a profit center you're going to have product and you're going to have acquisition all right so acquisitions marketing sales and then product right and so inside of these these are all identical right product acquisition right product acquisition you get the idea right and so each of these become profit centers right for the business and so these things can all roll into you while this all rolls into someone else
(11:03) right from a from an operational standpoint but this is really how the business would function right and so this is where you might have you know product line you know number one right product line number two product line number three right and each of these are going to satisfy needs for the customer ideally when you're enumerating these product lines is you want to use the existing resources that you have and capital and infrastructure to create products that are similar but different right so for example if i were if i were like
(11:29) because obviously we have a coaching business uh for gyms so if i were you know expanding pro like uh services then what's one of the things that we we've added in so we we added in um uh we call it a boiler room so this is something like a lot of a lot of our gyms were asking for more help with sales and so we're like well how about we just train you guys like we train our team like our team drills every morning we do boiler room that's how that's how all of our guys start our day so why don't all of you just if you want this additional service
(11:55) because not everyone wants it you can pay a little extra for it and then you can bring all your sales team and we can drill your sales team and so they get pumped up and the nice thing is something like that just shows such clear roi um to a business that it's like oh my god i would never stop paying for this so it's really sticky right and it's high margin so it works it literally works for everyone right and so it's like we have our core like let's fix your business service and with the existing resources we have which is these are the skill
(12:20) sets and the individuals that we have that work for us we know that we could create this product line and i'm calling a product line but service line um with little investment right we don't have to do a ton of stuff there right whereas when i started the supplement company that was a huge undertaking that probably wasn't the wisest decision i i was fortunate that we were able to maneuver it and now it's a very very healthy business but it took i mean but it was very hard and i probably shouldn't have done it in
(12:45) that order right i should have thought like okay well they also want um someone to run their ads for them so that's going to be our done free agency side so we're going to add that in right and again each of these like this hopefully this makes sense to you delineating these things it's like these are all types of services that a customer who comes in would naturally also want in addition and these can be upsells that will increase the ltv the customer while also making your own your own service stickier and helping
(13:08) them basically you want to you want to envelope the customer with all the things that they want that being said you have to have the operational know how to do this and this is where people get screwed up all right is that when they create these product lines they start trying to manage both and then they start trying to manage all three and then and then they start another business and then it gets even crazier right and so this is where people massively screw up and so until you have a true leader and i'm saying
(13:31) a true leader this person has to be as smart as you are all right running a new product division i would not recommend doing it which is why business growth is slow because it's all about the people like that's the hard part every entrepreneur's biggest problem is they can't find good people it's the hardest problem in the world and it's also because we need to be better people to attract better people and also manage better people because if you think about it if i were an omnipotent being if i were god right
(13:55) i could probably perfectly manage everyone to become an a player so that's a belief that i try and use it's like if i were a perfect leader and a perfect manager i could get everyone to you know surge forward and and and be the best right but i am an imperfect leader and i'm an imperfect manager and so i have to find people that have a little bit of battery included uh to get the result that we're looking for so hopefully this makes sense in terms of how you structure the business and how it scales you know at this point this would be
(14:22) like your zero to zero to a million would be here you go zero to ten million maybe with product line one or product line two added in right which then allows you to scale your acquisition so acquisition goes up on each of these things because the total ltb is higher and so this is ultimately how the business scales all right so quick recruit for everyone if you're zero to a million you don't need to worry about anything you gotta sell one product and one channel that's it you gotta get good enough at it that you can do it repeatedly in your sleep
(14:50) once you have that then you're like okay we got this unlocked now we can sell multiple products these people so i need to find somebody who's good put them in charge of this help them build out a product line that is an entrepreneur not an entrepreneur um and and then we'll cross-sell them into this additional service or or product line that doesn't require a ton of capital investment what else could we provide these people that they have been asking for right from 10 to 30 million it's like all right now we need i.t we need legal
(15:12) we need hr we need compliance we need all of this other crap because you become a target straight up you become a target in the business all right and so um you professionalize the business but you can't lose the entrepreneurial spirit and to not lose the entrepreneurial spirit is when you hire entrepreneurs and then you put them in chartered product lines all put around the central spoke of the infrastructure for operations so hopefully that makes sense hopefully that valuable if you're in the zero to 1 million
(15:37) range then just don't get distracted with shiny objects focus on one product on one channel it's all you need to do keep being awesome i'll catch you guys soon bye

Transcript:
(00:00) you can get people to pay you 10 times more than they pay somebody else you can get customers to convert on ads 10 times higher than they normally do which means it cost you a tenth to get 10 times more that's a 100x differential and that is how massive Brands print money over time and so I want to give you the six steps to building a personal brand or business brand that you can follow and over the last 40 months I went from zero to 8 million subscribers across all channels we built our portfolio from just starting out to doing over $250 million a year by understanding this thing that took me way too long so let's get into
(00:33) it the first two steps are conceptual the bottom four steps will be tactical and the nice thing is that I'll give you a framework and a few stories to kind of like work through so you remember it um and I think this is going to make a lot of you a lot of money and will finally bring to reality what so many people have struggled to do it's like I get that Nike is this big brand and if they just put the swoosh on a t-shirt they can sell for 20 times more wow that's really valuable yeah but how they do
(00:57) that right how did Apple go from just some you know just a mediocre company to becoming the Titan that it is and so if anything even the Apple example should give you a little bit of hope that even if you are not premium today or you're just kind of figuring it out today you can absolutely become a a a juggernaut in whatever industry in okay so there's six steps we're going to go over and I'm gonna walk you through each of them right now all right so step number one step number two three 4 five and six all
(01:30) right all right so the first one is just what is branding overall all right so let's talk about that real quick so branding is this big fancy word but all it means is the association between two things all right all we do is we pair so pairing is the active verb that you do as an entrepreneur to build a brand to build an association between two things now ideally the thing that we pair our thing someone the thing that people don't know about with the thing they do know about is that the thing they do know about is good right something that
(02:00) they like and so step three we'll get into we just going be about talk about the right customer but for now you have to understand what it is that we're going to be doing to begin with which is repairing the thing they don't know our business and or us our personal brand with the thing they do know and like which is the good thing now if we do this over and over and over again eventually you can remove the other thing and the association the likingness kind of rubs off on you all right now let me show you how powerful this is if I got up on stage right and next to me is all the Republican candidates that
(02:32) would make that would shift your perspective of me a lot because there'd be a lot of associations strongly held associations either positive or negative with that group of guys or gals now on the other hand if I stood same guy stood up on stage same me same message with all of the democratic party it would give a very different perspective on who I am now let's do door number three I stand up on stage with all porn stars there very different Association and so the idea is a lot and the thing is is that this Association these pairings are happening every day all the
(03:08) time in your business but most of the time they're being done haphazardly and so building a brand is a lot like making a garden inside in in the front of your house right there's a lot of weeds that want to grow there it's natural for there to be disorder for there to be chaos and so a chaotic brand is basically a meaningless brand because it has so many things that are not associated that Mak sense that it means nothing to nobody right and so what you have to do is you have to prune the tree you have to pull the Wheats from the garden you have to control what
(03:39) associations what flowers you want to be there and to proliferate CU imagine a a Garden of Flowers where it's all roses all red roses it'd be a very strong association with that one type of flower and versus somebody else is where like if there's one or two roses but then there's also some yellow flowers and some daffodils and some sunflowers it's really tough to say well what's that what's that Garden about I don't know and so that's what most people's branding looks like and so number one is understanding what is branding and building a brand overall it's just an association that we build that over time
(04:15) once it's strong enough if I appeared a hundred times in a row with porn stars eventually you would just assume I'm in the porn industry and I could remove the porn stars and I would still remain and people would make that Association that would be part of my brand all right so that's number one is what is brand if we're going to build it we got to know what it is the second is why should you bother all right and this is important so fundamentally if we think about what makes money in a business you've got the
(04:42) the fundamental Arbitrage of business is how much it costs you to make money all right so what that means is CAC the cost you require a customer against LTV lifetime lifetime value which is how much you make over the lifetime of that customer in terms of gross profit from each customer all right and so let's say if I spend a dollar to get a customer and that customer is going to make me $10 of gross profit then I have a 10 to1 LTV to CAC ratio and this is the fundamental economic unit that exists in every single business like if you boil every business down to this one
(05:12) fundamental thing it's how much does it cost you to make more money that's fundamentally even what investing in big businesses drives down to the fundamental economic exchange that occurs within the business how much does it cost you to make money now the reason branding is so important and why you look at the most valuable companies in the world or said differently the most valuable brands in the world what do they have they have customers who it costs them less to get them number one people are willing to pay more higher
(05:42) lifetime value and they don't buy from anyone else which means they buy over and over and over again and so if brand can allow you to convert a higher percentage of your audience get those people to buy more times from you get them to not buy from anyone else and get them to do that at a higher price than the commoditized price of the marketplace those are some very powerful things for a business arguably the most important things that can't happen in business and having a brand or a strong brand strong positive associations with
(06:14) your ideal audience is one of the fastest and most power not fastest excuse me the most powerful ways to accomplish that and so if I told you you could do that well why would you not if it's the most valuable thing you can do in a business from a dollars and cents perspective now the thing is is that building a system associations teaching people what you are and what you're not takes time but once you do accomplish that teaching which is fundamentally what branding is you're teaching someone a pairing same thing like you teach a kid that don't touch the stove it's hot
(06:44) this you're trying to associate the thing you don't want them to do with something that they don't want to have happen works the same way we're just doing it in reverse okay so number one what is brand it's the association of between two things we do it over and over again to make sure that it's only the stuff that we want and then people say oh this guy is the business guy which is for me now why does it matter we get more customers they buy more times higher conversion percentages lower CAC at higher prices and they buy again and again and again great so I understand why I want to do this now
(07:13) let's actually start branding so this is s it come down to who okay so whenever I have this conversation with with a business owner or somebody who's a personal brand and to be clear here I could say hey six steps to build a personal brand I could also say six steps to build a business brand believe it or not it's the same same six steps it all depends on who you're trying to sell and so if you're building your own brand if you're trying to sell a certain Avatar then it's going to come depend to that so I'm going to use a very boring business so let's say I'm an accountant
(07:43) okay I'm a CPA and I have an accounting firm all right now if I want to Brand my accounting firm I'm going to start with who do I want to attract right who do I want to attract and so these are the qualifications that I think through when I'm thinking about my who now I have a whole chapter in this book $100 mil offers that talks about this but I'm going to give you the the the crash course so number one is I want the audience to be growing right because if I have to pick between an audience that's shrinking and getting smaller one that's maintaining one that's growing well shoot I'd rather go after one that's bigger because even if I stay the
(08:18) same size I'm still going to grow because the Market's growing right so number one I'd want them to be growing number two this is sound obvious again is I want to make sure they can afford my stuff right I want people who are making money because if I want to charge a lot of money they got to have the money so I can charge it right again if I could go after poor people medium people rich people well I'd rather go after people who are rich and can afford it so that's the second qualification that I have that I look for for my who
(08:43) remember I'm an accounting firm I've got this skill set but I need a zero in a little bit I don't want to be a generalist I want to I want to serve a specific Marketplace so I can charge a premium and it makes it more operationally sound for me because I have to do the same thing over and over again rather than come up with custom Solutions over for every different customer who walks in the door all right the third thing that I want is hey I want people are very easy to Target because if I if I can't find my customers right like I got people who
(09:07) are really easy to find and really hard to find well hell I'd rather have the one that's really easy to find right and so we're thinking about this in terms of Basics but like this is this is real stuff right it's like I want them to be growing duh I want them to have the money duh I want them to be easy to find and finally I want people who are in pain I want people who actually want what I have to sell if they are let's say I'm going after a Marketplace and everyone's all wied up right not necessarily a bad thing because it means that there is demand there as a side but if if no one
(09:40) wants the service you have tough to sell and so these are the four basic things growing they can afford it I'm easy to find and they're in pain okay fantastic so let's walk through this if I'm if I'm an accounting firm so if I'm an accounting firm I want something that's growing so I think um Health Trends let's do this together live I think Health Trends and aging um Boomers like this is a big a big Market they have they have a lot of money uh in terms of easy to find okay so what's a business that's that's hopping on this trend so
(10:11) that would be like Med Spas semaglutide clinics um cool so let's start with that let's just say like Med spas and clinics that are dealing with anti-aging for Boomers and obviously they're in pain from getting old because who isn't in pain from being old and doesn't want to be old uh so great so this checks all the boxes all right so we found our who so that is Step number three that meets all four of our qualifications great so now let's talk about step number four which is now we have to figure out what they like now
(10:43) remember we're an accounting firm and we're trying to find Med spas and and anti-aging clinics to to do their accounting for them okay so what do med Spas so we're going to say Med Spas here Med people right what do they like what do those business owners like well they probably like making more money number one they probably want to get more customers number two um they probably want to make more profits they probably want to build a sellable business those are all things that they find they probably want to have uh some help uh recruiting Talent so that they don't have to work as much inside the business
(11:16) uh they probably have some issue retaining talent because finding high quality uh like nurses and nurse practitioners ain't cheap and there's a lot of demand for them uh right now especially in the private market and so it's like okay so these are some of the things that they like and the these are some of the problems they're struggling with and so if I want to um build a positive brand with these people I have to find the things they like and the things they're struggling with so we just listed that out okay so now what we
(11:42) need to do is in step five we associate which you can say code for advertise advertise Oops There You Go advertise ourselves with the solution right we want to pair ourselves with the things that they like they like solution to their problems everybody wants to be in less pain and so that means that I'm going to probably start making content and picking off piece by piece here I'm going to say hey um here are some things that we see across our firm for The Med spas and anti-aging clinics that have helped Drive profits they actually can they can combine this stuff in their
(12:18) refrigerator and they pack it this way so they can actually fit more in and have more stuff more room for services great here's the second thing is what how people set up their lobbies this actually makes it more efficient so they can see more patience in less time so I'm going to start making content in terms of videos in terms of blogs in terms of written format cheat sheets and PDFs I'm going to start giving this stuff away I'm going to start associating myself with the things they want and the things they need so when I
(12:42) start doing this people are like wow I start to like this guy because he's making my life better now I keep making these associations me they don't know with things they do know and the problems they are suffering from that they like I keep making this Association over and over and over again right now what happens is is that we have as we build this brand we have to think about it from the perspective of the MedSpa owner okay now this is a this is a simplified version of what I talk about in the leads book in the core four in terms of advertising but I like this
(13:17) as a as an even easier way to think about it is that at the top level you've got you tell people and so me right now this is me telling you this is me advertising myself this is me making my stuff know known that's what we mean you tell them that's the first level it's also the least influential right like if you don't know who I am then you're you might believe me to some degree maybe the content that I have will speak more to you than who I am and that's why the quality of your stuff matters so much
(13:45) because every single time there's somebody who's brand new who doesn't know you they're going to make 100% of their judgment off of this first exchange and I always trying to keep that on the top of my mind that some of you guys here who are new have never heard my stuff before it's like I got to be good right I got have some good stuff and if you're struggling to figure out who you want to sell to I wrote a book $100 million offers that has several chapters dedicated to just helping you solve that problem and if you struggling
(14:08) with the association step which is figuring out how I actually advertise this thing how do I let people know about it that's what my second book $100 million leads uh help solve and if you're absolutely broke then you can go to my podcast they're free uh episode 579 is where they start you can check them out there if you like watching instead you can go to my site ac.
(14:25) com um and I have video courses on this they're free you don't even have to opt in for them um and if you like the physical copy you can go check them out on Amazon we've sold over a million copies of these books they' have over 25,000 five stars um so give him a gander you probably won't be disappointed let's get back to it so think about it like a movie just to give a simple example the movie company tells you that their movie is great so they make a movie trailer all right so you watch the movie trailer do you immediately go see a movie when
(14:50) you see a great movie trailer probably not sometimes you're like well that looked interesting that looked good so what do you do next number two is you your friends tell you you say hey that new Godzilla trailer you see that looks pretty cool and your friends say dude I went to go see it it sucked and you're like oh yes just like that that movie doesn't get my business right now the last time I saw a movie that really took over from word of mouth was Maverick which was the Top Gun movie I don't know
(15:21) if you guys saw that when it came out I feel like I got 10 different people who were like dude it's the best movie I've seen in two years right and I was like wow wrong now I saw the I saw the the trailer and I was like this looks cool but when 10 people told me to go see it I was like all right I'm going to go see it right and so this one far more powerful what people say what others say I should just say others sorry make this easier for you what other people say what other people say to them matters way more than what you tell them now the
(15:52) third level here is what they experience themselves right so you make your promises what they experience themselves so at the top level you've got a movie trailer The level underneath of that the people are like hey this is good this was bad this was mediocre the level underneath of that is that I go see the movie and I make my own decision for myself now the a movie is a great microcosm example of what a brand is in a very short thing it's only one product the movie you go see it or you do and then they generate cash it's actually
(16:25) not really a business it's fundamentally one chunk of media that has a ton of marketing behind it and then that's it and then they try and make another movie right now for us as business owners we're not in the movie business we're in the we want them to buy again and again and again business so what we do is that when we make our promises what we tell them we have to deliver on the promise so that when they see our movie they go to our restaurant they use my accounting services people are like wow this guy really is good right and so when that occurs this
(16:58) completes the loop because they get this amazing experience they believe me the next time I make a claim and they become the people who tell other people hey these guys really are good and this creates What I Call The Virtuous cycle of branding is that you make a promise you keep that promise and then people tell other people that you kept that promise and then other people try your thing and then you keep your promise to them and then around and around it goes and it just takes time to get this second level where other people talk on
(17:29) your behalf which matters far more than what you say because anybody can get somebody to buy one thing one time but it takes a business who can keep their promises as exceptional who can get them to buy again and again and again so if we're going through the steps in branding first off you understand branding is making associations between things they don't know and things they do know which is hopefully something they like so they make that rubbing that likingness rubs off on you you do it because it helps you get more customers for Less convert a higher percentage at higher prices and get them to buy again and starve out your competition the who
(18:03) is when you start this process you think who am I trying to be the ideal uh who am I trying to provide likingness to and so if I were trying to go to Med Spa owners it might be very different in terms of the type of content that I'd be making if I'm an accounting firm than if I was going to homeowners right if I want residential homeowners to be my target market uh or just normal uh W2 employees we I'd be making entirely different content and associating with very different things for that audience
(18:31) right now I'm still an accounting accountant as a business but who I'm trying to make the positive association with has a very different feel to it right I could even decide I only want Republicans it's not a protected class by the way you can say you only want Democrats the only Republicans not protected on either side political parties is not a protected class and so I could say I'm only going to make content that appeals to this demographic and I know that I'm going to ward off all the people on the other side of the aisle figuratively now you might also ward off any who doesn't want political stuff in their accounting right which is
(19:01) a third bucket the point is is that you get the who which in our example was Med Spa because it satisfied the four things they're growing they're in pain they have the money to spend and they're easy to find cool so we have the med Spas now what do they like they like getting more customers they like making more profit they like making their lives easier they like saving money they like making their company sellable okay so I'm going to start making cons around all of those topics and if I succeed at teaching that
(19:25) stuff then they're going to make that positive association with me and they're going to like me I'm keep keeping a micro promise within my content which increased the likelihood that they think that I'll keep my macro promise that I can help them as an accounting firm drive more profits make better decisions with the business and then ultimately when they want to come to transition or sell the business I might be the one who can my financials will help them make that transaction and and Steward it over to a new owner now the fifth step was
(19:51) associate or advertis now I just talked about there's three levels there what you do which is the core for so you either make content you reach out to people you don't know reach out to people you do know or you run ads there's the four ways that you can do it right so you make the associations through the advertising so I want to be clear here advertising is letting people know The Branding is what you let them know so people get this big this whole thing mixed up they're like advertising branding what's the difference advertising is the process of making known branding is what you make known
(20:20) it's the content of the advertising it's what associations occur while you are making things known right and so you can have exceptional advertising and terrible happened at the same time the Budweiser campaign was exceptional advertising they let the whole world know they were making association with Dylan M the the transperson now for Their audience for their who that was a bad Association and so it was bad branding but it was good advertising and we have to make sure that we can break those things apart and to be clear for a
(20:51) different who that pairing with Dylan mvan might have been really good for a different company that had a different who and so if you had a a a business that served people who were super super uh left and very uh Progressive in terms of all that stuff then that would be a pairing that might drive sales and it'd be both good advertising and good branding in that subset of audience but for Bud Lights or Budweiser's core audience that was an association they did not like and did not want and so it drove down sales it was bad it was a bad thing that's why we
(21:23) have to know what do they like so that we can pair with that as hard as we can and we advertised the hell out of it so as many people as humanly possible can find out about that pairing and then finally this is the last step of branding which is the most important step the most important step is keeping your promises okay which it comes down comes down to product meaning that the thing that you said what you said it would do does it the way you said it would do it by the time you said it would get done which very easy to say very hard to do
(21:59) but fundamentally the biggest businesses in the world like the reason apple is Apple is because the products are exceptional now they've had now I'm going to talk about the last you know 20 years has been now obviously at different times and they're they're trying to figure out what their next big Jesus product is going to be now but fundamentally they have the brand they have because they have made the association with elegant simple easy to useed design that makes technology accessible for everyone that's fundamentally what they've done right
(22:29) that is what they stand for and in the beginning it was a being not a suit but the thing is at this point the vast majority of people associate with not that and so they actually bet on what would eventually become the majority of people and so they fulfilled their promise because their products are elegant they are easy to use they are Sleek right they have all of those elements and once people do buy from them what happens and I'll tell you the story to what it feels like so the first time I ever had the experience of good brand good reputation I had positive
(22:58) associations with an audience I launched something called uh LNS which would became like the first beta version of what would become Allen uh my software company so I did this webinar to just my existing audience and a bunch of people weren't able to make it on because they're gym owners and they're you know they're business owners they're busy and but they knew that we were going to be doing the build outs for automated lead nurture for their gyms in order of the order getting received and so we had people calling in saying hey I missed the webinar I have no idea what Alex is
(23:30) selling but here's my credit card just bill me I'm in for whatever it is and so think about the power of that is that the only reason someone would behave that way is because they have a strong history of positive reinforcement with the brand is that every other promise that I had made up to this point for those people I had delivered on more than they had paid and so if someone just says listen I just here's the card I know I'm going to get my money's worth just charge me so I can get in line sooner that's that's where where you want to be and that's where all of these other kind of like you hear these like
(24:02) direct response marketing hacks and tricks and and whatevers they become irrelevant because you have the thing that matters most which is a strong positive Association that orients someone's Behavior towards you with a higher likelihood of purchasing more frequently exclusively from you at higher prices and this is why it's so important the problem is that it's hard because it takes time and you have to be deliberate with it there's a reason that I haven't taken a black pill or red pill podcast there's a reason I haven't done that believe me I get [ __ ] asked right I
(24:35) don't want the association there's tons of people in the porn world that reach out and say hey hop on our podcast we get so many views we get all this stuff sure and the thing is is that I personally you guys know My Views I'm nihilistic in general I don't think anything has inherent meaning so I don't care what anyone does in terms of how they choose to make their money or how they choose to make their income provided it's legal right now and it is legal but I also know that there's a big segment of my audience that does care and so I don't want to disenfranchise those people that trade isn't worth it
(25:05) for me and so I don't want to make that Association not that I have any issue with it it's just not a trade I'm willing to make and so whenever you make whenever you make an association you trade a certain percentage of your audience for ideally a greater percentage of the type of people you want right and so the Dylan mvan move to go back to that did strengthen Bud Light for a sub segment of the audience they had some people that might have actually started drinking Bud Light because they did that now they might have lost those people because they basically backed off
(25:39) on the position very quickly but for a moment they made a bet with the move and they got some segment to like them there was just more of them that hated it and so they lost overall and so you're go whenever you make any change when you make any new Association that's different than what you have done in the past you are going to lose some people and gain others the point of good branding is that the ones you gain are more of the who you want and the ones you lose are the people you don't want and so every day you're basically
(26:11) pruning this tree you're weeding the garden you're planting the right flowers and taking out the wrong ones and here's a here's an interesting point let's say we have this this this thing of roses and this is something I think that really drive home for a lot of you if you've got this row of flowers and that's your whole garden it's just just all red roses right and then a white rose pops up in the middle of the red roses there's nothing inherently wrong with a right Rose there's nothing inherently wrong about me talking about my relationship with Laya right but for my audience for my who it's business
(26:47) first and so like I I made this tiny mistake within our our you know our own business or learning whatever you want to call it was that there was a there was a period of 3 to six months where I started experimenting with some wider topics the thing is is that I I lose some audience who isn't married who are business owners but why would I not want to appeal to them I'm I'm business first and so I got this question and I I want to hit on it because I think it's really good is that I have said before that you
(27:13) are the niche right all the unique things about you create the thumbprint of your personal brand so how do you contrast that with saying hey you want to just do the stuff that your who or your audience likes so this is how I explain it is that let's think about this is a central pillar see this marker this is the central pillar of my brand which is business that is the central pillar of what I have now some people are going to be business in married some people are going to be business in Fitness some people are going to be business in philosophy some people are going to be business and uh marriage or
(27:44) whatever I whatever other ones I have you know dessert okay fine the thing is is that business always has to be first because that's the common thread of the whole Community if I make marriage first then I will lose everyone that's that's not marriage first and so you can sprinkle in your uniqueness of identity but around the core value proposition that you have for your who mind you this is if you have the desire to monetize a brand and do it for a specific Avatar and so if you have the accounting firm and you're making content about how to do your books and how to be more profitable and how to set up your lobby and how to generate
(28:25) customers all that stuff that you might do to help attract more metpa owners to you you might as a business owner of the accounting firm be married and that's fine but you're still going to make the accounting practice and helping metpa owners be the core because every one of them when we talk about what do they like all of them like that all of my audience likes business and so you keep the one thing that you know they all like that you have the strongest positive Affinity with with the most percentage of your audience the key core thing and so if you're going to go
(29:00) through this and you want to build your brand you know what it is you know why it's important you figure out who you're going to go after you're going to make sure it's growing easy to Target they got the money to spend and they got the problem to solve you figure out the things they like you associate yourself with those things through advertising so that's making content reaching out to people and running ads and appearing next to people and with things that they find positive in general for that audience you do that as much as you possibly can and that will allow you to
(29:31) get the purchase now once you have the purchase you either break the cycle of branding or you create a virtuous cycle of branding which means The Branding reinforces itself and you do that by keeping your promise with the product not over promising under promising overd delivering and doing exactly what you said you were going to do the way you said you were going to do it by the time you said you'd get it done if you do this over time a larger and larger audience will be customers of yours and tell other people to become customers of yours you will be the Godzilla movie you
(30:04) will be the Maverick movie where you say you're great but then 10 other people tell people that you're great and then everyone wants to buy and then they do see the movie they do go to your restaurant they do use your dry cleaning they do go to your gym they do try your agency Services they do sell a house with you they do work with you and then they become a larger part of that pool that compounds and says they are who they they are who they say they are

Transcript:
(00:00) everybody in this room is making between $1 million per year and $12 million per year and we just talked for the last 60 Minutes on how to scale their business enjoy all right so you got neuropathy um you're doing 5 million year what's the model uh done for you scheduling okay Le okay is it local neuropathy stuff yeah so diabetic dinners and all that jazz dinners and yeah familiar with the model okay um so then what's the what's the what's the big play uh our we're we're niched pretty well like I think we're probably the biggest in our Niche um it's a smaller group meaning
(00:38) like there's maybe 2,000 doctors that do neuropathy specifically um so and we have 160 of them so it's not we're still there's still huge potential for us to I think we get 300 or 500 or th000 maybe I don't know what's the Ang go for you um I'm I'm just cash okay yeah yeah no I I asked because it's like is it to build it to sell it is it to have yeah I mean I think selling would be cool it has to it have to go to different verticals I mean I'm like I'm way too risky on the checklist oh not necessarily I mean cuz
(01:16) the thing is is like the the ultimate version of the model that you have is like you've got 160 out of like 2,000 neuropathy clinics right so you've got like pretty decent you know you got whatever that is 8% um of that like pseudo of like niche of a niche of a in Market but those guys make how much these these guys make a year like um uh between a million and 5 million right and so this is where this gets like way more interesting in my opinion so it's like you've got 320 million year I'm just using an average right per year that you're driving in revenue and it's
(01:49) like man I'm making five I'm like this sucks right of that you're like how can I get more of that um and so the thing is is like I think the the ultimate version for like the the quote info and agency space that I know those are different things but fundamentally they serve Niche Niche avatars that are B2B um the ultimate version of those businesses is rollups of the the customers you serve because if you think about what like a rollup does I don't how familiar you are with it but like you get everyone on the same marketing you get everyone on the
(02:27) same price points you get everyone on the same packages you get basically you consolidate what everyone's operations are and that's what the majority of super Niche agencies and kind of in info Consulting whatever you want to call it do with businesses so they do all the heavy work of integration for what a rollup would do and then they just say like okay I'll stop there I just won't like actually push it over the edge and monetize the whole thing um and so like most of the Physicians that I know hate being Physicians they do it purely to make money and want to be out of it as
(02:58) soon as possible and so like selling them on the idea that like okay your practice does you whatever 2 and a half million a year of Topline and whatever 1 million in profit uh that's awesome and then you have your you know taxes that you're taking home 600k year after that like that's great but what if and on your own this thing could maybe sell for I don't know 3 million bucks maybe like maybe if you're really really you know we're being really generous but if you were part of a group of Physicians that
(03:32) were a neuropathy you know thing Nationwide uh we could probably sell for like your thing could probably sell for 10 million and so all I'm asking for is a you know 20 to 30% slice of that but times 160 and so obviously of the 160 you wouldn't do with all of them I mean if you did that would be a monster deal but like if you could get like 10 or 20 of them to roll together because they all probably do have enough like enough profit together to be meaningful so it's like if you get the roll up to be like1 to $20 million in terms of profit that
(04:04) would be a meaningful exit that would be probably like a 100 to $200 million exit and you have 20 to 30% of that but then after that point you're now the guy who did that and so then your whole reputation changes your Dynamic changes around pricing you're a long-term stick all of that kind of stuff changes because it's like oh I'm the guy that can get you to hear and that's also the like get rich know if you don't have to do this again which is a much more compelling offer can I ask you a side question you guys uh
(04:30) when you switch to licensing so I remember I know o OG flying around and then more less OG they were flying around for you and then more recent them doing it for for themselves right and I gave them the ads that we test yeah right so the the transition for you from doing it for them to doing it to then doing it themselves and you being a coach does that I would never use that word but yeah yeah does that work do you think that that looking back would you would you have done it that exact same way would you have switched to the licensing model and like and is that what you're calling licensing joke I
(05:09) mean because like we had ads that we would test every month and then we would just let everybody else use them and tons of people tried to use them that weren't are because they would copy the gyms that we had ads and they'd like I'd have ads gyms using my face to run ads for their gym it happened all the time so um would I do the model we had again yes the reason that we didn't do done for you was two things one is or like the reason do it yourself for your avatar doesn't work is that they make too much money yeah a gym owner the
(05:40) value of learning the skill exceeds their current skill it makes more sense for somebody who makes $35,000 a year to learn how to Market and sell than somebody who makes a million dollar here to learn how to Market and sell they've already leveled out of that in terms of like because they can pay somebody less than they make to do this for them whereas the gym owner can't it makes sense for them to learn that skill and then from the reason I didn't do a rollup is because group based service uh there's zero there's zero market for it no one wants to buy them if I had been in a market where people were buying for
(06:11) like for sure I would be I would that would have been the model I would do beautiful yeah out of respect for I'm going to rock and roll does that make sense sweet yeah so we do permanent holiday lighting that's R off a Smartphone um on homes and businesses um my question I guess would be or I guess our constraints we have no Revenue retention um and so we've dabbled with you know maybe doing like a a maintenance plan you know where we upsell people things like that um or you know having paid subscriptions in our app but so who's your customer most of the time uh it's kind of a it's a
(06:46) healthy split between like elderly and then like people want to keep up with the Jes okay and so the light so tell me more about like tell me more a little bit more about the product is have a better understanding of it yeah so basically um we install an aluminum track system into their existing soft and it's got LEDs and so you can do any holiday game day accent lighting it's all right that is that like the Philips hu type type deal I don't want to like oversimplify what you're saying I just want to make sure I understand it it's kind of like that it's much bigger cooler what's the average ticket uh
(07:17) about 5,000 okay how do you get customers um through Facebook and I guess met ads but ads you didn't paid ads in your local yeah okay got it how many locations just one okay one location what are margins um we're about 60% depends on the season um so you make you make a million bucks you keep 600 no well we checked about 51 okay great you're doing half awesome what's CAC um 300 300 bucks for 5,000 LTV that's great okay so um so a couple things so if you want to get Revenue retention um you want to measure how long you've been in business so I've been with the company for a year okay
(08:01) about two years first year was just you know vetting products out and stuff got it but do you own it yeah okay got it okay you said been with the company so I was like I don't know what that means I've been with the acquisition. comom as well um um okay so uh so again we're thinking about this from a revenue retention perspective um one is is there so you install this thing for the lighting um what else do those people want like is there anything else you can add on top of it because like you have to
(08:33) Keeping Up With the Jones I'm sure that during certain Seasons they want to do other razzled Dazzle things and so like you can you can assemble and then disassemble things multiple times a year uh for seasons for Super Bowls for things like that I don't know if that's too different from the type of lighting that you currently do but like it's not too different now I get people asking all the time if we'll do their trees or if we'll do you know other stuff that's not permanent yeah so I would see the
(08:58) impermanent lighting as like you run two to three seasonal campaigns a year so I'll bet you Easter would be one if you're in Utah I'm sure that'll be big Christmas will obviously be big in Utah um and then you know pick your third date maybe maybe Halloween's not as big in Utah um I don't know I'm just I'm just messing around um but even if you had you know one or two cracks at the Apple um cracks at the Apple whatever bites of the Apple uh every year on top of that that keeps you top of mind and then like when you go there you're like hey we also do it like we'll do standard
(09:30) double check is everything working okay with the lights it gives you UPS opportunities but you still like generate other revenue and then when they want to replace it's like hey did I tell you about the new lights cuz these ones are old now the new ones are oh my God let me tell you let me show this thing on my phone I did for your neighbor Susan down the road hers looks sick didn't know if you're interested in that um so it's like those become UPS opportunities and instead of saying like it's um recurring it becomes reoccurring
(09:54) so it's slightly different so like Coca-Cola has no recurring basically no recurring members uh member like memberships but we buy Coca-Cola products all the time so we have reoccurring it's reliable Revenue it's just not on a membership or a subscription and so basically all you'd have to demonstrate to make the the the company a lot more valuable is Simply Having the data to track that we sell a customer for lights and we sell one out of two another thing every year whether that's an upgrade a a maintenance fix or it's lights that we do for Seasons like if we
(10:25) can just show that half the people continue to buy something from US every year that's still makes it a very valuable business does that make sense that would be it so my name is Cameron uh we do Residential real estate flipping in the state of Missouri uh we did 15 million Revenue last year for 3.7 um gross before overhead so 2.
(10:48) 5 after you take into account our team 15 meaning like the how much the houses were when you sold them and then the three we sold $15 million yeah it was like house sale price the profit on each project was 3.7 which is it helps us tell how well we're doing on the projects and then you take out our team and you end up with 2.
(11:07) 5 like evida I guess sure um I was trying to think of the constraint all all week you know uh zero Revenue retention got highlighted in the in the thing but for us I think it's going to be that I would we've kind of captured the market we can capture which for what we do is a driving radius like we've I would say dominated Within 4 hours of where we're at which is like you drive 4 hours to a house to evaluate it and 4 hours back your day is gone um so we're kind of at a push or pivot moment of like do we we do no advertising it's 95%
(11:44) foreclosures and then like a few word of mouth so do we pivot would you say to the rest of Missouri like almost franchise out like get four little like find other big cities and and try to get the rest of Missouri there's probably like four quadrants or would you go go into marketing cuz I know I mean doing 95% foreclosures it's like we don't control our income of properties whatsoever and we kind of have like that that one funnel and like if we're clo like if the economy gets good then you have no deal flow kind of exactly and constant through Co foreclosing was literally illegal in Missouri and we
(12:20) made 2.7 that year so somehow we made it happen like you said it's just a lot freaking harder but there's ways um so I don't know if it's a push or a pivot I would say that's our main con there's things we can improve on but that's like the one that keeps us up at night right now let me just say what's the goal we have a mission statement and it's to uh make sure that all houses within our reach are at their highest and best value because we don't see a house falling off the market as a good thing that just makes other real estate more expensive um I I know the goal is
(12:53) not necessarily to ever sell so it would probably be to expand I guess okay so so you know path one is you just go to another city and I wouldn't necessarily call it franchising you just expand it's just like opening another lighting thing like that's you just that's just the normal way of things like if you just get better and better at it you open another location um I see that as another another set of skills for you which I think will be valuable um and you could and this time like if it's basically there's no point I mean you could go in Missouri but you could also do any other Market that you'd want
(13:28) because if you're if you're going past 4 hours of driving now you're in like flying range in which case pick the right City you know like pick whatever City you want to go to um you'll also go into a city that's going to probably have competitors you know what I mean which I see is a good thing um because it means like the more competitors there are the more of a market there is um as long as you're you know number one then more for you um and so that's that's high I that's at least my perceptive perception like whenever people like oh there's a ton of competition in my market I'm like that's awesome it means
(13:58) there's tons of buyers um and so just side note there but um cuz the alternative of this is like literally changing the entirety of your business exactly which I I would I would like you're doing well with it how long you been doing this uh I've been doing it for eight years yeah dude you've already paid down like all the ignorance Deb so like you're at this point you're like you're like here on your curve like you're like right here and so it's like well don't don't jump back down to like here again right don't go there um like
(14:30) there's an ultimate version of this and so what's the who's the biggest uh wholesaler in the nation the biggest Wholesale in the nation uh is it We Buy Ugly Houses probably I mean there's a lot of me okay so what do they do that you don't do um a lot of advertising a ton of advertising pay pay for click uh mailers is huge Billboards we do none of that so I'll bet that there's still way more deals even probably even Within your current market I think so and so I would probably if I were you so either either
(15:06) you have to replicate what you're currently doing in a new market but you have some of the risks that you've already brought up which is like you're all inbound based on foreclosures you have some of these other things you're not like the income is not necessarily reliable um I would definitely learn the advertising stuff for your own business cuz like whenever there's an ultimate version of the business that I'm currently in it's like they already did it and so now all I have to do is do it better than them and whoever bu that business is already gone probably and so
(15:32) it's just a bunch of Suits who don't know how this business works and so it's just right for us to just murder them I'm just being I'm just being super honest like this is how I see it um and so I think I would just like go 100% try and pants them um and do PBC like and like also do some of the stuff they're probably not doing well they probably aren't doing social well they probably aren't running like not as well as they could obviously their Billboards I know the Billboards that they run um and but I'll bet you they've got great sales training and I'll bet you've got they've
(16:00) got Great Floors of people and kind of infrastructure in place and so I would look at that I would look at their overarching model as well because I'll bet you they get a piece on the back end as well like because they probably vertically integrated as much as they possibly could um within the business that that they actually make more on every deal than you do so they can spend more on every deal like they can pay more like so they have they have ways to beat other people in all these different markets cuz they're National right exactly and so step one would be start
(16:31) advertising more because then they'll just immediately make more within your current market like that would just that might double your business if you just did that um and then number two is I would analyze the living hell out of them like that's what I would do and then think about like okay this is this is the future version of my business one can I replicate it two is there anything I can do to make it better 100% I definitely wouldn't change my business for sure I think that I think your advice is dead on it's just what I'm afraid to do cuz I don't know how to do it it's like I'll just go do in different cities but I guess I got to
(17:00) learn new things darn right yeah maybe we can help up Alex um so I'm Joel I have a CPA firm uh based out of Baker School California but during Co we went virtual so now we serve all 50 states um I have a lot of constraints uh but I think you know my questions would be you know how do you prioritize what's revenue revenue is last year was 2.
(17:28) 5 this year is probably going to be about three awesome uh margins last year 900,000 this year net was was the part going to be about 1.1 um awesome I don't know that's good but I mean you're running 30% margins on a on a I mean yeah sou expensive labor um so I mean I guess my question is yeah but it's a super reliable business it's a viable business like accounting firms get rolled up left and right there's tons of buyer activity there like it's very people don't turn out of their accounts I mean it's like it's it's very sticky there's High LTV the issue with accounting is most of the
(18:03) times um there's no one in there who knows how to Market and sell that's usually the issue with accounting accounting businesses it's like all word of mouth and no one knows how to like Market yeah and then the other issue is is getting good accountants because there's so much Demand right for decent accountants and so but like the accounting firms that I know of like all have like anybody who comes here with accounting firm almost always makes money they're all doing well um so there's big demand yeah for sure so what's the issue um I guess one would be
(18:37) operations um just making sure our clients are satisfied like we have a short period of time to do all of our work mostly during tax season right so we get clients have certain expectations getting their tax returns down and we at capacity but then you know obviously they don't want to pay a premium sometimes so I think we need to improve our sales process to make sure that we can charge a premium to give them that value that they're expecting so do you mostly have one time a year customers or no it's usually we charge quarterly okay uh for quity tax planning uhhuh is it
(19:10) more businesses or more individuals businesses oh great okay well that's I mean even better yeah so yeah our I mean our minimum fee right now is 1950 a quarter okay uh what's your annual stick annual stick what do you mean by that uh what's your Revenue turn annually it's not as good as I like it to be i' probably say we keep have you 70% okay you probably want yeah you want to get over 80 I mean for for accounting firms like you probably can do a little better yeah so I think it has to do with just
(19:38) also making sure the clients see the value because after we give them like certain Tax Strategies they're kind of like oh I kind of learned this now I can find a cheaper accountant sometimes so even though there is that stickiness you know they especially some business owners will be like oh I kind of sell the value what you guys did last I I I'm not sure I buy that I think what someone says on the exit versus why they actually can aren't necessarily the same thing um cuz like I I already got the value is like literally what everyone says when they want to leave anything and it's just cuz like they just want to leave um because I mean I what you want
(20:11) is I mean fundamentally from an accountant you want somebody who will get you to pay as few tax as humanly possible and keep you out of jail and that's pretty much that's pretty much the that's the task yeah and um make it as little work for you as humanly possible for that to occur right and so I mean just me having been a consumer of many different accounting firms and accountants and employees who were you know who did that stuff for us um I don't I don't buy the like we taught them the two or three tricks yeah um
(20:43) also I bet you a bunch of your business owners aren't even like close to it some of them are bigger and like aren't they're just like yeah just pay the bill I don't I don't really care just make sure it's right so I would bet that you probably have bad onboarding okay so basically the expect basically the Delta between what they're sold and then what their experience is in the first handful of days and weeks going into it and then the communication Cadence between touch bases they probably see limited value there and so I think um I would give you the same
(21:13) kind of like if I were to like buy 100% of your business tomorrow I would audit the sales process to handoff like I would bet you there's a massive amount of opportunity there in terms of like how can we take more notes on every customer because the I get pissed off if I feel like I'm talking to somebody they don't know much about my business and I'm paying them $8,000 year my taxes right immediately I'd be like oh yeah [ __ ] you like I know you can't be looking at like I can just do back of napkin brain math of like if you barely
(21:39) know who I am you definitely don't know how to save me money on my taxes right and we do have an onboarding process but there might be a disconnect between the sales well we already know there's a disconnect cuz you said there was so this is me this is me trying to help so I would go really deep on the onboarding process which is like how can I really tighten this up both in terms of the personalization of the communication and how can I speed up the number of times you communicate with them because you want frequent
(22:05) communication as long as like it's pushed so it's not me asking for [ __ ] you know CU then I [ __ ] hate you right like if you ask me for St but if it's like hey uh just letting you know we ran this today this thing is moving forward everything's good nothing for you just keep you in the loop and then two days later hey we also ran this thing um XYZ is done and it's moving forward to the next step I'd be like oh [ __ ] they're doing stuff and so like I tell this to everybody but no one does it and so this is me telling you and
(22:31) hopefully you will do it but like if you do a hundred things you want to let them know every time you're doing one of those things on their behalf and they're like dude these guys are working for me all the time like this guy works his ass off and then someone else is like well they're doing it for 8,000 I'll do it for six and they're you're like oh no these guys work their asses off for me like I'm sure I'm safe like no one actually knows it's kind of like when the guy comes to your your house like especially the nicer the neighborhood you live in you know this like he's like
(22:57) think I could do the lighting for 10 grand I'm like dud you think I got this house because I let people rip me off I was like give me the r price and then it's like all right I can do it for four and you're like great you know or whatever and so the thing is is like no one really knows they just they just gut call on the fact that like my communication with this company's been crappy the expectations are poor and so if this is my external experience I'll bet you they're not crossing their tees and dotting their eyes on my taxes that would be my guess right and so I think if you get all of the other
(23:27) stuff tight they will just get yes that your internal stuff's as tight which I hope it is um and I'll bet you that'll keep the stick honestly and of course accountants don't know how to deal with customers so I bet you probably need to train them again on that communication Cadence so it's basically way more personalized way more frequent uh communication and then probably very tight training on how to have touchpoint calls with the customers right that makes or clients whatever for sure that' be like the number one thing I would do I wouldn't even do anything
(23:56) else I mean do you think it's scalable too cuz I mean my biggest yes accounting firms are scalable ey KPMG like yes they're scalable price yeah PWC think those are publicly trading accounting firms yes they're scalable what do you think about like one of the thing you mentioned I think yes yesterday was like you know the size of the brain the biggest brain is as big as you know so I I'm starting to now hire people that are smarter than me in other areas like uh but when it comes to accounting I'm still like the smartest person in the room yeah there's smarter accountants I don't say this a slight I just say like look at the guys that keep like they're
(24:30) some smart dudes yeah I mean I kind of want to hire like cuz I'm more of a CEO than I am a tax nerd yeah so I rather hire like yeah go get a tax nerd yeah yeah you go recruit somebody from one of those companies who's like I need somebody who worked at Enron who wasn't a bad guy you know what I mean and figure out like who can do like the real the crazy stuff who knows the tax like who reads tax law for fun yeah like that's who you need cuz there are dudes who do who are like oh curled up on like I know a buddy of mine who literally goes to the pool with the tax law his
(25:03) kids are in the pool and he's reading it and I'm like what is wrong with you he's like I just love this stuff and I was like I'm glad someone does you know like and he's like look at this hole he's like oh I'm going to crush this one and he's like he's like this is legal it's like he just like loves it's like for him is like treasure hunting so like you need somebody who's like that and if that's not you then you should have somebody who is that way yeah for sure so yes I agree and I think you should do
(25:27) that I would say step one though fix all the outside stuff step two go get that guy cuz that stuff will make you more money today with what you already have than do the other thing right so newer SAS company we help inbound sales teams improve their or eliminate no shows improve their sales off and self efficiency um I really think the most helpful thing for me would be just you running through um really the major learning lessons you had from Allen in terms of red plaque my my background is high tiet education and for that whole stay so I think I'm kind of coming into it you know do you have
(26:04) his technical co-founder I do okay how good is he I spent 18 months fighting so okay he's pretty good well that could mean that it just took you really long to find somebody who's bad so like um two years from now you're like I should have know yeah um so it really comes down to like has this person built a solare company before yeah Okay cool so fundamentally like the entire game's different than the High tiet game right like it's all about Revenue retention it's all about word of mouth it's it's a
(26:33) product business there's actually a podcast I just made I don't even know when it's coming out about this but like what business are you really in and so like when I got into Allen I thought I was in the marketing and sales business because that was the business that I came from but you're actually in the product business so it has to be it has to be basically like taking to its natural extreme if people don't stick with it it doesn't matter so basically marketing and doing everything else like it's irrelevant
(26:59) right and so like unless that's right nothing else matters basically and so Marketing sales in the front end literally only serves the purpose of making the product better until there's a point where it has what I would consider passive growth where it grows on its own and then you gas the living hell out of it and then that's what makes gazillion doll companies like if you want low turn you either have to go up market and find the people who don't turn out or you have to help create the people who don't turn so like the Shopify and the Spotify
(27:30) a lot of IFI here um there's going to be there's cohort churn which you're probably familiar with if you're co-founders in this so like you're going to have periods of time where it's like okay the first six months we turn out [ __ ] 80% of our customers but the 20% after that point our retention curve is flat and so you just have to figure out once you get to that data cohort you're like okay what do these people look like and then you readjust the messaging readjust uh the marketing so you can get more and more of those people so you get a bigger and bigger slice of them and
(27:59) funly that Loop is what will you more or less focus on um and then I think about it from when I'm trying to reverse engineer the customer Avatar it's like you have psychographics like what do they believe you have demographics what do they look like where are they from you have Geographics or where where are they um and then you have kind of activities which is like what did they do so if I'm trying to reverse engineer what the people who spend the most money with me look like I look through those those lenses who are they where are they from what do they believe what do they do and then I try and say in my ads hey
(28:30) I'm looking for people who believe these things I look in the places that they're at um and then once they're in I try and get them to do the same things that the people who were successful who look like them who talk like them who believe like them did in order to be successful so like in the beginning you just do a ton of marketing to get Traction in the door and that's literally just so you can like see if people like it see where they're turning out see get basically you just want feedback and then once you
(28:55) find what people are liking what they're successful with obviously iterate from a product perspective on the road map to do more of the stuff that core in terms of value but then the marketing side it Loops back and then that's what informs who you're picking on the front end who you're marketing to right so you being much more specific form and totally call the people to STI yes yes and the hard part is that your sales team won't want to do it and you will not want to say no to money yeah but I I understand a
(29:23) company persp for the Mak cool but that's I mean fundamentally like if you good Vista um I I became friendly acquaintances with their their head of pricing and packaging and he was just like if you don't do you know vist is so they're out of aost in100 billion dollar private Equity they're they'd be like the fifth biggest company like whatever they're massive um and they only they're private Equity they and they buy software companies and they triple them in in in three years which is their goal and they flip them and so um the founder I can't remember his name
(29:54) now I feel bad um is uh anyways rich I'll just put that way um point being I was talking to the head of packaging and he said you want to know our whole secret and I was like what man he's like we just know our our quired companies's customers better than they do I was like what do you mean he's like so we go into the data room and we look at all the customers they have and we look at what channels they came from we look at who they are how they act all that stuff he's like then we turn off all the marketing that's not those customers and we crank the living hell out of the stuff that is that and we do nothing
(30:23) else on the company Tres obviously it's more than that but fun like big picture strategy that's what they do we get more the people who spend the most money but people just aren't disciplined and that's why people just stay poor because then they they try and serve too many people too many different avatars they can't say not of money today so they don't get the big money tomorrow cool appreciate than you hi I'm AR Alex uh DTC fishion brand Commerce Indonesia from Indonesia doing $10 million a year addit that $3 million
(30:56) been doing this nine years awesome uh thanks for making it out thank you how do I know when to expand new product line what are you selling now what do you sell now t-shirt shirt pants Jeans jacket but mostly man were is it white is it white label or a brand say it again is it your brand or is it my BR your brand I manufactur I I'm not manufacturer I suck con to the other Factory in India and then I only own the office and the warehouse is it custom do you design it or you just slap your leg you design it knock off no that's
(31:34) fine I mean like hey I'm I'm I'm not I don't dud competition's competition um as long as you're not hacking their databases or anything like that's I mean that's the nature of the retail business I understand it um okay so the question that you have is how do how do you scale it or basically how do you add more to expand new product line let's say Woman's let's say sports o because I'm doing casual only let's say formal um I don't think at 10 million you need to like like you could do so much more even within that within that
(32:08) that demographic like if you're just mostly men's wear like there's tons of massive Men's Wear companies can I add to that yeah add yeah I'm thinking about that also because I haven't achieved 200 or $300 million yet isn't it isn't it will make my brand to man were letter in life so I'm not building enough Foundation to capture the woman's letter in$ 300 $500 million mon 500 million a month that would be a lot um it's a tough call man I'll be honest with you because like on one level I mean if you're like I want to build the
(32:50) next Nike then yeah you're going to have to sell to everybody but even Nike doesn't sell suits right just like like there's so like there's so many people who buy so much clothing um and I mean I think so right now I think you're a little bit of of like a brand identity spot like you obviously know how to convert I'm guessing are you running ads yeah right so you know like you know you know that game and you run really good margins I'm sure on the on the products based on and and you can you know how to run run ads at scale and so what I think right now is you have to
(33:22) figure out who who you want to become as a brand so if you like Men's Wear then like you can be I think you can build a massive Men's Work company just being real I mean just being really transparent with you like you can U build a massive vsware company also like Lou Lemon doesn't do I guess they have like pants that are nice but like they're all sportswar so like I mean lemon's a terrible example now because they're just gone to crap but like um like if you look at these I like like I just as a framework for everybody like I
(33:51) look at what's the biggest version of the business that's currently here like what did they do to get there what does their business model look like and then how many steps between where I'm at and where they are do I need to take and like what lessons or what what skills am I deficient in and then it's like okay well then those skill deficiencies become the opportunity like fundamentally that's it and what their brand looks like and how they monetize like are they vertically integrated or like if I was getting into the into the energy drink business I'd be like okay well Red Bull has outsourced literally
(34:20) everything besides marketing so I guess that might be the most important thing for a consumer packaged good that's you know rtds ready to drink and distribution so it's like they have massive brand plays massive distribution you know they have their recipe underlock and key and everything else is is so like basically I would look at the brand like is there a brand that you want to emulate uh basically I'm I'm what problem are with uh am I solving is just a billion dollar exit building consulting firm and then that is a lid magnet to PE build media and then
(34:51) control the Indonesia okay so my goal just I'll a billion liquid cast Okay well let's take so right now we sell clothes so let's a couple I get it I appreciate that so I want to I want to increase the like that you get there so I think like you can make this thing very valuable without doing all of the other stuff that you were talking about so I think like you absolutely can do this and then think okay why can't I get this to $100 million a year selling men's Weare like why can't I and I think that way then it's like okay is there a is there a brand person who can endorse this like if you look at the big retail
(35:28) Brands they have big endorsers who stand next to the product that increases conversion increases the premium you can charge and so instead of knocking off Zara you just become a brand and I think honestly I think that's the gap for you like you're obviously very good at the Arbitrage of media to to clicks and whatnot but like I think you need to go from that to building a brand and then that's what will make it sellable so this is what I like that's the tldr of our conversation is that's what makes your thing valuable is you need to build a brand

Make More Profit than 99% of People - YouTube

Transcript:
(00:00) if you want to make more profit than 99% of businesses you need to nail pricing optimizing pricing has a six times stronger increase on profitability than getting more customers and two times stronger increase of profitability than decreasing churn or getting people to buy more times and it is the strongest way for businesses to make more money and so in this video I will walk you through on each page that I turn A New Concept that you can apply to your business that will make it more profitable via price if you don't know who I am my name is Alex rosi I own
(00:32) acquisition. it's a portfol of company over $200 million a year and these videos are to help you show what we do to grow our portfolio so that you can make lots of money and then maybe someday we can invest in your company otherwise enjoy I take a weekly call with a school uh communities in the school group and uh I had like three or four guys who asked me questions that I was like these are not like Alex questions these are math questions that you can just simply solve by doing math and so it's like should I do this price or this price price it's like well
(01:01) what's the conversion of this one versus this one and then what's LTV on this one right it's just you just solve the math problem and I think a lot of businesses are not using math to solve their problems and with pricing being one of the largest levers for making money not one of it is the largest compared to getting more customers uh increasing uh how many times people buy and uh and pricing pricing is still a three times stronger lever on profit versus the other two so let's talk about five concepts of pricing that will make you more money all right so the first one is something that I like to call the price Dev value
(01:37) discrepancy all right and so if we imagine here as the value this little first Red Line This is the value that the person gets this is our price assuming that our price doesn't change over time now if our price doesn't change and the value does when will people cancel here when the price and the value were matched or when it's underneath and this is our sad face as business owners because we're like oh my God I thought that I was making all this money and so the thing is is that there's a third line here that is
(02:10) probably worth understanding and this is our cost line so ideally you want your cost to be here your price to be here so this is your profit and then over here this is your something called customer Surplus uh which is just a fancy word of saying Goodwill or the value that people are getting net of the price right so ideally you have really high value you've got a price that's still high relative to your cost basis as a business owner and so this is the fundamentals of pricing individual now one of the things that I see as a mistake is how does this occur how do we go from having lots of value to not
(02:46) having lots of value well let me explain so with onetime value versus consumable value which is I like to think about it all right so the reason that you have those big discrepancies is that usually you don't don't understand the value that you are delivering to a customer meaning if I say hey let me give you this course on you know building websites whatever right then as soon as you learn how to build websites the value of that course drops to zero you already have the skill like the day before you needed to learn how to do arithmetic arithmetic is super valuable the day after you learn it it
(03:28) has zero additional value now that doesn't ract from what the initial value was it just no longer has value and so what most business owners should do but don't do so this is me telling you that you might want to think about this is differentiating the value that you have in your business between one time and consumable or recurring value all right so let me explain so let's say I uh let's let's let's use that example the websites so my little my little course right on website building is something that would be one one time value once you have it that's it there's there's nothing
(04:06) else but what are all the things that I might have in my business for website building that someone is going to consume this month and next month and the month after I might have a community that's associated of people who are trying to build Pages that's something that I'll use this month and next month I might have accountability if I have somebody who's going to help me build it right accountability SL support that's something that I'll use this month and next month right I'll have access to those things what else would I use
(04:34) probably website servers to host my site right I'd probably use software to host my site I'd probably what else would I use um I might want ads help right that I would use on a monthly basis to help optimize my ads right and so the big thing here is that we have to look at the services we provide and this is especially true with education people because they have lots of one time value and very low recurring value is thinking am I pricing these things appropriately so hear me out I think that a superior pricing model better matches the price to Value
(05:11) discrepancy that you're shooting for on a regular basis so it would make sense for me to charge more here right my price to be higher here and then it would make sense for my price to be lower over here so I continue to have this Delta all the way through right and so the question is how do you accomplish something like that well what you do is you have something called a startup or a one-time fee which is associated with the thing that has onetime value and then you have a lower consumable or recurring billing thing that's associated with the consumable recurring value and this is fundamentally why I
(05:47) think there's so much churn in the media or education or information space is because people don't differentiate between those things but your customers sure do and so the customer says well you want me to pay $1,000 a month for this course but I already learned how to do this and you want me to keep paying for it for 12 months even though I already went through it now you might make the argument well it's worth $122,000 but you know what as far as they're concerned today it's worth nothing and so this is why I like having this this perception of I have a
(06:16) one-time payment up front that's higher and then I have a smaller payment that is done every month that reflects a price to Value discrepancy on these recurring consumable things now one of the things that people have a hard time with is realizing that this is significantly less valuable than this and so what happens is is that this might have to be $5,000 and this might be $300 per month or $200 per month and that's okay and so making sure that that price Dev value discrepancy matches will allow you to have really long LTV on the
(06:47) side and so in so doing get way more LTV overall because people don't leave and if people don't leave they keep paying if they keep paying you keep making money okay now that is the onetime value versus consumable valuable uh concept this is the big head long tail which I talk about in my offers book um in more depth and I think a lot of businesses are going to start switching to it they already are the way that this is done in the infos space is people sell a course and then they have continuity or community on the back end um and you sell it as one thing but the they're
(07:16) just priced differently so you pay $5,000 today but then you pay x per month over time okay now if you were to switch to something like this let me walk you through something that blew my mind that might blow yours as well so profit well did a really cool study on this which showed the difference between monthly billing quarterly billing and annual billing now you're like okay well what's the point who cares well you should care let me show you why so if you build monthly the average turn across all memberships is about 10.7%
(07:54) per month that means if you have 100 people you're going to have 89 at the end of the next month all right if you Bill quarterly that churn drops to 5% okay less than half literally simply by changing the billing Cadence now what happens if you Bill annually it drops all the way to 2% now you're like okay that doesn't seem like a very big difference but let me show you how big of a difference this really is so we can determine LTV by taking price and by the way you all wanted more real business [ __ ] this is real business [ __ ] okay so you take price and you
(08:30) divide by churn and this gives you your back of napkin LTV all right meaning lifetime value how much Somebody's Worth over time and so that means that if my price is $100 all right $100 and we'll use that for all three of these examples per month right now if it's $100 per month here I'm billing monthly here I'm billing $300 every quarter here I'm billing uh $1,200 per year all right just to be clear now these turn rates R are extrapolated back out to monthly so if I have 10.7% churn 10.7 then it means that my LTV is somewhere in the near but of
(09:09) like 950 bucks somewhere in there okay now if I have 5% churn my LTV is now $2,000 if I have 2% churn my LTV is $5,000 wow so we went from 950 to 5,000 just by changing the Cadence that we built if you're listening to this and you're like wait a second if I made five times the money per customer guess what that would do to my business you bet it would 5x your business then you're like okay well I'm going to do this tomorrow not so fast there you know fast Fred let's talk about the other side of this two things real quick one if you like this stuff uh the question that I was citing at the very beginning of this
(09:53) was from a school uh Q&A that I do so if you're getting into business you want to start a business you can join the school games3 % of people make their first dollar online very proud of that um if they finish the first month of the school game so pretty cool there if you already are a business owner and you like this more in-depth stuff in terms of like scaling the companies uh and increasing profit and eida uh we have workshops that we just started uh offering at acquisition. comom at our headquarters in Vegas um and so if you want to see if you qualify for one of
(10:19) those uh you can go to acquisition. comom hit scale and uh hopefully we'll talk to you then conversion rates and so think about it like this let's say you get 100 clicks or at bats or whatever to pitch this thing right now before this you used to say hey my thing is $122,000 and you Bill you know a th000 bucks a month for a year okay fine now the thing is is maybe you close 20% of people on this okay fine now let's say you have another 100 where you get on the phone and you say for these guys it's $5,000 per year and it's up front now the question is what percent maybe you
(11:02) still sell 20% I don't know this is a testable proposition but this is where it gets really interesting is that for everybody who knows that you you say hey this is $112,000 it's 1,000 a month for 12 months we all know that this person cancels at month four you know what I'm saying so they cancel it month four or five which means the people are worth $4 to $5,000 right now if you Bill $5,000 and you Bill it annually and you say Hey you have to pay this upfront maybe you have the same Clos rate because the price point is so much the perception of the
(11:33) price is so much lower but here's where this gets really interesting is that if we look at this 12 months later and we say hey what percentage of these people are going to renew guess what the percentage is way higher and that brings me to my next point which I will reiterate back on this one which is let's think about what the mechanism is that drives down this churn going from monthly to quarterly to annual so let me tell you what it is or at least my best thought of it is that churn churn is directly correlated with frequency of
(12:09) billing okay so hear me out if I bill you every day the likelihood that you turn is going to be significantly higher than if I bill you every month and I believe that that comes down to what I consider the look back window so think about it like this if I have a month right or a period between billing one and billing two doesn't really matter what this period of time is on this point I'm going to look back with my eyeballs and say how much value did I get between this billing and this billing now if I'm billing monthly then let's say I'm an SEO agency and I make
(12:43) someone 10x their money on month one great month two happens let's say I make them 1X guess what they're going to do they're not going to think oh well he I 10x my money on month one this guy's already paid for himself for almost the whole year no they're going to think well I got a good return last month and I got a crap return this month and so I'm going to cancel it's about what have you done for me lately it's about what have you done in the lookback window between billing Cycles the reason that this frequency piece that I was mentioning earlier is so important is it
(13:13) extends the look back period and so if I paid $5,000 a year to be a part of an association and then it comes up to Bill a year later that I might think to myself huh I look back over a year and say did I make more than $5,000 now that 10x month is going to be including uded and the 1X month and the next month that was a 3X and the next month that's a 1x the next month that's a 15x all of those months are going to be included and I'm going to be like wow this is a banging deal right and so for that reason extending the look back window gives you a higher likelihood that people are
(13:44) going to renew and we already see that it's five times more likely that people Renew on an annual basis now you can make also the argument someone who can pay a fee up front can also afford to do it so they're not just scrimping by to try and barely afford whatever the services and so there's probably a number of reasons that annual does better than monthly or quarterly but for me as a consumer I think to myself I think about what's this look back window and I want it to be as long as humanely possible for someone to logically say this makes sense for me okay so from
(14:15) there I have made a number of conclusions for myself that I'd like for you to consider oops that you can consider for your business all right which is the difference this is kind of counter internet marketing culture which is originally you want to say you want to sell it for as much as you possibly can which I used to preach and I don't believe that as much anymore and I actually would much rather pitch something that I know they're going to continue to pay for right and so I spent the first part of my career trying to
(14:48) obsess about what gets people to stick how do I get people to pay again and again and again and where I have switched to in my career is I just look for things that people already don't cancel from and then I just try and sell those and so if I could do it all over again I would only focus exclusively on things that people already don't cancel so if you look at alarm systems and insurance and payment processing and Banking and other things like that you're going to find things that people in general don't cancel or switch from cable right like people don't switch from these things uh cell phone service
(15:21) like these are things that people don't really switch of very often on the flip side gym memberships are something that people cancel all the time and that's a structural thing people don't want to work out but people do need insurance people do need to watch television people do need to use their phones even more and so I would take all of my emphasis and say why don't I just get into the right boat that I already know has really long LTV um and so that's something that I've just learned in time now now the other piece is I would strongly emphasize the point that I was making earlier about looking at quarter
(15:53) annual and monthly is that I would rather take less money on an annual billing and converted the same percentage so it's like if it's 12K for a year versus 5K paid up front for a year I'd rather have the five because I know that my annual my renewal rate will be much higher so let's let's finish out this uh this little this little equation here so here if this $5,000 is what I'm asking for someone to pay for a year and we have this look back a year later believe it or not remember we have 2% a lot of times this means you're going to keep 80 0% or more of the
(16:31) customers and so all of a sudden wait a second remember we had 2% monthly churn but this is a 5K thing well that means that this price point would be 5,000 / 12 can youone do that math for me that's 600 bucks a month 500 600 bucks a month 500 bucks a month 465 46 416 okay so 416 all right and then we multiplied this guy by 50 because it's 2% churn right which means they have uh what is that that's going to be 20,000 something all right don't worry it's 2% churn there we go so this is 2% which is equal this times 50 same thing equals uh
(17:20) 20,800 all right the reason this is so important the reason this is so important is that look at the difference between this 20,000 and this 4 or 5,000 that we have here now this means that a year from now you're going to have 80 out of the 100 people still paying you and then they renew again and guess what if you keep selling at this rate that means that you get all of last year's sales to stack on top of this year's sales and guess what happens in the third year you have last year's the year before and this year's that stack on top of each other and so
(17:49) this is what creates a compounding business and the vast majority vast vast majority of small businesses do not understand this and the reason that they stay poor is because they think that the only way that they can grow their business is to increase the number of customers that they're selling every month and that simply is a very terrible way to live because the moment your acquisition Channel your your YouTube channel gets shut down your Facebook ad account gets shut down you've got some sort of deliver deliverability issue on your domains if you're doing Outreach
(18:20) right there's always something that can happen and unless you have customers that plan on continuing to pay you over and over again it means your business dies immediately that's not a very valuable business it's also one that's hard to sleep with at night and so the idea is you want to find stuff that people don't stop buying you want to sell the crap out of it you want to sell it at a price point that you know they're going to continue to pay you want to extend the look back window as much as you possibly can so it increases
(18:44) the likelihood that they're going to convert and you also have a bidirectional relationship between the price and the conversion rate and so maybe you do get more people to buy at $11,000 down than you do at 5 grand upfront but on the flip side $5,000 is less than $12,000 for the year and so you're going to have two forces that are going to be working against each other now for me personally I would rather have the much higher quality customer that's going to be in the most optimized billing cycle and if I do think about
(19:11) this with my thinking hat maybe I either do the big head long tail which is if I know my thing isn't tremendously valuable then I might say my one time upfront that offsets my cost to acquire customers and then I have a very small monthly billing after that that has a big price to Value discrepancy on based on the consumable value of my service or thing or I know that my value is high and it is high on a recurring basis but it's volatile meaning some months it's big some months it's not big this is particularly true of things like ads or
(19:40) organic like if you have something that goes you know viral one month that's going to make a lot of money for them if it doesn't go viral the next month and it doesn't now some of these things you can't control and so by having an extended look back window it increases the likely that something good happens during that time period it increases like that they will build again in the future and so the tldr for you number one one separate out one time versus consumable value and then if you can do that you can switch to the big head longtail pricing model which is one time up front and then small recurring the
(20:14) alternative is that you can consider increasing the look back window right between when people see value and when they get value there's our little eyeball looking back money and so what we can do is trying to switch to annual to the best degree possible and billing based on what you think someone is going to continue to pay for what they're going to pay for on their worst month rather than what you can as much as you can get them to say yes to today and this is something that I've switched to over time the third thing is making sure that you're in the right boat and when I say that what I mean is
(20:44) instead of trying to obsess about getting people to buy more times go to stuff that people already don't cancel and you'll be amazed at how much easier it is to do business and how those things stack on top of one another by the way if you're wondering why my eyes look back and forth between things it's cuz I have three things I'm looking at one is I have a bunch of notes cuz I do prepare these for you guys cuz I don't want to just like be off the cuff and just rambling uh second is that I do these uh with Instagram lives and so those are on a separate camera than the
(21:14) YouTube camera and I try to look at the YouTube camera but I also have a hard time not looking at the audience that's onagram live and so if you see my eyes darting back and forth that's why so now we'll transition to questions from the audience the question is one is how do I know how to raise my price because of things like inflation and how do I just raise my price in general if I've been in business for a period of time all right so those are two separate questions I'll answer each to them individually so from an inflation perspective uh every continuity contract
(21:38) I would include a clause that says that you can match the CPI or the you know consumer price index that allows you to map up uh the price with inflation that's up to you now having that Clause doesn't mean necessarily mean that you have to always do it every month or every year but it means every two or three years you can just update your pricing accordingly people don't like pricing changes and so uh I would do it less frequently rather than more frequently uh so that's number one in terms of inflation in terms of thinking about one to raise prices in general uh
(22:09) I encourage everyone to continue to raise prices until your conversion rate times price equal less money meaning if I can sell now again this doesn't take into effect uh into account uh hard costs all right so I'm just going to assume that the cost of our thing is zero let's say it's a it's a digital media thing just for sake of simplicity so if I can sell if I get on the phone with with 100 people and I can sell 10 people at $10,000 uh I have a you know 10% conversion rate which means I make $100,000 from $100 from 100 calls that's
(22:38) 1,000 bucks a call now if I can all of a sudden get to 30% uh close rate with a $5,000 thing then it means that I make $150,000 on those 100 calls and so then I would make 1,500 bucks per call and so I try and level out the uh cost per or Revenue per uh phone call or conversation so that I can understand What's the total amount of money that I'm making so it's not necessarily about raising prices or lowering prices it's about what is the total absolute amount of gross profit you can maximize and so this is a math problem not a Alex what should I price it at problem and I will tell you exactly what we do with every
(23:15) company which is we just [ __ ] test the price and so we get on the phone and we say and I will say this it's way easier to go low to high than high to low all right and so if you if you sell at a price that's more expensive over time that works out okay if you if you go the other direction it can kind of suck and so um I think going up because think about it you're like yeah well that's what I was selling at last month we have more demand now we're better at our stuff like it makes sense like if you bought a Apple stock at 10 and now it's 20 like you're not going to be
(23:42) upset like in time prices change now the flip side is when prices come down uh if you if you are in that position then the reason behind it would be useful to tell the other people but usually you're going to have to downgrade those people if they're still in your business uh because if you did figure out some technological thing which would be probably your big reason why if like hey we figured out how to make this more efficient so we can lower the price we pass the savings on to you uh then you have to pass the savings on to them uh otherwise if you sold someone last month at 20K and this month at 10K very tough
(24:11) if it's for the same thing uh and so that's why I like starting low and then raising it and then usually at the very end I'm going to have to do tiny little adjustment of like okay I I realized I went over the hump of maximizing my profit and so then I back step and then I refund these people the difference where I give them a bonus in practice most businesses will have a monthly and an either or quarterly or annual it's usually not one or the other and you'll probably know your avatar uh if if if if prepaying 12 months at a time is too uh
(24:40) arduous for them uh then it might it might be better to just have quarterly billing um as the primary way and I would say that as I'm as I'm explaining this right now you might be able to just get away with pure quarterly B billing and not have monthly or annual like you just do quarterly um and that might be a kind of a nice blend for a lot of people as like the Middle Ground um but it's very typical to have monthly at this rate annual at 16% less because it's uh you know buy 10 get two free um and by doing that though if you get people onto that annual remember you're giving them
(25:12) a 16% discount but the likel that those people recur and the LTV on those people still might be 10 time uh five times higher than these people so you take a 5x increase in LTV and then apply the 16% discount to the fact it's a lower price and then you'll get probably something closer to a you know 4 and 1/2x so it's still worth having that quote discount for the annual rate if you want to incentivize people to go to the annual first off you have the discount so that's you know thing one um and I like to associate as many benefits
(25:41) assumably possible immediately for making the decision and so I want bad things I take away so discounts would be a pricing thing that I a bad thing I take away and then I also want to add good things so it's like um if I had a call it a call it a customer appreciation thing or I had uh I had specific times or sessions that only VIP customers so basically consider it like you even name it something so it's like you have your standard and your VIP even if it's the same pricing you'll get way more people to take it because they want the status Associated and then VIP get
(26:11) these other three benefits it's like they don't have to wait in line they can get the session times they want or we have a special Saturday session or Sunday session that's only for VIP and they get you know Tow Service whatever you just think about anything that's VIP two or three things that ideally give them status in the community for for being a VIP which you have now associated with the annual billing which has the highest stick rate so not only you providing more value to these people they pay a little bit less and they get the status and that's okay because they pay four and a half times more over
(26:41) Lifetime and so this is how you stack as much as you can in the annual uh so that you can just make a lot more money and the other really big benefit that I didn't hit on at all in the video that I should have is that annual if you do increase the conversion percentage there in in a real way you're frontloading a year of Revenue meaning your ability to offset the cost to acquire Customer skyrockets because you get so much more cash collected up front so you can get really aggressive in the acquisition even if you have a small like let's say you convert half as many into the annual
(27:10) billing it's like okay well I get half as many but I get 10 times The Upfront cash so I still get 5x upfront cash as I did before into monthly and so if that's the case then I'm still crushing it the question is is it better to Bill upfront versus bill monthly and get the contract because then with that in theory the contract plus the lower rate would convert a higher percentage people and it would extend the LTV so I'm going to give a two-part answer to this number one is the contract that you lock someone in on is only worth the quality
(27:40) of the signature on the contract meaning the person or the prospect who buys it is their creditworthiness that matters now for example in Europe uh contracts matter a lot more and people actually adhere to them like it's there's not a really big you know churn rate on people saying that they don't make they don't with their commitments in the US it's just a different culture in terms of how credit and contracts work like people get out of and cancel contracts or ghost or cancel their credit cards all the time and this is because visa and
(28:10) MasterCard and those companies have become a very Pro consumer uh basically uh cover for people to not stick with their commitments because they will always side with the consumer on chargebacks and refunds and so it allows people to make purchases without consequences and so I like the people where contracts matter is like Enterprise customers if you have a massive company that you're doing business with contracts matter if you're dealing with like consumers contracts don't mean anything and if you look at the biggest companies that deal with consumers the vast majority of them
(28:41) don't even bother doing contracts because what ends up happening is that PE it let me say it this way it will decrease sales to such a larger extent that just billing month-to month and then focusing on improving the quality of the thing you have because at the end of the day if the contract doesn't matter either way all the does is decrease sales because people Factor it in to their purchase but they don't Factor it into their cancellation and so it's like you increase friction on the front end but you don't decrease friction on the back end now in general
(29:10) will someone who signs a contract stay longer than someone who is month-to month yes but the question is what's the trade-off on conversion and is it worth it versus taking all that effort and putting it into how do I improve the the quality of the prospect uh product um how do I in improve the quality of the prospect as well in terms of targeting and messaging but the big one is is there a way that I can just pick something that people already don't cancel the question was is there a way to extend the lookback period beyond the billing cycle meaning
(29:40) can you accumulate saving you know time saving if you had a software or money made if you had an agency or anything to that degree or you know pounds lost if you did weight loss whatever you know marriage is saved you know fights avoided if you're in marriage counseling whatever um I think that the the the the best thought process that I would have around this is yes I would try and report that data on a cumulative basis as much as humanly possible because then it allows me to at least try try and price or at least display my value
(30:10) relative to price on a longer time rizon like hey uh you know we have brought you 35,000 you know clicks to your website over the last 6 months now it doesn't like it might look like this in terms of the volatility it might be up and down but if you look back cumulatively relative to what you paid it's still you know a great deal and so I think that is where customer success and having some you know Tech and how you're reporting and how you have those conversation with the customer is super important in terms of framing so I think there are huge benefits to trying to show the
(30:42) cumulative uh increase but just being really real most people don't care that much so I think it might lift you a few points but the big big is they're still going to think well you know you build me last month and this month I only got one X and it's not worth it for example if you look at instacart they say we saved you this many hours of going shopping and driving or whatever and so it is over the duration of the time that you've had instacart they will show you what your savings are not what I saved you this month hey if you like this more mathematical approach to business by the
(31:13) way this is how I actually do business that's not the YouTube version and the reason that these videos will always get fewer views is because it's actually for business owners uh that being said one of my favorite videos that I've ever made uh is seven equations that will make you money uh it is fours business owners that want to make money you have to know these equations I do them in every business that I invest in like watch it memorize like you should know these like they you should know them like the back of your hand you shouldn't just like memorize them like you should understand them uh because that's how you will ultimately make a lot more
(31:44) money in your business by looking at it like an investor and investing accordingly

Transcript:
(00:00) There's four ways to buy anything and I'll show you one unique way that's what actually got me this building. And so let me walk you through it. You've got what I would consider past money. So that would be savings. So that's earnings that you had in the past and that's money that you put away. The next money is you have income money.
(00:18) So this is the money that you make every single month. You can spend this money rather than touching your savings. This makes sense. Then you've got debt money which is basically future earnings. like this is money I'm gonna take debt and I'm gonna pay with future money, right? And I'm gonna have to pay this debt off.
(00:35) And then finally is the category that I like to have, which is, and I'll call it new money. Now, you're like, what does that even mean? That's what I'll explain. So, I've noticed amongst the friends that I have that are the best with money, that they're wealthiest with money, they they're okay buying things that are bit grandiose, right? Now, some of them buy big houses.
(00:55) Some of them make buy big cars and buy big yachts, big build big buildings, whatever it is, right? And I had a business owner who came here and he was like, "Hey, I'm choosing between two offices. I've got basically a sensible office and I've got a much bigger office that I'm really excited about." He said, "Which one do you think I should take?" And I said, "Which one do you want?" And he said, "The big one.
(01:12) " And this guy was a very good salesman. And I said, "Okay, here's the deal. You can buy the big one. It was two and a half times the size um or at least two and a half times the price and it was a little bit nicer, whatever." I said, 'But the deal is you got to pay it off in a year. He was like, I can do that. And I was like, right, then don't worry about it.
(01:30) And so the thing is is that I would say these are kind of almost like different personality types in terms of where people are taking the money from. Now, the reason that I bring up this building being a significant purchase is it was less that the price was a significant purchase and more so that I didn't need this building at the time. I just wanted to have a place to have a home gym that would be more than like it' be like a commercial gym.
(01:51) And I wanted to have place for meetups and things like that. And I could come up with a rational explanation that between all the portfolio companies, we were spending about $4 million a year in event spaces. And I was like, well, if I had a big enough space for all of them to do their their internal meetings, their quarterlys, fly out their staff and their team, and have a venue, then I could probably save that and it would pay for the building.
(02:10) But I remember Leila was like, "Hey, you know, we should maybe maybe we should just get like a 5,000 foot building." So, this building's about 36,000 ft², much bigger. And I remember hearing this and I was like, I mean, that's appropriately sized for where we're at now, but it's not the size building that I would want it to be for where I want to go.
(02:30) And so, I remember telling her, I said, I promise if we buy this building, I will make sure that it makes us more money than it has cost us. And I would say that a behavior that has served me extraordinarily well is looking at new money. Meaning, if I buy this building, can I find something that will pay off the building? Now, of course, I had the expenses on on the portfolio side.
(02:49) We could have just saved the $4 million a year that we spend in venues and all that stuff. Sure. But I was like, is I'll bet you there's something that we can do with our existing resources, and this is the key part, is that it's sawdust money. It's money using your existing resources that you're currently underutilizing to generate new money for a specific project.
(03:11) And so my favorite way of doing this is like if hey if Daniel wants to buy a boat or wants to buy a car, I love the idea of him being like so I'm just going to work one extra day per week over the next year and then I'm going to buy it. The richest people I know, that is the behavior that they typically use.
(03:30) I want this thing and so I'm going to go make the money to buy the thing. I'm not going to use my existing income. I'm not going to use my existing resources. I'm not going to use my savings to buy it. I'm not going to go into debt unless I know that I'm going to pay it off within a year and I have no prepayment penalty and I have a clear plan of how I'm going to do it.
(03:45) They have a clear plan of how they're going to make the money in a very defined time period. And it's from doing above and beyond. It's looking at all the stuff you got. And the reason that I like this is I was talking to a good friend of mine, Chiron Cervatza. He's a president of Real uh actually just became a board member, excuse me.
(04:05) And he said, "Oh," he said, "you just want to write yourself a swimming pool." And I was like, "What does that mean?" He so he said, "So Paul McCartney, uh, the Beatles used to say he wanted a swimming pool." And, uh, everyone's like, "Well, what do you like, how are you going to pay for it?" Now, obviously, he has the money for a swimming pool, but he didn't want to use his savings.
(04:24) He didn't want to use his income and his royalties. He didn't want to go into debt for it. And so, what'd he do? He was like, "I'm just going to go write a song." And so he writes a song and he writes himself a swimming pool from the money that he collects from selling the song, right? And so I think about this a lot because I think it's it's a different way of thinking about money.
(04:42) It's like I'm going to I want this thing and so I don't want to limit my that thing. If anything, I want to use that thing to motivate me to find other resources. So what I'm being is resourceful rather than draining resources I have. I'm finding new resources by utilizing existing assets um that are currently under my control.
(04:59) And so this is fundamentally like people were like, "Well, you know, you could Airbnb one of the rooms out." And like, "Okay, that's one of the things I'm going to do, but I also have some time." So I was like, "Maybe I'll drive Uber." There was one of my favorite customers ever at my gym. She was a mom of four, single mom.
(05:11) She didn't have the money for the gym membership. And she was like, "Well, I could drive I could drive Uber one day a week and that I would be able to afford it." And I was like, "Great, then do that." And so that's what she did. And she was one of my longest standing members, lost 100 pounds. And it's like there's a there's a shift that happens when you decide to do it that And I think there's something to be said about creating a vacuum, about creating space.
(05:32) I've heard the saying like make yourself poor, right? Of the idea of like how do I how do I create this deprivation? How do I create this this threshold that all of a sudden increases my my my demand for money, right? Because everybody has a demand for money. Like you have a certain lifestyle that you have grown accustomed to.
(05:51) And so that's your minimum threshold. That's your minimum requirement for for living. The real wealth comes from being able to continue to jack this up while keeping this low, of course. But in those instances when you do want to buy the sweet ride, because I'm not like people think of me in as an aesthetic, and I am to a large degree, but if I want to buy a sick ass home gym, which I do have, I would rather that money come from new stuff.
(06:16) either you can do extra stuff to get the thing or I think the 2011 version of this is how do I use the thing to make even more money. And so part of the reason we spun up the advisory services was actually like me fulfilling a promise to Leila of like okay we'll find a way to use the building uh to generate income to cover the building because I do want to have this sick home gym which will be a complete and other waste of space.
(06:37) Um besides the fact that I think it's dope and why have money if you can't spend it and you can't take it with you anyways. And so this may seem like a a wild departure from some of the content that I make, but this is obviously targeted at someone who probably has a little bit more is a little bit further along.
(06:50) All right, if you are broke, don't do that. If you're broke, just focus on the new money stuff, right? But if you have some, I think that you stay ahead of your spending by not increasing your lifestyle relative to your income, but by increasing the new money relative to the new purchase, which typically are defined.
(07:08) And so it doesn't have to be forever. So if you're like, well, I don't want to work overtime all the time. Fine. then you can just work overtime for a year, work overtime for six months, work overtime for a month so that you can afford the thing. And I think it's always when you think about it like that is I have to take I have to add this on top.
(07:21) I don't I don't touch my flows, right? I don't touch my income flow and I don't want to create a liability with the debt and savings is like that's my nut, right? I don't want to I don't want to, you know, use up my my nest egg, right? So, I got to go make it. And it this has just been this behavior that I've observed from the people that I know that are the wealthiest and the people who enjoy their money the most.
(07:41) And I think that's the thing is like it's one thing to have money because I I know plenty of people who who obviously have money, but some of them I don't think they enjoy their money and it's because they're always it's it's like they're like afraid and there's some of this whole idea of like you have to be abundant and all that stuff.
(07:55) I know tons of people who are super scarcity mindset and have a lot of money because they just don't like spending it. And so like there's something to be said for that. But that's if you make money the goal. And if you do make money the goal, then by all means, don't spend it because then money is the goal. So fine. But if money isn't your goal, then the people that I've seen that are the happiest that I think spend money well.
(08:10) They use money like a tool is they use an expense or use something that they know they're going to consume. They know it's not a good investment and they say, "Fine, I know it's not a good investment, so I'm not going to use my income to buy it. I'm going to use something that I already have that I'm underutilizing, which might be just your time.
(08:27) You might take on a new client project. You might take on some one-on-one services that you wouldn't normally take on, right? Those types of things can be defined period because you're like, well, it's not going to increase the enterprise value of the business. It's not going to be some sellable asset, but I do want this thing and I don't want to touch how my existing infrastructure functions.
(08:42) It's just one behavior. And I think many of you like if you're like me, like I don't like I don't like spending money. And I've tried to learn my way out of it, which is I don't like spending money that's like my main money. It's like my core money. It's the money comes in from businesses, distributions.
(08:58) That's my main thing. But if I want to buy something crazy, then I've just got to be willing to do something crazy for it. And the weirdest thing happens is that I get almost more excited about making that money than the money that I make every single day because I know that that money is going to towards this specific thing.
(09:14) So I'm like, I'm I'm building a home gym right now. I'm buying equipment right now. Like that's my as I'm doing this, I'm almost like more joyful about doing the work because I know exactly what it's going towards. And so just a little behavior that I picked up over the years, something that I've observed in other people that I've used myself that has been wildly valuable.
(09:31) And if you have that, you know, if you've got two machines that you could buy for your business, you know, and one's a little bit sweeter than the other, and you can't really justify the expense, then just take the Delta, be like, I'm going to go make that myself because I think it's sicker. And I have never been disappointed about doing that.
(09:44) Not once have I done that and been like, this was a mistake. And the thing is is that I've bought plenty of things that I that I I thought were expensive, right? But I can minimize my regret by saying I'm not using money that I otherwise would want to use somewhere else. And so that's my little money behavior that has served me very well and I hope it serves you well.

(00:00) Your speed of decision-m is prayed on how clearly you can think. I wanted to make this because I had a really good conversation last week with an entrepreneur and something came up that I know affects all of us. The entrepreneur was dealing with kind of a rock and a hard place decision, right? There's two two paths you could do and apparently there's a cost on either side.
(00:21) I thought this was such an interesting thing because most of the biggest decisions in life are scary because you've already made all the easy decisions that you can make. The only way to make a hard decision an easy decision is to let life make it for you, which is what the vast majority of people do. The things that are obvious and not risky, you have already done.
(00:38) What's left are the things that are obvious and risky. These types of decisions involve tradeoffs. What you're trading is being stuck for either getting better or getting worse, but you're making a trade and you're hoping that obviously it gets better. This guy was relatively new to business. He'd been doing business for called 18 months.
(00:57) One of the things that was a real issue for him is that he was attracting a lot of beginners. The problem was 80% of his revenue was coming from a different set of customers that he didn't like as much that wasn't as good for the business. What is the apparent conflict, right? What's the apparent trade-off that he has to make here? If we want to get these customers, it means we have to start saying no to these other ones.
(01:14) But if I say no to these other ones, my revenue is going to go down. So, what do I do? What most people do is they just stay there forever and that's it. Like, they just stay stuck and they just do this. They look back six years later and nothing has changed in their life because they changed nothing. With this individual, I said, "Hey, there's a number of things we have to do.
(01:30) " One of them is we have to change your ads so that we start messaging the right type of prospect. If you can't say, "Hey, tired of your job." It's like that's going to attract people with jobs who are tired of their jobs. If you're frustrated with your business, then you're going to have different concerns.
(01:43) And so, he wanted to be going after business owners, not consumers. And so, I was like, "All right, we have to talk in that language." Now, the second thing is he had a book about how he quit his job. I was like, if you're going to write a book, it should be about your business, not your job because then you will get people with businesses.
(01:55) So, you had to change the lead magnet. Now, the third thing is it's like, okay, well, you can't also just sell your existing price point because it won't make sense because the cost of getting a business owner compared to get cost of end consumer might be 5x or 10 times more than that. So, we have to make sure the economics of the business work.
(02:07) Now, if you're thinking about this, you're like, "Wow, there's a lot of changes." It's like, "Yeah, he's got to make the trade." Now, the alternative to that trade is that he's just dissatisfied. When I actually spell out both sides, I'm like, "Well, shoot. How can I make today feel worse so that tomorrow feels better? And that's what ultimately gets me to make those jumps.
(02:23) And I would love to tell you that the big decisions in my life I made because I had this big passion pool, this massive vision in front of me. But the reality is most of the time it was because my present became so painful for me that I was like anything is better than this. Even if all of us rewind the clock and think about when we started entrepreneurship, right? Like you take the leap because you want more freedom and to make more money.
(02:44) But neither of those happen right away. It's kind of one of those like in order to have an investment payoff, your bank account must go down before it comes up. When you lift weights, your muscles don't get bigger. They get smaller and then bigger. You supercompensate. There's usually a step back that must be taken in order to take steps forward.
(03:00) The only guaranteed thing is that if you never take that step back, you will never get the outsized return of taking the steps forward. I think about this because there's so many hard decisions in business. Of course, advertise more. Yeah, do we'll do that, but that's not super high risk.
(03:14) Where do these risky decisions come up? It's when you've made all the easy choices. So, if you're like, "Okay, well, I I need to get better people." Okay, we can't just wish for it. So, we need to start adding friction into our process, right? We need to start disqualifying customers and we have to start qualifying our avatar to the same degree.
(03:31) If we want to raise price because we're like, you know what? I don't have enough good people in my business. It might be a pricing issue. Hear me out. Let's say that you have more demand than you can handle and you've got a team that's spread thin and you're thinking, "Okay, I need to increase my team because I have this demand, but I can't increase my team because I don't have the money to do it.
(03:52) " D what's the problem? Well, you've got to step one, raise your price. If you're supply constrained, you've got more than you can handle, then we can decrease how much is coming in by raising price. By raising price, what's the next thing that happens? Well, now we have more cash flow because we raised the price. for making more for the same thing that we were doing before.
(04:07) That cash flow does what? It allows you to pay and advertise higher compensation so you can attract the talent you need to get people in so that you can no longer be supply constrained. And so usually there's two or three order consequences that have to happen. Now each of those have quote risk, but the alternative is what? You stay there. You stay stuck.
(04:25) You're going to spend money knowing that the ROI will go down and you'll make more money. So I'll give you an example. So, a lot of business owners, especially on the smaller side, when they're starting out, maybe they're, you know, a hundred bucks a day, $1,000 a day, $5,000 a day.
(04:40) They get to this arbitrary price point of what they're spending on advertising, and they're like, I can't spend beyond that. And the reality is that usually the return goes down in terms of relative return, but their absolute return goes up. So, let me say it differently. If someone said, "Hey, if you give me $10,000, I can give you $100,000.
(05:00) " I'd be like, "Well, that's a great deal." I'm like, "Can I give you a million dollars at that?" And they're like, "Oh, no, no, no, no. If you give me a million dollars, I can only make you an extra million." And I'm like, "Wait a second. So, if I give you a million, you give me two million, so I make 1 million in profit. If I give you 10 grand, you make me a hundred grand.
(05:14) Which would you rather do? Don't think about this too long. You want to give the million so you get two million." Why? Because you made a million dollar in profit versus $90,000 in profit. Of course, it makes more sense to do that. But the thing is, the relative return will be lower. That little note that I just It's especially common in smaller businesses.
(05:30) I used to work with I mean obviously with gyms right would happen a lot of times is a gym owner would cap their spend right so I'll give you how this would work so let's say that in order for them to cover all the cost in the gym they need to sign up x number of members per month what they would do is spend as little as possible to get those x members and then be like okay I broke even but I can't spend more money because I'm breaking even it's like dude you have to spend more money because you're getting to break even on that spend end everything
(06:01) above that is the gravy. But people because they downregulate their goals based on the difficulty of achieving them from a very tactical perspective, something that has given me such outsized returns in my life is actually spelling out the trade. Spell out the trade. I talked to a lady last week who had a bunch of businesses and so she had five different businesses she was running and she was doing like a million or $2 million a year, whatever.
(06:23) When I talked to her about it, she's like, you know, the problem is like I can grow things but I get really bored really quickly. And I was like, "Okay, well, first off, there's nothing wrong with that." And I super mean this because I'm not the should guy. I'm not the you should do this, you should do that. Do whatever the hell you want.
(06:38) There are certain paths that are better for optimizing for specific outcomes. And so, a lot of people don't even know what outcome they're optimizing towards. If you just have make more money as the goal, guess what? Very hard to focus with that because everything makes more money. You get super spread thin because everything you can make a logical argument makes more money.
(06:56) but it won't make you the most money because the most money is going to come from focus. Now, when I spelled out the trade-off for this lady, I said, "Listen, option A, you keep doing what you're doing." And you say, "I prefer more novelty in my life." And I'd be like, "That's amazing. Just understand that the trade is you're not going to build something super big, and that's okay.
(07:16) You have to really want to build something really big. And if you really want to build something big, the trade-off is you don't get the novelty in your life. So, which one would you prefer?" And that's what it comes down to. And if you're like, you know what, I would rather have this big outcome than the novelty, then great. Then you know what you're paying for when you have those moments of boredom, what you're getting for it, you know the trade you're making.
(07:37) Now, part of the difficulty of these trade-offs is that what do you think she gets immediately? Novelty. What do you think she gets at a delay? The big business. And so, she has to pay the price of boredom today to get the big business she ultimately wants. or she doesn't have to pay. Well, the price she pays is that she doesn't get the big business today.
(07:56) But in both instances, she doesn't get the big business. But in one of them, she gets the benefit of the ADD, of the squirrel brain, right, of monkey mind, of trying all these different things, tasting all this different stuff. And again, I want to be clear, do whatever you want. But I only say this from my own experience of you will limit yourself by spreading yourself too thin.
(08:15) And here's the real kicker, and this one's nasty. The better you are in general, the more capable, more able, the more potent you are as a human being, the more things you can multitask and do decently well at, you're still giving up the aggregate upside, which is almost always 10 times bigger than your current spread thin version.
(08:35) And that sounds like a crazy number, but like I went from a couple million bucks a year, again, this is rough numbers, I don't remember the exact ones, of when I had nine different things that were going on. And I have my launch business, agency 1, agency 2, one for chiropractor, one for dentist, and I have my six locations, lot of different businesses, one CEO.
(08:50) And I'm like, I'm a big CEO. As soon as I just consolidated all of that into one, I basically 10xed how much I was making roughly. And the thing is, I've seen this pattern. The problem is people aren't willing to prune the garden. There we go. Prune the tree, right? They're not willing to cut the branches off to let the whole thing grow.
(09:06) Back to the original owner that I I was talking about at the very beginning, when I had my conversation with him, it became clear that this is what he ultimately wanted to have. And so when I've been able to convince business owners to do the thing they ultimately want to do, it's just spelling out what my trade is. Know that when you have hard decisions in front of you, there's nothing wrong with that.
(09:22) It means if anything, you've picked all the easy paths. You've already cut the lowhanging fruit off. You've already made the easy ones that have almost no trade-off or the trade-offs are so obvious or benign that you're like, obviously I'll make the trade. But what happens later is you get to real irreversible decisions.
(09:36) You have or rather difficult to reverse decisions. At that point, you have to put your big boy pants on and say, "I got to make a trade." Because the only thing that is guaranteed is that if you want everything from life, you will get nothing. That is my little message of the day. The hard choices that you have are hard because you've used up all your easy decisions already.
(09:52) And wishing that they were easier does not make them easier. And you've got to pick and you've got to live with the consequences. And I will say this, the more irreversible decisions you make, the better you get at making them. But you got to start. So that's it. Rock and roll. Appreciate you. Taco Tuesday. I don't know what that means, but just go for it.

13 Ways to DESTROY Your Competition (Legally) - YouTube
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lc8DNduiwKA

Transcript:
(00:00) the first way to legally destroy your competition by the way I'll explain there's 13 is Network effects so you can have different types of network effects the first type is a customer base so that's having a large very established user base that by the nature of it being large attracts even more people to the network so if it's just you that's not a network if it's you and two other people all of a sudden people are like I want to join that group but when you have that fourth really good person now a
(00:25) fifth wants to come in and as every additional person gets added that Network becomes more valuable and so if you're like how does this actually work in the real world I'll give you two very different examples so one is you can think of Facebook right social platforms so a platform isn't valuable until lots of people are on it but once lots of people are on it well no one wants to join the small platform because there's no one's on it but if everyone's on this one then they can instantly connect with more people now in a very different
(00:49) version of that in the hardware world is telecommunications companies you look at Verizon you look at AT&T as they were racing to create their monopolies which they more or less have and I'll explain what that word means in a second they were offering all these benefits for people joining in in families and free texting between people who are on the same network as them so that they could encourage more people to be on those networks and then there were advantages of being inside of it now a customer base is the first type of network effect a different type of network effect is a product ecosystem so think of something like apple right they
(01:21) have all these unique plugs and all these unique softwares and operating systems that only work on Apple products and once you buy one Apple product or two Apple products all of a sudden you don't want to mix and match PC and Android and all this stuff into your world of technology and so they create a closed loop system where everything works with itself and if your product is good enough that you can get people iPhones then you can get millions and millions of users to then just buy all these other core products that they have
(01:51) less Affinity less Affinity towards and then force them to use all of your products because of One champion product that everyone has and so sometimes if you're thinking about this for your own business it's like okay one is there a way that I can structure what I have so if more people enter my network from a customer base it adds value to every other business every other customer so the opposite of this is a traditional service business usually if you're one-onone with a client you provide value as soon as you're one on two then
(02:20) it provides less value and so most businesses are structured to deterior rate as more customers come in versus things like a buyer group so if you have 20 dentists who get together and say hey we're going to all buy together because we're going to get cheaper prices then as more dentists come into that Association you get more and more buying power and then you become a greater and greater Monopoly and have more leverage over your potential vendors right and so you can think about incorporating these elements into your business to make the business more competitive and harder for
(02:55) anybody else to disrupt you and this competitive Advantage is so valuable that tech companies these massive behemoths are willing to lose billions of dollars to establish this network because they know that once they've mapped an ecosystem then they can profit in all sorts of ways the second way to destroy your competition is exclusive control over a resource or technology so let me give you example of resource so possessing exclusive rights to essential resources or materials that are crucial for production for some Goods right so like the deers Group which is a big
(03:27) diamond group historically has controlled a huge portion of the diamond market and by doing that they made able control supply and demand and since they own most of the mines and the distribution they can basically set the prices because supply and demand exists and so believe it or not there's more diamonds there are dishwashers in the United States but they're valued more because they control Supply to keep the prices high and this is a huge advantage to them imagine if all those diamonds got released and they were what they really are which is not nearly as rare
(03:56) as sapphires emeralds and rubies are but how amazing would it be to have this big stockpile of stuff that you got for almost nothing that you can sell for exorbitant amounts of money that's a competitive Advantage so you've got the natural world where you've got like diamonds or there's resources right but in the technological World you've got data and proprietary Tech so that would be patents or a huge amount of data that other people don't have access to and cannot replicate legally which creates a
(04:19) huge bear to entry so I'll give you an example that's really easy to understand so Google search will literally never be beaten at the keyboard inserted search I want to be clear because there's other things that can happen later right but search itself Google will always have more data because they started first and so if somebody starts today and can collect lots and lots of search data Google still has 20 years of experience and data on all of these users across the world and they can use all those algorithm refinements that they have that no one else has to continually make
(04:51) better models which is why even though open Ai and chat GPT have become a huge source of search in the world Google's still very much a threat even though they're quote behind on AI in that race they're still ahead on the data and if SL when Google makes its bigger play into AI they already have everywhere you've ever searched on Google Maps every email you've ever sent they have the stuff that you buy on the Android store and everything you search on your phone they have all of that data and so they're going to be able to personalize their AI better because I will make one
(05:22) bet which is it's the best AI that will win not necessarily the first one because as soon as you use a better one you'll immediately switch so I don't think that they're in some crazy rush I think what they want is better and in fact Google dominated search for so long that it became so apparent that they were something that the government calls a monopoly and so the government has tried for many years to try and break apart Google's Monopoly for search and Google is very good at defending itself with all the lawyers in the world and they've pretty much been able to just keep that Monopoly in place and so these
(05:55) competitive traits that I'm talking about for businesses you don't need to have all 13 that I'm going to talk about I want you to go through it and be like is there one of these that I can more directly weave in to the fabric of my business so that I develop a stronger and stronger competitive position over time rather than an eroding one so speaking of the government the third way to crush your competition is government regulations and Licensing so there's two types that matter most right now one is government grants the other is licensing requirements so government grants have
(06:26) usually exclusive rights from the government to operate in some sort of particular market so that's like utilities or public transportation and so things like Amtrak so Amtrak operates as a government granted Monopoly in the United States for rail service so they have exclusive rights to operate certain routes that literally no one's else is allowed to operate so talk about being able to like set your own prices now there's things that come with that but talk about like going out of business it's like well literally no one else is allowed to do business and as long as people want the transport method they're
(06:57) going to stay in business so this second is strict licensing requirements so basically you can operate so Amtrak has this type of service between states or you could do one service in a specific area or territory and so like utilities like Con Edison which is in New York has a strict mandate from the government to operate that area and so they have so anybody who wants to get in there has super high barriers to entry and just to give you context how viable this is Conan Edison's Revenue last year was about 16 billion so that's more than a billion a month and since we're in the
(07:29) great city of Los Vegas I think one of the big obvious ones is once you go through the regulatory process of getting a casino license it's basically a license to print money because they say that people can literally just hand you money with a low chance of winning the same thing for lotteries because they're so lucrative because you guarantee the odds that you win and the only thing you have to do is Market the lottery and when people have a chance to win for money for no work guess what people do it and so the government has to grant that and they have big taxes on those corporations because they know
(08:01) that they're going to make money and so I'll tell you a fun hormos family story uh but one of my relatives in Iran owned the national lottery and so he did very well until obviously the revolution overthrew it and then everything was confiscated for his family and many others like mine um but he owned the lottery and so he was allowed to come up with all sorts of promotions as long as he wrote a check to the government and so these things have occurred across different countries across borders and so sometimes Simply Having the knowledge
(08:36) of navigating the government regulations to get a grant or permission to do business in a certain way gives you a competitive Advantage even something on a smaller scale as simple in some of the hard States as getting a liquor license right if you have a liquor license you're able to sell liquor at huge margins right and so it becomes a huge profit Center in the business and so that's a small example but they all fundamentally are around the same effect now you might be like well how am I going to use the government stuff well some massive companies like Oracle
(09:04) they've been able to get that and I'll talk about their just way of destroying competition a second but the fourth way you can destroy one that anyone can use is economies of scale and so there's two different ways that you can attack this one is cost advantages and so basically you achieve a lower cost basis per unit sold through larger scale production and so that allows you to undercut prices and deter smaller competitors so it means other people who are smaller can't buy the volum that you can and so as a result can't price as low as you can and
(09:35) so this is a price based strategy as in you can still make a profit at a lower price than all of your competition and so this is a low cost leader strategy which typically is paired with economies of scale where you don't want to get into and this I want to make this a clear cautionary tale is that if you're getting into one of these markets there's no Advantage this is Dan Kennedy quote there's no advantage to be being the second cheapest player in the marketplace the cool thing with this strategy is that it gets better
(10:07) with time and so that's what you'll notice as a common theme which each of these points is that as you have a a greater Network or as you have a more robust ecosystem of products or you have larger economies of scale most businesses like I said degrade with scale they get worse and harder with scale whereas if you have one of these strategic advantages woven into the fabric of your business as you get bigger and the business becomes more complex you have another Force that's driving your competitors away so you have something that's very strong and
(10:37) working in your favor as you scale which is one of the key traits of becoming a very large business is having one of these thoughts into your DNA wov day one so for example my software company Allen we started scheduling appointments 100 appointments a day a th000 appointments a day we got up to four or 5,000 appointments a day and we still continue to do that in that company and so as we acquire more data and we send more messages we get economies of scale on literally messaging itself and so if somebody else wants to come in and we're sending millions of messages a day
(11:07) they're going to have to pay more per message than we do and so with that we know that we actually have increasing margins as we have more messages that go out in addition to the data that we have that no one else has and so that is a compounding advantage that makes it harder to compete if someone starts two years later than us and again any one of these competitive modes will be enough to build you a massive multi-billion dollar company and so you don't need more than one of these you just need to
(11:35) do one right all the way the fifth way to destroy competition is vertical integration now this is one of the sweethearts of private Equity because it's something that usually Capital can come in to do and this is something that we've done in multi of our portfolio companies which I'll talk about in a second so there's two kind of common ones that people have one is control over Supply and the other is distribution networks so control over Supply means that you own everything that is required from kind of click to
(12:00) close and so in the deers example I gave earlier they own the mines all the way to owning the front store right or Tesla right when Elon is building the cars he wants to get as close to the supply chain of like where do I get steel from all the way to the actual retailers which are just Tesla retailers that sell online to the customer so he vertically integrated the entire chain end to end and he was able to capture margin at every step and by doing that you can have a more profitable business and or sell products that are better than other people at lower prices because you can
(12:32) eat into your own margin and then put everyone else out of business and so there are multiple advantages to controlling your supply one is that you can control quality all the way through and everyone is aligned with the end user and the ultimate business at large the other piece is that you control disruption because if you have vendors that you rely on for key components of your products if those just those vendors go out of business then it threatens your business and so by controlling all of these things like controls kind of the opposite of risk in a lot of businesses if you control those
(13:02) elements then they are things that you can manipulate and adjust more proactively than being reliant on third parties so you not only capture the profit and have higher quality you also decrease the risk of the business so let me give you a 1.
(13:21) 0 example of how this would work so by being a self-publisher which I am instead of hiring a publisher to publish my books I take over a second portion of the business and so rather than relying on public Publishers to print and distribute the stuff that I have I print and distribute the books that I sell because I have the relationship with the customer you guys and I'm the one who wrote the book I didn't ghost write it out and I now can make sure that the the size of the book which is a little bit unique which I did on purpose because I want it to be like a kids book and very approachable those are all things that somebody else might
(13:50) not be willing to do now if I wanted to keep eating up the supply chain I would then go to buying the warehouses that do it rather than just simply using the warehouses that do the distribution and if I want to take another one I would buy the printing presses and if I would to take another chunk up the ladder it would be I would buy paper mills right and so you can keep vertically integrating until it's I own forests that I take to my paper mills to make paper and then they go to my warehouses where I distribute the books that go to my retail which is me fundamentally as
(14:21) the storefront that actually get the customers to purchase and so that would be a completely vertically integrated product line and if you think about there if you think about your products in that way then you think wow think about all the margin that's included in a book right so it goes from literally water and sunlight which is what it takes to to grow trees and time all the way to a quote influencer who has lots of Impressions and free media that can drive sales so you're you're basically selling free media with
(14:51) sunshine and water and that's where you have and everything in between is where all the middlemen take a slice and if you can eat all of that up you have all the control the sixth way to destroy your competition and my personal favorite is a strong brand identity and customer loyalty and the reason I like this one so much is that some of the other ones I mentioned sometimes they require a huge amount of time or a lot of complexity like government regulations um and some of them are just require a ton of capital right which if you're starting a business or you have a small business it might be harder to develop over time but this one is one
(15:19) that you can make with skill which is why I love it so much which with Brand Power you can build powerful associations and then your brand becomes synonymous with the product itself so for example Google is synonymous with search engines Kleenex for tissues Band-Aids for I don't even know what the actual name for Band-Aids is because it's so synonymous like tissue based I who even knows right and so the advantage when you have a strong brand like Nike is that you can simply take your logo put it on a commoditized
(15:47) product and get higher conversion rates lower cost you car customers at premium prices and so you get massive improvements to the business because fundamentally if you can price above your competition and increase the demand for what you have what a competitive advantage and the thing is is that you can simply build it with time and skill which is why I love it and anyone can build a brand if they know how to keep their promises and make associations clearly and deliberately over a long period of time with what their customers value and then strongly disassociate with the
(16:22) things and the people that their customers don't value until over time people just estab associate that value intrinsically with the brand itself and so me personally I've tried very hard to teach lots of business stuff to business owners because I believe that private Enterprise is the only way that we can save the world and so I want as many entrepreneurs getting as big a business as they possibly can to help the most customers and do it the right way so they can build businesses that last so that capitalism has a [ __ ] chance if
(16:53) you're a business owner and want to figure out which of these strategies is right for your business come out to a workshop we just started Ed running these at our headquarters here in Vegas at acquisition. comom and so if that's you you can go to acquisition. comom click scale and if you qualify maybe we'll see you here way to destroy your competitors number seven is strategic pricing and so you can think about this from a price discrimination perspective and from a predatory pricing perspective and I'm using the literal terms don't read into it so predatory pricing is basically temporarily low prices where
(17:22) your profits can Outlast selling at a loss so that no one else can enter the marketplace and the most classic example of this was Microsoft is any person who wanted to add a new feature to the micros to compete with Microsoft Suite they would immediately copy that put it into their bundle not raise the price and then that person fundamentally everybody who already had Microsoft just kept paying Microsoft and got that feature for free this is very very common in software where everyone's in a features War where they try and copy everyone else's stuff and give it away
(17:51) for the same price or free so for example a simple version of that is Instagram copied Snapchat stories made it Instagram stories and basically stalled uh Snapchat's growth as soon as they were able to do that right and so that's a version of it which is predatory pricing the other is price discrimination which is founded on selling different prices to different people so this is maximizing profit so someone walks in the door and you say hey how much money you got and they say a lot you say okay well these pairs of
(18:21) shoes are $200 and somebody else walks in the door and they say you say how much money you got they're like less than that guy and you're like all right well these shoes are $100 you sell the same product at two different prices to different people based on their spending power and so one of the classic examples of this is Airlines so they collect tons and tons of data on other users and so by the way if you have credit card points with an airline they know all you're spending by the way and by the
(18:45) way most Airlines make the majority of their money on the credit card systems and just use all of the airline stuff as the coolest benefits program to get people to use their cards if you didn't know that um fun fact they get 3% of all of what you spend on your credit card that's their income and so if you barely ever use your you know Southwest points but you spend $20,000 a year on your credit card they make $600 a year on you no matter what and so if you and somebody else are looking at the same flight with the same seat you might get
(19:16) displayed two very different prices based on what they know your spending power is and your need is and if you have that kind of competitive data compared to your competition then you can make more profit than they can and so regressing this down to a small business the way I think about this is being very clear on the one or two customer segments or avatars that you really serve and being able to segment those people so that you can sell to the right wallet right now so discriminatory pricing is literally selling the same thing at two different prices for
(19:45) different people I don't personally like this and so the way that I feel ethically okay about it is I like to tweak my offer just a little bit so that when I have the rich person I can add one thing like a free cocktail with their thing and charge a lot more for it but I can still ethically say these two things were different so if they ever do meet on the plane and say how much did you pay for your ticket how much did you pay for your ticket I can at least if they came to the owner be like hey why did I pay 200 this guy paid 160 and we
(20:09) bought in the same hour be like well you got a cocktail now the person might be like well if I had known I'd be like well they still were different right and so that at least gives me a little bit of you know stress fee sleep I'll put it that way and so having a couple tiny things that you can change about your offer this especially works well with Services allows you to price more aggressively to someone's spending power or need while ethically being able to sleep at night without saying that you sold the same thing for two different
(20:34) prices and as a fun bonus for this one is that pricing compared to all of the other things that I've talked about so far is one of the easiest levers to build and manipulate compared to government regulation or massive economies of scale like you can do this one much faster and you can do it on a smaller scale so number eight is exclusive contracts with three different parties so you can either have exclusive contracts that control Supply so no one else can get Supply so if I am Hershey's and I have a contract with the farmers
(21:04) group in Africa that gets the cocoa nibs that are required for chocolate then I make it very difficult for anybody else to get into the chocolate business unless they resell from me which means I'm still going to make a profit on their business the second way you can think about that is customers so government contracts is a classic example where if you get a contract like Lockheed Martin does for making fighter jets or whatever they make for the government for defense then the government is known to be able to to uh
(21:30) keep that contract and they're only going to have one for a specific need at a time and so once you lock that contract in no one else can really compete for that core service for years and then imagine 5 years later well you've already done this for 5 years is someone going to spin up a company that didn't make all that money in that meantime doesn't have all the relationships and then get the next contract probably not that's why companies like Oracle locky Martin are gazillion dollar companies because they basically just siphon off taxpayer dollars and have locked those contracts
(21:58) in the third is contracts over distribution and so you've got the supply side you've got the customer side and then you've got reaching the customers which is basically the middle between the two and so if I have an exclusive contract to sell video games and the only retail distribution is game stunk right then I can unless there's other marketplaces for distribution I can have a huge Monopoly over everybody who walks into those stores and so having exclusive contracts with distribution are ways of locking down markets well I mean I'll tell you an obvious one one of the classic examples
(22:30) of having massive distribution as a monopoly is Coca-Cola and Pepsi and so they're the primary two players in the drink game and the reason is as soon as they can buy a company that gets some sort of market share because they actually have a good product they can immediately drop it into their distribution base of every single restaurant every single 7-Eleven every single Walmart every single Walgreens every single retail store they already have the existing relationship they already have the distribution and so by having that locked in they don't even have to really innovate just wait for
(22:59) the market to say oh this is a winner they overpay the founder so that they get Fu money but they pay that guy 500 million bucks and they immediately take that thing and make it worth 5 billion and if somewhere to try and compete with Coca-Cola they'd have to have a hundred years of sales and outbound teams establishing all of these connections and the thing is is that especially because Coca-Cola is in the physical world like there's not a huge like you have to get the product to physical human beings so having a physical distribution Network gives them a huge
(23:30) competitive advantage and this is just through contracts they have these relationships they have these agreements and they're just already in place and to the flip side the people who are sign on the other end of these distribution agreements if you don't carry Coca-Cola and Pepsi people be like what kind of Mickey Mouse thing you got going on here because they own the vast majority of the beverages that most people consume and so when you're thinking about building your business having these agreements where you can get access to distribution increases the value of the
(23:54) company and secures Revenue because you get to rely on all the marketing each of these individual retailers do to get customers in to buy your product and fundamentally this is a B2B or B2B Toc strategy and if you don't what that means it's business to business or business to business to Consumer and so if you want to lock in one of these things and you're a smaller business you have to make it worth it for the distributor and so if they're picking between you and someone else then you can say hey I will help you I will sell you my product at a lower cost than other people or I'll add in a whole
(24:24) retail kit that'll move more product for you or I'll come out to your site and train your staff for free you have to add other perks and incentives that more established players probably aren't willing to do or don't need to do so that you can get a foot in to the door so number nine huge Capital requirements meaning it takes a ton of money to just get into the business and so that automatically knocks out 99.
(24:47) 9% of business owners who aren't going to be able to raise a billion dollars on their first go now Elon for example was able to do this with SpaceX because he's Elon and by the way casually shot up hundreds of satellites into space so that he could create star right and have Global coverage for internet and there's other obvious examples of this you got Exxon Mobile who has a huge Capital to go find search and then drill oil or like underwater oil drilling like these crazy things that cost gazillions of dollars that you're not like hey you know I'm thinking about opening a dry cleaning
(25:16) store or an underwater oil rig right like it's it's it's a huge amount of capital or even simply as simple to understand as developing a new drug like a pharmaceutical it takes takes a ton of time a ton of money a ton of Regulation so there's multiple big things and a ton of money because you have to run the whole thing for years at a loss not being able to make a penny and then the day that it gets legalized then you print money for like 30 years but it takes time and money and Regulation and knowledge of regulation in order to even get to that point and many failed drugs
(25:51) that don't work which a lot of people don't talk about and so if you don't have a huge stockpile of cash you either got to raise it or you got to not play which means once you do win it's harder for people to enter because even if you do figure out the you know hair loss fixing drug you're going to have a huge years and years of profits and advantage over somebody else who's going to what be the second player in that market years later right and I I'll say like and let's scale this down to small business so it's easier to start a
(26:19) social media agency because it just requires skill than starting a manufacturing PL or starting a business where you have to buy Capital Equipment so a equipment in order to make the business work and so basically the amount of capital that's required in order to start the business becomes a competitive advantage in of itself and so if you have the ability to raise capital or even saving lots of money for yourself you can automatically pick vehicles to start a business in that have fewer people competing against you so you automatically shrink the pool
(26:51) number 10 is IP intellectual property now this is one that I think is wildly understood but you've got kind of two basic camps here so you got padon copyright trademarks which is basically like I own this information and no one else can use it so simple example of that is this book like someone else can't copy the contents of this book and then republish it and just put their name on it it's illegal and it's good that it's illegal because then people wouldn't spend the time to write a book if they knew that the moment it does well some a hundred other people can publish the same book right and same
(27:20) thing with like a cartoon character like Mickey Mouse which by the way is expiring kind of soon so that's kind of frightening for Disney uh but they you can own these patents for 70 or 100 years or whatever it is and so you basically have an entire lifetime and sometimes two lifetimes they're able to create wealth with this one thing that obviously lots of people like if it's good and after that point it becomes common it means everybody can use it and so we might some find some very interesting Mickey Mouse apparel and cartoons that start appearing after
(27:50) Disney's Big ownership over that IP expires now the other version of this is Trade Secrets and this one's really tough because it's really hard to enforce it's really hard to keep secret cuz you have employees who learn Trade Secrets and then they can leave and then just becomes competitive practice and so the thing is is like the classic one is Coca-Cola secret recipe for their drinks and this is actually really common in flavoring because there's really unique recipes for like Red Bull and Monster
(28:15) and I think monster famously didn't own its own recipe from the person that was actually doing the manufacturing and had to pay like $500 million to just buy the rights to its own recipe from the people who made it in the beginning some crazy amount of money somebody can fact check me all right and so the thing is is that but if you're like man someone's using my offer someone's using my ad someone copied my content that's not considered intellectual property believe it or not and so there's very strict guidelines which I won't get into about it but if
(28:44) you do have a copyright right if you do have a trademark which is like you can't use acquisition. comom right you can't pretend it's your business and the key word I think for knowing whether it's right or wrong is pretending like it's yours right like you can't pretend that you wrote this book you can't pretend that you in acquisition.
(29:02) comom you can't pretend to represent something that you're not which is what this protects and so this gives you the business owner the opportunity to spend more resources more time building things of value because you know they're going to be protected and if I ever wanted to sell the rights to my book I would be able to sell it for probably close to $100 million based on the revenue that this book brings in and it just continues to make money and these types of businesses set themselves up for things called royalties and so Oreo for example and Nabisco set up lots of different royalties with like
(29:34) supplement sellers who want to say this is Oreo flavored or ice cream dealers you you want to have Oreo real Oreo flavoring so if you want to use the Oreo recipe and the Oreo logo on your products they say sure you can use it you just have to give us 8% of Revenue of whatever you do and so there's also a really strong strategy of saying hey I'm going to just lean into this I'm going to go get 10 different big Brands to license me their brands I'm going to pay them the royalty but I'm going to piggyback on 20 years of branding and marketing that they spent gazillions of
(30:04) dollars on so you can start small businesses uh a mutual acquaintance of mine started his suppling company just taking all these premium Brands like Swedish Fish and Sour Patch Kids and making them into supplement lines that people immediately recognize so he got the benefit from that brand recognition and already a flavor that people loved and knew even though he was a small business number 11 is Acquisitions and mergers and you're like how do you destroy your competition through acquisition mergers well you kind of don't you kind of just assimilate your competition and so this one is a a
(30:33) darling of the private Equity world and basically the world that I live in as an investor which is hey we've got three companies that are all competing for the same Market well what if we just buy them all and put them under one well now we control the entire Marketplace and so the government seeks to break these things up once they get really really big but the problem is it gets really hard when it company's really big because they know how to defend themselves and so Facebook for example meta has acquired number of companies
(30:59) like Instagram and WhatsApp to consolidate position they added messenger in and so they have all these things and they've been prevented at this point from buying any more because they don't want one company owning all of the digital media and I think rightfully so but that is a way that you can develop a monopoly and so when you're thinking about Acquisitions and mergers you're really just thinking about market segments or like I was saying earlier so this one basically umbrella is on top of any of the others so you can do private Equity so you can do Acquisitions for example and acquire
(31:28) all of the things in the supply chain so you basically use outside Capital to acquire the entire supply chain and vertically integrate or you acquire all of your competitors and you achieve economies of scale or you acquire the distribution and the exclusive contracts and then you create a closed loop and so you basically use capital and taking existing resources and assets and so I had a company yesterday was talking to me about this and they were like hey I'm having this problem because this company was doing about $60 million a year it's a roofing business he was like I buy all
(31:57) my leads from this online lead source and they're the biggest lead Source in the US and I'm their biggest buyer I was like okay cool so what's the problem he's like well I'm having trouble scaling Beyond them I was like okay well there's two ways you can do it you can either buy it or you build it and my recommendation to him was hey go find five small agencies that sell to roofers exclusively and sell payer lead and rather than buy the leads buy the company because he had the capital to do it and so if he buys one two or three of the businesses he can then own another chunk of the supply chain so he owns all
(32:30) of the media assets that create the leads and he owns the roofing company that can create the roofs and then what would the next thing he would buy he'd probably buy the financing company that finances the roofs and he'd make points on that and so the more you eat up of this which you can do through Acquisitions and mergers the more of a competitive Advantage you have the more valuable the company and so what's interesting is that small businesses get small and stay small through competition but big businesses think about
(32:56) consolidation and so you you could see five business owners who are all neck and neck in a local market but the funny thing is is that one guy sells private equity and then private Equity buys the other five and just owns them all and it just seems like the silly squabble and so if you can work together to create a much bigger Enterprise the sum of the whole is greater than the individual parts and this is very true when it comes to equity value in a business and so if you seek to create a more valuable
(33:21) Enterprise don't think from the competitive lens think like how do I eat up things that would cause risk to my business and so that's looking at distribution looking at customer bases looking at looking at media assets looking at all the different components so you can say hey is there a way that we can work together rather than compete so that we can just become a much bigger thing and then own a stronger position in the market which then gives us some of these Downstream things we have economies of scale we have a stronger
(33:43) brand all of these competitive modes that you then position yourself to destroy competition and so me personally and this is something that's be way too long to learn about business is I'd rather own 20% of a billion dollar company than 100% of a million dollar company and one of the classic examples you probably have heard of because you've probably seen their big green trash bins is Waste Management which you may not know this but the owner of the founder of Waste Management didn't even like start a business he just bought Waste Management routes and he kept buying them over and over and over again
(34:15) and so what he saw was a very fragmented Market of mom and popop shops that he saw wait if I added all of these routes together I would have huge economies of scale and then I would own the entire network of waste which is more or less what he did and and so he grew the entire company through Acquisitions until he became a multi-billionaire and had a big public company which we now know as waste management and so and so if you're a small business owner you can just think about that exact strategy that Waste Management did which is if you are let's say a pool cleaner or you own lawn care company then you can look
(34:47) at all the other lawn carees in your local Marketplace and say okay well what if I owned all of these and you just focus on your local city and if you own them you're going to have huge advantages it's going be harder for people to come in and compete against you you have the relationships you have economies of scale you have more efficient routes because you have your houses are closer together and this happens with lots of Home maintenance type of businesses and the thing is is that right now this is a huge private Equity interest so there's tons of m&a activity that's happening here because they're seeing the same thing that's
(35:12) right there which is wow these guys are all really fragmented instead of competing if we consolidate it we make a much more valuable thing so number 12 is one of my favorite personally and so one of my big sayings is find what everyone wants make it better and give it away for free and step four monetize another way so it's having an innovative business model and so a lot of people talk about this in disrupting marketplaces so you take stuff that other people are currently selling at a profit and you just give it away for free and so Google for example with Google Docs Google Sheets Google slides
(35:45) to try and disrupt Microsoft or eat up some of its market share they offered essentially the same software for free and added some features that made it even easier for people to work together if they were already on Google so fundamentally many of these models exist on freemium Concepts which is I give something for free that you continue to use and I put all of my effort on ascending people from free to paid and so it's actually a marketing strategy and so your cost to acquire a customer is the cost to deliver a customer
(36:16) divided by your conversion rate so if it cost me a penny to service a free customer and I convert one out of a 100 free customers into paid customers then my cost to a Car customer is a dollar and so you would actually take all of what would normally be a marketing budget and you put it into delivering the free thing and make sure that that free thing is so good that the word of mouth marketing on its own because it's free then generates more demand that you then just take the cost basis of delivering the free thing and that becomes your marketing spend and this is really common in disruptive businesses
(36:47) because that is their competitive advantage that's what makes them difficult to compete with because other people in their Marketplace that's their Core Business and then you're just giving it away for free because you found out another way to monetize so Spotify for example did a great job with this where they made free music for everybody because they licensed they made all these agreements and so you can listen to whatever songs you want on demand as long as you're willing to Jesus as long as you're willing to listen to ads and if you don't want to listen to the ads you can pay them Tada
(37:14) and they do a REV share with musicians we can get into whether it's ethical how much they pay them or not but that's not the point of this video the point is that they had an Innovative model that disrupted that industry but you're like okay these are some massive things but is there something that I can do on a smaller scale well the answer is yes you just have to do the math and so for example I had a concept that I that we tested out at a gym it didn't work but I can still explain it to you is that I
(37:38) had a meals company called Prestige meals and I also had a sub company Prestige labs and I knew gyms and so in one of our test kitchens I said Hey what if we told people that if they were on our meals they could get the gym membership for free and so we marketed free gym forever because the whole shtick was if you eat the right Foods when you're not here the results you're going to get in here are going to be massively Amplified now the difficulty that we had and I think if I worked at it a little bit longer I then was like this is a little
(38:08) bit of distraction because I was getting way too into like trying to innovate this business model but fundamentally that's how it worked it's just okay well I have a capital cost for the gym but once I incur that the additional users isn't that much to take on in terms of price and I'm willing to give this thing away for free that other people charge for as long as they buy this other Revenue stream that has more profit or more income and so that's how I think about pairing different Services together where you just take the a very cheap service that a lot of people want even if you go from $20 to zero it's
(38:38) still free and free gets 10 times the interest of not free and so that then allows you to generate the demand for your much more valuable service that you can sell at a higher LTV I'll give you another version of this if I that I would test out so if I had a large facility right I might say you have to you can come to my facility and you can use it for free you have to do these rules and I can kick you out so that would control some of the Riff Raff for example but by doing that I would use my gym as my free lead magnet to get people in the door and then what would I do
(39:06) when they're in the door well they got to sit down with us to do an onboarding consultation which we would sell personal training at and so it's like I can give the whole gym membership away for free if you just buy Personal Training knowing that only one out of five people are going to buy it and that's fine because I didn't pay for the customers and I'm making all my profit here so as long as my profit and my personal training covers the cost of maintaining the facility and I can still at a profit then I have a good and very innovative business model number 13 is
(39:31) control over distribution channels now you might be like this is really similar to contracts with distribution and it is kind of except it's way more valuable because contracts at some point they can break them like all of the vendors overnight could say you know what Coca-Cola we don't want you now is that likely no but if you have absolute control and ownership over distribution you also can profit from everyone else's business too and so Amazon for example owns a distribution Monopoly right they have access to everybody in the United States they're the most widely adopted product
(40:01) which is Amazon Prime in the United States in total and that's how they can get you things in two hours right which is crazy and they had the warehouse Network built out first and they were putting so much strain on the US Postal Service and ups that they were like well we're just going to start Amazon's delivery and now Amazon's deliveries you see the Amazon trucks everywhere where they just have their own people that and their own vans that do all the deliveries for them and so Amazon because they have access to everyone's front doorstep if you want to sell a
(40:31) product on Amazon you pay Amazon 2/3 or half of the revenue which is absurd but it's also why Amazon's revenue is like a gajillion dollars a year how do you chunk this down so you're not Amazon you're like how do I make this work for me so I would say on a smaller scale you have local distribution so you can create distribution centers in a local area and you just slowly expand outwards because in that City in that tiny area you're the best now the other version of this is that you get really good Distribution on a specific Market
(41:00) segment so if I have every single CEO in America and I know them all first name basis then if I want to sell private jets I probably will have a good job doing it and so just think about it as means of communicating or means of delivering messages or products to customers that you have complete control over now I don't own those CEOs but somebody might own those relationships right and so the idea is as much of that as that you can have complete control creates a competitive mode now I want to zoom out we talked about 13 different
(41:32) things here the chunked up version of this is the actual word monopoly and it comes from the Greek mono meaning one and pce meaning to sell meaning only one person can sell and so there are 13 ways that I just outlined where only one competitor can sell and that could be because they control the supply they control the demand they control the media that talks to those people they control the technology that prevents other people from getting into it it just costs a ton of money to get into the business they
(42:02) have some sort of Grant or license that says that only they can do it so there's all these different ways but fundamentally it's finding a way that no one else can enter and as much as monopolies are quote frowned upon in the government they don't do very much to break them up and this is how Bill Gates and John D Rockefeller created life-changing wealth but you can create life-changing wealth and not necessarily become a billionaire you just create a small network of a very small niche that you own and by doing that you can take steps and weave one of these 13 strategies into the DNA
(42:33) of your company to make it more competitive and ultimately make more money and I told you number six my favorite was brand and how to build a brand and I actually made an entire keynote that doesn't require any money and only skill to understand and deploy in your business so go check it out

How The World’s RICHEST Man Made His Money - YouTube
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV__y1z7MI

Transcript:
(00:00) Bernardino became the richest man in the world and what's crazy is he only sells to one percent of the population you may not have heard of Bernardino but I guarantee you've heard of his companies Louis Vuitton Christian Dior Celine Sephora DKNY Bulgari Givenchy Tiffany Hennessy Marc Jacob while the tech billionaires and everyone's net worth have plummeted Elon Musk lost 200 billion dollars Bezos lost 70.
(00:24) he only lost seven his business model is Recession Proof the man who's selling ten thousand dollar purses there are some lessons that we can learn from the richest man in the world so the first thing we have to understand is the psychology of the rich versus the psychology of the poor the first encounter I had with like super wealth I remember I was working at Smoothie King I was a blender tender one of my buddies he's in the back with his feet up he's flipping through a magazine he's like dude check this out this guy bought a 50
(00:48) 000 Burger man that's crazy who would spend fifty thousand dollars on a burger I thought about it more and more if I go and get lunch it cost me 12 bucks for the burger the fries and the coke whatever he had said it was some Finance guy who had made like 100 dollars that year if he made 100 million dollars and he worked 2 000 hours he made fifty thousand dollars an hour I was making seven dollars an hour and my burger cost me 12 bucks his fifty thousand dollar burger was cheaper for him for his amount of money that he was making than
(01:17) my twelve dollar lunch was for me that was a huge shift for me where I realized I'm playing this game wrong and I'm not empathizing with the rich because he's got to be thinking differently than I am to be able to afford a fifty thousand dollar burger it also kind of makes sense for him the second is how we create products that specifically serve rich people they think differently and want different things the best thing to do is study luxury Brands when you shop at a high-end store they'll offer you champagne while you shop you're going to
(01:45) have somebody who's assigned to you the moment you walk in the door what can I get for you they can have and deliver that better experience because of the premium and luxury prices they charge if you've ever been to a luxury mall and you see a purse for ten thousand dollars and you see a jacket for fifty thousand dollars and I would urge you to not say those people are ridiculous I can't believe someone would spend money on that what I want you to do is actually empathize with the buyer what kind of person would spend fifty thousand
(02:10) dollars on a jacket if I can pick from all jackets and I have so much money that the difference between a hundred dollar jacket and a 50 000 jacket in relative terms is a ten dollar difference to me and my wealth then I just want the best jacket Bernard or no capitalized on this so there's four distinct positions you can have in any Marketplace you can have bargain which is the absolute cheapest one poor quality poor experience the next is best value this is the difference between a Walmart and a Target Target is better
(02:36) value it's got brighter lights it's cleaner it's the best value for the buck the third position the marketplace is premium the high-end Lexus the BMW and then the fourth position in the marketplace is luxury where the price has no cap part of the value of the product itself is the cost that people know you paid to get it Bernardino lives in this luxury bubble it's where people associate their status with the purchase they made typically when you raise prices you decrease volume but in luxury goods when you raise prices you increase
(03:08) how many you sell and that creates this unbelievable amount of profit which is what has now propelled him to be the single richest man in the world rich people have the same problems that poor people do they just want them solved differently the big thing we want is we want to deliver a big dream outcome number two we want them to believe with very high confidence that if they work with us they're going to get what we promised on the bottom side they want it to be incredibly fast so as soon as they pay they want to get and then they want
(03:35) to have as little effort and sacrifice assumingly possible and with the rich speed and convenience are Paramount the money is never an issue it's how much are you going to ask of my time and how painful are you going to make this for me A buddy of mine only Services Fortune 100 companies and he manages right now 1.
(03:54) 2 billion dollars a year in advertising budget and here's what's crazy his advertising agency actually has to front the ad spend if they say hey for this month in December I needed to drop 300 million on Facebook ads he has to front the 300 million but the thing is is that he has to do it that way because he needs to be as easy as humanly possible so he actually has to have a revolving credit line in the billions with a bank he charges six percent of all advertising dollars so when they drop 300 million he gets six percent not bad he gets 18 million bucks
(04:24) just for fronting the cash rich people will always pay for Speed the easiest way to appeal to the rich is just do the same thing in half the time whatever the service is if it's dry cleaning return it by end of day if you only have a phone number be the person that can accept anything if they email you shoot you a text if they WhatsApp you if they phone call you can accept anything because you've made it convenient they just want it to be effortless the third is if we know what products and services they want how to price those things
(04:50) appropriately when you solve rich people problems you get to charge rich people prices when you deal with rich people you have unlimited upside which is why they are better customers there's five things I want to talk about from the customer's perspective because if you increase the quality of your customers you increase the quality of your business number one when you charge more money for your products or Services you get an increased emotional investment if you have a very low cost item people won't even give it the time of day and
(05:18) so when you raise the price you raise their emotional investment and in a real way you actually increase the likelihood that they get results the second way that it'll help your customers is that it will increase their perceived value there was a research study where they had three bottles of wine they had a cheap wine a mid-price wine and the expensive one they had people try them out and they had them rank them based on what they thought people said I think the most expensive line is the best the middle price is the middle and the
(05:44) cheapest wine was the worst and that's not that surprising except when the researchers explained that all three wines were the same when you raise your prices a more expensive thing is perceived in real terms as more valuable even if the actual core product is the same the third is results for your customers if you increase their emotional investment you increase their perceived value what ends up happening they actually do get better results when they sign up for the gym for personal training versus a 10 a month thing they
(06:12) get better results the fourth thing that happens when you raise your prices you actually attract less demanding customers have you ever seen this meme the customer says well what exactly am I going to be getting for fifty dollars then it has the rich customers like wire set let me know what next steps are anybody who's ever been in client services can attest to this the higher the price tag the more expensive the contract the fewer payment plans you have to set up the easier the customer is to deal with part of the reason that
(06:40) a 50 person is saying well what exactly am I be getting if somebody's got a hundred dollars in their bank account you're asking for fifty percent of their net worth just because someone's willing to pay you doesn't mean that you should take it the fifth benefit that your customers will get as a result of raising your prices is that you actually have more money you can deliver on your promises for so imagine you've got a hard cost thing that costs five bucks and you charge eight bucks we only have three dollars left to run the rest of
(07:06) your business provide service you don't have a lot of room there now imagine you charge fifty dollars for that same five dollar thing you have forty five dollars that you can now use to deliver two three four times the value the customer gets a better experience you can reinvest in your product you can attract higher level talent to your business if you have no margin the best people aren't going to work for you they're going to go to the real business owner who understands how margin needs to work whereas you're sitting here dealing with
(07:33) fires all day because of people haggling over fifty dollars the best way to sell is having the full conviction that your product is the best the best quality and the most elitist product in every line that we are selling throughout the world and you can't say your products the best if you're trying to do it on margin and you don't have the money to reinvest in good people you can't do it when you have all of these higher paying lower demanding happier your customers your perception of the real impact you're
(08:03) actually making goes up it becomes this snowball that starts rolling and you have these testimonials and these reviews that start rolling in the momentum Builds on the flip side if you don't have that and it becomes this Vicious Cycle in the other direction where you're not getting these testimonials all you're getting is chargebacks and refunds from these demanding customers that had unrealistic expectations because it was such a high percentage of their net worth there was nothing that was going to save them from
(08:26) themselves there's no advantage to being the second cheapest person in the marketplace but there is an advantage to being the most expensive

Investor Boils Down Business Growth to Simple Math - YouTube

Transcript:
(00:00) what's going on everyone i've got a fun topic today how to make a million dollars and so i know this is uh almost clickbaity uh but i want to uh go over it mostly because it's like one of the number one questions i get all the time and so we might as well actually break down the math for you and so the number one way that i know that someone has no chance in actually doing this is they don't even know the math behind how to accomplish their goals right and so that's what we're going to break down today all right so the first
(00:25) thing is you have to know how many units or whatever it is you're selling to get to your goal right and the question is do you want to make a million dollars in revenue or do you want to make a million dollars in take home income mind you to be in the top one percent in america it's four hundred thousand dollars a year all right and so let's say you have a business that runs 40 net margins which mind you is very good um if you run 40 at margins that means if you made a million dollars in revenue you would make 400 000 a year in net
(00:47) profit what you get to take owner pay right from your business which is why by the way i think that having a job that pays well is very underrated i think it's just from being realistic if you look at the odds i think it's far far far more likely that you can achieve a six-figure or multi-six-figure income fast by having a really high-paying job because you've acquired a skill then trying to learn basically all the skills and own your own business i'm just being candid and i think that if i knew the amount of risk that i was
(01:19) taking on when i started business i don't know if i would have done it again and i think that i had an atypical entrepreneurial journey because i wasn't really an entrepreneur personality type i just really hated my job enough that i was going to do anything but that and so that's what started it but let's get to that let's get to the mean the potatoes all right so a lot of times people haven't even figured out their price points on things yet and so the easiest way to understand this is that if you have a million dollars a year which is what
(01:45) you want to make then you want to break this down right so a million dollars a year is going to be 83k per month all right roughly right it's 83 333 whatever you could say 84k but 83k per month all right that's what you have to make in uh revenue right now if you break it down per day i think it's three three three three three i think um per day but if you if you do it per week so let's just break this into weekly uh it would be like let's just say 21k okay so 21k per week all right and you'll notice i'm gonna keep breaking this down because
(02:14) it's really difficult to hit fuzzy targets right i heard this from jason flatland fuzzy targets don't get hit right so we need to make this a very precise clean pristine target all right so we got a million dollars a year breaks down to 83k per month 21k uh per week excuse me 21k per week and then from there you know seven seven days would be about 3k plus per day right so so that's that's how we know how we can get to that number now i like weeks because weeks are like normal cycles daily can be a little bit too volatile until you get to like
(02:41) 10 feet you know uh 10 million plus per year um and so if we're if we're talking starting out right 21k per week all right so the thing is is we just have to know what the lifetime value of our customer is and so let's say you're selling a single product that has no upsells right which is pretty common um a single product that has no upsells let's say your ltv is a thousand dollars okay now i want to be really clear about this you don't have to sell a thousand dollar widget for this for the math that i'm about to share
(03:10) with you to make sense all right it just means that your total lifetime value of a customer is a thousand dollars like starbucks i think their ltv's like eight thousand dollars and you're like holy cow well think about how many times you purchased the starbucks over the last you know 10 years right it adds up and so for me i'll give you a couple different examples of what a thousand ltv might be if i sold a course for a thousand dollars and i sold nothing else that would be 1000 ltv if i sold a 100 a month gym
(03:32) membership and the person on average stays ten months that would be a thousand dollar ltv if i sold uh let's say ah crap if i sold uh uh skin care products right and the average order value was you know 250 and the average amount of time that someone stayed on my cream products was four months one thousand dollars was my ltv okay so these are all different ways of achieving a thousand dollar ltv which makes this hopefully a little bit simpler now if i have to get to a million dollars then i need to sell 21 units
(04:01) per week right and so that would be 21 divided by a thousand which is 21 right units per week to hit our goal and so if i know that i only really sell five days a week monday through friday right then it means i got to sell four or maybe five i'd probably make five my goal so i overshoot it a little bit so i gotta sell five deals a day right and if i have five deals a day and the nice thing is with this process that i'm walking you through right now like you can add as many zeros as you want it works the same way right you can
(04:27) add zeros to your product zeros to your goal like everything works the same way so it's five deals a day is what i have to close now the thing is is i may know my math right and know that five deals a day we close let's say one out of three one out of three phone calls which means i'm going to do 15 phone calls a day who show up right and now if i'm selling products and it might be based on site conversion so if i have like you know one percent conversion on my store an e-commerce store for example then i would need a hundred times the amount of
(04:55) sales i need right so if i need five quote sales per day with an uh the lifetime value of a thousand and i know that it takes a hundred clicks to get one purchase then i need 500 clicks a day hopefully that makes sense here but i'm just walking through a more a more service-based sale because it was top of mind all right so 15 calls right per day and let's say that i know my show up rate on these calls is you know 66 so i'd have 22 set appointments per day right and the thing is is i know that based on my either outreach efforts
(05:26) it takes let's say i don't know 50 outreach efforts to get one appointment i need a thousand outreach efforts a day right now mind you a thousand dollar deal would not be worth any kind of effort like that so because this is way way too low to have kind of like a hand-to-hand combat uh sale type type system um this would probably need to be closer to like ten thousand dollars um and then there you go you get your 10 million but but i'm using this just to illustrate uh like the different ways to get there right
(05:54) and so um a nice thing to think about this is that if you if you take out if you take this little number here your deal size right and you put that as the main variable for this process right you could either sell you know nine 10k deals per month and have a million dollar business wow right you could sell one 100k deal per month to have a million dollar business that sounds pretty chill you could also sell 100 well roughly you know 83 right 1k deals per month that sounds a little harder right or if you have hundred dollar widgets
(06:34) you got to sell god 830 right or 33 whatever it is times 100 per per month to hit that 83k right and so you can kind of see how much harder it gets the lower the price like it's it's hard to sell 833 things every month i mean that's that's a lot of work right and honestly it's hard to sell 83 things a month selling nine easier right and so it's been this is just the conclusion that i've made throughout my life is that especially when you're starting out i think it's easier to start with premium things as in like it's easier to
(07:06) just over deliver like crazy for a client rather than trying to think about like how do i make this scalable it's like you don't need to worry about that yet like you need to just start making money right and so it's like how can i just how can i how can i find a sweet spot in here right this like five thousand ten thousand fifteen thousand dollar mark how can i find a sweet spot in here where i can just provide tremendous value to someone um that they will want to continue to do services with me and i don't have to have a tremendous amount
(07:29) of operational skill because the reason that this is so hard for people this hundred dollar month or even ten dollar month range is it's the operations behind it you have to be able to support so much volume uh that you're very good with people and that's a totally different skill than learning how to market and sell and acquire customers and so this is where i think most people kind of run into trouble and why a lot of people who end up making more money earlier kind of focus on this on this upper side of the ladder
(07:52) there's a very very very few exceptions of people who uh make a lot of money like super super rare make a lot of money below this thousand dollar um you know per unit price tag right like you have to find a way to get your ltv higher because it's just too hard like acquiring customers is just too difficult to not have a high ltv and like like i said starbucks right 8000 ltv so it doesn't have to be your ticket price that has to be low it's just like you have to find ways to make customers worth more right unique expensive sticky air if you
(08:20) remember that from before habit forming something that they want to continue to come back again and again and again so anyway how to make a million dollars i think most people do not do this math on this which is you got to make twenty one thousand dollars a week and then there's a zillion ways to make twenty one thousand dollars a week right you can sell hundred dollar units you can sell a thousand units you can sell ten thousand units because a hundred thousand dollar units um but at the end of the day that is how
(08:40) you do it and if you're thinking about this from a sales professional standpoint so i'll break this down for you guys as a bonus because i know a lot of sales people follow our stuff um make this whatever your product is your commission right so if you want to make a million dollars as a salesperson right then you need to sell like unless you get a thousand commission then you need to sell 83 units a month of your thing right and that may sound crazy and that it is because that's why you know that's why the top one percent is
(09:06) you know half of that in terms of income right and so uh but if you can if you can figure out that a thousand dollars you know if you can get your like you should be able to think in your mind like this is my income goal as a salesperson this is what i would like to make is the amount of calls you know or calls taken required to hit this goal uh reasonable right because on some level every every position has a cap based on time right how much how much time you could allocate right there's only 24 hours in a day
(09:32) and so anywho reverse the math on your own business and your own products that you're selling and a lot of times this will help you get your goals a lot faster so anyway keeping awesome lots of love and i'll catch you guys soon bye

The Top 1% of Business Owners Aren't Smarter Than You - YouTube
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9OmYf_IlQ0

Transcript:
(00:00) The top 1% of business owners aren't smarter than you. They do things differently. And that's what I'm explaining in this video. I'm Alexi. I own acquisition.com. It's a portfolio of companies that generate hundreds of millions of dollars per year in revenue. And so, I've seen a lot of different patterns across businesses that we both invested and scaled in or some that we turn down.
(00:18) If you feel stuck, it's because what got you from 0 to 100,000 or $100,000 to a million or a million to 10 million or 10 million to 30 million isn't going to be the thing that gets you to the next level. and you're probably working on something that was once very important but is no longer. So, to make this real, I'm going to give you three examples of my own business experience of what I thought the business I was in versus the one I was actually in. So, in the very beginning, I was into fitness. I got into it thinking that my life was going to be
(00:42) about, what workouts we were going to be, and how I was going to structure the weights and the intensity. And then, as soon as I actually got into the business, I realized that the biggest issue is most people don't even show up to the gym, all of my attention was like, "Oh my god, I have to get people first in the door, and how do I get them to stay?" and how do I run this profitably when I've got rent, I've got trainers, I've got equipment that breaks. And all of a sudden, I was like, "Oh my god, I thought I was going to be in the scientific fitness business when in
(01:05) reality, I was in the sales and marketing business." One of the easiest ways to identify what business you're really in is to zoom all the way out to the people who are already a hundred steps ahead of you. Not just one or two steps, but like a hundred steps.
(01:22) And the reason for that is because if I said if you just look at someone who's one or two steps ahead of you, you should do what they do. The thing is is that they're one or two steps ahead of you and they're probably going to get lost, too. But if you look at the people who are all the way at the top, typically it's because they figured out something that you haven't figured out.
(01:35) If you look at the biggest fitness businesses that are gyms, most of them are basically in the sales and marketing business. They have absolutely mechanized the ability of getting people in the door. Their general managers for each location are just people who have membership quotas who are driving sales day in and day out. And so for me, I never even sold a poor. I didn't know what a lead was.
(01:54) I didn't know what email marketing was. I didn't know any of this stuff. And the thing is is I signed a lease and 30 days later I had to come up with $5,000. And I'm like, how am I going to do that? When I was begging people to buy to buy my gym memberships, that was a form of sales, not good sales, but it was a form of sales nonetheless.
(02:12) All of a sudden, through repetition, I was like, "Okay, so I have to have these consistent conversations that get people to buy. And if I do that more effectively, then all of a sudden, I make more money." Okay, cool. So, this is really important to this business because believe it or not, people don't wake up someday and say, "You know what? I'm going to sign up for a gym membership." Doesn't usually happen that way. Usually, they got to get interrupted. So, they have to get interrupted with some sort of ad.
(02:30) And that then reminds them that they're not in the shape that they want to be. Or they put on their clothes in the morning. They're like, "Oh my god, I can't close this thing." But still, they don't just say, "Oh, I'm going to call the gym up." Not usually how it happens.
(02:43) Instead, again, it's other people stopping them in the parking lot being like, "Hey, do you want a free workout or thing?" or showing up to their office of work and saying, "Hey, we made these protein muffins.
(02:54) Hey, while you're eating these muffins of ours, can I tell you about what semi-private training might do for you?" You have to get in front of people in order to ultimately bring them into the gym. The other problem with gyms that I didn't know I was in is that basically no one sticks with gyms. Now, there's a very small select group of people who are hardcore lifters who do absolutely get obsessed with gyms.
(03:12) But here's the crazy part that everyone in the industry doesn't tell you. They are such a small percentage that they're the ones who actually take up all the space in the gym. And if the amount of people that actually were subscribed to the gym, all of them came, no gym model would work at 10, 20, $30 a month.
(03:30) Like if you actually had people pay who only used it, your gym membership would have to be something like $200 to $300 a month, which just so happens to coincide with with the vast majority of service-based gyms. what cross trainining facilities and boot camps and semi-private training facilities, all of those have clients who all show up and that's why those prices are where they're at.
(03:47) Even a business like Crunch or Planet Fitness, they have $10 a month memberships, but they still have like five or six% per month of their customers who turn out. So that's like half the customers per year are leaving out the door. If you've got thousands of customers and you lose half them every year, guess what else? You need a machine for generating another few thousand customers to fill up the bucket.
(04:12) These very large companies know how to train sales staff, recruit sales staff, market across different channels to get customers in the door. And once I figured that out, my gyms started growing. But until I did, I was like lost. Might be like, "Okay, so every business has to be a marketing and sales business." Uh, kind of. And so then I got into the supplement business.
(04:30) So this business for sure is about what's inside of the bottle. So I got Dr. Cash. He's the smartest human being that I know who's a PhD biochemist. Got his, you know, PhD when he was 21 years old. He also did the stacks for Olympic teams and he has a national log press record. So I was like, this guy is going to come up with the most efficacious product, the best ingredients.
(04:49) And I just said, listen, you make the best thing you could possibly make, I'll figure out how to sell it. That was the business that I thought I was in. The actual business that I was in with supplements is actually in the brand and distribution business. The ugly secret of the supplement business, at least in the United States, is that if something actually works, it's most of the time illegal because if something works a little bit, then typically if you put a lot of it in, it works a lot of it.
(05:11) Now, I think supplements are good for, you know, filling up holes, nutritional holes in people's diet so that they can get some of these other, you know, minerals or whatever. But the thing is is that if you're a customer, when you have two different proteins that have the exact same calories and macros, what gets you to buy? The brand.
(05:29) And so, because every single supplement supplier has access to the same ingredients more or less as everyone else, and the research studies that are out there, anyone who says that they know the research, the customers certainly don't know what the research is, nor do they really care. What they really care about is how good does it taste and do I feel cool when I drink it or eat it? And I was like, "Oh my god, this is not at all what I spent my entire time building this business to be." Then I had to learn all this stuff about brand.
(05:55) Now, I didn't know anything about brand at that time. And so that business kind of got to what I would consider like a direct sales model, but what I really missed was the cool factor. I didn't understand how to make my products cool. And if somebody's gonna buy a creatine for me versus a creatine that's 14 bucks and mine's 60, why are they gonna buy it? I didn't have a good answer to that question. And not only that, I didn't have distribution that was convenient.
(06:19) In the beginning for a business like this, you can sell online to consumers. They cover the shipping and stuff, but a lot of times people still like buying supplements in person because it's very easy. You don't have to pay the extra shipping. The business that I thought I was in was a combination of sales and making a great product.
(06:36) But the business I was really in was a brand and distribution business. And you might be like, "Okay, so that business was maybe different." But the third time he'll definitely get it right. You would hope that, but I I didn't. The next business that I had that I wasn't good at was my first software company.
(06:54) At this point, when I got into it, I was like, "Okay, listen. I can market and sell this thing. That's all that's going to matter." Because I had, you know, again, I learned I hit everything with the marketing and sales hammer because that was what I was good at. But when I got in the software business, I realized that you could sell software really, really easily because most software solves a problem that's pretty easy to describe. And the technology is supposed to remove a lot of pain.
(07:16) The problem is that as soon as someone logs in and it doesn't solve that problem or it solves that problem by introducing even more pain into their lives, which is very common, they then immediately hate it and you by default. I thought I was in the marketing and sales business yet again when in reality I was in the product business and I didn't know anything about product from like a software. I didn't know how to I didn't know how to write code. I didn't know what UX or design is.
(07:41) Like I'm still not that good at design. The whole thing was just kind of like screwed from the from the onset. I didn't have any of the talent and my strategy was not around product. So the fundamental issue with that business was that the product wasn't good enough to deliver on the promise and the problem was I needed to make a better product and I didn't know how.
(07:59) I at the time hired an outsourced development team, right? And so I just had them build the product. I was like, "Yeah, do all the code stuff and, you know, ship it back to me." But the issue that I ran into was a couple things. Number one is that I literally aligned myself with someone who had a disincentive to do a good job. So think about this.
(08:16) They bill hourly and so their incentive is to charge as much as humanly possible and do as little as possible in that period of time and just keep me on long enough that I don't cancel. Now, the longer you work with an outsource development shop, the harder it is to leave them because they have all these developers who are dedicated to your account and they're all read up on the code. You're like, "Well, I can't switch now because they already have five or 10 or 20 developers that are allocated to me." And here's the even
(08:39) worse part. Let's say that you're still really good at marketing and sales. Guess what happens next? They see how much money you're making. They own the damn software, right? So, they can see that you're making money. And you know what's crazy is that I I noticed as we kept making more money, my fees just kept going up. Wild.
(08:59) Almost so much that I was like, "Wait, where's my profit?" At the end of the day, the dev shop was more or less taking advantage of us. And because I had no technical proficiency, nor did I have a co-founder who was really technical because you can't absolutely have a business like this. Somebody's got to know how to code, right? Somebody's got to understand technology. And I didn't know it.
(09:17) And I didn't have anybody else. and specifically I have anybody else who is incentivized to help because in the software business you can make the promise of good fast cheap and people are going to buy but you have to fulfill that promise and that's fundamentally what makes that business so hard but also so lucrative when you get it right and so I learned that lesson too late I ended up selling that company to somebody who did have a full in-house dev team and I had built because of my sales and marketing ability still a
(09:41) pretty decentsized distribution base that he could then leverage with his software and continue to expand the business so that worked out. Okay. So, I'll give you another example of what business are you really in. So, I talked to a guy recently who is in the M&A world, so mergers and acquisitions, and he was buying up plumbing businesses.
(09:57) And so, he bought up a plumbing business. And I was like, "Okay, well, what's limiting the business?" And he said, "I can't find good plumbers." So, I was like, "Well, what's your system for getting plumbers?" And honestly, he didn't have one. And so, I was like, "Okay, dude.
(10:17) If we think about what the product of this business is, when you're in a service business, the product is the service. Meaning the people who deliver the service are the thing you sell. And the margin of the business is the difference between what you have to pay them and what you get to charge for their work. Our acquisition process to scale the business doesn't have to be customerf facing because you've got phones ringing off the hook. There's already tons of demand.
(10:35) There's insufficient supply. And so the question is, what are you doing to out market your competition for talent? I introduced to him a concept that I love to talk about, which is the cost of acquiring talent relative to the lifetime gross profit per employee. All right, it's a lot of letters. Basically, this is how much it cost you to get people. This is how much you make from them.
(10:57) And so I said, "Well, how much does it how much do you make from a plumber per year in gross profit? So revenue minus what you pay them. What do you make?" He said, "Probably about, you know, $300,000 a year." And I was like, "Okay." I was like, "So, what are you willing to spend to get another plumber?" He's like, "Well, I think we have like a $500 referral thing if any of the guys refer somebody else." And I was like, "Okay." So, think about how wild this is.
(11:23) You're willing to pay $500 for $300,000 per year. This is per year for from your plumbers. I was like, "Does this feel a little bit low?" Of course it did. It's it's insanely low because the thing is is that if you're a smart competitor, what am I going to do? I'll be like, "Well, shoot. I'll pay $30,000.
(11:48) " So, all of a sudden, if I offered $30,000 to everyone in my staff, if they can go get somebody, what do you think's going to happen? They're probably going to find more plumbers for me. But guess what else I can do with $30,000? I could also say, "You know what? I'm willing to spend that in paid ads or in recruiting or headunting of people who just go and post people from firm to firm.
(12:07) How do I know if it's going to work out? Well, if you're doing a referral bonus, you can say that it's after they're productive at month six. Now, you've got somebody who did the referral who's super invested in making sure that it works out. Most recruiting firms have 90-day clauses to make sure that if the person doesn't work out in the first 90 days, they'll swap them out for free. That's pretty typical offer.
(12:22) If you're running ads, you don't have to worry about either of those because it's just the cost of the ads. The question is if the one thing that's limiting this business is that he doesn't have enough plumbers. Literally everything that he does with his time that is not about creating an acquisition system for talent is the thing that's limiting the business.
(12:41) I'll give you a different example and the reason I keep giving you these examples is because it happens in every business and this is typically what keeps business owners stuck. you started doing something, maybe it worked and then it stops working. But you think, "Oh, I need to keep doing this thing or do more of this thing." When sometimes that's the truth, but a lot of times it's just that the game changed or the real constraint of the business is not the thing you think it is.
(12:58) So, I was talking to a media company, super large YouTuber, big creator, right? And I said, "Well, what's the goal?" And they said, "We want to, you know, build, you know, make more money." I said, "Okay, great.
(13:10) So, what do you think it is right now?" And they're like, "Well, you know, right now," and just to give you context, they're a way bigger channel than me. Very big. Many millions, tens of millions. I said, "What are you doing right now?" They're like, "Well, we think that we've really mechanized our process of creating content and you know, we think that we can get this these new levels of efficiency in the content creation.
(13:28) " And I was like, "Okay, so out of a hundred compared to the marketplace, what would you guys rate your your content at right now?" So, what's funny is that like they would they were like, "I think we're like maybe a 90." But I'm like, "God, like if you just do percentiles here, like your 0, but everybody when it's your own game, you know much about it.
(13:45) You've forgotten more than people who are have been in this for two years know about it. You guys are probably like a 99 out of a hundred on marketing. The issue with your business, despite the hundreds of millions of impressions per week that you're generating, is that you're just not making that much money. So, would you really think that doing more media is the solution? And so, they looked at me for a second and I was like, what do you sell to make your money? And they were like,"Well, I mean, you know, we do sponsorships every once in a while. We basically this and that." I was like,
(14:14) "Okay, do you think it's possible that not having a clear monetization mechanism is the issue? What would you rate your monetization strategy at?" And they're like, "Oh, well, probably like a five out of 100." I was like, "Okay, so you've been deploying all your resources to go from 99 to 99.5%." rather than taking those same resources.
(14:42) And the thing is is that when you're this low, going from five to like 25 probably takes less effort than going from 99 to 99.5. And so what we need to do is fix the monetization of this business. When they had this larger goal, the business that they thought they were in, which is media, but to get to where they want to go, they were going to have to enter into having a business model. They're going to have enter into monetization as the issue in the business.
(15:04) The problem that most businesses have is they don't know the business they're actually in and they keep trying to solve the problem that they enjoy solving rather than the one that the business requires to be solved. Every business has a big hairy problem and this has been my experience and maybe just because it took me too long to learn or I you know I I I only learn about it once I get into it as a recommendation. So this is a a hack of hacks.
(15:28) If you're entering a new marketplace, talk to the people already in that marketplace and ask them what the hardest part of their business is. And a lot of people follow me because they're in education or consulting information products. So think to yourself, well, if you're in that world, what business do you think you're really in? Well, if you learn the basics of marketing and sales, just like any business, but if you want to make it big, look at the big consulting firms. Look at Mackenzie, look at Bane, look at Ernston Young or KPMG.
(15:51) These are all recruiting machines because on a long enough time horizon, you have to learn how to do other stuff because you can only keep selling infinite people for a period of time until eventually you've sold everyone within a marketplace and there's no one left. You've already pillaged the land. Instead, we have to find a way to get people to keep buying.
(16:08) If it's in the service business, it means having exceptional people. If it's in a physical products thing, it's how do we get customers to come back again and again. If you're in the software business, the same thing except you're doing it via code rather than kind of a recurring how do we basically engineer consumption.
(16:24) A lot of entrepreneurs who are in the education space, and I bring this up because I'm literally educating right now, is that they have one talented person, they have some guru, and then they hire people who really aren't as good, and then they dilute the service quality over time. And then they're surprised that somehow their business stops growing. When they were smaller, you grew really fast because you had a good product, which was you. You were exceptional.
(16:41) And then you hired all these other people, and they're not exceptional. But then you're like, "Oh, I love this one. I decided to stop doing it because it's not scalable." One of my favorite lines to hear. I'm going to try not to curse. It's going to be hard not to. I'm like really struggling, [ __ ] They are building cities in the middle of the ocean.
(17:05) We are sending rockets to space and building internet from satellites globally. We have electric cars. We have AI robots. and you think that you can't scale service. Of course, it's scalable. You're just not good enough. But when you phrase it that way, now it becomes a problem that you can solve.
(17:25) This is a second hack of hacks for figuring this out. Insert the problem that you claim to have that is unsolvable and frame it in the form of an I don't know. So, for example, no one can sell like me. I hear this all the time. No one can sell like me. What if you said, "I don't know how to get anyone to sell like me. Salespeople suck.
(17:50) I don't know how to find good salespeople. There's no good plumbers. I don't know how to recruit, hire, and train good plumbers. All the leads are crap. I don't know how to advertise to get good leads." One is a complaint, the other is a question, and the question has an answer.
(18:08) And so as soon as you can actually ask the right question, you start walking down the path to getting the thing that your business actually needs rather than you just complaining and giving yourself an excuse for why your business isn't growing anymore. And then you cast all the power out to some external thing.
(18:20) And that way you feel good and you can rock yourself to sleep every night saying, you know what, I gave it the good fight. But there are some people who actually want to [ __ ] win. And so for those people, who I'm making this video for, the thing that you're doing right now, if you keep doing it and it's not working, is the wrong thing. So let me give you one that you might not know as much about.
(18:38) So in the investing world, so I got into this, right? So we Leila and I took out, you know, tens many tens of millions of dollars in distributions. Then we also sold the company for lots of tens of millions of dollars. And so we had enough money that we could start our own family office and actually start buying companies and investing.
(18:50) I thought investing was about doing lots of deals at good prices. And what's interesting about this is that in some businesses it does work that way. So, like if you were selling cars, a lot of times the price of a Honda 2000, whatever is this basically your proprietary way of getting a commodity for less. You're not going to get it by by jipping people on the sale.
(19:09) Sure, you want to close at retail or as close to it as possible, but you're not going to buy a Honda and then all of a sudden sell it for 100 grand. So, you're going to make more of the money on where you buy and then you make up the difference on the sale at market rate. Whereas in the investing world, and this is what like I thought it functioned that way, but it assumed businesses were commodities.
(19:26) Think about this for a second. It assumed that okay, I'm just going to try and buy as many businesses as I can and buy them as for as low as possible. But the problem I was missing is that a really good business can outperform all of your bad ones with one good deal. For me, what I thought I was in was the high volume discount deals.
(19:45) The business that I was really in was learning how to say no at a much higher velocity to a much higher number of deals because you only need one Facebook. So, let's confront the real problem. At each stage, I've had these learning curves where I thought I knew what the business was about and then I realized what it was really about.
(20:04) The big hairy problem that I had to solve. Here's how I think through this. It can be painful because oftentimes we spend so much time trying to solve every other problem that we think we know how to solve rather than solving the one that we know we need to solve but don't know how to. That's a lot of times what makes that big hairy problem so hard is that you just don't know what to do.
(20:22) And this is why so many entrepreneurs start a second business because they're like, I don't know how to solve to grow this and past this one. And then they make up a reason and then they start another business because they think somehow the second business is going to be different than the first when in reality you're just going to reach a plateau that you don't know and then you're going to stop again. So you have to confront the issue.
(20:34) You have to confront the problem. And so this is how I mentally trick myself into getting to being okay with solving hard problems that I have no idea how to solve. I imagine myself, let's just this is purely hypothetical. All right, so let's say that I've got a business that's doing $10 million a year. You can use whatever zeros you want.
(20:52) Okay? And let's say that it's got, you know, $3 million in profit. Okay? So this is topline. This is bottom line, aka profit, leftover cashola, cheese, cheddar, lettuce, money in the bank account, whatever you want to say. So that's our top line, bottom line. Let's say that we've got this big hairy problem. So, we got this big hairy problem.
(21:16) Now, we think that if we solve this big hairy problem, we're going to be able to continue to grow the business to $20 million a year in topline revenue. And that three because we've covered a lot of our base, our fixed costs in the 10 million is actually going to jump all the way to like seven or eight million. All right. In profit. So, big a disproportionate profit increase with the increase in topline, which is not uncommon.
(21:34) So, here's what's crazy. This business might be worth somewhere in the neighborhood of $15 million. I'm just going to make an estimate that's a 5x on this $3 million. Okay? Now, this $8 million business might be closer to worth maybe like $72 million. That's with a 9x.
(21:58) And so, the difference between these two amounts is $57 million. That is a big a lot of dollars. Here's how I mentally trick myself. I say, "Man, this big hairy problem is big and hairy." But if someone paid me $57 million to solve it, would I be willing to solve it? I'm like, "Hell yeah, I'd probably solve it for a million dollars." And so, I've got this nice $56 million surplus of what I'm willing to do it for versus what it's actually worth.
(22:27) I tell our founders in the in in the portfolio, I say once once we figure out what this big hairy problem is, I always try and remember to do this and I say, "Hey, if we do this, this is going to lock $50 million enterprise value. This is going to lock $100 million in enterprise value if we solve this one problem.
(22:43) " There's a common saying in the in the venture capital world, which is, is this a feature or is this a bug? There are some businesses that I will see founders bang their heads against the wall being like, I have to solve the churn issue in my gym. I have to get it so no one leaves. I can tell you right now, you're never going to solve churn in fitness. You're not going to do it because it's a human problem. It's not a bug. It's a feature.
(23:06) We have to look at what are the features of our business versus what are the bugs of our business. The bugs of the business are the things that you can and should work on that can help you get to the next level. The features of the business is like this is the core way this business works. If you know for a fact that people are going to cancel fitness, because let's face it, people do, then what then becomes the issue? I need to build a marketing machine so that I never run out of people. Now, the good news, couple pieces of good news if you're in one of those businesses is
(23:30) that one, some people come back into the business, right? So, if people lose weight or they don't lose weight in two or three years, they might still want to lose weight and try again. Whereas, there's other companies, let's say your uh your internet bill, probably haven't switched providers in a while. Who does your banking for you? You probably have been with the same bank since you got a Looney Tunes account when you were six.
(23:48) And so you've probably had this around the same banks for a while because it's a pain to change and you probably don't care that much about it. And so for those businesses, they're all about aggregating market share and just having a really sticky customer base. But guess what? They have problems too. My former CFO gave me this piece of advice uh that I just absolutely loved.
(24:08) And I was I was griping to her one day about about basically features of this business. Like these are things that are absolutely true about this business. And I was basically just complaining because there's nothing I can do about it. and she said, "Alex, you know, I've been in in business and I've seen a lot of different businesses over my career.
(24:25) " She said, "The grass is always greener on the other side because no one sees that's fertilized with." And she's like, "It's all they're all every business has." But the idea is that every business has overhead. Every business has stuff that is features and there's bugs.
(24:45) Things that are wrong with your service that should get fixed and things that are inherent to the very nature of this business. There's core features inherent to every business and we just have to be able to confront the issue that is at hand. And often times it's big, it's hairy and it sucks. We got to make sure that we're not trying to spend all of our effort trying to fix a term problem that will literally never get fixed because you're trying to gas humans to stop being human. If you think about entrepreneurship as a video game, which I often do. All right.
(25:07) So, let's imagine that we've got these levels here. All right. So, we've got level zero. We got one, two, three, four, five, six, whatever. I should probably end on seven because seven feels like a better level to end on, but let's let's go with six. Maybe in the very beginning, you have to figure out what you're going to sell. All right? You've got a what.
(25:24) And the big issue at this point is that you just can't make decisions. You're completely indecisive. You can't commit to anything. You have this fallacy of the perfect pick. You think that that whatever you pick has to be the one thing that you're going to stick with the rest of your life.
(25:36) But the reality is that you're probably not because you don't even know what you're doing, right? you don't have the perspective from which to make a judgment. And the only way you can gain perspective in which to make a judgment is to actually pick something and then start and then gain more data. You have to do that first. Now, let's say that you graduate from that level and you actually made a selection. Congratulations. Now you have something to sell.
(25:52) So then you have to learn advertising 101 because no one's going to buy your thing unless they know about it, right? So you have to learn that skill. At every one of these levels, you will have entrepreneurs that just get to level one and then they they don't learn level two. Let's say that let's let's say level two is they learn how to profit. All right? They learn a business model around it that that they they wrap a business around it. Okay? Let's say that's that's level two.
(26:11) Well, they get to level one and then they say, "You know what? I just saw this thing over here that looks easier to scale up. So, I'm going to I'm going to race through level one and level two here." And they do. And here's the crazy part. This next business, they do this in onethird the time. And they're like, "Oh, yeah. This was a great idea.
(26:29) I just boom, look how fast I'm going." and then they crash into the same level again. They're still stuck at level two because they never learned it. The big hairy problem is typically the problem that you need to solve to get to the next level. And it typically requires an entirely different skill set. Most people can't confront that level of uncertainty or that level of dissatisfaction with themselves.
(26:48) And so they just start something else. This is and I will I will probably keep repeating this because it it needs repeating is that the woman in the red dress. All right, she is the distraction. And if you don't know what I'm talking about, in the Matrix, there's a moment where Morpheus is training Neo. They're walking through a busy city.
(27:11) Then all of a sudden, a woman in a red dress walks by. Morpheus is talking. Neo looks back. And then Morphe says, "Were you listening to me or were you looking at the woman in the red dress?" And he looks back at him and he says, "Look again." He looks again. There's a gun pointed at him. And he says, "Freeze.
(27:28) " He said, "This whole point, this training is to teach you one thing, which is that if you're not one of us, you're one of them. The one of us is if it's not the core business, it is a distraction from the core business." Because every one of these other things, every one of these other people in the street, every one of these other opportunities can look attractive because you don't know the [ __ ] on the other side.
(27:45) It's the grass is greener because it's on the other side of the fence. that if you got close to it, you'd see the manure that you had to sit in in order to get it to grow. The craziest part about all this is that you can beat just about everyone if you can stick with something for a few years. Hey, and real quick, if you're not sure what level of business you're at right now, I spent 200 hours this year just making this one project for you, which is the $und00 million scaling road map.
(28:11) And I broke up the stages of business into 10 stages. And you can identify where you're at by simply just putting in your business information. You go to acquisition.comroadmap and it'll spit out this custom report that tells you what the constraints are at that current level and what you need to do to graduate and get to the next level. This is our gift to you absolutely free.
(28:27) And if you're like, I'm not sure what the big hair problem is or I'm not sure what business I'm really in. On the thank you page, you can book a call with our team and we'd love to help you uh figure that out and ideally get past it. Let me conquer a big belief that is common among entrepreneurs.
(28:44) One of the biggest reasons that people will switch from their current business to the next business. There's two big ones. One is a fancy way of saying it's hard. This is the like I don't think my business is that scalable. And I'm like remember cities middle of the ocean. Rocket ships in space. Cars that drive themselves. Robots that are smarter than humans.
(29:03) Really? You think it's not scalable or you don't know how to scale it? Remember, let's flip it into a question. I don't know how. I don't know how to scale it. How do I scale a business like mine? So one is a difficulties thing. The other one that they do is that they will say I don't think this business can get to the size that I want for myself.
(29:21) Now I will put a big disclaimer here which is that if you want to be the richest person in the world, yes, you're going to probably have to do some sort of technology that has mass global appeal and it can't look like any of the technology businesses that already exist because those already exist. So it has to be a true denovo idea. And I'll tell you something else.
(29:39) If your goal is to become a trillionaire, you probably won't. And the reason for that is because the people who are the absolute richest in the world are missionaries, not mercenaries. They do it because they genuinely believe that this solution deserves to exist in the world and they're willing to eat glass for a very long time.
(29:58) Now, in your mind, and I say this as also an entrepreneur who has money goals, in your mind, a trillion dollars is just like you you just see that as winning because that means that you're the richest person in the world. But like, can you name the richest person in the world 30 years ago? You can't. It was that guy was number one. Can't name him. It wasn't Bill Gates.
(30:16) Do you know who Paul Getty was? Richest man in the world 100 years ago. 30 years he was richest man in the world. You can't name him. So this idea that you think of becoming the richest man in the world is going to somehow make you immune to impermanence. That you're going to that your life is going to now be meaningful because of that. It won't be. And I can also tell you that like a billion dollars is a lot of money.
(30:35) A hundred billion dollars is a lot of money. If you're not at that level, like I think having that goal is a bit silly because things will change as resources change, the map and the pieces in the board change as you develop as an entrepreneur under the assumption that you have what I would consider to be modest goals of let's say a hundred million.
(30:53) Let's say let's make that our modest goal. All right, so bear with me here. Every business in my opinion can get to $100 million enterprise value. I want to be clear here. I'm not saying every entrepreneur can get to $100 million. I'm not saying every every business as it currently stands can get to $100 million.
(31:10) I'm saying that there is a version of every business that's maybe adjacent or one or two steps away that can absolutely become it. So, let me give you an example. I have a restaurant. I don't think it's scalable and I don't think that I can be a 100 millionaire. Well, all we all we'd have to do to disprove this is say, is there anyone who's worth over a hundred million dollars in restaurants? Turns out there is.
(31:29) There's actually a ton of them. In fact, my neighbor above me is worth a dec 10 billion and he owns restaurants. Uh the guy who started Subway, who's the primary owner of Subway, one is a franchise model, the other is privately held. Okay, so you wait, so I definitely have to do you can do either of them, but you have to pick which one you're going to do, and you have to go all in for a period long period of time.
(31:53) And you might be like, well, yeah, sure, Subway. Well, let's let's play a fun game. How old do you think Subway is? 59 years old as of right now me making this video. How long do you think uh Andrew Churn and Peggy Churn of Panda Express have been doing Panda Express? 42 years. And so you're right.
(32:18) The five years you've been making your restaurant is probably not that close to the 59 years that Subway has. And you're like, "Oh, well maybe I'll be like Chick-fil-A 78 years." Can a restaurant business become a billion-dollar business as fast as a software company or technology company? No. But what did we say your goal was? You said 100 million bucks.
(32:38) That means you have to get about $10 million in profit in the business between now and the time you die. Doable. That's not a promise. That's not a guarantee. I'm just saying it's doable. Even if you're like, "Okay, well, I have a dry cleaning business." Okay. Well, we can make that into a franchise model and then scale that way.
(32:56) We can privately own them and just keep compounding the the business. And what is what's the what business are we really in when we're in dry cleaning? Honest truth, I don't know. I've never been in it. What I would do is I'd talk to a bunch of dry cleaning people, what sucks the most about the business? Maybe talent's not that hard in dry cleaning because maybe the the skills of maning a dry cleaning business are not that tough.
(33:13) Maybe the issue is the machines break a lot and you're actually like, "Actually, I'm in the logistics and, you know, machining business. I need a lot of tech inside of that business." Okay. Well, that's the business you're in. Ask people who are in the business what the hardest part of it is.
(33:25) Oftentimes they'll give you the big hairy problem and then you just get to say is that the type of problem that I'd prefer to solve. And this is a frame that Leila uses a lot that I love when we're when we're helping an entrepreneur make a big a big decision.
(33:37) They'll say hey there's these two paths I have in front of me and I'm not sure should I do the franchise, should I do the private held model right now. The big overarching thing that no one seems to mention is we might ask what's the goal? But what the subtext underneath of that is in what timeline? Because almost all goals are accomplishable on a long enough timeline. Now, back to the two paths. Let's say that you're making that decision.
(34:00) I want to I want to start a franchise or I want to keep privately held. Okay, if this is the path, what you want to do is you want to adequately be able to know what the big hairy problem is in each of those paths because there's one and they're different. And then you ask the followup question which is which of these problems would I rather have? Followup to that is which problem do I feel more equipped to solve today? And so that gives you a lot of insight because a lot of times people want to think about the upside but the downside mitigation is what gets you to the
(34:28) upside. Elon has this really great quote that he has from somebody else but he says entrepreneurship is a lot like staring into the abyss and eating glass. The staring in the bis part is because you're constantly facing the uncertainty of the business and existential risk to the business every single day feeling like it might not work.
(34:46) On the eating glass side, it's that entrepreneurship is the most efficient funnel for having nothing but bad news. So think about it like this. There are problems that are very hard to solve and there are problems that people don't want to solve. You get to have the best of both. As in you get problems that no one wants to solve and they're really hard, right? Problems that are hard that people want to solve, they'll still work on them for you.
(35:10) Uh problems that are easy that people don't want to do, ah you can usually pay someone enough, but like it's solvable. But it's the ones that really suck and no one wants that you get to have. And what happens is this becomes your lens of the world because you just think all day every day is problems that absolutely blow and no one wants to do that. But you have to do it because who else is going to do it? It's your business.
(35:27) Every single day it's just trudging through this muck. And you think that somehow another business is going to have different mechanics. But this is a feature of entrepreneurship, not a bug. Entrepreneurship is the mechanics of entrepreneurship and ownership, specifically being CEO, being the person who's calling the shots.
(35:46) That's your life and that's what you get compensated for. And so there's a lot of romanticism about entrepreneurship. The freedom that entrepreneurship gives you. Well, it depends how big you want to go. Because basically the day that you stop eating glass, the day that you you you stop dealing with that is the day that in my opinion you sacrifice somebody for potential for comfort.
(36:05) And I think that's okay. I think it's totally okay. But that's a trade you get to choose to make. But at the end of the day, I said that there was two big reasons that people say, "I think I should switch my business." One is that the business I have is currently not scalable.
(36:17) Hopefully, I've popped that balloon for you. And the other is that I don't think that this thing could become super big. Well, we have to ask the question, how big? And why do you want it to be that big? Is if it's just for you go, you're probably never going to make it because it's too hard and you already have satisfied your material needs.
(36:35) So, the reason that those massive companies exist is because the people who started them genuinely thought that it's almost like their purpose in life was to do this service for the world. And as a result, the company continued to grow and they were willing to deal with all the glass for that entire period of time. We talk about Jeff Bezos with Amazon. You know, it's only just been like a chill 30 years for Amazon, 35. Like we talk about these fast growth tech like Facebook's like 20some years old.
(36:55) At the end of the day, you're going to have this choice. I want you to know that there is absolutely a version of your business that can become $100 million. I really genu like I have a very hard time having someone convince me that there's not a version of just about any business because there's because because of this, no matter how small the niche is, there's eight billion people in the world. And so with online, we can now access them.
(37:21) This might not have been true 30 years ago, but today it kind of is. Anything brick and mortar, you can scale nationally. Now, if you're like, well, I'm in a country that only has seven seven people. Okay. Well, then guess what? You become international. But are you saying it's impossible or difficult? Want to make sure we're clear here. I don't know how to go international.
(37:38) Do you think no one else has gone international before? Oh, people have done it. Therefore, it is possible. Therefore, I can learn it. I think about these big hairy problems because this is what hopefully the entire point of this video is figuring out the business you're really in and being able to confront the problem ahead of you so that you don't switch paths and you actually solve the thing that gets you to the next level.
(37:55) While you're going through this, I think that there's this personal experience that you have to learn the difference between which is what's good hard and what's bad. And this actually ladders up to a very classic entrepreneurial question of do I push or do I pivot? And you're like, wait a second, I thought you said that uh I shouldn't switch new things. It's different.
(38:14) The good kind of hard is when you have underlying assumptions that you believe to be true from first principles and just have to push through via iteration. That sounded like a bunch of words. So, let me just give you an example. So, if I want to start running TikTok ads for one of our companies because we we decide like you know what, one of the things the big hairy problem here is that we don't know how to advertise on paid and that's what's that's what it's going to take for us to unlock. Okay.
(38:31) Well, if I sell to accountants, right, I would say okay, are there accountants on TikTok? And the answer would be yes. And so it's like, okay, well, is there a way that we can run ads profitably to get our messaging in front of those people? If the answer is yes, then I fundamentally believe that there's a profitable way to turn those eyeballs into customers. Period. Now, you might have run a Tik Tok ad to get accountants and not gotten them.
(38:48) But it doesn't mean that getting accountants on TikTok is impossible. It's just you don't know how to do it. Again, solvable. And you might be like, "Ah, but that's going to be hard." Remember, there's going to be a big dollar sign, a big price tag associated with solving that problem. Let's say if we we start running ads and we don't immediately see ROI.
(39:06) That's the good kind of art because we can iterate. Remember I said good kind is you iterate, right? Do we get enough clicks? Do we get enough optins? Are they the people who opt in are the right type of people? If not, maybe we need to change the messaging, change the targeting, right? All these are just iterative. But it's not that it's impossible. It's just it takes work. This is iterative hard. That's good hard.
(39:22) To be clear, I don't see losing money on ads as losing money. I see it as investing in something that's going to increase the enterprise value by creating another acquisition channel and simultaneously diversifying how we get customers. And so having multiple acquisition channels meaningfully increases enterprise value without even having additional profit because it decreases the risk for the acquirer as in the person who's going to buy the company. Right? If I have two ways of getting customers, I feel way better. If I had six ways of getting customers, I
(39:45) feel even better than that. But not only that, each of the six ways also brings more customers. So it also grows the business and decreases the risk. It's one of the most valuable things you can do in a business.
(39:56) And so it would make sense that the reason it's such a valuable thing to do in the business is because it's hard. It's hard. It's why most people don't do it, which is why it is valuable and it is rare. I can't say that I want this really rare outcome and then at the same breath say I'm not willing to do very rare levels of work. So let's let's do a hypothetical.
(40:14) So if a business is worth $10 million, okay, and I can add a second acquisition channel that doubles the revenue and diversifies the risk, that might add $15 million enterprise value. So, if I lose $100,000 figuring out Tik Tok ads over six months, but I get a $10 million return on it, would I do it? Absolutely. But the thing is is I say this and people nod their heads or they're listening and they're like, "Yeah, I believe that.
(40:40) " But you have to see these as investments in the business. like I'm going to invest this time and this money and I am willing to not see success for this period of time before deciding to truly call it. And honestly the when you decide to truly call it is just your ability to deal with pain.
(40:58) So there's something about human behavior around this which comes down to frustration tolerance. So the basic behavior is how many times you try something again before you quit and this typically has to do with your history of being reinforced after multiple attempts. So I'll give you a very simple example. If you say, "Hey, I'm not going to buy something from you.
(41:16) " And the salesman says, "Well, like, have you thought about it like this or have you thought about like that?" The amount of times that that salesman is willing to both follow up and ask again on the call is directly proportional to the amount of times in his past or her past that after asking a second, third, fourth, fifth time, they were rewarded for doing so.
(41:34) And so, if someone gets rewarded, again, intermittent reinforcement doesn't mean they have to get reinforced every time they ask five times. If they get reinforced enough times that they ask five times, they will ask five times every time. So if you have a dog and they come to the table and you give them food because they beg, right? Then what do you do? You reinforce begging. So they come back and they beg.
(41:54) Now if they come back and then you don't give it to them because you execute your willpower and they sit there and they're like and they you still don't give them food. Fine. What do they do tomorrow? They come back again. And what do you do tomorrow? You don't give it to them. What do they do the next day? They come back again. Okay, they come back again. And here's the crazy part.
(42:12) Let's say that let's say that they come back five, six times. If on the sixth time you give it to them again, you've just taught them that they have to wait for extended periods of time. You've rewarded them trying again and again and again and again. Entrepreneurs, we are like this too.
(42:31) And if you're newer to the game, then I would encourage you to increase your frustration tolerance. can't manufacture the win that you're going to have, but this is why I try to make these videos is that the amount of times that it has taken me a hundred iterations to get an ad campaign to work is a lot. And so now I just have a fundamental belief.
(42:51) I'm like, if we keep working on this, we will make this work because down to fundamentals, there are eyeballs here and we can pay to to reach them. And there's no reason physically why we can't get them to take a click and then ultimately buy our thing. We just aren't good enough. And so we just have to look, are there people who could buy my stuff on this platform? Is there a way to reach them? And can I do this profitably? Yes. Great. Then we will make money on a long enough time horizon.
(43:08) And so the only thing we have to do is just not run out of money while we try. That's it. But here's the thing. Let's say that and I said I said that this is what this looks like in reality. You make this decision to make this investment because you see the big price tag on the other side, right? And you say it would be reasonable for me to spend $100,000, a million dollar, whatever the number is for you in six months to get this thing that's going to double our acquisition, right? Of course you would make that investment. But the
(43:31) first month you spend a hundred grand and then you don't make money back. People throw their hands up and they're like, "Ah, it doesn't work for me." Of course it didn't work the first time. This is why you get paid to solve big problems. The types of problems that occur in entrepreneurship is they're all one of a kind.
(43:44) And you're like, "Wait a second. I thought business behaving patterns." Absolutely. So, I think there's this great uh, you know, like history doesn't repeat itself, but it rhymes. It's the same thing in business. Like if I knew every single thing that I was going to do with every business that I started of, then it would be instant, right? you'd be instantly instantly bigger. But no, there's similarities.
(44:07) There's patterns that you recognize, but you're like, "Okay, we're going to have to turn on paid ads, but we've never done this for B2B on Tik Tok. So, we're going to have to learn that little nuance in this setting." And even if you've done B2B on Tik Tok, maybe you haven't done B2B on Tik Tok for accounting, but you did it for for for marketing agencies, right? So, like, okay, fine, we did that. All right. Well, like there's always going to be more nuance because I can always say, cool.
(44:26) Well, you did that a year ago, but what about today? So the idea that you're going to know the solution is is a false belief that will make entrepreneurship significantly harder for you or at least more painful for you. I said earlier in this little diet tribe that I just went on, there's good kind of hard and there's bad kind of hard. So what's bad kind of hard? Bad kind of hard is when your underlying assumptions are proven incorrect.
(44:49) So this is the classic push or pivot, right? So if we've pivoted several times, but I've pushed a lot more. So you pivot when your underlying assumptions are proven incorrect. Meaning so let's say for example if a report came out saying Tik Tok had banned accountants from the platform then I would say we don't push on Tik Tok.
(45:07) The underlying assumption was there are people here we can reach them profitably. Well the underlying assumption is wrong. That's not true. So at that point we have to pivot to a different platform or different advertising method. And so I just use this as a clear test of when I'm being stubborn versus when I'm being intelligent.
(45:24) And so before making a big investment, I like to identify what I call the need to believes, right? Or the assumptions that I believe to be true or must believe to be true in order for the remainder to follow as desired, right? So as long as those assumptions are true, we keep pushing. And if one of those assumptions is proven wrong with supporting data, then you change.
(45:42) And so fundamentally, that's the ignorance tax we all pay is that sometimes you have these assumptions because you can't know everything. You're not God. Can't know everything. Sometimes you got to find out on your own. and you find out that assumption that I had is not true. And that was kind of like the whole thing this was predicated on. And so then you pivot.
(45:59) You find something else out that is true that you didn't know was true before. And then you make your change. I tell the story in my $100 million offers book of good friend of mine who had a technology business. So you think, oh technology, this is something that, you know, obviously it's going to be cutting edge. But what he chose to do was try and turn around a dying industry. So he tried to turn around newspapers.
(46:20) So, we said, "Hey, I'm going to take you into the digital age, and we're going to have an ad product for you that'll take all your print ads and turn them into online ads on your site." And it's just, you know, you can use our software to do it. It's one click, whatever. It's very easy. With that, you think, okay, that business makes sense. You're going to transition these guys over. It gives them a whole another thing that they can sell. Cool. Groovy.
(46:40) Now, what was the problem with the business? What are the need to believes in that business? The need to believes are that newspapers with their inherent business model are going to continue to exist in order for that business to be viable. Now, at the onset, you might get into that business thinking, well, yeah, I'm going to help them convert. That makes sense.
(46:58) But if those businesses cease to exist, there is no one left to convert because all the people have just switched their consumption to other platforms. And so, in that instance, that's what I consider bad hard. That's like the underlying assumption of this business is no longer true. It's proven incorrect. We thought that they would continue to exist.
(47:15) We could flip them over and they'd generate the same revenue as they were before. And so then we'd have this massive market to go after. But in reality, many of them just went out of business. And so there's really no one to go after. The few that did that you could go after continue to shrink over time. Not a good market to go after. That is a bad heart.
(47:29) It's the kind of hard that you can't fix. In that setting, you have to pivot. He would then have to ask the question, okay, what other businesses could I add digital ads to? And then at that point, you'd have to say, okay, maybe I could take blogs and make ads, make it make a network of blogs and that's kind of more new age traffic and help them either cross- sell across each others and, you know, basically create this network of traffic. Like that would be an interesting business. Again, there'd be need to around that as well. At that point, you'd have to have a real
(47:58) existential question of like who do we want to be when we grow up? Because who we thought we wanted to be ain't going to work out. Little little subtext here. It's very rare in what I would consider traditional businesses to have a need to believe that's actually not true. If you're an accountant, you're in lawn care, you're in your plumbing business, you're you sell, you know, website design, notwithstanding AI for the for the time being and robots taking over. Notwithstanding those two things, for the last however many years, 50, 60, 80
(48:29) years, those businesses, more or less, you not being able to scale them was a you problem. It was fundamentally you didn't know how. That was it. There wasn't anything wrong with the market. There's nothing wrong with HVAC. There's nothing wrong with plumbing, nothing wrong with lawn care. All those things are going to continue to exist.
(48:46) And so, if you were limited in what any kind of business that I would consider a normal business, just know that there's nothing to do with the scalability of your business. It's your ability to scale that is the problem. Yours. And so at the end of the day, a lot of entrepreneurs get into this for some sort of freedom or some sort of monetary goal or because they want to solve a problem or a combination of all three.
(49:03) But we fundamentally get paid to solve big hairy problems. And the bigger and hairier the problem in general, the bigger and harrier the payoff. Paul Graham said this quote on Twitter the other day and I really liked it. He said, "If you want to make a million dollars, you must endure a million dollars of pain.
(49:21) I like to consider how much enterprise value I'll get on the other side of this concrete wall than to bash my head into. If the number is big enough and I've got a strong enough helmet, I will keep bashing into it so I can get to the other side. And that's what keeps motivating me. So, as long as I'm solving the right kinds of problems, the ones where I can reason to first principles that there is a solution. And that solution will make money, then I keep going.
(49:39) And if I get to the bottom of it and I find out that my underlying assumption is wrong, I have to change. And that's just as hard. For the entrepreneurs who are stuck, who are listening to this, who are watching this, identify the business that you're really in. Confront the big hairy problem in front of you. Don't jump ship thinking that some reason the grass is greener or that the woman in the red dress is somehow different and not crazy from the woman that you're married to right now. She just has a different kind of crazy and you'll discover that in time. So, you might as well be happy with the one you got because you know
(50:04) what you need to do to make this person happy and you keep forging. And then you decide whether or not you want to push or you want to pivot based on the underlying assumptions. And if you push, focus on making progress and breaking through that wall because the payoff is on the other side and that's what makes entrepreneurship worthwhile.
(50:20) Now, this was all very theoretical because, you know, obviously it applies to a lot of different businesses. If you want to see me apply these same concepts of how to actually push through the walls for a business to get it to break through to the next level, I have a video here that you're absolutely going to love of me breaking down a real business and helping them scale.

Business Owners: You're (Probably) Not Good Enough - YouTube
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Luvfw14pVx4

Transcript:
(00:00) if you've ever not gotten the deal or you've ever not had someone believe in you you've been doubted because of the way you look how old you are how young you are what gender you are where you're born where you're not born the way you dress the way you look the way you talk then the question isn't whether that bias is true cuz it may absolutely be true but the question is what do we do about it anyways and how can we confront the other alternative reality that might be true which is what if you're just not good enough now what there was a lady
(00:26) who made a post and she said I quit my job to start doing this because my boss didn't respect me because I was a woman and so because of that um I quit my job to start doing this and I had this immediate thought in my head what if you're just not good enough that was the thought that came through my mind when I read that message and it got me fired up because the amount of times in my life that I've seen this victimized mentality hurt people is far more than it has ever helped and so the reason I want to talk
(01:08) about this is because it applies to employees it applies to business owners and I have so many stories of this that I want to drive through this and then I want to drive to the two natural conclusions that end up coming from logic all right and so this is the same thing as the kid who says hey um I started this marketing agency and I've you know I've got these services and I'm trying to go to these business owners and they're saying well they're not buying for me because I'm a kid right I'm too young right I had a a family
(01:34) member who had a restaurant and he opened it up in the wrong part of town and he was like well my restaurant's not working because people don't want to come to this this side of the this side of the neighborhood they have bias against side this side of the neighborhood and I'll give you another one which was uh Jacob who was my neighbor my little 15-year-old neighbor from way back when when I walked in on him trying to sell a wholesale deal and he got off the phone and he'd been trying to sell wholesale deals for you
(02:01) know a month cuz he' read some stuff on the internet watched some YouTube videos and I was like so you know how's it working he was and he was like well no one's no one's really you know buying yet and I could tell that on some level it was because he thought that he was too young and people aren't taking him seriously so one of our portfolio companies had two people who were in a conflict all right so there was a white guy and a black guy and they were peers and they had to work together and they didn't like each other and so finally we
(02:29) had to be like y'all need to get along figure it out and so the white guy sends the black guy a song and it's his like way of of trying to make amends and the song was a a rap song and it had some lyrics in it that offended the black guy and he said you know this is not racially sensitive blah blah blah blah blah and he then asked for the white guy to go through racial sensitivity training and here's where this gets interesting the black guy is married to a a white girl and has mixed kids and the white guy is married to a black girl
(03:05) and has mixed kids do you think he [ __ ] needs racial sensitivity training no he just doesn't like you for the content of your character and so there's a very significant possibility that it might not be because you're too young it might not be because you're black it might not be because you're a woman it might not be because you're a republican it might not be because you're a Democrat it might not be because you're trans you just might not be good enough and the thing is is that even if you're right even if there is a
(03:30) [ __ ] bias because biases will exist I'm not even going to deny that they absolutely exist and they will always exist and the reason they will always exist is because this is how human beings learn you learn and you create judgments to to wish for a world that doesn't create bias wishes for a world where humans don't learn if you go and you're a waitress and you serve a table and it's all people with red faces and those red faces leave you zero tip and then you go to a table with green faces and the green faces leave you a big tip
(03:59) and then you do that again and again and the red faces leave you lower tips then the green faces and the green faces leave you big tips what will you do you will begin to expect that red faces leave you no tip and green faces leave you big tip now replace red and green with tall white asian woman whatever the point is is that people will learn and as long as there are stereotypes that exist because people do behave in a certain way then people are going to learn those things period but the thing is is let's say you're a red face and
(04:25) you do tip well and you hate the fact that when you walk to a place they don't treat you a certain way right and the thing is is that biases exist everywhere and I want to be clear here when I got into the gym space I was young I was so youngl looking that I knew no one took me seriously and so I lied about being the owner I lied so when people came in I just said I'm the owner and IID worked out a deal that I would I would potentially earn in my ownership so I had this whole backstory that I made up in the beginning because I look so young
(04:56) that no one would believe that I was the one who owned the gym and so I'm saying this because I I get it and to be fair I look the way I look if I have a tank top on like we moved into a very nice Penthouse my neighbors immediately complained about me he literally sent to the the email to the front desk of the building and said is what is this Beverly Hillbillies who moved in next to us I'm not kidding and so the thing is is that I mean I thought it was [ __ ] hilarious I died I thought it was great but the thing is is that what does that
(05:26) mean he has a bias against people who look like me right who who wear white beaters and walk around like that on a regular basis and he thinks wow this guy I've had negative experiences with people like him and so the thing is is I have a friend from college way back when black guy and he hated that there was a stereotype that black people don't tip he hated it and so rather than try and say this is unfair the world is unfair this bias exists you know what he did he was always really nice and and he always over tipped that was what he did he over
(06:03) tipped because the thing is is that let's let's play out the scenarios you bitching moan and you say you know what this person didn't buy because I'm young this person didn't buy because I'm a woman this person didn't buy because of whatever and the thing is is let's say you you do some empirical study and you prove it right now what great you prove that you have a disadvantage okay again now what hey if you want to get around people who are actually winning who look like you who smell like you who talk like you and
(06:31) are doing what you want to do I'd like to invite you to the the school games community at school.com games I take calls in there I put content that's like this and more personalized inside of that community and I drop a huge amount once a month an 8 Hour training on how to actually take this stuff and win anyways and so if that's interesting school.
(06:50) com forgames see you in there the thing is is that arguing for for proving a bias is good for society bad for the individual and as far as we're concerned this is a single player game life and so we've got to go through it with the assumption that nothing's going to change and what are we going to do about it anyways because no one gets better by feeling sorry for themselves no single person has ever gotten better by proving that they were the victim of something ever and so whether you're an employee and you're getting you feel like you're
(07:17) getting passed up for the promotion and the amount of times that we get this too like I'm a business owner we have a lot of businesses we have a lot of employees and the thing is is that if someone gets passed up maybe there is a bias because biases will always exist but the only thing you can do is be better than the bias you have to be better than the bias you have to be so [ __ ] good that you have to be you have to overcompensate he didn't tip normally he tipped more than normal so that he could be one one light
(07:48) on the bad dots that he felt that the people who had served him in the past had experienced and so to give you a the a story that I had with Jacob so he was the young kid he sounded like a child on the phone and the reason they weren't buying the deals from him was because he sounded like a [ __ ] child on the phone and the thing is is that what if they're right and I think this is where people get even more offended it's like what if the bias that you have what if what if what if the bias that You' you've experienced against what if it's
(08:17) true and this is where people get what if I do act like a hillbilly right what if I do act what if what if I did act immature because I was young now what and so the thing is is that one if you prove that there's a bias again so what now you've proven that there's a bias your life's not any better version two what if they're right so one you're proving that there's a bias and you don't act that way the next the next vein of thinking is what if what if they're right about it what if you just you are exactly The Stereotype
(08:51) what if I am immature what if I don't show up on time what if I am emotional because I'm because I act like a child because I haven't matured yet because I haven't enough experience in life now what if I'm not consistent because I haven't learned that skill yet which most more young people have that than old people old people are notoriously consistent they love their routines eight how many 80 year olds do you know who don't have routines hard to not have one when you're 80 right you have to break the stereotype
(09:17) of old people by by being spontaneous right and so the thing is is like these stereotype exist because biases exist because we're going to always learn we're always going to make judgments but it comes down to whether your restaurant on the wrong side of the street whether you have a red face or a green face or you're short and girls girls don't like short guys okay if you believe the bias then you make it true you make it real you give it more power rather than less and so I look like this I look probably in terms of like my look I probably look
(09:50) right leaning I probably look a little bit hillbilly is if I take if I put the wife beater on then I definitely look Dumber in general I mean when I had my gym people I had many people asked me if I was literate but as soon as I opened my mouth it became apparent that I was educated and so the thing is and here's here's my silver lining for this is that if you have a bias you actually have the opportunity to stand out even more by being against it if if a green face tips more than a red like than a just tips a
(10:22) lot then it's like well I expected a green face to tip more but if a red face tips a lot you're like whoa I know noticed that if a guy in a suit sounds literate and sounds educated you're not really surprised there because it's what you expected but if a jack guy and a beater who looks like a hick and maybe had doesn't have hillbilly views of the world isn't a racist might have a more articulate way of expressing things then all of a sudden you pause and that person becomes more interesting they start to break the bias they start to be
(10:57) better than the bias you start to create a category that's separate for that individual so there are many red faces but this one is John and John's cool John tips well the thing is is that I think all of us have the opportunity to be John or Sarah who who is a redface who there are there are biases that exist but we can be better than the bias and I love this I love this quote from from Andy forcella it's so good I [ __ ] wish it were mine he said personal Excellence is the ultimate rebellion and I just [ __ ]
(11:29) love that and so the question is always what are you going to do about it proving that it exists does nothing you just prove that there's you have a disadvantage okay we all have disadvantages in some way to some person like if I go into a place that has had a lot of guys in flannels who said racist things to them as soon as I walk in the room there's going to be a bias against me they're not going to like me by right at the onset and so what can I do you can play into the bias I can complain CL that there's a bias or
(12:01) I can overcompensate I can tip more than anyone normally does I can be more kind more understanding more literate I can work harder and so I'm going to wrap this to to to Jacob because I I'll tell you the story obviously I said listen I think you suck at sales I think it has nothing to do with the fact that you're young and so you got to learn and he's like well how do I learn and I like well you got to do more than everybody else and I'm going to give you the advice that I told him and I would say that he says has changed his life and so I will
(12:26) share it with you and this goes for the employees this also goes for the business owners it work works for everyone which is I said volume negates luck I said if you want to be the best find the best guy in my company so I got him an interview I said I will not get you the job I said I can get you an interview because the guy who's going to be hiring you I was like it's up to him and he's got 10 other guys he's been interviewing and so he decided to give him the give him a shot right that's I mean at gym launch in sales like getting
(12:52) a job is getting a shot that's all it is you still got to work your leads you still got to go generate you got to generate sales and so he got on the phones and I said go find the best guy look at what he does and do twice as much because you have to do twice as much cuz he's better than you you can't do as much as the best guy cuz he's always just going to get ahead you have to do what he's doing and another full day's work so that you can start catching up and so he started doing twice as much as what the best guy was
(13:14) doing and so over time he became the best guy on the outbound team and then he became and then he moved up to the middle sales team and became the best guy on the qualification team which is the second the second highest level of sales guys that we have and then from there being the best guy and here's the thing here's the the [ __ ] thing because he was so young he's 18 years old 18 years old all the guys who were my closers were all men with families like they were professionals it was a strong team it still is a strong team
(13:43) and the sales manager a man with a family said he he was hesitant he had a bias against him because he was young he said listen I I'm not going to just let you on the team now he had objectively had better stats as a Setter and anybody who had been 30 years old or the family would have absolutely gotten put on The Closer team but he said I want you to go self-generate end to end click to close you go find someone in the [ __ ] world bring them all the way and close them yourself before I let you on the closing
(14:12) team he had never asked anyone else to do that and so he did after he did one he was like I need you to do another one to make sure it wasn't a fluke so he did another one and he said you know what just because I want the team to be really sure because you're young and I and he had the bias of oh Alex knows you So you you're getting special treatment because Alex knows you you're the you're the friend of the bosses right and so he's like you got to do another one so he had to do another one and then when he got on the team what did he where did
(14:42) he start low man low man on the totem he was young and he had the bias of oh your your boss is pet right he had to have both of these biases against him because nobody likes that guy right and I told him that I said they're going to not like you because you're young and they're not going to like you because they know you know me and I was like you need to leave no [ __ ] room for doubt that you earned it I was like and so you're going to be left of center you're going to start 6 feet underground before you can get your head over I was like
(15:09) that's what it is and I was like either you can [ __ ] and moan about it and you can lose and and be right and be right about the fact that you're going to have a bias against you or you can win win anyways and so what did he do he became the top performing sales rep with all the grown ass men and their family was there bias yes did he have to do more to get on the team yes did he have to prove himself in ways that no one else had to yes and so if you're in that position and you feel like you have this bias against you here's what I would ask if
(15:43) you're an employee and this is what I would encourage the business owners who are listening to this ask this question what would it take what would it take for me to get on the team what would it take for me to be the manager what would it take for me to be the director What would it take for me to get a raise what would it take for me to get a promotion if I'm the business owner trying to get the deal what would it take for us to do business together what would it take for you to say yes what would I have to do
(16:10) objectively I get that you've got some you've got hesitation I understand that I'm young I understand that I got in here because I had some other guy who tapped somebody else's shoulder and got me an interview day one I get that I understand that so what would it take let me compensate let me not just tip normal I'm not going to tip 20% because other people who look like me don't tip 20 I was like I'll tip 100 just tell me what would it take to change your mind what would it take for me to not look like a hick or for you to not think
(16:38) that I'm completely illiterate or uneducated what would it take no one benefits from the excuse you hurt you more by accepting that the excuse is real because what the excuse of the of saying that there is bias and that the bias is the reason that you have not moved forward is that it gives you an excuse for not succeeding that's all it does it gives you a nice warm blink to say I'm not winning but this is the reason why because the alternative reason of saying I'm just not good enough hurts your ego and to be clear I not saying that
(17:11) bias doesn't it absolutely exists but we have to live in a world that it does exist and win anyways and so I'll show you I'll show you a note that I Leave myself because I I get in the same everybody everybody's got [ __ ] and so I'll show you what the background on my phone is right now this is the season I'm in if you can see that it says just win that's it it says just win two words at the end of the day winners write history and if you win in the end if you become the top performing sales rep that's all that matters and the only
(17:50) people who care about the biases are the ones who lose because those are the those biases are the things that soften their head when they when they put their head down on their pillow at night because it makes them feel okay it doesn't hurt their ego as much to say you know if I didn't have this bias I would have won but no one remembers them how much stronger of a story is it that you win despite the bias you win despite the disadvantage Oprah will always have my eternal respect for being the first female black billionaire who built a
(18:22) media [ __ ] Empire in the [ __ ] 80s no one else can do that and so that's the thing is that the number of biases that you have to act against you becomes the more compelling story that no one else who doesn't have those biases will ever be able to tell and if there's if there's anything that gives me hope it's that is that you get the opportunity you have this one unique opportunity that you get to be an example you get to be an inspiration to other people who have red faces who have green faces who are too young who are
(18:53) too old because those B like I didn't get hired for the tech job because I'm too old you're not going to fix bias because it's wishing that humans won't learn and that's never going to happen but you can still win by simply asking what would it take and accepting the only thing that you can control which is that there is bias and the reason I did not win is because I'm just not good enough yet I'm just not undeniable enough yet now I might be good enough if I had a green face but I'm not good enough if I have a red face so I got to
(19:24) get that much [ __ ] better it's the only thing that you can control and so whether you're a business owner and that restaurant that's on the wrong side of the street if you have the best pizza in the city people will go to the hood where it's unsafe to get the pizza everybody knows a restaurant where you're like it's kind of on the wrong side of town it's a little bit seedy but man that Indian curry is [ __ ] off the hook everybody you know that spot now do they have to be better than other places that are in safer nicer parts of town
(19:57) yes but it doesn't mean that it's impossible it just means the bar is higher and the only thing that we have control over is whether we're willing to make the [ __ ] climb and so I saw that post and I was feeling spicy about it because the thing is is like she was using that as the as the Catalyst for her quitting her job to start a start a business and I'm and I'm all about that that's fine that's awesome take take take take your life into your own control but do not for a second because I know that that belief
(20:24) will not serve her her saying I didn't get promoted because I was a woman I didn't get respected because I was a woman and believe me I know Lea doesn't get nearly enough credit for all the stuff she doesn't act if she was a guy if she was just a dude and it was just Alex and Dan and Dan was a 50-50 partner of mine Dan would get shitload more credit than Ila Lila's a woman and she's my wife and so the bias that exists against her is that how many business guys have their wife they say she's the CEO CEO and really she's just she's just
(20:57) a secretary right she's just a help her really just has some doing some admin task so many people to this day we show up to a business conference and other business guys treat her like that so what she GNA do she's just got to be that much [ __ ] better and if you knew Lea which many of you guys don't if you really knew Lila she loves it she loves it she's like we're gonna [ __ ] murder him lela's way more hardcore than I am you guys just don't know that Lea's got a [ __ ] Dark Side you guys just don't know which is great I love it I think
(21:31) letting some of that dark side out and and beating the [ __ ] out of that victim mentality that you have that because we want to we want to lean into it we want to we want to we it feels so much better to say I didn't win because of outside thing because it makes us feel better I'm I'm good I'm good enough just but there's this thing my restaurant is good enough it's just on the wrong side of the street right I really am good at sales I'm just but you know they don't give me the advancement because I knew Alex or because I'm too young and I you
(21:59) know I'll just wait a couple what would it take what would it take for me to become undeniable for me to be bulletproof I want to have no chinks in the armor nothing that anyone can hold against me to say that I am not the best for this thing and if there is a deal that you need and there's a guy who who like was beat the hell in high school from guys who had flannel flannels and he hates those people and I don't get the deal guess what there's other people that will give me the deal and you just keep moving forward

Transcript:
(00:01) what's going on everyone happy tuesday hope you guys are pumped uh for today's podcast slash video uh i've been looking forward to this one for a little bit and uh if i sound a little bit stuffed up it's because i have two massive tubes that are like four inches long in each of my nostrils uh but that was no reason to not give you guys some sick stuff uh for business stuff and this is mostly just for me too so uh anyways buckle up hope you enjoy so today what i want to talk about is the perfect business and so believe it or not this is
(00:26) actually something i talk a lot about um not as much publicly but what i like if if we were to talk in person and talk talk shop about business i i love talking about business models i love talking about uh just monetization structures in general uh writing books specifically modification structures uh so really excited about it but uh i just recently finished uh berkshire hathaway university which is basically uh uh the consolidated 30 years of shareholder uh the the war buffett a trolley bugger the the you know the co-founders coach
(00:59) sheriffs etc of of berkshire hathaway they do these yearly shareholder events and these guys are both billionaires now they're both in their high 90s which is crazy they've been investing for 50 plus years investing for 50 plus years and they've built a you know kajillion dollar empire um i think as of today it's worth half a trillion um which is just nuts their return on capital was 2 million percent so when they started where they when they acquired berkshire hathaway which was a publicly traded company at the time was a textile
(01:28) company they uh the stock was nineteen dollars i believe actually no they offered to buy war buff it out at eleven dollars and thirty cents uh i love fifty anyways doesn't matter point is is that it was it was between 11 and 20 right and at this point that same stock is worth 377 000 all right so that's a that's a 20 000 x return so if you so his odd put thousand dollars in it's not worth 200 million all right that's how crazy this is and over you know 30 years of shareholder things there's many times where he gives little
(02:03) nuggets of wisdom of what he's looking at uh when he's buying a business or what he what he believes to be valuable businesses and uh i was really it was cool for me because uh i have always had three main things that i look for businesses and in reading his book or the book that was about his shareholder readings i added two uh two to that list and so i wanted to share those with you today all right and uh the moniker that i have had for this is i'm gonna i'm gonna share with you is unique expensive sticky air and i said there's five there's four
(02:47) words here that's okay because i'm going to show the last one in a second but unique expensive sticky air so what i'm looking for like in my mind of what a perfect business is it's unique expensive sticky here and i've explained each one of these so unique is something uh and i'll even tell you one of the things that he said in his shareholder video that i found really just it was just so it was so short and so like packed that i loved it um he said in response to what is an ideal business in one of the one of the
(03:12) meetings he said uh something that costs a penny sells for a buck it is habit-forming and it was so succinct it's so great and reading some of the other stuff he's got other other things but that one was three of the five in three sentences right so they cost a penny sells for a dollar and it's habit for me and i just like it it's just so great all right so let's let's break this down so something that costs a penny so that would be like air something that costs you almost nothing to make all right it's expensive meaning you could sell it
(03:47) for a dollar so cost you a penny you could sell it for a dollar and it's sticky it's habit for me people come back and keep buying it again and again and again right which means very long lifetime values all right that's that's what he's looking at initially now the the unique part is something that if you if you listen to some of his other stuff is he likes to have big competitive boats all right so what's something that's you know what's how can i find air for a petty sell it for a dollar that people come back you want to keep breathing
(04:17) and no one else can sell it so it's unique air right it's not here that anyone can sell it's specific to the to it has a brand behind it that no one could copy uh it has share of mind he talks about that a lot uh like geico everyone here probably does like you could say 50 or more by switching to geico you've heard that uh because he 10x their advertising budget as soon as he bought the whole thing uh and just had them go on a massive rampage so they could take over my chair and geico has grown proportionately and so
(04:46) this is four of those features right unique expensive sticky air something equal make for a petty sells for a dollar is habit forming that no one else can replicate and um for me this is just so cool uh and i'll talk about a couple of the features of this in a second um you know what i'll talk about it now so one thing that you'll notice and this is for all the newer entrepreneurs or you know really it any entrepreneur uh who's interested in this kind of thing notice the gross margins he's talking about right a lot of people quote
(05:20) feel bad for charging for things that don't cost that much which is a terrible mindset to have you charge what the market will give you right so if for example uh you you know you find this these widgets like these pens and you know that that you get them from some place in china that cost you a dollar if someone's willing to give you a hundred dollars for it do you feel bad taking it you're like well if only they do markets are built on information advantages information inefficiencies meeting one person the seller knows more than the buyer
(05:54) that's that's how these things work a lot right and so uh i i noticed this because you know you're listening to one of the best investors of all time if not the best investor of all time and he looks for like a hundred to one right costs a penny sells for a dollar a hundred to one it costs one penny one percent cost of goods compared to what it's being sold for so 99 gross margins that for me was actually very very interesting uh is that he he doesn't go for like an 80 or a 90 he goes for 99 and for perspective the difference between selling something
(06:29) uh for a dollar that cost you 10 cents versus selling something for a dollar that costs you penny is not that uh you know it's it's just nine percent more profitable to sell some you know sell it for a dollar that costs a penny versus a dollar that costs a dime it's actually ten times more profitable and here's here's why i better explain this is that for one unit of cost the petty one could sell 10 times the amount for that one cost so does that make sense so if i were to sell 10 pennies worth of buy cost it means i make 10
(07:03) whereas 10 pennies worth of the other example of a dive is only one dollar and that's one of the things that people don't understand about margins right the gross margin of the product that you have like every increment when you go from when you go from 90 to 95 gross margins in a business you double the profitability of the business that's what's crazy right and so uh that's why this is so important right now if you try for example look at your prices right now and say uh i want to get to if you're at 90 and you say i want to get to 95
(07:34) percent gross margins now let's say it costs you right uh let's say it costs you 10 right uh for your for your thing right you sell for a hundred that's ninety percent gross margin so ninety dollars is is margin for you ten dollars is cost you sell for a hundred all right so if you wanted to get to 95 percent gross margins what do you think you do would you add five dollars maybe 105 no that's not bad to get to 95 gross margins you'd have to sell the same 10 thing for 200 that's what people don't get about margins right and so what i
(08:09) like what i would we would we would turn gyms around at what and whatnot i would have guys who are at 66 margins that's usually where most people are and that's horrible by the way and i would say we need to get you to 80. and they would see 66 to 80. only 14 percent only 14 you just saw me double the price from 100 to 200 to get five right and so that's that's how important these margins are and so to hear this man say i want something that i could create for a penny sell for a dollar that's habit for me get people keep
(08:37) buying over and over again for the rest of their lives and that no one else can buy because it's unique right that was pretty cool and so these are the four kind of components of the business itself but the last thing that buffett talks about and he talks about this a lot so i draw a little dotted line here is the person who is running it all right and he has three characteristics that i saw him repeat over and over again uh for the management or the operators all right and they have such a brilliant model of managing
(09:07) right because berkshire only has like 19 employees or something like that something stupid and they have a gazillion they did 88 billion in profits last year think about that 88 billion the second most profit in the entire world was like a 20-person company because they're so good at advocating response just basically delegating out responsibility to the businesses that they bought now he turns out a lot of deals but what he looks for in operators and this is why i think this is cool is that what he looks for in operators
(09:34) we can look for it ourselves we could create that ourselves as entrepreneurs right we could think how can i embody these characteristics all right and so the first of these characteristics is he says i want somebody who's risk averse all right because he said many times any things time zero is zero he's like you could have 30 years of a great track record and make one bet that goes to zero and lose it all and that is why he's so risk-averse and i had a mentor who told me something once that i that i just loved he said alex you
(10:04) should only have to get rich once and for some reason that just like that that hit different you should only have to get rich once and so uh and the smartest best of the world feels that way too you should be risk averse he's like i give i give up bigger opportunities all day long to to cover my downside all right the richest people in the world i'm telling you this right now if you don't have access to people who are worth a hundred million a billion i do and i will tell you how they think all right it's all about downside risk mitigation
(10:34) they will give up they will give up huge returns to not risk losing money and the funny thing is that poor people think the exact opposite they go for the lottery they've basically 100 guaranteed downside right one in 300 million of winning and they do it all the time right and one of the things that uh buff says is like if you if you uh if you bet poorly small you'll bet poorly big uh which i i love that too right so anyways number one matchmaker is risk-averse so we think about ourselves how can i be more risk-averse how can i
(11:05) make sure that i can't lose right it's much more important to not lose than it is to win and what's interesting is that if you don't lose long enough you kind of win by default which is kind of interesting which brings me to the second point which is log-term thinking so the reason that they like family-owned business specifically is that families think about generations they think about passing it down between you know father and son parents and kids right and they like those businesses because they don't cut quarters they think about
(11:36) quality they think about long-term investment long-term competitive strategy they're not thinking about quarterly earnings and you know basically short-term gratification which is what most of the stock market companies are forced to do because they have to pay her to to to stock stockholders right and so if you can't i've talked about this some of my other podcasts shifting from ceo to investor but one of the most beneficial things that i have done for my mental health and for the success of my business is thinking in a long-term type horizon
(12:06) and i can't tell you that i'll tell you that of the people that i encounter the longer their time horizon that they talk in the wealthier more successful they are invariably so when i talk to somebody and all they're thinking about is this week the next two weeks payroll and what they're gonna make this month and last month i already know that they don't make a ton right and it's because that's all they think in right and then and then they get from there you get to slightly higher level entrepreneurs they're thinking in quarters okay
(12:33) this quarter this one we can't focus anything this chord is all we got this is what we can do right and that's fine because the smaller you are the less stable you are it's more volatile right but over time as you expand those horizons right you'll be able to make better better decisions because you'll start thinking well if i did this for five straight years would it be reasonable that i would win probably right uh if i do this consistently for five years do i think that i will it would be unreasonable that i won't be
(12:56) able to be far past by my my goal probably right but most people still think of these tiny chunks of time and could never get ahead and they spend month after month after month for 30 years trying to become millionaires rather than just set a goal of like well let me just see if i could increase my my income by 20 000 in the next year right and then next year after that i'll try and increase it by another 20 000 and they do that by you know and in five years you have a top one percent income uh but only 99 of people
(13:25) don't think that way which is why only one percent do so anyways number one for the management is that they're risk averse they will take they will take the loss they will not take the opportunity to avoid the loss number two they think of long term horizons right and number three they have unimpeachable character which i just really like that is a word unimpeachable character and if he uh if you listen to or talk about uh about about about losing buddy he said if you lose money that will be forgiven he said but if you lose me a shred of
(14:03) reputation i will be ruthless and he's he's so uh so big on this and i think that's you know these these these kind of three things come together people who have unimpeachable character are not trying to get rich quick right they're trying to build something of value they're trying to build something that's enduring something that's long term and uh they're honest and so what happens though is that when you have an impeachable character it's actually intangible that has compounding returns and i'll explain what would be that but he
(14:33) talks about it for his own business he's like the fact that our check's always clear that we we do what we say we're going to do uh allow us to get access to more deals because more people want to work with us right and we do we close deals faster and so the thing is is that your reputation over time becomes a competitive advantage and that's what a what's a unique that's a sustainable and compounding competitive advantage because someone who's stuck with their word for 10 years compared to somebody stuck with their word for 30 years whose
(15:00) word is worth more the 30-year guy someone she's stuck with you know who's done everything and but unique character for 30 years compared to guys done it for 60 years who has the stronger word the 60-year guy it's something that if you can develop it literally compounds with time uh and it's and it's in his opinion priceless and i think he's a very good valuer of things and so anyways the perfect business model i'll give you a quick recap it's unique expensive sticky year that's managed by somebody who's risk averse long-term
(15:30) thinking and has unimpeachable character all right so something that you could create for a penny sell for a buck that's habit-forming that no one else can do and you do it in such a way that you don't take short-term risks you think long-term in terms of how you're going to invest in the business and the legacy and building something of value and not not obsessed with short-term volatility but for a long-term earning and finally that you do it in such a way that people will think everything that this man has done has
(15:59) been fairly earned and wisely used and so with that i will leave you with the perfect business i hope you enjoyed this hope you found this valuable this is one of my favorite things to talk about and uh keep being awesome and if you're in the arena keep getting up i promise uh you will get better over time lots of love i'll catch you guys soon bye

(01:52) rather do a slide presentation um sometimes i want to mix mix it up um i have a bunch of bullets and i think it went really well with the gym more so i wanted to kind of do the same thing and layla and i talked about who's going to talk about what because we both are involved in our finances uh that's not always the way you know in a lot of marriages you know one person manages money one person does other things but as a as as resident cheapskate um of our marriage it uh it made sense to have personal finance full to me and so uh i will kick this off kick this
(02:23) puppy off with some stats and a quote so quote number one the first 100 000 is a [ __ ] but you got to do it i don't care what you have to do if it means walking everywhere not eating anything that wasn't purchased with a coupon find a way to get your hands on a hundred thousand dollars after that you can ease off the gas a little charlie munger vice chairman berkshire hathaway some of you guys may know this but uh charlie munger is my probably my number one resource for all things wisdom and money and uh i actually think he might even be a better teacher than
(02:53) warren buffett i think warren buffett just picked a couple of stocks that ended up outperforming charles and charlie has not had any like massive home runs he's just been a consistent investor for a long period of time um and a general assault of the earth individual who is full of wisdom and so if you are looking for wisdom when it comes to money i would i would recommend anything that is written by him or any talks that he gives what i want to transition to is um the reason behind this this kind of you know leadership meeting a lot of times we talk about management and uh you know leadership in
(03:23) general and character traits and things like that my goal in general as my life has progressed is to make as many people wealthy and independent as humanly possible and so each of the businesses that we've had have have done that and there's different people who become you know uh wealthy you know through jim lords it's obviously our our clients but i think as as i've gotten older my care has actually shifted towards uh you guys uh our employees of the company and making sure that everyone here um comes independently wealthy and so what i want to do is lay out a plan that literally
(03:51) everyone in this call can become independently wealthy if you follow it is that cool with everyone is that all right let's do it alex yes absolutely like as a belief breaker which is just like everyone and any position in a company right everyone has their compensation levels that they're compensated at i think something that um is really interesting is that what i've noticed over the years is that it's often not correlated with how much money you make let's correlate with everything alex is going to talk about which is how much
(04:16) money you don't spend and so i've had personal conversations with a lot of you who you know maybe you're in the middle tier in terms of compensation you have more saved and more in your bank account less debt than those who make more money in the company and so i just want to put that out there is that it's often you know getting rid of the downside rather than increasing the upside another quote for you you cannot outwork money and so ideally you would like money working for you a horrifying stat is that the average
(04:41) american had negative net worth literally if they were born if you're born a baby and you have zero net worth you're already in the top you're already above average because you've got zero think about how [ __ ] wild that is that's insane and that is because people make poor choices not because of anything else and so i want to be very clear about my my view on this and it's one of victor rather than victimhood we all make choices and independent of what we make wealth is a ratio of what we spend versus what we earn therefore if you earn anything you can
(05:17) become wealthy by controlling what you spend so that's stat number one step number two the average u.s minimum wage worker will accrue over a million dollars in earnings over their career if they lived and worked a minimum wage the entire time and never got a pay raise which barely even makes sense because with with every you know every four years minimum wage goes up anyways right so think about that for a moment that means a million dollars is going to flow through the hands of basically any worker who works full-time throughout their career in the u.s all right
(05:47) next one the median u.s income earner will make over three million dollars they will earn that over their lifespan pretty wild right what if we controlled the flow and we actually made good decisions about that lots of cool things and i will show you that in a moment and i want to reiterate one more point and if you want to dot it underline it highlight it wealth is a ratio not a number between what you earn and what you spend right now there is something that is in your life if you do not have the amount of
(06:17) money you wish or you're not saving or investing at the amount that you want that is eating away at it it is your number one nemesis for some people it's sneakers for some people it's eating out for other people it's clothing and so the question i have for you guys is first off in the chat if you guys will be open and honest with me what is your vice what is the thing that eats into your accounts what is that thing that you love spending on and you feel guilty but you get that dopamine rush every time you buy it
(06:47) what is that please put in the chat the more honest we can be the better it'll be for everyone high heels me too i'm with you on that one right skincare eating out kid stuff food food and beer okay cool fantastic this is good coffee gotta be spending a lot of money on coffee alcohol a lot of people drinking going to the bars going to the club right there's a lot of things and so the next question is and this is kind of why this is a behavioral question because becoming independently wealthy is not complex
(07:22) it's simple not easy and so my question for everyone on this call is are you willing to give up your vice to be a millionaire it's a genuine question i'll tell you a brief story um and then i'll get into some of the more tactical stuff and i want to make an example because there are some limiting beliefs around this that i think um me debunked wealth is accrued through character traits when i uh a lot of you guys may have heard of the story of when i was sleeping on my gym floor has anyone heard that story a guy sleeping on the floor didn't have enough money right what you don't know is that i was making five thousand
(07:58) dollars my second month in business in profit the third month i made ten thousand dollars the fourth month i made third month i made fifteen thousand dollars the next i made 20 the next i made 25 the next i made 30 the next made 35 and that was in profit and i was sleeping on the floor and that was because for me i get tremendous amount of anxiety if i spend any amount of the income that i earn that is not negligible and so i wanted to take as much of that money that was coming in and adding it to my bank account and so for me and for
(08:31) everyone here if you can gamify that one simple number which is what is in your bank account you will win the game and so many of you are not in complete control of your finance because you also have a spouse and so we will we'll distribute this to you guys so if you want to play this with your spouse because maybe by the end of this call you decide to make some decisions i'd like to get them bought in as well because you have to do it together right not one of you can do this you both have to do this together if you are married but if you do commit to this and you can play a game which is
(09:01) the game is how little can we spend and see if you can beat your last month's total every month see what else you can trim see what else you can not spend money on because it becomes fun and interesting and as soon as you can make not spending money fun i promise you you will have more money than you ever need you'll be able to eliminate the stress in your life around money and i mean this so sincerely from the bottom of my heart everyone here in this company can become independently wealthy can become the top one person in america simply by the habits that you choose to make today like i ca i'm serious as
(09:31) cancer right now and i wish i could tell better stories that i knew how to break the blues and we can do this um and i'll try and address them at the end because some of you will have limiting beliefs around this but if you make the steps that i'll walk through today um they will they will benefit you and there's only six steps that i'll walk through they're very simple and they're very straightforward okay now next next little stop on our adventure okay is let me show you the eighth wonder of the world does anyone know what the eighth wonder of the world is so let's say
(10:00) marcos how old are you you can unmute if you want to tell me fantastic want to see some crazy [ __ ] marcos because i'm about to show you let's say you have zero dollars saved up okay i don't know what you got saved up but let's say you've got zero dollars saved up are you curious by any chance how much if you saved 100 a month you would have by the end this is not the actual amount are you curious do you want to know how much you'd have if you saved up 100 a month and you just put it in the s p between now and when you're 75 yes
(10:31) you're curious do you want to see very 2.7 million dollars pretty [ __ ] interesting right yes very i would agree with you so check this out let's make this zero this is something that i have saved on my phone this calculator i have saved on my phone and so right now let's say that you're looking at making a jordan's purchase right you see the new jordans and you're like man them shits are sexy so you take your hundred dollars and you think well i could either have these jordans or when i retire i could have 22 thousand
(11:05) dollars which would you prefer the 22 grand i agree with you i would as well i made similar decisions throughout my life now if you looked at going out to dinner for example or going out to lunch and maybe just going out to lunch three days a week right it's an extra let's say 12 bucks a day right three times a week so it's 36 bucks times four so you're looking at like 130 140 bucks just by not eating out 31 000 and that's just one month now if you did that for a year you'd have 400 000 wow i agree with you but no one does the
(11:49) [ __ ] math that's crazy i've never thought about it that way that is the purpose of this call thank you marcos yeah thank you you bet and so one of the number one things that happens and one of the limiting beliefs that people have is that the amount that i can save right now is not enough it's not enough to make a dent it's not enough to do damage now some of you on this call might not be 19 years old and have you know 60 years of content behind you right so let's look at let's look at what probably the median age in this company is which is 35 years old okay
(12:21) and so let's be a little bit more aggressive here let's say again you start at zero but you decide to start saving 500 a month i know that's aggressive but let's just say if you did you'd be able to retire with three million dollars it's 100 bucks a week the thing is is that just about everyone here if you make different choices about how you live what you spend your money on you would be able to have this outcome and i mean generally from like the bottom of my heart it's just like fitness right you have to you have to burn more than you than you eat this is
(12:49) simple eat less than you burn or yes exactly thank you saving money and personal finance are simple except the thing with weight loss is you don't have any compounding thing that's working with you right with money your money works for you right while you sleep and so that's the magic of this and here's what's cool marcos i will show you something interesting they might be like how is that even possible how can i say 500 a month from now being 35 until i'm 75.
(13:12) well you only contributed 240 000 here i mean that's a lot but this is how much your money worked for you which is why you can't not work money you have to let money work for you and so the number one thing that will create wealth for everybody here is your income that is the thing that will create that that is the flow right obviously throughout the company you can look at different opportunities to make more money to to you know to get promoted to to add more value to the company things like that so you can increase your inflow
(13:42) but for just about everyone here and what's kind of funny is that i have had many conversations with people and i want to be really transparent here there are people who make the most in this company are among the most i would say the top 10 earners in this company who i have had conversations with who have zero dollars saved up i've also had conversations with people with the top ten percent earners company who have negative net worth i've also had conversations with people who are in the bottom 20 in this company they would have higher net worth than the people in the top percent 10
(14:11) and so to me that shows that it's choice it's just a choice and what i can tell you is somebody who's made this phenomenal amount of money throughout my life my level of well-being has been no way affected by anything that i've spent money on material goods do not increase my acceptance of subjective well-being and so if you're if your goal is to seek to decrease the anxiety that you have in your life because of finances then the easiest way to do that is to spend less money because you have lower risk consider your fixed expenses and your
(14:41) lifestyle your risk basis this is your risk that you have as an individual and so if you can make yourself an investment that has very low risk and very high return you will reap the benefits over a long period of time and so this again is assuming you save 500 a month that's it now let's just get wild and let's say you go all in on this you just you just go nuts and i'm going to give you some of the habits and all that kind of stuff in a second but i just want to paint the picture first so let's say you did the same exact thing but you were like you know what
(15:11) i'm totally changing my lifestyle i'm downgrading where i live i'm selling the lease on my car and i'm buying a car and five thousand dollars in cash that i have no payments let's see where this takes us 2500 bucks a month it's 14 million dollars just in case you're curious that's not the top one percent that's the that's the top point four percent of the united states and you just get there through making smart choices and this again is assuming you have zero dollars saved up so this is for you marcos let's say you save 25 000 by the end of this year because you do a great
(15:46) job and you live like a cheap ass all right and you put no more money in for the rest of life all right and you start because you're 19 years old that's how much money you can have 5.5 million dollars if you just save 25 000 today and put it in the s p and never think about it again marcos you could be hoodrich right and so one of the things does anyone here know what the number one drain on net worth is besides taxes 35 of every single american's paycheck goes to this one thing yes laura larose interest 35
(16:28) so for context imagine right imagine where you had a franchise right and so i i own i'm the franchise pro subway i have i license out my business model too 10 000 restaurants subway gets 10 and they kill their franchisees because there's no margin in food do you know who's killing them three and a half times more the banks 35 of the average american paycheck goes to interest that's it and so right now what i just showed you was 500 a month so can everybody here just for just for shits and giggles multiply what you take home by 0.35 put
(17:13) that in that calculator i'll wait for you guys to do it multiply what you make by 0.35 and put that in as your monthly contribution you can start with zero dollars you put 75 as your retirement age the reason you do that is because we're all going to live a lot longer than our ancestors at so why you guys are doing that and getting that calculation and the reason i'm asking you to do this because i want you i want to show you that it's worth it to make these decisions and so the reason 35 is that for example let's say you buy a house right you've lit you you're realizing
(17:50) the american dream which is hilarious because you didn't actually buy a house you got a loan because the banks have zillions of dollars of advertising to make you to fool you into believing that is now the american dream is that you owe them money that's the american dream is that you owe someone else money and that 35 of your paycheck goes to them for the rest of your [ __ ] life you could also get into student debt which i absorb and heat to like every ounce of my being but i won't even get into that so let's just talk mortgages if you do
(18:15) buy a house and you're the average american and you move in three years which is what the average american does they move every three years do you have any idea what percentage of all those quote mortgage payments that you're making are going towards principal which means the actual amount of the house dominic correct you have a 30-year mortgage your first three years you're paying jack [ __ ] towards your principal which means you just leased it from the bank and then they get somebody else in and then
(18:37) they and they and 97 of the dollars that go in there go to them and the bank holds the note on everything to the same degree if you buy a car and you can't buy it in cash the same interest applies except it's even higher isn't that wild isn't that nuts what's what's more is that for those of you who have student loans think of how crazy this is they lobbied to get the government to back student loans which means they gave 18 year olds so everybody who's on the sales team understands this but if we try and give a business owner get a business refinanced right in real
(19:13) terms of the likelihood that they pay back the debt for even fifteen thousand dollars right the approval rates like one out of three for 15 grand and yet because the government allows this they allow banks to give a loan for 200 000 to an 18 year old with zero [ __ ] earning potential and they say that they can never get out of it which means that that percentage of your paycheck what they did just like that subway that roy would say off the top they're getting a royalty on your [ __ ] life 35 of everything you make
(19:51) forever they allow people who aren't even old enough to drink put themselves in enough debt they can never get out of now i believe in personal accountability you should be responsible for your decisions but i don't think you should be subsidized back by the government the purpose of today is hopefully to shock you a little bit into how much many people on this call are being robbed by decisions and the invisible hand that is taking money from your pocket every single month and so if you guys will let me i would like to walk you through six steps to get out of this mess is that okay with you guys
(20:20) so you saw the sunny side which marco's got to see you can be worth 6 million dollars if he just saves 25 grand this year and doesn't do anything else on the flip side for everyone else right not just marcos hopefully marcus you don't have a mortgage and student loans and all the other things right hopefully for everyone else you can see what has been robbing you and your ability to create generational wealth is this one thing and so my goal is to get us to get this this this monkey off our backs and so one more one more stat that i will that i'll
(20:50) push towards you is that does anyone hear anyone willing to be honest that is anyone here have credit card debt does anyone have credit card debt okay so who here know has hurt you know like compounding is the eighth winner of the world which is what marco's eyes popped out of his head when he saw the note right eighth wonder of the world is compounding you can also have negative compounding interest which compounds against you and so you have the eighth wonder of the world beating you up every single day rather than lifting you up so that you
(21:18) can become financially afraid that is the eighth wonder of the world working against you because it's compounding and for many of you you know credit card debt 10 12 16 per year if you could get it if you could get a an investment that'd be 16 a year you'd be [ __ ] stoked and that's what exactly what every single bank did in the world is they make you the investment that they get sixteen percent compounding in we cool is everyone like i have everyone's complete attention what i want to hit on are the the six the six pieces here all right
(21:47) number one is that you have to start saving money and you do that before you start paying debt off all right you're like how much do i save what you save is something called an emergency fund and the reason you start there rather than paying off your debt is because something will come up and if you learn the habit of stopping to pay off your debt you'll stop paying it off it's like going on vacation and so think of this as the vacation fund for your financial fitness is that we need to plan for the vacation that's going to come so that we don't
(22:18) get off base for most people that emergency fund is between one thousand and five thousand dollars i will let you decide on on what that is based on your income but what that is is when your carburetor and your car goes up or when you break your foot and you have a service it's the stuff that is quote unexpected but 100 predictable that it's going to happen at some point in your life and so the idea plan for the thing that you know will happen you just don't know when the only variable is when not if and so has anyone here i'll ask this question to prove the point can i just
(22:49) get hands you can see it on the screen has anyone here in your life had an unexpected bill come up so then can we call them unexpected let's call them expected bills and just plan ahead all right so the first thing that we do so if you're writing this down the first thing you do is you save between one and five thousand dollars i will let you make that decision you are grown-ups that means that even if you have your credit card debt even if you have other things that are stupid that's fine for right now the first step is to save one to five thousand dollars step one step two you pay off all your
(23:22) debts minus your mortgage so if you have a mortgage don't worry about the mortgage for now we'll get to that in a second except for the mortgage you pay off all your and it is my my two cents that it's better to pay off the smallest debts you've got even if you've got one that's let's say 20 and you've got another one that's 10 and the 10 one is smaller despite it mathematically making more sense to pay off the higher debt one no one here has made any [ __ ] rational decisions up to this point so why would we make them now the point
(23:51) is that we need to get the emotional victory we need to lose some weight we need to tighten our belt all right and you need the first win so that you can see that you can do this and so you pay off the smallest debt first and then you pay off the second smallest debt and you'll feel is momentum and you'll see that you can do it and so what i my earnest ask is that if you can team up with your spouse on this and you show them how much money you could be making with just what you're paying in debt right now 35 of your paycheck and how it can be create independent wealth for you and
(24:22) your family for the long run just by doing this then hopefully it will make it worth it more than getting a dessert at chili's although i do love desserts at chili's i think they're fantastic do it when you can afford it and you can pay for it in cash and still hit your budget to show you to the extent how much layla and i believe in this we bought our home in cash we bought our cars in cash everything we pay for in cash we have zero debt total zero and what i can tell you is it feels good knowing that no one can take your [ __ ] away from me because for those of you who like to be more sophisticated and
(24:52) read up on articles on crypto and robin hood let me tell you an interesting concept that i learned from somebody who's much wealthier than me they said debt increased risk risk if expanded over a long enough time horizon will eat away the returns that the additional leverage gain because anything any number no matter how big multiplied by zero is still zero so it doesn't matter how good you are and how much you saved if you take on too much risk which is what debt is over a long enough time horizon it will multiply you by zero which some of us are old enough marcos
(25:28) you're not but some of us are old enough to remember the 2008 2009 collapse i will tell you that just about every entrepreneur friend that i know lost everything they start back at zero and marcos you saw that you're at 19 and if you didn't [ __ ] up if you don't [ __ ] up between now and when you're 75 which means you don't take on debt and you just you need to pay for things in cash and you budget how much you make right and you spend less than what you earn you'll be able to be financially wealthy for the rest of your life you'll also never have to worry about money ever and the only reason people don't do this is
(25:58) because they think that status and how good they feel about themselves live in the eyes of others rather than their own eyes would you rather be rich or have everyone think you're rich it's a real question and most people answer by their actions which one they'd rather actually want which is why finance and personal finances is much more a question of character than it is about intelligence is anything here complex that i've shown you arithmetically save more than you earn right spend less than you earn
(26:28) do it for a long period of time don't buy [ __ ] you can't afford and no money to do it i told you step one save one to five thousand dollars step two pay off your debts smallest to largest not in terms of interest do it in terms of smallest to largest for many of you that may take one year two years or three years and i know that this is the that's the rocky cut scene that's the part of the movie that everyone fast forwards through but i can tell you that the amount of spiritual growth that happens when you consistently
(27:00) live disciplined will change who you are and how much control you perceive that you have over your life and you may lament the fact that you have student loans you may limit the fact that you got into a 30-year mortgage we'll talk about in a second but those things are done there's nothing you can do about this all we can do is the choices that we have in front of us and so the question is are we going to let the decision that we made years ago rob us of the future that we can have if we choose to have it one save one to five dollars
(27:25) two pay off all debt that is not not your mortgage in terms of smallest to largest you paid off just you know as soon as layla and i started making money we paid off her student debt right like we live by this this is i believe this falls to bones through and through all right third step in your in your piece of in your financial freedom is actually expanding your emergency fund those savings you don't invest those those are just so that you can live as a human being and feel safe some of you will have larger need for security
(28:01) other of you will have smaller needs for security and so the range for this is three to six months of living expenses now the fact that you've done this after you paid off your debt aggressively you will already have the character traits in the discipline to know how to live on less which means you're very able to one you won't even have to save that much because you already have been living on so little so three months might not even take you level and you would be amazed at how much more money you have when you have no debt that goes out every single
(28:30) month paying the banks you will be blown away so right now for shits and giggles because that's why we do this right chess and giggles nothing here is serious as cancer right except for you know your future and everything else who here has a car payment can you get a hand you have a car payment okay who here leases where they live or has a mortgage now if you were to add that amount of money up remember that calculator i want you to put that in the calculator again i know i'm asking you to do some work i
(29:01) think it's worth it can someone throw some numbers of what that would equate to 2.1 million dollars there it is and just so you know no one can guess what your car payment and your house payments are based on this number so don't worry about it six million dollars 3.2 million dollars 5.6 million 3.8 million dollars so 2 million 15 million 1.
(29:19) 5 million dollars 2.8 million dollars how [ __ ] nuts is this this is the [ __ ] they don't tell you this is how everyone at the top makes all the money they loan people who can't afford things things they can't afford and they settle them with that that's compounding against them for the rest of their lives that's the secret so if you don't want that working against you these are the hard decisions right now if you can have the hard hard conversation with your spouse and think to yourself is there a way because now at this point in the in in this process
(29:49) you can try and pay off where you live so that that money that you're currently outflowing becomes your retirement fund you could literally do nothing else you could just do that and and own the car you have in cash and just so you know as somebody who's had super cars and had a prius that was worth five thousand dollars it gets me from point a to point b in the exact same amount of time it was also the biggest regret of my life is buying the the bentley that we had number one financial regret i have i get zero enjoyment out i miss our
(30:18) little broken prius that i did a dent on the side door and had a crack through the windshield and for context just so you guys know that i'm drinking my own kool-aid when we owned that car as the only car that layla and i split we were millionaires and i had a lady who was in our mastermind named monica patar who saw us pull up to our mastermind in the prius with a cracked windshield and the dents in the door and she said i thought you guys were supposed to be rich as she walked into the mastermind which you as of course a guru are horrified by this kind by this idea and i said i am i
(30:48) said you should look at my back and so that's the kind of thing that just like it just gives you what kind of confidence do you want do you want someone to say nice car or do you want to bait let's say you should look at my bank account there's a kind of stress-free living there's a kind of confidence that comes from this there's a kind of [ __ ] you money energy that's hard to fake and i would like that for everybody here on this call and it is 100 attainable for everyone here just making the right choices
(31:10) so the number one the easiest thing you can do is if you have a lease you can turn it in early and you can buy a car for five thousand cash you can save up for it okay but once you do that remember that hundred dollars a month that 200 a month that's some of you guys are paying as soon as you save up and you do that one time that two dollars a month becomes a constant flow that for the rest of your life is adding towards your and then you can choose to downgrade and not live in the really ritzy fancy neighborhood that you live in now that might be above your means or rather is above your means because you can't buy
(31:39) the house in cash and you're just loaning it from the bank right and this is stuff that no one says it everybody wants to you know impress their parents to show them what neighborhood they live in rather than impressing themselves and giving themselves a stress-free life again for context when i did decide to lease my first spot where i decided to live if you guys are curious i split a bedroom in a house bedrooms i split one bedroom with one another guy i paid 400 a month in rent and this is in southern california for anyone who has contacts 400 a month gets you nothing
(32:13) i split a bedroom in a house and again i was making twenty thousand a month and i'm not saying i'm saying this because i believe in this so thoroughly and very luckily on my part i was i was raised by a father who came to the united states with nothing he was an immigrant he had one thousand dollars that he was able to take with it and so we'd split the paper towels in half right because we didn't want to you know waste them we never used napkins because those are expenses used housed the dinner table right you saved everything we always would get like two milks at costco which
(32:44) were like the big ass gallon ones and it was just me i was the only kid and he's like drink up it's gonna go bad because he didn't want to buy the milk at royal farms or 7-eleven whatever you guys have it was like a dollar more all right and that's why if you guys can gamify this with your spouse you'll win the game because if you can play the game you'll win but most people just don't realize that you are in the game right now and other people are playing you so i gave you the first habits one to five thousand of emergency and you do that before you pay debt because
(33:12) something's going to come up and you don't want to break the cycle of paying off your debt so you do that first then you start paying off your debts from smallest to biggest so you can get the emotional victories and you start winning number three then you save up three to six months of living expenses so that you can feel financially secure so you don't have to worry this will lower your stress and it will make your life much better the point that most people have of becoming wealthy is because they want to become happier the easiest way to
(33:36) become happier is become less stressed the easy way to do that is save some [ __ ] money fourth step this is where you look at how you can start building wealth all right and so the way to do that if you have a mortgage and you don't want to live somewhere else renegotiate the mortgage you can refinance right now because right now interest rates are nothing and try and get a 15-year fixed that will make your mortgage go up but the vast majority of the money will be going towards something that you own and so your principal will start you will be increasing your net worth fun fact you don't pay capital gains on
(34:07) selling the house that you own so if your primary home increases in value and you live in it for over two years and then you sell it and decide to go upgrade because it's gone up and you can buy 100 of your new house with the cash that you have saved up you don't pay taxes there are some things the government has done to help people out that is one of them so if you insist on on living somewhere that is beyond what you can currently pay in cash then refine is to get a 15 year fixed and then when it comes to cars if you can combine because most you guys work from home well most of you everyone here
(34:36) works for mom you probably only need one car and if you're like no way it's like layla and i live with one car we still live with one car actually [ __ ] now we have to but like we lived with one car for a very very very long time right and i'm about to return because i don't need to so if you can buy a car in cash which there are tons of good cars in cash and here's what's crazy cars in cash that you buy and you use for three years thousand dollars you can sell for five thousand dollars you just use it for free
(34:58) pretty well all right everyone ready for five step five all right step five is exciting step five is where you invest 15 of your pre-tax pre-tax income into the s p 500 again i'm not an investment professional i do not recommend that you listen to me in any way you should consult your own professional advisors for any investment advice uh and this is not a recommendation at all because i don't know what i'm doing and so you can make your own decisions as an adult uh to choose to do with your money what you want to do if you look at the last 80 years of the s p 500 it's gone up by about nine to ten
(35:38) percent per year for that entire period of time now if you guys haven't heard my talk on volatility and risk it's good to understand this the reason we built up the emergency fund of three to six months of living expenses is so that you never look at that money and that you never stop putting money into it and i will tell you one story that you guys know half the story about and for those of you who are about to read the book you're going to read the first half of that story which is that i went almost to bankrupt and i had a
(36:01) thousand dollars left in my bank account right before i started gym march what you guys don't know is that i had just under 300 000 saved up that was in an index but to me and you can tell by the way that that story was wrote that money does not exist once it is gone it is gone you never see it again you never touch it don't look at it and if you need to make money you find a way to make you sell something you work an extra shift you take up uber on the weekends whatever the point is you don't touch it because if you can learn that character trait you can learn not to put your hand
(36:35) in the cookie jar you see the money that marcos can have if he just puts ten thousand dollars away or twenty five 25 000 mark goes i see something really crazy let's say you save 25 grand this year and let's say because you're like alex i'm all in on becoming independently wealthy let's say you save 2 500 bucks a month all right because you hustle your ass off selling here's what's [ __ ] crazy that money that 74 million is being made it's just the question is whether you're going to be the one who makes it or the
(37:07) bank that money is being made either way think about that money is being made all day every day all the time the dollars always work at the same degree for whoever their master is the question is whether you're the master of the dollar or the person you're paying and if yes you're curious about like what the tactics around this are all you do is you download robinhood which is the app which is free connect your bank account and you can you can deposit straight into an index off there it's very straightforward you don't need an advisor they're just going to charge fees which are actually going to kill
(37:35) your returns so don't worry about it s p 500 again this is not investment advice do whatever you want with your money in fact i might not know anything so i definitely i would say don't listen to my boss right this makes sense for everybody i'm gonna go through the steps one through five again from the top one save one to five thousand dollars because that is the guaranteed fund of something that's going to happen to you you just don't know when number two you pay off your debts in order of smallest to biggest not in terms of the
(38:07) number how much money how much what percentage it's earning at you pay in terms of how little you have to pay it so you can eliminate it and just start crossing out line items all right step two step three you save up three to six months of living expenses it's up to you depends on your risk tolerance marco can probably save three you don't have kids or a wife if you've got kids and a wife you might want to save up it's up to you step four you look at what you're living with so if you have a lease on a car trade it in
(38:37) get a 5 000 car and live on that period if you can downgrade where you live and what neighborhood you live in do it because i can tell you we just saw how 35 of your check is going to make someone else 74 million by the end of your life it's just up to you whether you want to make it or you want someone else to make it step four actually that was step four uh if you if you insist on living continued step four step four b if you insist on living in the same place as you live now then refinance for a 15-year fix that
(39:08) way you're gonna get the vast majority of the one that you're paying is gonna go towards the equity of the house and not to interest fees and if you do that you'll be like whoa the amount i have to pay for month is so much more it's almost like you're actually trying to buy it fifth invest 15 of your pre-tax income pre-tax you have to do some math here so if you make 50 000 a year you multiply that by 0.
(39:33) 15 which is 7 500 and that's what you save that's minimum you can do more than that do more than that get aggressive with it right and if you want to be a superstar let's say you do that 15 year fixed and you invest 15 you plow the rest of the excess cash that you have into that equity so you can pay it off early you need to make sure that you have no prepayment penalties so maybe you pay your 15 year fixed off in 10 and then in 10 years here's what's crazy you have no car fee you have no house fee you've learned to live on far less than you make
(40:07) and now everything beyond the food you eat goes into building your wealth everything and you'll be you will be frightened to see how fast it grows and i will share one more fun fact for you guys today right now layla and for this year made more money on our money than we did from our companies and i'm being transparent about this because i want to show you that it's possible you also if you read the book see that i had a thousand dollars on my bank account saved up and when i started my first gym i had
(40:43) four thousand dollars total you can do this it just takes discipline it just takes making choices where you look marcos that pair of jordans instead of seeing a pair of jordans you see 22 000 that's what you have to see when you see go getting beers with the boys on the weekend for 20 bucks right of course you wouldn't do that because you're 19 and that's below the legal drinking limit so the non-alcoholic beer that you get because you're a crazy person why would you drink up non-alcohol beard weirdo anyways so you go get your nine alcoholic oh duels
(41:14) right for 20 bucks and instead you see that that's six thousand dollars 6000 rk speed very expensive so just about everyone here has been drinking top shelf their whole life they just don't know that okay one thing alex that's from yes i was i was about to wrap up and open it up so we're good okay cool um something that um you know because alex and i obviously you guys are probably like well you guys own the companies you know you have lots of money like are these things there's a few things i want to point out which is one when we first learned about money and money as attention was when we were
(41:46) literally like we had it was when we first started gym launch we went almost bankrupt like in credit card debt like all that stuff that's when we got a coach who taught us a lot about money and one of the biggest things that he talked about was the attention of money the attention of debt and so with the first paycheck i got from when alex just paid me like an employee when i had made all the sales in the gym in hawaii i paid off all my debt with that and so the reason for that was like i only had a very small amount left it was just like the attention that was going towards that debt right
(42:13) the second thing with that is the same is true with things that you accumulate and this is something that we've gotten the opportunity to learn as of more recently like we had one car we had a small apartment we had all these things when we first started the companies and then over time you think hey well there's such a large discrepancy in between how i live and then what i have that maybe i can fill it a little bit and then what happens is that you have attention on those things because if you get a car that's more expensive you can afford it but it's the attention it takes because that's like for an example a toyota you take into the shop
(42:42) takes a week to fix we have a car that's in the shop right now it's been eight weeks has been fixed right things like that that become complex even though it doesn't need to be and so it's not even just the things that you're buying with money it's the attention you get back when you start saving the money so for example i used to tell people when they would come into the gym they'd be like i'm in debt and i'm overweight in the snack i'd be like well you have your nails done your hair done your eyelashes like why don't you just get those things
(43:05) on we're like they're like well i don't feel good about myself because of those things right i do those things to feel better about myself i'm like but the reason you feel bad about yourself is because you're in debt and you're fat so what the hell and so i think that a lot of times those things that are like vices for example cover like a short-term pain fear anxiety insecurity we have but it's actually just piling into the long-term one and so it's like in the short term it might feel worse to save that money but in the long term you'll have way more attention and way less anxiety if you do
(43:33) so i just want to share that i think it's even if you have the money to get stuff stuff adds complexity which adds more anxiety and so it's like we all want more money so we can have stuff but then you just feel worse anyways so it's just it's just ironic was this guys was this valuable for you guys this was different than leadership management stuff and how to run meetings which are all very important as well but my goal is if i can decrease the stress of everyone on this call by helping everyone make good financial decisions then you know eventually we can operate as a company of people who are not stressed
(44:09) wouldn't that be nice because we realize that no matter what we're secure and we know exactly what our expenses are we know exactly how much we earn and we know that we make far more than we spend and we also understand that we are 100 in control of our finances and so my my plea to you is that if you've ever felt like someone else is in control or you feel like you've been dealt the [ __ ] at the stick right or you drew the short straw that no one [ __ ] cares and it's still up to you like no one's going to come to save no one's going to come to sleep but the good news is that
(44:39) what you need to do in order to become the one percent in case you're curious one to five million dollars in assets is the one percent that's it and we just showed marcos here how to do that with twenty five thousand dollars and so everyone here if you're like man but i've got i've got but i've got but i'm different you're not just stop you're not you're not my metabolism is different really you've solved obesity we can just cure africa from starvation because your metabolism is special you've figured out a way to
(45:15) not eat food and still gain weight we have to put you in a lab so we can crack malnutrition we can just figure out the genes that you have that somehow cause you to not lose weight when you stop eating right somehow you've cracked arithmetic and somehow figured out a way to spend even to somehow lose money and go into more debt despite spending less than you earned all right like you're not special the math is the math right and so i just like i wanted to do this call because it's important to me that everyone here on this call can use gym launch to become your financial vehicle for wealth and effort can do that
(45:52) minimum wage makes a million dollars over their lifespan and i showed you the contribution of the 500 a month person is 240 000 and it created three million dollars so the question is do you want to look like you live like a king or actually live like a king and i think that living like a king comes from the peace of mind that you get and for me that is how money serves me because you have to figure out how many serves you or whether money's serving you at all but that 74 million dollars that marcos
(46:18) has the potential to make over his lifespan that money is being made the question is whether or not you want it to be you who makes it all right my sermon is over you got five minutes left i'm gonna hold you um otherwise thank you guys for your attention and um if you guys do get a chance uh grab a copy of the uh our sponsored our sponsored book 100 million offers you can find it on amazon in the link and if you feel uh so compelled to leave a leave a review that's good then please do so if you hate the book then please don't leave a
(46:46) review anyways lots of love guys uh appreciate you all thank you so much for for being on this journey with us i hope that we can all use um the well-being that we help gym owners uh succeed with and we can also use the income that you guys have to set yourselves free as well because you can do it easy catch you soon bye

Transcript:
(00:00) mosey nation what is going on in this video what i want to talk to you about is a hot take that i had on people who complain that their business is not growing enough and yet see everything as though people owe them something and so i uh did two videos or three videos a week for three years and you know everyone you know you have some bombs you have some great videos and this is the among the top one percent of videos that i made in terms of the number of people who shared it liked it commented all that stuff and it
(00:29) was in a private community and i want to make it public to you guys and so uh this video uh truly will show you the frame of mind and the perspective from which to see customer success increasing lifetime value how to ultimately provide more value than everyone else does from a framing perspective and it applies to sex it applies to business and it applies to life and this is one of the hottest take videos you see if i share any numbers in the video it's because it was in the past that's why if you see a discrepancy that's the difference so
(00:56) anyways mostly nation there's a lot of people broke i don't want to be one of them that's why i make these videos keep being awesome i'll see you guys in it enjoy what's up everybody happy saturday ah man i've got a good one for you today i um this is even one where i looked at layla and i was like i'm gonna have to take a walk on this one um this kind of came to me and i was thinking about it and it's just like man it's it's it's this one kind of philosophy so we have we have five five core tenants at gym lunch rather than go
(01:22) through all of them i'll tell you one of them is and it's uh own it that's one of the five core tennis that we have and if you are curious about what why you would have those you make core tenants so that you can always reference them back for yourself um and for the employees that you have so you can say like this is how we make decisions right and you can always look back at that and be like this is who we are right so own it is one of them and oh man this is so good a lot of people get really upset about their customers
(01:50) who sign for a 12-month membership and then quit after three months right and i'll hear the same people trying to get out of franchise agreements that are five years long right and saying this is bs i haven't gotten the value they didn't give me what they promised they would give me right i'm being real talk and so one of the things and one of the ways that we've so we have honest ridiculously ridiculously like almost zero churn on our highest level group so our most expensive group we basically zero turn and if you were to tell like if you
(02:20) were to ask anyone or someone ask us like how are you growing this that how are you going this fast all this stuff is that honestly i think it's just because i'm incredibly insecure deep down and i have this huge fear of rejection so i don't want anyone to not like me and i don't want anyone to feel like i'm not giving them what i what i said i was going to give them and it's like it's a serious fear of mine probably rooted in security if you can shift your perspective from thinking from well i just got the contract we're done to like we just got
(02:50) the contract oh now we have to fulfill on this right the way i see my relationship with the gym lords group i see it as a week to week like you guys are on week to week with me unless i perform unless i provide value like everyone's gonna leave right now obviously you need to be discerning you need to be wise you need to protect yourself with contract that goes without saying obviously right and you have agreements that are there but if you ever rely on your business because of contracts you will lose always because at the end of the day people
(03:22) will do what they want to do if you rely on contracts your life will be living hell because then people are like well if you like you trick me know like if you live on contracts your life is going to be about contracts and how about you i don't want my life to be about contracts right you can go even deeper with this okay so when like i married layla i honestly had this feeling we both had a conversation like literally the day like the night of our marriage and i was like i was like i was like we can't mess this up i was like this is it i was like
(03:51) you're the one i committed to if anything i was like i was like i like i just don't it's like if we ever have issues i was like we gotta confront immediately because we're in this right if you treat your marriage right you've got that contract you're like i got a contract you got to be with me right and you treat your marriage like you treat your customers i got a contract you have to stay here you have to pay me you will lose and if life will suck but if you consider it as week to week like i consider us day to day and i used to
(04:17) make that joke when we were dating people like are you guys committed like in a relationship this is right before your married i was like we're month to month [Laughter] she hated it but the joke for me served the fact that like you're only as good as your last paycheck right you're only as good as your last day and the moment you rest on your laurels the moment you get lazy is the moment someone else who's hungrier will take you right and that could be someone who's hungry who takes your wife now obviously we have
(04:40) commitments we have shared principles that we never want like we believe in i don't get biblical on you but like like we believe when you get married you stay married right that's like that's the goal that you can always make it work with anyone right that's our belief that was one of the things that we checked on each other before we got married right but that being said if you look at what the bible says right and this is just marriage but the marriage and business are so similar because you have to do the stuff sometimes you don't want to do
(05:04) and you got to be consistent you got to do it every day you can't just say hey great job this week and then not say anything for two months to your customers right same thing with the marriage i can't just be like hey babe thanks for making dinner once a month and she makes dinner every single day right and she crushes it she's awesome layla is a freak she's amazing if i could run our business away well she kind of runs her business but the point is if you're losing customers and you're like all these people are flaky no one commit no
(05:30) one like and you want to get into victim mindset of like lamenting customers right they're people and people will always be self-serving you can always count on it i had a mentor telling me that he's like if you always predict that people will act in their own self-interest he's like you'll always be right and i've always thought about that i was like wow he's like you want to predict the future protect them predict that they will act in their own self-interest forget what they say about principles forget what
(05:58) they say about anything and so what you want to do if you like which is why you should always align relationships so that how their best interest is with you right so like i have to make legacy so freaking good that their best interest is staying and paying me right i'm being super real with you and so if your customers right at your gym keep leaving and you keep saying no one's like no one honors their word anymore no one does any like bs man like you probably didn't honor your word right because you're no longer in their
(06:28) best interest anymore and they tell you that by leaving right by having high churn rates that's how they tell you that that's how the market tells you that you're not being good enough right and so despite you despite signing the 12-month contract or about signing the 18-month contract whatever it is live week-to-week live workout to workout because the real contract that they have with you is for today and the moment that one of your employees gives them lip or says something or says something rude or doesn't show up on time or the bathroom
(06:58) looks like or their music is the same playlist they've heard every single time they go to your gym they're gonna leave that's it they'll come up with their reason they'll say they got busy they'll you know like work or they're moving they'll come up their friend's a doctor or a nurse they'll get the fake note it doesn't matter someone wants to leave the relationship to leave if your wife wants to cheat on you she'll find a way so you don't want that so it's like i gotta make this so good that you don't want to look anywhere
(07:26) else you think you'd be crazy to look anywhere else right and they've been like i want i want my wife to go out and like someone's like if some guy's like hey like you know come on she's like do you know what i have at home like like you're a fool you know i mean if you think that that's gonna get me right like your game is so low you have no idea what i have right so they see a gym advertisement for something else they're like you have no idea my gym like you have no idea how my trainers treat me you have no idea how i feel
(07:55) when i walk into that gym every day right how those people can make me feel and so if you think about your relationship with your customers as you're only as good as yesterday you're only as good as today that's it that's all you've got and so every time you have to resell them like i sell layla every single day on being with me every single day because i love her to death and i want i want this to be awesome forever i do and i know that i know that in order for that to happen i can't just appreciate her once a week
(08:28) i can't even appreciate her once a day i tell her every like every moment baby i love you i'm like you're awesome you're so good i was like you managed our team so well i could never do this without you and it's true right and so if you look no here's another one ready for it you've got your employees everybody's got their employees everybody complains about their employees my employees don't work hard enough they don't care about my customers they don't care well how are you showing up as a leader how invested are you in them
(08:56) do they feel like my trainer left with all my customers they left with that they left with because it was so bad with you that they had to look somewhere else it was so bad that they had to leave and so it's like how how can i make this exchange fair exchange how can i make this exchange even abundant exchange as in they get more than what they get from i i give more than i get right how can i make this an unfair advantage that's how you have a value discrepancy value discrepancies keep people people are like people don't go to chipotle
(09:26) because it's worth seven dollars people go to chipotle because they pay seven and they get a 20 meal that's why they go to chipotle that's the secret i'm all about raising prices but i'm all about being 10 times more valuable than my price which is three times more expensive than everyone else and never ever ever ever ever taking it for granted i don't take your attention for granted i don't take the fact that you pay us every week for granted because i know that there's always somebody who's going to come after me and try and be better than us
(09:54) and i have crazy insecurity um in thinking that like tomorrow it could all be over and i never want that to happen and so um if you think about that with your customers you will always be ahead of your competition like we're constantly innovating because i'm like everyone's gonna copy my stuff everyone's gonna copy the stuff i came up with last month i gotta make new stuff i gotta make new stuff right and when you're when i'm concentrating on my customers and not my competition right then i make good right because i
(10:24) want them to stay and i'm thinking i'm only as good as my last paycheck right i'm only i can only provide for layla if i provide for you stuff that makes you money for real anyways so this was a walk and talker i thought i would uh just give you a little little saturday morning love as i get some fresh air in socal enjoy soak in some of the the socal weather but i love you guys so if you guys don't have amazing marriage amazing business amazing relationship with your customers amazing relationship with your employees
(10:55) don't ever think about what you've done because they don't people don't humans don't right we don't remember what we did we don't remember all those things like every time i can't tell you how many times my wife is taking the trash out i always remember when i take it out right we always remember what we do but we forget what everyone else does and we forget that they forget what we did and we think that it's wrong that they forgot when in fact we just have to do more again today right because you can't change anything
(11:21) else and i can't change how they're going to think and so you can either lament how human beings are or you can react and win and just adjust right you can just adjust so all you got to do is just know that everyone's going to forget no one will honor their vows and if you think about life that way you will never be surprised in business if people leave you then take it as a sign i'm doing something wrong right if there's some you know discontent in the marriage take it as a science and be like she doesn't appreciate me think
(11:50) about how i can appreciate her more right how can i make things better for her so that she wants to stay right so she gets excited she like she doesn't want like she's no energy anymore like okay cool why don't we have energy why don't i make her dinner once you know what i mean or what like whatever whatever that person's love language is i'm not get too deep in like on the marriage side but like you got to fill their needs customers and employees too like especially especially since we're selling service most of us are selling service and
(12:18) if you're selling service you need to fulfill the person's needs otherwise they're not going to fulfill the needs of your customers right are you investing in them do you want them to grow are you giving them the things that they need to move on and become rock stars so anyways i love you guys i hope you guys having an amazing amazing day and weekend hope you found this valuable as always thank you very much for your attention i know that you have many things to spend your attention and eyeballs on and i'm honored that you
(12:42) decided to spend the last few minutes with me on saturday morning lots of love guys if you're a gym owner and you haven't joined i promise we can help make you a bunch of money and make this business a lot easier for you so lots of love guys talk to you soon

Transcript:
(00:00) the biggest mistake that I have done in my entrepreneurial career I'm going to walk through and then I'll explain kind of the The Meta concept that I think is why we are doing better now than we've ever done before the very beginning of my business I started an online uh Fitness coaching business called the free training project which then flipped to for-profit I then started a gym now I did a smart move and said I'm going to focus on only one of them which was the gym and the gym grew I kept doing this gym thing cuz that kept working and then all of a sudden as I kept opening
(00:27) locations I was like man I'm pretty good at this marketing and sales stuff then all these people started being like hey can I give you money to do other stuff and I was like well I accept money and I can do other things so that sounds great within the next 12 months I had a dental agency a Ciro agency and a business that was the turnaround business which was me flying out to gyms and so I tried to grow four businesses at the same time where I was CEO of all of them it took me getting into a head-on collision in a DUI where I had a mentor of mine
(00:52) whatever you want to call it who's like your lack of ability to make decisions will kill you after that over the next 7 days I broke up with which is probably the best term because some of you guys are in terrible Partnerships and won't admit it I broke up with my partner um that I had with a couple of the gyms not all of them but a couple of them I broke up with partner I had for dentl a part broke up with a partner I had for Cairo and then broke up with another business that was related to tangentially with
(01:17) the launch thing and it sucked but finally after all of those conversations I was able to just do the turnaround business and then within the next however many months you guys know that story it exploded we made a whole bunch of money and then we switched to licensing and then we did uh 3 something then 480 then 780 then a million then one2 then 15 then two and we kept going straight line all the way to four at that point I was like huh you know what we could do start another business that was when I started Prestige and Prestige obviously helped the top line and the bottom line as well but the day that I
(01:50) started Prestige was the day that gym launch stopped growing so gym launch maintained and then I grew Prestige cuz then Prestige got all my reign then I was like okay well I split my attention we went up in Revenue well I'm going to create this ecosystem for gyms and so then I started Allen and so I'm now here with three companies I just have more money to do things now and so I'm CEO of Allen CEO of prestige labs and CEO of gym lunch and as soon as that happened um Prestige Labs went down slowly and
(02:22) gym launch went down very very very slowly and that continued until I sold Allan and then after I sold Allen gym launch straight line up and that was what allowed us to actually eventually exit the company I bring this up because it's been the hardest lesson of my entrepreneurial career you have to learn to say no and I actually think Focus just comes down to saying no to everything that is not what you said you would do that's it that's all it is and so if we want to be focused then you can run that filter through your brain which is this is something that is not what I said I would do which means
(03:08) if I want to be focused the answer is no now how focused you are determines the extent to which and across domains that you say no to so on one level you say no to business opportunities even more focused to be a person who says no to business opportunities and new friend opportunities even more focused to be somebody who does no new friend opportunities no new business opportunities no networking opportunities and the list can keep going right if somebody did literally nothing else then they'd be the most
(03:37) focused person and so it's not a am I focused or not it's how focused are you there's this quote that I heard from Justine musk which is Elon musk's like seventh wife removed or whatever Elon if you ever see this I love you she said he said no in a way that protected his resources so that he could Channel them towards his own goal and I realized that behind every no is a deeper yes to whatever it is that you do and so I just think about it that way which is like the focus feels bad on the outside because no one likes saying no but what it really is just saying yes
(04:15) again to the thing you said you would do and the reason this is so near and dear to my heart is because I have it's it's been the struggle of my life it's been so hard for me and the opportunities that I get presented now are insane they're nuts and I recently had to turn down an opportunity that was absolutely absurd and now the opportunities are all billion dollar opportunities everything's a billion now which is cool but I also have acquisition. comom which will for sure be a billion dollar plus company in the next 36 months like we
(04:43) will be there that's like we need to we didn't we need to not do anything else I can just not mess it up and it's still hard and so I gave myself this saying which was and you can scale it up or down whatever way you want which is I'm not going to sacrifice my first billion for my second and so right now some of you have your first million or 10 million or 100 million or whatever the number is for you and you get excited about your second 100 million or your second 10 million or your second million and you forget to make your first one and I'm
(05:14) I'm keep I have so much content on this specific topic because it's something I struggle with so much and that's why I wanted to hit on this so you're going to hear another quote so you guys can tell me who this is uh people think Focus means saying yes to the thing you focus on you've got to focus on but that's not what it means at all means saying no to 100 other good ideas that there are you have to pick carefully I'm actually as proud of the things we haven't done as the things I have done Innovation is saying no to a thousand things Steve
(05:40) Jobs you've got to say no no no and when you say no you piss people off also Steve Jobs I was listening to an interview from one of his Executives when they were building the um the I can't remember if was the iPod or the iPhone and so they were like so what was it like to work with Steve and he said Steve would start meetings and just say what have you said no to lately you just start with that because he figured out that that's what Focus really meant is what you say no to and he said I would sometimes like have some NOS ready for the meeting so I could like throw him out but he's like he wouldn't be satisfied if I gave him like obvious NOS
(06:17) he said it had to be no to something that you deeply wanted it had to be like a juicy no and some of you guys right now have juicy NOS that are sitting there and you just have to get the credit from Steve Jobs for saying a real no cuz the other aren't actually NOS they're obvious Nos and if you actually pursued them you'd be an idiot the ones that really are the meaningful ones that Propel you in your career are also these sacrifices that you put on the altar of the success that you want to have and so in some ways it's like it's it's all the opportunities that you turn away because
(06:47) you really thought about the one thing that you that meant that meant the most to you and so I got this from a mentor he said if you don't say no to good opportunities you'll never have the time to pursue the Great opportunities' and once in a lifetime opportunities come about twice a year so let me explain why this concept matters and why it's going to make you more money and why I think it's the greatest superpower of entrepreneurs so fundamentally you can do more stuff or get more for the stuff you do that's it which is fundamentally volume times leverage this is the
(07:21) definition of output which I Define work as output personally so I don't Define it as you know work times distance times whatever in within the context of a business it's the amount of stuff you do and what you get for every repetition which yields your ultimate output so in the beginning when you're really shitty at making cold calls you have to do a lot of them to get and you don't have a lot of Leverage because you're bad at it to get some level of output but here's the really interesting thing about leverage and volume the more you do the
(07:52) better you get at doing I've told this story before and there's a lot of different analogies for it but two classes start in University for making one class the professor says you have to make the perfect pot by the end of the semester it's the only assignment you make one pot and at the end I'll grade you on how good that pot is the other group he said I don't care how good the pots are make as many pots as you possibly can and I'm just going to measure it and the pot has to be round and it has to be able to hold water and that's it those are the requirements of
(08:22) the pot as many as you can and at the end of the semester everyone assumed that the person who had the quality pot was going to be one who had the best pot and the volume pots had the most volume pots but something interesting happened which is that the people with the volume pots had both the most pots and the best pots because they had so many more repetitions to get better they had done more work and they got better at what they did and so then they had literally far more output and the quality was better so they crushed the other team if it was a business Bruce Lee said I don't
(08:53) fear the man who's done 10,000 kicks one time I fear the man who's done one kick 10,000 times and so some of you are just doing one kick at a time which are your business ventures and you as entrepreneurs are just like wondering why your kick suck it's like because they're always new and it's starting a game over with a different character every time you get to level two and saying well I'm going to see if I can beat level one yet again with this new character and then you get stuck yet again I'm partially saying this because
(09:24) I'm trying to reinforce this with myself because saying no to that last billion dollar opportunity just recently I said no to so I made a video um a while ago about a billion dollar opportunity I said no to a really big one was far more than a billion dollar opportunity like this week and so this is me rededicating to the fact that the woman in the red dress just gets hotter and hotter and hotter it never goes away or at least it hasn't gone away for me if you continue to grow if you stay the same then you know the woman of the red
(09:51) dress or if you go down the woman of red dress gets uglier right I say this figuratively what's interesting about this is that I actually think the distractedness comes from a place of delusion it's that we somehow fool ourselves into thinking that if we do two things we can compete against people who do one thinking that we're that much better than the competition and we're just not because the person who's going to beat you is the person who said no to everything else imagine the perfect competitor somebody that you would be incredibly afraid to go up against they're incredibly intelligent they're
(10:21) incredibly hardworking they always learn from their mistakes they never stop they say no to nothing else be a tough person to compete against and then add on top of the fact that they're patient and they have no rush to beat you probably going to win here's the interesting thing you can be that competitor like I mean I think about myself when I had I had I if you count each location as a location I had like 10 businesses I was CEO of if you don't count the locations then I had four different businesses that I was CEO of it was absurd Not only was I just the CEO I was also the chief salesman for like half of them like and also did the
(10:59) delivery like it was a period of time where I did not sleep I did not eat I did not work out I mean I kind of worked out cuz Lea fores me too and she feeds me so I ended up staying in okay shape but anyways point is is that I was only alive on like I was like hooked up to Just Energy drinks and adrenaline hoping to make this thing work and the harder I work the less money I made because I was doing it wrong and I'm hoping that I can prevent one person here from doing that and so saying no as I try to see this now is saying is putting money in the bank
(11:30) saying yes spends the money and I think we want to say yes because yes is feel good in the moment and feel bad later when you have to stick with that commitment NOS feel bad today because you have to let someone down but feel good later when you realize you don't have to go or you don't have to do that thing that you almost had to do and so it's actually Nos and yeses are very short-term long term in terms of decision making so I was like why do we keep doing this or we Royal we why do I keep doing this um and so trying to zero
(12:00) that down has helped me um and just saying like oh this is you being wanting a cookie today that's why you're trying to say yes you just want a cookie right now and simplifying it like that has helped me get over it well I mean I you know once an addict always an addict for you know distracted Focus uh but for now I've have conquered my my addiction for the the week um and so you know the reason people can't say no is because saying yes once you start takes less effort it gives reward now and pain later no gives pain now and reward
(12:32) later and I think where this really comes down is that our business when it gets tough stops rewarding you because like when things are growing it's exciting of course it's like a new relationship you're like super you know you're into it things are moving momentum's happening you're hiring people there's cash flow it's great but then all of a sudden you encounter this boss or this obstacle this thing that you can't get over and all of a sudden like all that reward starts going away or becoming far more infrequent and so then you your eye starts wandering and you start looking for the other relationship that high again um but
(13:07) trying to reframe that point as I am at level three and it doesn't matter how many new characters I switch to I'm going to have to battle this boss and so all I'm doing is delaying the inevitable for a confrontation that I have to have to do thinking about it that way has basically made me be like don't be little [ __ ] like you have to frame and this is a useful exercise for anyone is I try and frame the thing that I don't know how to the problem as something I don't know how to do so rather than saying who had the ads problem you guys so instead of saying ads agencies don't
(13:43) work I'm not saying you say this instead of saying ad agencies don't work you say I don't know how to work with ad agencies that is a skilled deficiency and now it's under your control right and so blame becomes something that you can control and then now you can do something about it I promise there are agencies that do a good job in your space the same thing is like um Tik Tock doesn't work for us I don't know how to work Tik Tok this is a skill deficiency and if that's what I need to do for the the next level rather than starting another business and reconquering the first three because I can get to that level really quickly and get that quick
(14:14) High I have to sit here and I have to be comfortable in the fact that I don't know what I'm doing and the problem with that period is that you basically have to try out all of your best bad ideas until you have no bad ideas left and you have only good ones and so and then one of those good ones will work and sometimes it takes five best bad ideas to get to a sixth good idea but once you have that sixth what's interesting about it is that like you've seen before once you unlock level three you know how to pass
(14:44) it every time and so I would say that the reason that we've been able to move so quickly now with the companies that we have that we invest in that we buy is that we know what level you know one through 100 million a year looks like and now we're about to you know cross our third company doing that and so like we we we've done this before now and I remember I think I was telling somebody the story but when I was trying to find a sales director for the first time I had no idea what I was looking for so the first thing I did was the first mistake everyone makes which is oh this guy's the best guy on the team I'll make
(15:13) him the manager don't do that I did that and then of course I lost my best closer and my best closer also hated managing 0 for two and so then I'm like okay I either have to give him a demotion which is going to hurt his ego right just it's just terrible rocking hard place so so that didn't work out so then I hired another sales manager this sales manager was the opposite of that guy all operations all process and he did mediocre to bad better than the guy who hated people and just wanted to close deals who's a pure Hunter this guy did
(15:43) okay eventually we said Hey how do you think you're doing and he's like not that good and we're like okay you can either leave or we can take the demotion he was like I will swallow my pride and take the demotion I'd rather just close and I was like great so then I had a third sales manager and this guy l people and he understood sales well and so he loved spending time doing 10 ones he loved watching the guys improve he was just a people person and he was organized and he trained the team and the team's performance went up and I was like oh that's what a sales director looks like and from that point in my
(16:16) career I haven't missed on sales directors and that has been true of every every other role I've had in the business and so all of the time that it took for for those managers to cycle through was growth I didn't have close rates that dropped cash flow that suffered because I didn't know what it looked like and so I consider that ignorance debt and so we have to pay that debt down so all businesses incur debt and the biggest one being ignorance of the founder not knowing what it takes to grow this business and so framing the problems that we have as the things that we have to confront as
(16:47) this is debt I have to pay and there's no way around it this is a toll of the success road that I'm on and I will stay at this toll until I come up with the change to pay this debt to open the lever so I can go to the next toll booth and keep driving until I hit it again and it's going to cost me probably more at the next one because these guys are greedy these told these uh you know the lessons of Life are very expensive and so for me the reason I spend so much time documenting a lot of you guys probably don't know this but my podcast when I started it I didn't make
(17:23) it for you guys I made it for me and for those of you who are trying to like document your journey really helpful frame because I didn't really get too obsessed with the fact that I had like 200 downloads per episode like it didn't really matter to me cuz I was like you know it'd be cool cuz one of the biggest things I always wanted was Elon Musk and Jeff basos the channel from 1997 where he's like here I am on Amazon and this is our sign and we'll see what happens and I wish that they had done that and so I've tried very hard to be able to do that um you know with my own career and so for those of
(17:54) you who want a fun little tidbit the first podcast that I have is 90 days after after I lost everything so you can actually hear from basically Ground Zero to here now the evolution and thinking so and I think that there might be some utility in that because as I'm walking through that it's at zero so what I'm thinking with is an entrepreneur who just lost everything is trying to figure out what the next move is and so use that for what you will but from a Content perspective I try and document those lessons so that I can continually recognize the pattern again
(18:30) and so what I want to have happen is oh this is another one of those and then I can just play The Playbook I be like what did I what was I thinking then and I can go back into the archives and be like Oh yeah this is what I'm looking for oh yeah this is what I'm looking for two biggest regrets I have is that I didn't document anything until I lost everything twice number one the second biggest regret that I have is that I have no recorded sales from the 4,000 closes that I did in person not one to be fair Tech wasn't as good then it would have been a little bit weird but I could have done it and I regret that I mean imagine the
(19:00) [ __ ] Library I would have had and so I hope that you do that but what I want you to have is I want you to have your your playlist of your hottest calls if you are a salesperson or have great salese having them record when they're hot when you're like dude I could close anyone right now that's what you want to record because the way that you pause how you phrase your questions your tonality everything is what it's like to be on fire and being on fire is simply a different way of doing things that you were before that's more effective and so so what you want to do is then study why
(19:31) what is it and how I talk and how I phrase these words that increases the close rate of my calls what is it and then you can get better and better and better at closing because you'll study the best game footage you'll repeat the most successful activities that you did advantages of saying no to everything is actually keeping a deep yes because the best person in the world has only done that thing their entire lives and that's how you get world class results the biggest Returns come from the end of the cycle what I mean by
(20:04) this and this is kind of the unfortunate or fortunate part of life is that if you think about this as your progress right so let's say this is 10% 20% 30% 40% 50% 60% 70% 80% right that's you compared to the rest of the marketplace you get better this whole time and you barely see any improvements in output but all the gains come from being the top 10% to the top 5% all of this gain becomes yours and then top five to top 97 A2 all of that becomes yours and you gain more from getting from 95 to 97 A2 than you did from everything up to 90 because fortunately
(20:48) unfortunately we live in a winter take all society and so if you look at the top selling book on Amazon it sells more than the bottom 5.9 million books on Amazon Amazon and when you buy stuff on Amazon you probably like oh there's three products here one that has 2,000 reviews one that has 200 and one that has 20 you're not like you know what I'm going to chance it on the 200 you're like I'm feeling risky today no you just buy the 2,000 why because it's trusted and that's how most people do it and that's why the sales are
(21:20) distributed 95% and then for some reason someone doesn't like the color of the main seller and or their phone didn't load weird and they accidentally click the number two best seller right and you got lucky and so what's interesting about this period right here and I'm I'm starting to really live that right now and I'm trying to like send telegrams back so that hopefully it's helpful is that if you make a video 10% better you don't get 10% more views sometimes you get five times the views if you make a video 20% better
(21:52) you'll get 50 times the views and so we get outsize returns for incremental improvements here and the only way you can get those incremental improvements is saying no to everything that isn't the one thing that matters most so I think some of you guys have some juicy nose sitting on your table at home I think you have some strategic decisions that aren't really strategic decisions they're things that just take up all your time when you could just be working on the stuff that you know will grow your business which is do more do better period
(22:31) and you don't need to try that new thing you probably don't need to go to that random lunch with so and so to explore synergies I know who you are and I'll tell you a fun story to drive this home so um recently there was a relatively large influencer who reached out to me and lots of following blah blah blah you'd know who they were and um they were like hey I would love to connect and I was like this will not change anything about what my plan is to grow acquisition.
(23:12) and I fundamentally have always held the belief that if I continue to grow a that door will either be open or there will be a bigger and better door that will open in that door's place if it closes because people will always want to make room for winners and winners have to say no to everyone else Joe Rogan can call anybody to get them to answer his call and if he said no to them 10 years ago do you think it's more or less likely that they answer the call when he calls them now more likely but if Joe Rogan had taken every one of those calls and not built The Joe Rogan
(23:45) Experience the way it is now many of those people probably wouldn't answer their calls and so when people are trying to connect with you because of the success you have realize that it's because of the Su success you have and they will only want to reach out to you more when when you have even more success and so you actually threaten the main reason they reached out to you by choosing to take the call and so this particular individual he like well you know maybe we can you know I have the deal that you could blah I was like all right maybe this could contribute and says I am free on Monday at this time
(24:16) he's like well I'm not free at that time and I said okay and he's like I'm not free on Mondays and I was like well I take calls on Mondays he was like well um well I mean can you change it to any of the other days of the week and I said no he just kind of like got weird and so then I was like I guess we won't meet and I can keep living my life because I know what I need to do right now to get us to where we want to go and there's probably nothing that this person is going to say that is going to in any way increase the likelihood that
(24:53) that occurs and so thinking about it from like how will this change my activities help at least does for me say no to the hundreds and thousands of things that want to take your attention and you just have to make the decision of whether you care about that thing more than you care about feeling good in the moment or Saving Face and I would strongly recommend as fast as seemly possible being okay with people not liking you not understanding you and thinking that you are different than them because you
(25:24) are you're a winner H yeah I'll take let's take I got a little time so let's um uh shoot why can I ask why did you say to the billion dollar deal if that wouldn't that contribute to the big U the way that that deal would work it would require more time for me to not be doing this that deal though it has a risk adjusted return of a billion plus now decreases the likelihood that I make this billion plus which has a far higher likelihood this one is I don't want to say nothing's guaranteed in life but I don't have need to believes like with every
(25:58) new venture there's a certain number of need to beliefs like if this happens and this happens and this happens then we can achieve this thing if I've already netted out the need to beliefs like we need to believe that if we make content that we can make content that spreads to business owners that was a need to belief I didn't have that when I started acquisition.
(26:21) comom so I paid down that risk by starting but it turns out that if you make business owner content business owners pay attention check now from business owner content does that then create demand for deals I don't know some people just watch stuff and nothing happens it turns out that if you do make business owner content even if you give away all the secrets business owners are more likely not less likely to want to do business with you I didn't know that that was a guess check that worked and so there's just this number of need to believes that occurs in every single business if you don't know what these are for you highly recommend figuring with those out because then you can ask the question differently which
(26:51) is does this increase the likelihood that what I want to have happen happens and then that can approximate a confidence score which is how confident am I in taking this action which is what's the perceived likelihood of me getting what I want or what I think will happen and so most entrepreneurs by Nature are optimistic we think everything's going to work out and then all of a sudden everyone here many people every time I ask this question more than half the room says they're stuck so obviously it didn't and so we have to balance this eternal optimism which keeps you going with the crushing
(27:21) real reality of the fact that we don't guess that well and we have to solve new problems because we don't have the perspective from which to make the judgment when we started you probably know a hundred times more about the business now than when you did the back of napkin math and you're like I'm going to be rich right and there's all these other things but the thing is is that they are now known unknowns when you have an opportunity you go into unknown unknowns because you don't have perspective because you're not in it all you have to do side note is talk to people who are in that game for five plus years and they will tell you all
(27:50) the problems in the business yes so I have the construction company I have a flipping business um and I also about to start building like literally three houses how did you identify uh you know gym launch as your wife how do you know it's your wife or just another woman in the red dress so I'm going to read this quote from the um founder of uh Dropbox Drew Houston he said everyone loves the idea of focus but what Focus actually means is shooting stuff you love and turning down things you know you can make work and so
(28:23) you all three of those businesses you can probably make work or they already are so for me this is actually my really good litmus test for this which is what's the one that like you don't put as much time in and it just makes money and it's covering all your fun ideas real estate right do that imagine if you actually spent time doing it all of your time I'll tell you a story so we had a um a lady who had a uh re like a premium cocktail business and so she came here I got to understand her business pretty well um and so she was cans but she
(28:57) wanted to be premium she had spent a ton of money trying to get this out there and fundamentally people didn't really care too much about paying a lot of money for canned cocktail drinks when you could just have a tiny thing of Jack and kzero and kind of call your flight a flight right and so she was trying to sell on to travel and having a tough time she was too expensive and there was no brand behind it so the buyers wouldn't buy and the people on the plane didn't care so I asked her how do you live cuz she obviously was burning a lot of money in this business and so she said oh you know for years I've always
(29:33) just been a flipper and I'm really good um interior designer and so she knew how to identify properties that had big value ad where if she did a facelift she could make big money and so she just did it with penth houses so she was just really good at that kind of like really high end and so I was like so has this been the thing that's made you all of your money your whole life and she was like yeah that's kind of how I make my money but this this and I was like this is a waste of time and she was like well the interior design flipping thing isn't scalable and I was like let me restate this to you
(30:06) real estate isn't scalable I was like it is possibly the most scalable business in existence you literally add zeros you add doors it actually gets more scalable the bigger you get and if you're like well I don't know if I make enough money doing just the real estate I have to do these other things then you need to fix the model which means maybe you have a bigger construction company than the size deals you're doing which means maybe you can support much bigger deals on the real estate side and then the constraint becomes capital and luckily in real
(30:35) estate capital is not a hard constraint to solve if you have a good deal the capital will appear way back what do you do when you and your spouse are confused that's Lila doing that to me so um what do you do when you and your partner or you and your spouse are conf confused or in Conflict around what is the juicy know and what is the real yes I will tell you a fun story which is that the Allen deal of me starting Allen the software company is the only fight that Lea and I have ever been in and she just pleaded with me to not do Allen and I was like you're you're just G to
(31:13) you're just going to have to see like when we just you know crush it and the thing is is that we did crush it but at the expense of the other two companies and so I just borrowed from Peter to pay Paul and so what you don't want is to do what I did which is I wanted to prove myself right but I was long-term wrong I really like to think of kind of the question that I was asking earlier like which one of these things instead forget about the new exciting juicy because there's that everywhere and you can convin who here knows how to spin themselves up and get
(31:44) really excited about something right not hard not hard to do but the devil you know in a lot of ways is the devil you've already paid all this ignorance tax on and so a lot of you guys are trying to jump ship when you're here but you've already paid down all of this time and you're just starting to see a little bit of growth because you started to really turn the corner on your skills and this is the first time that you have a more attractive woman in the red dress and so the thing is is that every business this is my fundamental belief is that every business can become a billion dollar business I've yet to see a business that can't do
(32:22) it so whether you if you were like I want to do the salons I'm like well then cool then go let's go do 2,000 locations it'll take 25 years but if that's what you want to do then we can go build a billion dollar thing you can build billion dollar construction companies you just can't do that and build salons the piece of mind I want to give you is that either of the choices will work if you stick with it and neither of them will work if you don't pick um the man who I owe a contract to all right so we
(32:50) have we have two groups of products we don't know whether to to one and then scale that or let me ask this Lila uses as frame a lot and this is helpful probably for you guys which is which problem would you rather have you can either have the brand and director consumer marketing problem which is what you have in your $53 business or you can have the B2B competitive space of being price matched against other machines and dealing with buyers and invoices and you know so which of those businesses would you rather have so I said earlier about play it out play it out which of these
(33:24) businesses would you rather have I don't think you can have both I mean you could I just don't think you'll make as much money personally it would be the D to St on the website okay then stick with the thing that you're good at that has made you the money up to this point the fact that these people came to you just say that's not the business we're in it's shooting things that you absolutely love that you know you could make work I know you could make it work and you probably love the $20,000 checks but if you really want to
(33:52) do this then you have to play it out because the guys you're competing against aren't thinking about selling machines they're trying to think about how to sell more of these $53 things now if that vanished from your mind how much simpler is your life so much that feeling you have right now is what Focus feels like and you just have to protect it at all costs it makes it really easy to win when you only have one thing to do

Transcript:
(00:00) the single most valuable skill set you can have is getting other people to do things for you because fundamentally if you know how to do that then you can get somebody else to do every other portion of the business and they can build it on your behalf and so in this video I'll walk through an in-depth process of how I think about managing people to get the desired outcome on a consistent basis and how to have some of the hardest conversations you have to have and make it feel easy so let me show you something that I haven't done in any
(00:23) other school days but I'll I'll walk you through it so I just call this like my Management Diamond so fundamentally if you ask someone to do something you want them to do it if they're not doing it then comes the problem solving right which is what how when oops okay so if someone doesn't do what you want them to do the first and obvious reason they didn't know what you wanted them to do and so you fix this one communication this is by the way a really good framework for having hard conversations when someone's not doing a
(01:05) good job so you say hey Carly I wanted you to do this and you haven't done it so I just want to figure out what the reason was so we can solve it or make it less likely to happen in the future so I figured the first was that you didn't know that I wanted you to do that did you know that I wanted you to do that if they say no I didn't know then you're like great now you know right now if they're like I did know that you wanted me to do that then you're like oh did you not know how to do it which you solve with
(01:32) training which we'll dovetail into the whole teaching thing in a second but okay yes I did know that you wanted me to do it and I know how to do it but I didn't know you wanted it by now or by tomorrow and so I didn't have a deadline here so we assign deadlines when we tell people to do things and that's just again to hold them responsible now if someone knows what you want them to do they know how to do it and there's a deadline associate and they still don't do it then the question is do they need some sort of incentive were they not
(01:58) motivated to do it or was something blocking them I could have the best chef in the world who's the most motivated know that I want to make an omelet knows how to do it knows I want it in the next five minutes he's like bro I don't have eggs doesn't matter how much I do like sometimes people don't have like we actually had this issue with my editing team was I was like why don't you all [ __ ] edit in the building and they're like the upload speed they're like my upload speed at home is faster than here and so it actually just takes me more
(02:22) time and so we paid Google Fiber to drill a hole into the [ __ ] wall and here we are now they can up it's faster here now right but it's fundamentally like if there are blockers then it's like okay well can I just solve whatever that blocker is can I remove that impediment and so walking through this has helped me have a lot of hard conversations with people and not make them hard it's like there's five reasons that you didn't do it you didn't know what it was how to do it when I wanted it you were't incentivize or something's
(02:48) blocking you any of these sound familiar and if there's more than one then you got to fix more than one and often times if you delegate if you basically you hand something off to somebody and it gets worse after you hand it off it's because you didn't delegate it advocated it you just said here you go good luck and so that's a very easy litmus test if you hand it off and it gets better or it's neutral then you actually delegated it and so what happens is most entrepreneurs just find a human being that has a pulse say they have a meeting
(03:14) like this and just say a lot of things at them expect the person to have 100% retention and know exactly what to do when they want to do it how they want it done with no blockages the person's not aware of and then be done be like oh yeah I already I told him once it's like yeah once not in a written format in no structured form like and then you're just yelling at them on a zoom call and then two weeks later you're surprised that they're not doing as well as you after having done it for [ __ ] years you know what I mean so we we think
(03:44) through this and this is how I think through um trying to figure out um employee issues so this one's fairly straightforward I my opinion this one's fairly straightforward the two hard ones are these guys so from a training perspective I'll give you I'll give you an example I had to do recently with um a teammate or an employee here um I'll just give a so let's say there's somebody on your team who's a dick right you're like hey Caroline you're being a dick um the thing is is that stop being a dick is actually a pretty terrible
(04:19) directive and the reason is because they don't know what they're doing because they're dicks they're like you just want me to not be me and you're like kind of and so what we have to do is so I call it bundling and un bundling terms and this is fundamentally why I think my content does better than most people's is that like you've heard me to find terms it's like okay patience is figuring out what to do in the meantime so if I told someone be patient it doesn't mean anything if I say be charismatic how do I be charismatic it's
(04:48) like okay I need you to have more uh vocal ranges when you're talking I need you to pause for emphasis I need you to say people's name I need you to look them in the eyes I need you to nod when they're talking like these are a series of activities that when someone does all of them we bundle them together and say this person's charismatic and so rather than saying be charismatic say I need you do these six things or stop doing these six things that you are doing and by doing that then people will stop describing you as a dick and so we
(05:17) had um so a teammate who's really high potential like really smart hardworking did all that stuff but something started happening and it started acting a little bit dickish and we had four leaders in my company have like sit down talks which normally wouldn't do but the person was really good at their job like I don't really want to lose the productivity and so I was the last stop I was like it's me or you're out so we got to figure something out here and he'd already been given a lot of instruction a lot of don't be a dick be
(05:45) nicer things like that but that doesn't help anyone change their behavior and so fundamentally giving someone a frame of what I want to have happen as a result of this conversation helps fil or what you're actually talking to them about and so like me insulting them or making them feel bad doesn't actually do anything for increasing the likelihood that they behave in a certain way most of the time it's just Clarity just like when you hop on the call and you tell people to do this stuff immediately they will not like you and if they don't like
(06:10) you they'll complain more which makes it more like you get fired you don't want to get fired great so all you have to do is not do that at the beginning of the calls people stop describing you that way he's like this is so eye opening I didn't even know and there was like four or five other items that I'd asked for specific examples so that I could say like stop doing these things and people stop calling you a dick and within a month people were people were like dude he's completely turned around it's like he just actually had Specific
(06:32) Instructions and so most of us aren't willing to do the hard work of saying like what is this person doing or what does this person need to do which is why I'm a big fan of checklist because it's like this is what you have to do when you onboard someone like check your hair make sure that there's not a bed in the background like I'm like yeah you're onboarding a customer and it's got like you know a pink bunny poster behind you and it's like that's probably not the first impression I'm really looking for right so it's like these are the
(06:58) checklists that you go through it's like first you greet them by name second you look at the notes and you tell them about the goal and then when you took a recording of the onboarding call it's like why does Sarah suck and Caroline's great just say well Sarah here's the checklist you did three there's 11 items Sarah consistently or Caroline does you know nine out of 11 and hers consistently get higher scores now if she if Sarah follows the checklist and she does all 11 and her scores are way below the other girls then it means the
(07:27) checklist is wrong which means that's on you not on her and so it means that you're incomplete in terms of what you're trying to train them on and so sometimes it's useful to know that so if both people do the checklist and they objectively meet the things then there's other things that you don't know about and so fundamentally soft skills and hard skills are all just skills it's just that soft skills people just have a harder time teaching because it's bundled language and I think that's why so many people struggle teaching
(07:53) them so in training the team to loop back to your question I want to figure out what the problem is with the person so I can try and loop to these things if it's a training issue I try and break it down as much as I humanly can if it's a motivation issue um it really comes down to reinforcing stimuli so either people do things that uh because they get stuff that they like or they avoid things they hate getting fired is usually a pretty aversive stimulus so a lot of people will do things to just not get fired so
(08:20) it's fairly strong um but the best performers do it do things because they just like doing them like the best employees the best teammates they just work all the time because the actual conditions of work are more reinforcing than any boss can be right which is why a lot of people like on my team for example with like a lot of editors and whatnot they just edit in their free time they picked up editing because editing itself is a reinforcing thing no one call cold calls in their free time oh yeah I just picked up cold calling on
(08:45) the side yeah I just cold call like on my days off just because I just like it like no one says that uh but the thing is is that sales and editing have very fast feedback loops and so you can immediately get off the call and get a reward you immediately get you see an edit and or you catch a moment and there's there's this F A lot of feedback loops that are really tight and good other roles have slower and longer feedback cycles and so as a manager you have to basically artificially input more feedback loops into longer project
(09:14) timelines or jobs that require more complex tasks um that motivate people through reinforcement and so a lot of people I think in culture say oh someone did something crazy and so what we do is we say what happened that caused them to do it but we actually invert how Behavior Works which is people do things because of what happens after they do them not because what happened before and so that's like what happens after you do stuff is the latency of training and that's how you train people and so anyways I I I ge out on human
(09:47) behavior stuff a lot but um motivation fundamentally comes from deprivation which is what are you most deprived of so if someone who's very deprived of Praise which many people are giving praise motivates them if someone gets praise all the time praise might not motivate them just depends on the person and so this is figuring out what are the reinforcing stimuli from someone's past that's getting to know your employees better so you can do the things that motivate them money by the way has been conditioned as a universal uh reinforcer
(10:19) we've learned at an early age that this thing equals whatever we want so it's just a generalized reinforcer but there are more specific reinforc that you can give to individual people so yeah that's that's that and then block you just unblock the thing if you can afford it whatever the problem is so um that's my little Manifesto on management if that helped out okay cool oh great Where do you um where do you find like more information to better understand these Concepts because we're in a very in like human capital
(10:49) intensive industry management is the the big piece that's missing for like every company and that's why so many people fail where would I find like this in more depth and in more volume so that I can understand these Concepts better so I've got a special CTA for you today uh this exerpt was from a school day so this is from the school winners who came out they were the top 10 and they asked me about managing team and so I answered that question but if you don't have a business then none of that matters and so to start a business you can go to
(11:21) school.com we run the school games it's for people who are just getting started in business and that's what that's for if you already have a business and you have a big team and you want to scale your team we run workshops occasionally at acquisition. at our headquarters here in Vegas and so if you'd like to partake in one of our workshops you can go there and click the scale button and uh hopefully we'll see you soon so most of these Concepts were derived from the ground up from just like rat studies with Dr cashy Who Sam Sam knows my my
(11:47) good buddy and so um I think most people just do a lot of things and just like see what happens like it's very halfhazard I think almost no one knows how to train period I feel I feel like understanding human psychology like that was always my found even ignore psychology really I completely ignore it I I would say that you talk a lot about it like you probably never heard me say the word psychology not the word psychology but what you're maybe I'm blanking it right so so to get no I don't want to get too far into that
(12:18) because I will go there but um so this is this is like for everyone like if you want to basically have your [ __ ] ometer always turned on it's separating out when people give reasons because statements or just blank statements of like the other day somebody was like there's only three ways that you can you know make a customer worth more and then they and then they continue the sentence I was like that's just false they just started the statement that way and a lot of people make statements that are just false they have no idea what they're
(12:45) saying and so we walk through a framework when we're trying to basically detect [ __ ] which is logic evidence utility which is what does this mean how do you know and then so what so I'll give you an example so I had um I had someone the other day say I'm stressed because I'm lonely and I was like okay I was like what does lonely mean to you it's a bucketed term right it's a bundled term he was like well I was like that on Friday night you have known to text or that people don't respond back to you or like what what is the what what does
(13:37) that mean to you because it's there's a thing there's an activity that occurred and then they described it they chunk it up as loneliness but when you get two steps below that of to like what occurred what was the action that got stunted or something that you wanted that you didn't get then you can get a lot more specific we're like okay so then I say all right so that was the lonely occurrence now have you been stressed before when that wasn't happening yes okay so then how do you know that that thing has anything to do
(14:05) with your stress they're completely decoupled right it's like all right and who cares you're stressed have you been stressed when things are going well yes have you been stressed when things are not going well yes so in general you're stressed when you're alive noted what's your point right and so we like breaking this down allows you to just be less confused about what other people say and so the reason I'm going here is because most people are full of [ __ ] not purposefully not maliciously they just don't know any better and so they just
(14:38) like paired out other things they talk about pop psychology whatever and I for the most part have just erased feelings intentions beliefs all of these words from my vocabulary in terms of what influenc his behavior because I just only focus on what can we observe because if I were to say this guy is really motivated I'd say how do you know what does motivation mean to you I said can you motivate me I was like Define motivation and she just like stood there and melted and I was like right so you want me to answer a question that you
(15:05) can't Define the word for so what's the likely that you get what you want really low and so the thing is is we ask questions about stuff all the time we can't Define which means maybe we need to ask better questions or at least know what the [ __ ] we're talking about and so anyways I bring this up because if you going back to the motivation thing if I say this person's really motivated you'd say how do you know it's like well they do all the stuff it's like great then forget about concept or label of motivation and just
(15:31) say this person does these things great and so I don't care if you feel motivated or not if you do these activities people describe you that way and if you do these activities when I had the conversation with the the dick in particular right I said I want to be clear I don't care if you're a dick I don't care if you hate everyone as long as you behave this way doesn't matter to me and so a lot of people spend all this time trying to be like there's these seven stages of awareness I'm like how do you know how do you know that what's your
(16:01) evidence for that and so what like what are the activities someone has to do okay they have to see your ad great then they have to interact with it in some way they have to take an action so if you go through the leads book I walk through the lead stages in the book and it's only based on the observable they took a step then they give you their information they give you means to contact them then after you have means to contact like you these are the things that like no one can like fight me like these are the things that have to occur
(16:25) and so if you if you reason up from what can I observe with with my eyes it makes life a lot easier even when you're talking to like a spouse you're like okay I'm really upset like okay what does that mean right now how do you know you're upset and so what what do you want me to do about it and so then you say like when you say this what do you want me to do when you say like if someone says like you should know it's like oh I'll play that game I'm hungry either means you would like me to go get you food you
(16:59) would like us to go get food together it could mean that you want space it could mean you're in a bad mood I was like but I won't take one Q for six behaviors pick and then it makes things a lot easier and so you can start training real realistically like anyone in your company to behave a certain way by just saying when you say this what do you want to have happen and also when you're having the conversation with staff or employees or whatever like sometimes we in in the moment like someone disrespects you you
(17:26) want to like immediately insult them or whatever right but you're like okay well what do I want to have happen well if I insult them they're going to be more resistant to me in the future but I need to have more influence over them not less so me counter punishing to prevent their their thing in the future it's probably going to be counterproductive and so what can I say that increases the likelihood that what I want to have happen happens and so it's like taking a second step forward and me back to think what's two the
(17:53) second order of magnitude effect on their behavior rather than what I feel like doing in the moment um and so when you're trying to look for okay how do I manage people better or how do I train people better most training is just not chunk down far enough and so the people who are successful in whatever your education thing is come in more qualified than other people like have you ever had a student or a customer who you're like this guy's going to win no matter what right it's not you it's because of them because they have a
(18:24) history of skill they have a larger skill set um that they bring to the table and so fundamental the people who are successful with your program are lacking the things you teach the people who are not successful lack those things and other things and so to have the most comprehensive training you would have to start with here's how you write words here's how you type here's how the internet works of course you're not going to do that because there's a base assumption which is what qualifies someone to be a customer of a certain
(18:52) level of skills it also works the same way with an employee there's certain level of skills that are required to work for this role and so if someone does have a deficiency then the question is what's the return on effort I think I could teach someone who has Down syndrome to be a neuros a neurosurgeon well I could but somebody could right it just might take 30 years it's probably not worth it because for the same resources we get 2,000 other neurosurgeons who don't have Down syndrome right and so if you think about
(19:17) your customers that way it's like and simply thinking about like take out character traits take out beliefs whatever it's just I need them to behave this way that's it just break it down to the activities and it makes a lot easier and so fundamentally it's like I wish I were more charismatic I wish more patient I wish I were more confident if you just debundled those things and just say how do I break this down to the smallest level and how do I just do those activities it makes it a lot easier and so usually when training does
(19:44) not work it's because we made an assumption of a skill set that they didn't have and so the more advanced someone is the vager the instruction can be so I can say or Sam can say hey man you think you just Market school I say sure that's it that's the directive it's not like okay do you think you can make this many pieces of content you think you could run this many pieces of AD or like whatever it is right and if I'm like hey think you make an amazing product keep making he's like sure like it's not like do you think you'd have an activation
(20:12) sequence an onboarding are we're going to do these things I like I trust that he's to do it because he has the skill set you trust that I can do it because I have the skill set and so fundamentally the more skilled the person is the bigger the instruction can be and so if you have lowl people you don't have a lot of room for vagueness so you have to be more specifically your instruction as people get higher and higher up in your organization you can be vager and vager with the instruction because they have more
(20:34) skills and so experts fundamentally just have more ways to be rewarded within the same context like if you're really good at editing video then you have many things that reward you because you have more skills if you're really bad at it there's very few things that reward you and so that's what Mastery development is

Transcript:
(00:00) You're about to watch a conversation between me and Alexi Omar, who's a legal attorney for musicians. The problem is that he's losing money and lots of it. And he only has about 6 months of cash left before his dream is going to go under. My name's Alexi acquisition.com.
(00:16) It's a portfolio of companies that last year did over $250 million in aggregate revenue. And we're going to take all of those findings and help him save his business. Enjoy. Let's do a quick quick overview. So, walk me through the business as it currently stands right now. What's revenue? Our revenue over the last 12 months has been 300,000 profit. Uh negative. So we're losing money. Okay.
(00:35) How much? We lost a 100,000. Okay. Minus 100,000. Yes. You're like, I could have done nothing and I would have just had zero at the end of the year instead of working all year and then being worse off. Heard. All right. What are the business units right now? We have services. Okay.
(00:56) We have education. Okay. And who do you sell to? I I sell to artists and entrepreneurs in the Latin music industry. Musicians who are Latin American who speak Spanish. Yeah. Okay. And uh you sell service, you sell education, what was the last one? Software. What's the revenue breakdown between Did any of these make money? Yeah. This the services. So this made money was profitable. Yeah, that was profitable. Okay.
(01:13) What was the top line and bottom line here? So we made 131,000. Okay. And we made about 10k for the in the last 10 uh 12 months in profit on that because you just didn't lose money on this one basically. Okay. And then education 131 as well. Oh, how coincidental. All right. Profit.
(01:37) But we lost there like most of the money we lost between the two. Okay. So it's between the two because they're under one company. Got it. And so this is 40K. I'm just going to put this as for the software. And then the money that you lost here was how much in total? I guess 100 110,000. Mhm. Okay. Put a little negative smiley face there. Maybe a little tears. There we go. Very sad. Okay. More tears. Yeah.
(01:56) More tears. All right. So, how are you how are you getting customers right now before we talk about how we're going to fix this? How you getting customers? So, we create content on YouTube. We have about 90,000 subscribers. Is that where most like everybody's coming from? Yeah. Okay. So, we got got YouTube. All right.
(02:13) What else we got? Then they usually go to our Instagram page from YouTube. Yeah. Okay. Is that the that's like the call to action in the videos and like the call to action is to go to our website, but a lot of people go to Instagram to just uh ask questions like, "Hey, I have this problem. Can you help me?" Interesting. Okay, got it.
(02:36) So, where do the sales come from then? The sales comes through DMs. So, usually they go to Instagram and they'll ask a question. So, the place that you don't intend people to go is where you make your money. Yeah.
(02:52) Instagram. And you don't tell people to go there. They just find you. Instagram? No. Yeah. They just find us. Okay. All right. We'll put a little star next to that. If all the money is coming in from Instagram, how many DMs do you get? So, we don't have that number. We know that from the website, we generate about 7,000 uh visitors. Okay. And for example, in April, we made 150 leads this far. So 7,000 clicks. Got it. All right. And then that goes into 150. Okay. Got it.
(03:20) So you're converting 2%. Okay. Into optins. Yeah. They're for free course. Okay. Optin for a free course. Yeah. Got it. Okay. And then from there, and then from there, usually we'll try to sell them the course, our main course. How do you try and sell them? Do you like reach out to them? Do you What do you With every video, we usually tell them, hey, and if you want to learn more about this, make sure to to enroll in our community. Mhm.
(03:51) The next step for that, they'll go through the course and receive some nurturing emails. And then from the emails is how they buy. And what are they buying from the emails? So, right now we're selling about um nine nine out of the 150. Our basic offer is $500 onetime fee. So, they have access to all of our courses now and forever. Okay.
(04:15) And then we have an upsell of another 500 to is that on a funnel or something? Yeah. In the same cart. Okay. Where they when they buy the 500, we'll upsell them to another 500 for monthly Q&A per month. No, just lifetime as well. Forever. Yeah. Nice. Okay. Oh gosh. Okay. So, there's so many I mean, where do There's so many things. Before we, you know, tear this apart, the good news is uh I actually think that you'll be able to make significantly more money pretty quickly.
(04:40) So, this is your education side. Yeah. All right. What's the uh services side? So, on the same Instagram page, if they want a consultation instead of learning because they say, "I'm not interested in learning. Sure. I just want Okay. I want you to do it.
(05:00) Yeah. I want you to do it. We'll then send them to our Calendarly link. Okay. To schedule a consultation and that's $250 for an hour. So you go DM to calendar. Mhm. Okay. And then you charge before you have the call. Yeah, man. Okay. Okay. 250. Dude, the good news is there's lots of room for improvement. Okay. That's great.
(05:26) So you have your calendar and then you charge 250 per hour and they pay on the calendar to to have access. Yes, man. All right. And so that means that you sold somewhere in the neighborhood of uh 6 or 630 something like whatever the math is 131* 4 that's 400 520. So uh 524 so 524 hours is what you were able to sell in services last year. You could 131,000. Okay.
(05:50) between the consultations because usually when they go through the consultation say for example the in the last three months we've averaged about nine to 10 calls. Mhm. So then from there we we'll either tell them do you need a deliverable service? So for example registering your trademark or business information. Those are three out of the 10 you can say. And then uh another three are ongoing legal services. Okay.
(06:15) And what other business do you have? Let's talk about that. So the other business is the software cuz you're like you know I'm not losing money so I should uh I am losing money. Excuse me. So I'm going to I'm going to spread my attention even more. Yeah. Okay. So So we're like story behind that. I know. I know. I know. It's a VC story. So, if you want a horror story, I can give you that.
(06:33) We We'll get We'll get We'll get into it, I'm sure. All right. So, there's a software company. Okay. So, let's walk through that. So, the software is Instagram. Where's the same thing? Um, usually they'll say, "I don't have $250. I just want contracts." Um, okay. Okay. And we'll tell them, well, you can access, you know, all of our contract templates inside our software, so you can pay for that.
(07:00) Okay? And that's what happens. Right now, we're so via Instagram, you just send those people a not a calendar link and you don't send them to the site, you send them to to our to our software website. So, which is a different website. And then they just check out on that page. They start a free. We had a premium, now we're using free trial. Okay. Um, and what's the membership price right now? It's a,000 per year.
(07:25) And that's what So it goes straight to a,000 per year is what you were billing. Yes. We also have a monthly version. They were like, I can't afford $250. And you were like, yeah, so pay $1,000 a year. Before we have a $500 per year. Yeah. So it was easier.
(07:43) The problem is that the value proposition at first was, well, pay us and we give you the contracts. But learning that people were churning because once they have the contract they'll download it and just go away. We have a couple of decisions that we have to make. Is there any reason that you just don't sell services and make money? Sales.
(08:00) Well, the reality is we started selling services in back in 2019. So in 2021, uh people we got a lot of demand. I couldn't keep up. I started selling courses so they could you know learn about how to do them themselves. And then after that um and also contract templates and then the education side just you know we started making the same amount of money on education. This is going to be an important one for you. Yeah. All right.
(08:26) So actually you know what I'm going to show you on my logo. Two most important concepts in business supply and demand and leverage. So if supply is low and demand is high what happens to price? It it goes up. Is that what happened? Yeah we started doing that. Yes.
(08:44) But then you created this other thing that was much cheaper rather than just saying I don't have enough supply. Pay me more. You're right. All right. We wanted to help more people instead of just Yeah. But the thing is is that a long enough time horizon and you'll have no one if we don't make this business profitable. Mhm. Right. Yes.
(09:01) So okay, tell me why we can't shut down the education and software so that we can just do services and then we can fix the service business to make it make money. Yeah. So the educational side, we already have over 800 people. They all bought like lifetime everything. Lifetime everything. Lifetime everything.
(09:19) The thing with with the education is that it's part of we are giving back to the community and nobody else is doing this. All right. So every time thanks to the education efforts, we are traveling the world and teaching other people in Guatemala, in the Dominican Republic, in Spain how the music business works because in those places our content is the university's content.
(09:40) So it's it's an impact project right. Okay. So that is why the education you know it would be very difficult for us to shut down and the education without the software is not losing money. It's the software that that actually Okay. So when we did this breakdown how you said the education loses money.
(09:58) So how much money does the education make if you don't have the software? In reality the education would be a break even. Okay. That the that whole money that we're losing is zero. Yeah. But but you said this is 110,000 of losses. So that means the software costs you 150,000 a year and makes you 40. Yes. Okay. You could say that. So why can't we be done with the software? So the software right now there's not a specific reason we can't shut it down.
(10:26) We we've seen traction on the B2B side of companies in the music industry that are interested in using our software because their clients like big companies now need a music contract software to manage their documents. So the play there for us. So what the software the software but that is something that how much did it cost you to develop the software? Right now it's burning 7K a month because we cut every every you know every employee before.
(10:57) How likely is it do you think that you're going to sell the software? I'm not sure. And the other thing is the software actually right now the way we are seeing it grow is by bundling services with software. Well it's obvious that the service is the thing that everyone needs. Yes. Yes. And then we just have like this other stuff that we did to be cute.
(11:16) Where do you want to grow from here? What do you want to have happen? The thing that we need is to be profitable. Okay. That we can solve very easily. That's the good news. Yeah. But it will just be painful. Yeah. But it's good pain. Growing pains. Yeah. Call them growing pains. If you lose a negative, it's a positive. So, okay.
(11:36) So in a world hypothetically where you just ended the software tomorrow and then you have the education and services what is required for you to maintain the education work-wise per week. Right now it's only one live stream with the community per month or per month. Yeah, that's the only thing. That's it. Okay, great. Can we just shut down the software? We can do that.
(12:01) Wow, that was easy. Okay, great. I love this for us. Okay. So, we're gonna X this out. Let's use a red. Let's keep this, you know, keep this keep this on brand here. So, this is a red. I'm gonna say that this isn't really a business. I'm going to say this is a charity.
(12:18) You might even want to operate like a nonprofit because it doesn't make any profit anyways and you're you're very, you know, kind of impact driven and whatnot. So, then what's the cost on the 131,000 in services? The cost would be the associate who is delivering the services. Okay. Right now we have a revshare model. Okay.
(12:38) But we also have because the services for example this year we are already at 150k. Okay. Great. Because now thanks to the education um the next generation of artists are looking towards us to represent them in deal closing closing deals. Right. Okay. So from there we take a commission from the deal. Okay. So, for example, uh we've recently closed uh several deals that are above 500,000 for the artist. Amazing. And we take 5% from those. Okay.
(13:09) So, do you guys act as an agent for that? They're No, they're lawyers representative. Those are legal fees that the label uh will also pay us. Interesting. That's the the music industry is a comm is heavily commission based. So, they get an advance. Yeah. And the label will the services strike again in making money. Yeah. Wonderful.
(13:33) So, what I want to do is reimagine the business in the simplest format possible that's organized to make you money both short and long term. Uhhuh. Is that okay? Yes. All right. So, I'm going to draw it across the top here and we're going to draw it in green because this is the money path. All right. It's the money path. You keep your YouTube where it is.
(13:51) Now, what I want you to do is I want you to have four different places that you're going to embed calls to action. All right? So, number one is at the 30% mark of every video, I want you to make a quick 30-se secondond like, "Hey, by the way, you know, if you want us to, you know, help you out with your, you know, music business right now, um, just DM me on Instagram and I'd love to help you out. This is my handle." Mhm. Okay.
(14:08) Number two is the description. All right? And you want to make sure that it's above the fold. So, you know, below this video right now, you'll probably see two links. One is for people who are trying to start business, which they go to school. And if you already have a business and you're trying to scale and you have like, you know, a million bucks a year or more or, you know, 500,000 a year or more or 10 million a year or more, uh, you can go to acquisition.com and, you know, schedule call their team and see if we can help you out, right? So, we have a description. Now, on top
(14:32) of that, pinned comment, so you can own that real estate. We also have your profile on YouTube, which gets traffic as well. And so, those are four places that we can actually just put and all of the CTAs here are DM me on Instagram. Why are we doing that? Because it already works. So, I'm not trying to break it. All right. So, now everything's going to Instagram.
(14:51) So, instead of having the site, we don't even care about the site. Who cares? Doesn't matter. So, we're going to go DM me on Instagram. And then from there, what I want you to do is that I want you to have them book a call without paying. And then what we're going to do is we're going to sell them. And what we're going to do is we're going to sell them a package. And we're going to sell it to the outcome.
(15:10) And you're going to say, "Hey, a lot of lawyers lawyers like to charge by the hour. The reason that we don't do that model is because it disincentivizes us. Our basically our incentives are adverse to you. When we do it by the hour, we're incentivized to take as long as humanly possible. So it means it cost you more and it takes longer. That sucks.
(15:28) So what we're going to do is we're just going to charge you for the outcome. Period. That's it. How's that sound? Yeah. So we have to qualify them before they can go to the landing page because you know there's 10 million artists on Spotify. Sure. And only a thousand are professional. Maybe 2,000 are professional. So, do you see that the landing page? Yeah.
(15:48) But they all eat, they all have cars, they all have cell phones, they all pay mortgages and rent. We're not We don't You sell to a lot of upandcomers and newcomers. They're going to use just like you have been spending your education money that you make money on this dream that you have and losing money. We're going to have them do the same thing.
(16:07) They're going to take their job money and spend it on their dream and hopefully they make it. But our goal isn't to try and figure out who's going to make it. Our job is to enable the opportunity. So the pre-qualification that I would have here is just income, not like and if you want, you can add their Spotify if you think that matters, you know, in the qualification, but fundamentally. Yeah. Okay. That's what I figured.
(16:31) So yeah, because if you I I've worked with different artists that their Spotify, for example, I have a Spotify. I'm a guitar player and I have 15,000 monthly listeners. But you wouldn't take that to determine whether I can play you or not. So income, but we are currently doing it that way. Yeah, you're right.
(16:51) Yeah, you're right. So what we're going to do is income, but we're going to do through budget, authority, need timing. That's the the big four, right? So do you have the money? Is there somebody else who needs to be on the phone? Your grandmother, your dog, your your agent, whatever need. So how important is this to you? Uh and then timing.
(17:07) If we were to get you set up, how quickly would you want us to to make this get this trademark or get this thing filed? Right? You want to take the people who have the money and want to do it now and are able to make the decision. That's the qualification. Now, the big the big question is what are we gonna charge? So, you're asking me? Yeah. I'm going to give you a hint. It's more than 250. So, hopefully the price is right with what you're going to charge.
(17:24) So, the average uh ticket on the service size between the ongoing one time and the consultation is about 1,500. That's the average. Okay. And a lot of that is from people just getting hourly charged. It's no it's basically the the ongoing right now is about the the lower ticket is about a,000 per month. Okay.
(17:50) Where because we are not uh charging them by the hour like a traditional lawyer. So and this is 750 usually. So you can see that if you combine the other Yeah. They usually get to So this is what I want you to do. I would love you to charge 5,000. I feel like that's going to be a stretch for you emotionally. So, how about we start at three? Yeah. Can you do five? We can do five. Can you emotionally do five? Yeah.
(18:13) We're We're selling right now three months for 4,000. So, great. So, well then shoot. Then we might as well do six. Six is the same as five. Well, you know what? I'll meet you in the middle. 5,800. Okay. All right. This is what we're going to sell.
(18:29) That's your retainer, right? So, either we can sell So, okay, this is a question for you. I do I would prefer to sell the outcome if it's just a clear outcome that they're they're going for. Um or you can sell a retainer, right? And just say like it's 5,800, I'll draw from that whatever. I prefer outcome personally because I don't want you to be tied to hourly if you can if you can afford not to.
(18:48) You good with that? Yeah, we we can move towards the outcome if it's the type of deal that we want to work with. Like for example, when I say outcome, I mean like the contracts or the that kind of thing. Like when it's the commissionbased stuff, I want the 5,800 plus plus the percentage. That's how we're doing it right now. Good. We just need to raise the prices. Okay.
(19:06) And we also need to organize the business so that we're optimizing for this outcome, not three different outcomes and confusing everybody, right? Okay. Now, if on the sales call someone is unqualified, so this depends on your deal flow, but I'm assuming that you've got time to take calls. Yeah, because I'm my time is spread around trying to understand this. I'm going to help you, man. All right.
(19:22) We're this this will work. When you have these people that are coming the call, what I want to add is before we have the sell the outcome. So, this is kind of like on the call right here beforehand. We're going to add a VSSL. Okay. So, you're familiar with a VSSL video sales letter. Do you have one right now? Um, for the course? Yes. Okay.
(19:41) So, instead, I just need you to make one seven minutes, you know, five to seven minutes. Doesn't need to be long. Just explaining how you do things in your process. Okay. And the other people that you've worked with, some of the successful outcomes, reviews, things like that. And then also, I would set expectations, which is like on this call, we're going to have one of two outcomes.
(19:59) um either you want more personalized attention and we'll you know give you the outcome that you want or if you're like just starting out um we do have an education thing that if you can't afford our actual services you can do it on your own so yeah now the thing is is that you know what I don't even know if I like that I'm I'm I'm deleting I'm deleting that okay so the VSSL is going to sell the services that's it when you get on the call if the person lied about their income or lied about their qualifications which does happen then you can immediately triage them and say, "So, Triage doesn't like you split." Um, and say, "You know
(20:29) what? Um, you can tell like this isn't going to be a services sale for $6,000 plus a percentage. Instead, it's going to be, you know, a one-time uh education uh product sale, and then you can sell that." Now, right now, you have this 500, then 500.
(20:47) I'm going to wager that you don't need like if you're getting people to buy this in a on a checkout page, typically you can triple the price with a phone call of the same thing. Okay? So you could probably sell for three grand. So if we're charging six here, I would say probably somewhere in the neighborhood of like 2 to 3K is the right price point for the education downell.
(21:10) But the only purpose of that is just so that you can maximize your time um on the call so that you can still kind of have something and if you need to do a payment plan or whatever, you know what I mean? Like that's that's at that point you're just trying to liquidate your time. But fundamentally, if we were to do this, let's walk through what it actually looks like. Now you have your YouTube videos.
(21:23) Now, all of the calls to action, the way I see my YouTube is I have, you know, 2,000 video, whatever how many videos I have, and each of them are basically like little mini ads that are always running and underneath of the video or the quality ad, I have my actual call to action, and I can I have this surface area across the whole internet that I can change and redirect all of that traffic from all of my videos to wherever I want.
(21:47) Then you can go back and on your biggest videos, go get pinned comments that you know um that have the same call to action because some people just read the comments. Change your profile and then going forward in your videos, you'll put the the the CTA towards to DMing on Instagram. We're going to completely ignore the site since that's where all of your all of your sales are happening on DM.
(22:05) So, let's just push everyone to DM. Now, how many followers um per month are you getting? I'm getting about 800 new followers. Guess what we're going to do? Okay, so this is thing one. thing too is that for every new follower you get, I want you to DM them and say, "Are you here for free content or entertainment, whatever, entertainment or you want help?" And then every person who says they want help is a lead.
(22:35) So right now, if you think about that, you got 800 new leads a month that you can work. Realistically, you close 5% of those. I mean, it's 40 more sales a month. At 6K, there's 240. Mhm. That's just from that. Not including your existing volume, which we're now going to redirect everything to the most efficient monetization model. What stops you from doing this? Nothing. Well, [ __ ] I think this will make you a lot.
(23:00) And I think this will save your business. And I think this will also make you very rich. So, we can help more people. Yeah. Because you can't help people if you're broke. The thing is is that the education I think long term long long term, you might end up just giving it away for free. Mhm. because people are coming from that group as well, I'm assuming.
(23:18) And then they buy your services. And that's why I'm not trying to attack this because this is long-term lead nurture for you. Yeah. So, where is this hosted? Kajjabi. Kajjabi. Well, there's your first mistake. Um, I knew it. No, but if you if you were to do it on school, um, there's a couple benefits.
(23:36) The the biggest one is that we have more active users than any other group platform um, and community platform. So like you'll probably just get people coming into your community anyways. Mhm. But you can also every single person who gets into the group, you can offer a free onboarding call as a part as a benefit of being in the community and then you can use those as setting calls to either triage them to services or just refer them to free stuff, right? Like instead of coming from YouTube, they would come from the school and then think about it like this. This is actually be a really
(24:06) good visual. So your old way, let's do this in red because Michael loves colors. Love colors too, Michael. So old way was this. You had one source of eyeballs, right? And you were splitting it between three different places.
(24:27) The new way is you now have three different sources of eyeballs and you're forcing all of them through the most efficient monetization vehicle because you've got your YouTube, you've got your Instagram, and then you've got your group. And all three of those are pushing to the one thing that we know makes you the most money that also people want and we're pricing it in a way that actually makes you money.
(24:48) And the question the question would be so we would create uh from the in from the DM or the WhatsApp we would create a calendar link they go there they'll uh get the the initial consultation for free is going to be let's be clear it's not it's not a consultation it's a sales call. Yeah it's a sales call. Then from there the once they schedule the consult the the call they go to a VSSL to prepare them. Yes. Yeah. Before the call.
(25:12) Before the call. Yeah. To prepare them and their expectations and everything. Then on the sales call we'll identify uh whether we can sell them our services or if not downell them to our course. Exactly. Right. So our core offer is our the results, right? The outcome. That's our core offer. Yeah.
(25:33) And that outcome is based on your specific need and our ability to fulfill that. But we're not saying when people are coming to us because we're lawyers in this specific niche. We don't have to talk about specific outcomes. Uh no, not like you getting signed with a record label. No, no. We're going to do the work to prepare you for that.
(25:51) You're still going to have to do that on your own. And then when that deal comes, we ask for 5%. And the reason we do that is because it makes it affordable for you at 5,800. If we didn't charge the percentage and if you're like, "Oh, I don't want to pay that percentage." Then you can pay us 25,000.
(26:06) So, we'll do 25,000 without the percentage or we'll do 5,800 with the percentage. Got it. Got it. And then, uh, do you think that that also gives you a very nice price anchor? Yeah, it makes it makes sense because, uh, the the percentage right now, the last two deals, the average has been like 40 something K. Okay. And the the lead magnet would be the sales call. Yeah.
(26:26) I I want to just do this as the easiest like what is the easiest thing that I can do to immediately fix this business and make it profitable. Okay, if we wanted to add something else, we could, but I just don't want to right now. Okay, we're going from spraying the traffic all over the place into places that lose money to pointing three different places to the one place that makes money and doing more of what already works.
(26:49) And we're just going to add a little bit of qualification, add a little VSSL, fix the pricing, and then we're also going to route all the new followers that come there, too. So, you're going to have a you will likely have a lot of opportunities. So, you'll likely be taking five, you know, 8 10 12 sales calls a day. Okay. And which is a good thing. It's No, it's great.
(27:08) And I have three people that can actually do that with me. So, if everyone has their own calendar link as you explain in your book, then Mhm. Okay. I have a book. I'm the bestselling author in Spanish in this niche. Okay.
(27:26) How do you where do you see that fitting in? Maybe that's a lead magnet like giving it out for free like you do because they usually become super fans like Yeah, of course. Yeah. Um or is that just another So there's a couple So there's I would say like right off the top of my head there's two places that we could like if you wanted to use it now I would say that you could give it to people who are unqualified.
(27:46) If you don't think you could like if you look at somebody's profile and you don't think they're they look like I mean you can probably tell if somebody's not qualified. Um, you could say, "Hey, um, it doesn't look like you're ready for our level of services, but because I want to, you know, invest in the relationship longterm, here's a copy of my book." I think that would be a very elegant way to not overly complexify what already will work.
(28:04) Long term, we could start using it as a um, a way that we would drive traffic in the future. And then you could have a call team call the people who bought the book and then see if they're, you know, they want more help and then you could basically bring it would just we all we would do is we add as another circle. But right now you have three more than sufficient traffic sources that you were just wildly undermonetizing and we just need to fix that. Okay.
(28:28) And the last question would be um on the software side. Yeah. Because the product road map is almost finished entirely with all of the features that the companies are looking for. Yeah. If I'm not investing any energies on that, I want to know. I'll believe that when I see it. Okay. Okay. So if I'm not suppose I'm not spending energy in a in a world that doesn't exist. Yes. Yeah. Suppose that in fantasy land.
(28:54) Is there a way that we can create like a sunset period where we would say okay I'm going to give the team x amount of time to roll out all of the features that these companies that are saying I want to use it. I'm going to pay for it. You know 15 $25,000 per year for the software. Is there a way to create that while we're focusing on this? So at the very beginning, you know, I said like what do you what do you want, right? And so we had to fix making this make money because you're going to run out of money. Yes. And so we have to solve that. The thing that makes me hesitate with the software is the amount of work
(29:26) and the amount of expertise it takes to make software really work is really high. Mhm. And so I would be more inclined to say like if you have some of these big companies, you might just give them the software or have them just say like you're like, "Hey, instead of 25,000 a year, if you just pay me 100 grand or pay me 200 grand, I'll just give you the whole thing.
(29:44) " And that's basically you getting it at cost and saving two years and then you can focus on this. Got it. That's of course if you want to make money. Of course. No, no, no. I understand. I just want to have like the different scenarios. Yeah. I mean, the alternative scenario is that you burn the education, you burn the services to the ground, you go all in on the software, and you need to be able to fund that loss for a while and then actually build it, right? No.
(30:08) If that doesn't seem like it's a that's too more fantasy than reality, then you learned a ton of lessons, which is fine. Everybody just gets better from learning and you build a really good business, which I think you have all the makings. You literally have everything in place. They were just organized wrong. That's the good news is like I don't we don't have to build anything.
(30:27) We just have to take what we already had, redirect it through a better monetization vehicle and that's it. And so you like this is the first step. We add traffic here as the second step and then we'll add the book as the third step later. But for now, you just need to step one and step two. We have enough leads to probably fill up your calendar plus one other person, maybe two.
(30:46) And if you have three people selling full-time and you have a $6,000 thing, you could be at $18,000 a day, $30,000 a day, $50,000 a day. And the next problem that's going to hit you is that you're not going to have the team to actually deliver on this stuff, which we'll cross later. But that's what this is going to do. This is going to break the business, but you'll be making money.
(31:03) And then we'll take that money that we're making, and then we'll solve the thing that's broken, which is that we're going to hire more augalos. So we're getting Spanish for lawyer. Yeah. You're doing it right. So I'm giving you a little Puerto Rican Spanish there. So our constraint right now on your framework on the scaling workshop Yeah. is demand. Is demand.
(31:25) Yeah, because we're not only uh starting and stopping, but also we're not directing them through the proper channels and you were mispriced. So you So I have uh my little my little moniker for the six big mistakes that small business owners make. So let's make those in red. And I think you were making almost all of them, which is great. The good thing is it's only up from here. Yeah.
(31:43) So you were selling to too many different avatars. So that's number one. Focus, which is that you had more than one business. So you were you were hitting that one. You're hitting this one. Um you you weren't so overexpansion. Uh which I will not say that you were wrong. So we put it under focus. I'll give you a neutral on that one. Put it there to be aware. Uh-huh. Then we have compensation.
(32:06) So it's are you overpaying your people, which right now I don't get that impression. Underpriced, which you were, or mispriced. So you had that one. And then this one is single product. So, that's when somebody has a front end and a back end, which I'll say that you had kind of like a half issue.
(32:24) We had the the $250, you know, per hour uh service fee, but we didn't have the kind of percentage win rate yet, and it wasn't part of a standard offer. So, I'll say that you had like a half a little X, a little mini X, okay, there. But the good news is that these are the mistakes that most small business owners make and it's normal and it's okay and that's why we're fixing it.
(32:43) And the next phase to to have a timeline or at least to be aware of our next phase would be do this until we get to a million per month. Is that your I don't know if you'll get to a million a month from this. You will certainly make a lot more than you are now. And the next thing that's going to break is you're going to run out of lawyers. So the next issue you're going to run into is supply constraint.
(33:01) I actually think you have probably more demand. Like you will not be able to sell through the demand that you already have without expanding supply. But if we completely utilize your existing supply of, you know, work that you could do at the appropriate price, you could absolutely make this into a multi-million dollar per year business. Yeah.
(33:20) It's just becoming a a law firm, you know, a bigger law firm. Yeah. And a specialized law firm, which is good. So, you have that niche down. You have a very specific niche. And there's nice thing is that there's a lot of people who want this service. And the price point that we're charging is an appropriate price for somebody who's, you know, wanting to make a bet on themselves in their career. You have to make an investment just like you do. They have to make an investment, too. Yeah.
(33:40) And that number is that um the $5,000 is that for any type of outcome? No. I mean, you'll know this better than I do, but I just want to make sure that you know uh the average ticket. Mhm. I want to I want to make sure that I'm running at at least 80% gross margins for service minimum. So, your actual cost, so your actual cost on this should be, let's see, should it should be less than call it like 1,200 bucks or I'll say 1,100.
(34:10) So, if you're less than $1,100 in terms of total cost uh for this to deliver that to deliver that, then you can then you charge 5,800. And so, I'm guessing your man hours are going to cost you less. I mean, I don't know what you pay your your lawyers, but let's say it's $100 an hour. If it's less than 11 hours to do it, then you're good to go. And if they do it in five, amazing. Okay.
(34:29) So, if I've had the cost, for example, a lawyer cost me x amount per month, now I know that I need to be making five times more. Five times more minimum. Okay. And that may sound crazy to anybody who's listening to this who doesn't have a business, but let me let me show you a visual. So good. So good. This is great.
(34:46) People say that, but let's imagine we have $100 of revenue to keep this simple. If you have a 20% gross uh sorry, uh 20% cost, but 80% gross margin business, then it's like, cool. So we already have $20 gone. So we have $80 left. But we're still going to have marketing that we got to spend. Mhm.
(35:04) We're going to still have admin costs, uh, you know, uh, people who are scheduling and all that stuff. We have sales, um, that we're going to have to pay on top of that. And that's going to be the majority for this business because the the labor is going to be here, right, in terms of your cost of goods. And so maybe all of these things cost, you know, 60%. Right? So then we still have a 20% margin in the business.
(35:22) But that sounds greedy when you're like, "Oh my god, there's 80." It's like, yeah, but we got to do all the other costs out of 80 and then whatever's left is our profit. Now hopefully you can run this thing at 30, right? And then you have a 50% margin here which would be wonderful and we smile. Got it.
(35:40) So all in all we went from sad face to smiley face. Did it great. I was aware that services was the the play when we focus on services this year and we're already making way more money. But that was you already 4x the business just by focusing on that one thing. And that's with still having the distraction.
(36:01) Like you absolutely can be at multiple millions a year. Like no question. Given the fact that you have a 90,000 YouTube following, you have a 23,000 person Instagram following. You have a community of people who love you and are raving fans. You have all of the foundation. So the good news is that all the work that you spent doing over the last however many years was not wasted. You just didn't monetize it well.
(36:19) And the good news is you can do it now. So no big deal. What's the role of for example now that we're getting invitations to go and speak to other countries? What do you think about that from the focus side? Is that something for distribution? Like because if no other lawyers are doing that, no other lawyers are publishing their books, is that something that we can use to differentiate from other particularly in service- based businesses? It's a good question. It's a tough call and the reason for that is that it's a it's for sure a long-term investment uh to speak
(36:50) on stages and things like that. The thing is is that you're currently not demand constrained. So you speaking on stages will just generate more demand that you can't handle. Let's play it out the other way. If you speak on stages and you take your eye off the ball in the business, you lose.
(37:09) If you focus on the business and you continue to grow the firm, the stages still be there because you'll just be bigger. So that is why maybe the counterargument would be if you want us to go to the stage, you have to pay us an amount that it's worth it. It's worth it.
(37:27) If you know you that you generate three sales a day at $6,000 when you're there and it takes you two days, then your speaking fee is said $36,000 plus travel. Exactly. You already have the number because you have it on a dayto-day basis. Yeah. And also to be fair, the opportunity cost isn't just what you what money you would have made, but also the focus and the distraction that takes away as well.
(37:44) So there's hard cost and soft cost. The hard cost is you really just won't make these six sales. The soft cost is what else would you have done in between and then not had to deal with any of this hassle. Perfect. Will you do this? Yes. All right. Deal. Done.

(00:00) And so what they think they're doing is they're like, "Well, that's what everyone else is doing, so I need to build my personal brand." You're not building anyone's [ __ ] brand. You're just reinforcing an identity that everyone already knows about and does not find you interesting cuz you're the same as everybody else.
(00:12) If you remember when you were in middle school, there was like the preps and then goth kids and then the bros or the athletes or whatever. When we're growing up, we're trying to figure out our identity. And maybe some of you weirdos actually switch tables once or twice cuz you were figuring out who you were. And what happens is we learn these identities that come with these sets of beliefs.
(00:27) You see this a little bit in the political scene. If you're a Republican, all of a sudden you have to wear flannel and trucker heads in America and shoot guns. And on the flip side, if you're a liberal, you have to just say all homeless people can do whatever they want whenever and we should let everyone across the border no matter what.
(00:41) We all should raise taxes. Basically ridiculousness on both sides. What happened to the real middle people who just like, "Hey, you can marry whoever you want. Please don't tax me too much." There's this middle and that's why people like Rogan have blown up because people are like, "He's a Republican. He's a liberal.
(00:53) " It's like, he's just Joe Rogan. Like Joe Rogan is interested in UFC. He's also interested in aliens. He's also interested in standup comedy. He's also has like this kind of fitness, carnivore, whatever thing going and biohacking. So, he has these like very different interest that he's super deep on.
(01:08) And no one would be like, "Joe, so what we're thinking is you need to increase your biohacking by 15% so we can capture this audience." No. If you want to stand out in your marketing or even a personal brand, just actually saying what you really believe, a thing that you're afraid of saying because maybe it's two or three or four beliefs that don't go with the uniform that you wear every day, actually makes you significantly more unique.
(01:27) Most people wear their clothing as a uniform to say, "I am this type of person." People will look at you and they'll assume you're a goth or prep or whatever. Here's where it gets cool. You start talking and then all of a sudden there's something over here and then there's another belief over here.
(01:41) And what happens is they start paying more attention because you don't fit the mold. It's my favorite way to differentiate any of the portfolio companies or even my own brand. This may sound crazy. Actually, just be myself. Because as soon as someone feels like they have figured you out, they'll move on cuz they're like, I can predict all of this person's behavior.
(01:55) They don't need to stay in tune or stay updated because they know everything about you already. And I'm sure you've met people like this. He wears this uniform. He says these things. He believes that he is this person. He's category 17. Boom. Don't have to think about it again. Everyone knows the starter kit for real estate. You know the haircut.
(02:09) They cut the side here, right? Buzzed on the side. Hard part, hard gel over the suit. Don't forget the glass is very important. Maybe the highle BMW midseries wax with rims. Maybe a picture of the of a watch. He's like, "Yeah, just bought this beauty." Those guys are all the same. And so what they think they're doing is they're like, "Well, that's what everyone else is doing, so I need to build my personal brand.
(02:27) " You're not building anyone's [ __ ] brand. You're just reinforcing an identity that everyone already knows about and does not find you interesting cuz you're the same as everybody else. I think that you would be better served actually doing you. And that comes with all the weirdness that you are. Cuz I've met some of you.
(02:43) Y'all are weird as [ __ ] And if you stop pretending to be this identity that you wrap into the starter kit of whatever Instagram influencer you're trying to copy and you just were you, what happens is your unique individual personalities are like weirdness because everybody had different parents. Everybody was born in different cities.
(02:58) Everyone has unique things. Like your dad might have been a mechanic. You might know a bunch of [ __ ] about cars. And if you bring that up, all of a sudden people look at what they expect from the real estate starter kit. And then all of a sudden you've got these points over here and you become interesting and people lean in.
(03:09) They pay attention because you don't match the mold. I'm going to shift this to business. There was this time where there was this competitor who moved in my marketplace when I had a local gym. Guy was out spetting me and I was like, "Man, I'm going to have to do something about this." So what I did was I copied the guy's landing page.
(03:21) So I copied everything, changed the logo, whatever, but it was like probably 90% the same. Here's what's crazy. His page did worse than mine did. Why am I copying this guy? I actually just got worse outcomes from this. Fast forward gym launch days. Somebody came into the marketplace, started marketing really similar stuff.
(03:32) I subscribed to the list to see what the emails they were sending and they were my emails literally 100% word for word. Didn't even like swap anything out. They were my email. I'm like, man, I'm thinking about copying this guy by cop on his newsletter. He's just using my [ __ ] A lot of people say, "Stay in tune with your competitors.
(03:46) Consume everyone else's stuff." I actually don't feel that way. I actually turned off all my ads on my newsfeed. When I made my marketing or made my content, I just made it about whatever stuff I felt like talking about. And so people were like, "Man, your stuff's always so different and so original, whatever." And it's really easy to be original if you're just not looking at everyone else's [ __ ] the act of consuming everyone else's stuff, what ends up happening is that those thoughts become top of mind for you and you become another Mickey
(04:06) Mouse, another Instagram influencer starter kit. They've got the watch, the car, 100% hustle, 0% grind. If other people copy you, it's a good sign because it means that what you're doing is working and most people aren't original. If you copy them, what it means is that you accept the position of second place.
(04:22) You accept that they are inherently first. You literally say, "You are better than me at this." And if you claim to be the best at whatever it is that you're trying to do or at least that you're trying to be the best, you copying their identity, their look, their feel, their brand means that you are accepting to lose.
(04:35) You will never win cuz you aren't going to beat them at being them. Quick story client and our software company, Allen, who was a real estate agency. So we worked with agency owners in that business. And so this guy was continually struggling new people and they would always turn out the back, whatever. It took me six months of like just battering him over the head with this, publicly embarrassing him to finally get him to change his behavior.
(04:55) And I was like, "You're not that good." Like, "It's not some marketing hack. It's not some sales hack." I was like, "You're just not that good." I was like, "You sell to realtors?" He was like, "Yeah." I was like, "Have you ever been a realtor?" He was like, "No." Then you have no idea what they go through and what your marketing looks like and what your sales process looks like is the same as every other [ __ ] person trying to sell realtors.
(05:12) Promise you, put your terrible agency, go take the 12 weeks, pass the test, and actually be a realtor. Sell some [ __ ] houses using your marketing skills that you claim to sell. In the first month of him doing this, he was like, "Oh shit." He's like, "These leads aren't as good as I thought they were." I was like, "No [ __ ] That's why no one wanted to keep paying you.
(05:26) But you know what he did over the next 12 months? He got better and better and better at it. And here's the crazy thing. 12 months later, he actually still a realtor and he's making more money because he actually got good at it. But here's the thing. If he had kept trying to look like everybody else, he would have been Mickey Mouseing until he kept trying some new thing or new some new hack, but he just didn't confront the work.
(05:41) And you know what happens now is that if he actually did want to go back to the agency thing and actually did want to help realtors, he would have the context to do it and it would make him unique because so many other people are just like him pretending to be to model their Instagram page after the same thing the other influencer they're looking up to does rather than being like I wanted to figure out real estate.
(05:59) Most people don't do that. They just look what everyone else is doing, do the same thing, water it down, and they literally blend in like everyone else and they wonder why they don't win. You've heard me say replicate before you iterate, right? That comes to skills. If you want to learn how to sell, hide next to the guy who's making calls.
(06:14) You want to learn how to knock on doors, walk with the guy who's the best guy on the team who knocks doors, right? You duplicate the skill so you know you can do it. That's different than replicating a story and replicating an identity. I've seen like Hermosifi and Hermosi style content and Hermosi style edits. It's not about the captions.
(06:32) It's about the content. What they can copy is the way it looks and feels and sounds. So, what they can't copy is the story behind it. Fix the story and the brand will take care of itself. if you tell the story that's true. And so if you don't have the story to tell, then do the [ __ ] that's worth doing that no one else is willing to do.

I Blew Up A Secret Business To Prove It’s Not Luck - YouTube

Transcript:
(00:00) This fashion stylist was making 300,000 a year but leaving millions on the table. So, here's how we fix the three core issues in her business and how you can apply the same tactics to scale yours. My name's Alexi. I run acquisition.com, a portfolio of companies that last year did over $250 million in aggregate revenue.
(00:16) So, let's dive in. So, here are the quick facts you need to know. Who does she sell to? Rich folks. What does she sell them? Fashion design and advice for their personal styling. How much is she making? 309,000. Her profit last year 130,000. That's 42% margins. The number of customers she served lifetime is over a thousand. So, kind of impressive.
(00:31) And then this is her model. She sells an $8,500 60-day kind of onboarding transformation where she picks new colors and palettes and all that kind of stuff. And then she rotates them into a $2,000 per month or $4,500 per quarter ongoing style thing. Plus, she gets affiliate commission because if they buy clothing through her, she gets 10% of the purchase price.
(00:49) That's how she makes her money. Let's dive in. So, problem number one, Ashley had a leaky funnel. She has a premium offer, a good close rate, and customers who love her work. But when I looked at her funnel, it was pretty much non-existent. She was sending paid cold traffic to a form with no headline, value proposition, or reason to opt in.
(01:05) There was just a get more info button. So, here's the wild part. Despite all that, she was still getting customers, which told me the quality of her service was probably pretty strong. And so, the bottleneck was her conversion rate. Basically, the number of clicks that actually turned into customers. And so, the numbers actually backed up that hypothesis.
(01:19) She was getting about 1,800 clicks and turning those 1,800 clicks only into eight sales. a huge leak in her process. 4% conversion to traffic with high intent. Advertisements fall into two categories. You have interruption based and then you have intent based. Interruption based is everything that you see that you're not looking for.
(01:37) So if you're on social media and you see an ad, you didn't start that day being like, you know what, I want to have an ad for a new pillow. No, you just see the ad that's interruption based. So television, radio, social media, online banner ads, all of that stuff is just interruption. Intent is where you initiate it.
(01:54) So you start to look for it. That's usually when you search for things. You might call up friends and get referrals. Like those are high intent customers or at least high intent prospects. And you want to have very different metrics that you track separately for each of those things. And one of the biggest mistakes that I think business owners make is number one, they'll blend that and try and understand their business, which you have to keep that separate because it's two different people who need two different processes and sometimes two
(02:13) different products. Sometimes people don't know if their stuff's good. They're like, "Oh man, I think I'm doing terribly." But they're comparing their cold traffic metrics to their warm or high intent traffic metrics and vice versa. The good news is we didn't really need to change what she was selling because she was converting a high percentage and she has decent price points.
(02:28) So, I'm not upset about that part. We just had to make it easier for people to buy. So, this is what we did. So, we made four core changes. Step one is we added a lead magnet. And think through all the different versions of what could we give away for free to get people to more interested. Because if you just say, "Hey, get more info.
(02:40) " Number one, not very compelling. Number two, that goes from like zero to let's sleep together. And so, sure, she had a high close rate, but she was also dealing with the people who were like in desperate need. But there's so many other buyers, the 80% or more of buyers who like just give me a little bit first before I take the next step.
(02:55) That's where the lead magic comes in. And I think this is a huge misunderstanding for a lot of businesses because like people think, I'm going to give something away for free. I'm going to solve their problem. It doesn't work like that at all. If you do it right, what you do is you solve a very narrow problem that then reveals the next problem that you solve with the thing you sell.
(03:08) If I were to say, "Hey, come buy my thing." I might get one out of 100 people to buy. But if I say, "Hey, you have this problem. Here's a free thing." And I might get 10 people to try my free thing. But then of those 10 people, I can get three of them to buy. So, I triple my sales by adding some sort of value prior to making my real money ask.
(03:23) And if you think what is content, content is in some ways hundreds and thousands of tiny little lead magnets that you get for free without someone even having to opt in. So that you can basically give a pre-lead magnet to the lead magnet. And so we can lubricate this entire process top to bottom. So what we did is we created a style assessment offer.
(03:39) Basically a personalized consult based on skin tone, body type, and lifestyle. and somebody who's rich and feels like their status doesn't match the way they dress and cares about that. Obviously, I care about that because my style is impeccable. The thing that makes a great lead mag because I don't want you to take like should I use a style assessment? No.
(03:54) Let me tell you that the pieces that make a great lead magnet. Fast, easy, narrow, solves one complete problem. So, I'll tell you my favorite lead magnet of all time. I just remembered this the other day. So, I'll tell you. So, I saw this in the dating space. I said, "How to know if a girl wants you to kiss her on a date." That's a huge need for a guy if he's on a date, but he doesn't want to be seem like a weirdo, right? So, there's huge pain that he's avoiding and great promise of if she does like you, you get a kiss.
(04:18) So, like literally such great polar uh stakes for learning this one thing. So, what they reveal and the lead magnet is I'll give you the answer is you try and brush her hair behind her ear. If you do that and then she rolls her hand into or doesn't at least move her head away from your hand, then you've got a girl who's okay with you kissing her.
(04:34) On the flip side, if you reach for her hair and she just moves her head back, she probably doesn't want you to kiss her. Now, I would also encourage you to not surprise attack, uh, because most people would just move away anyways. Always get consent, guys. Let's talk about why it works. So, instant perceived value, especially for high-end clients who don't want a DIY checklist, right? These are high-end concierge.
(04:52) They want a taste of that concierge experience. So, the best thing we can do is let them try it out a little bit. Let them ride the bike. Let me tell you the action steps for you so you can actually do this in your own business. So, this is from the $100 million leads page 45. If you're struggling to get leads, make an amazing lead magnet.
(05:05) Figure out the problem that you want to solve for the right customer. Figure out how you want to solve it. Figure out how to deliver it. Make the name interesting and clear. Make it easy to consume. Make sure it's actually good. And this one, like I still don't get this. Like they're like they put their trash as their lead magnet.
(05:21) I'm like 99% of people are never going to buy anything from you. You want the marketplace to judge you on your worst thing. I have now on average spent two years per book that I've written, which is basically the lead magnet for my business. It's important. you don't need to give your lead magnet to everyone. And this is something that Ashley brought up when we were talking about this.
(05:35) She's like, I don't want to give every Tom, Dick, and Harry free personalized style assessment. And I was like, you're right. You don't want to do that. So, when we're going to give someone this lead magnet, which doesn't have to be automated, so people have this assumption like, oh, it has to be an ebook. It has to be a free video.
(05:47) It has to be a book. It doesn't even have to be a book. You can have a service as a lead magnet. All you do though is it's not for everyone. So, in order to qualify for this free thing, like I there's no rules. We can say who gets this free thing, who doesn't get this free thing. it's America or wherever you live like you're allowed to choose to do business with one person or another say if you meet these qualifications then I will give you this free thing because you're a high likely candidate why would I give you a ride in my free jet if I
(06:10) want you to buy a private jet if you can't afford a private jet there's no point there's no way you can convert so it's just pure cost for me not a good idea and so the big four I always look for budget authority need timing do they have the money do they have the authority to make the decision do they actually want this thing and is now a good time if I can get those four answers prior and they say yes to all four now I've got a good qualified prospect The first thing we did to fix the funnel is we gave something more
(06:31) valuable for someone to take a step with rather than get more in. So the second thing we did was we installed a VSSL. So what is a VSSL? A VSSL is a video sales letter which is just a fancy way of saying you you film yourself doing your kind of your best pitch. VSSLs can vary in length depending on the nature of the traffic, the price point of the thing that they're selling and the sales process that follows.
(06:51) So the three Ps for us in terms of making an acquisition process is going to be product, prospect, process. What are we selling? Who are we selling it to? how we going to sell it for her thing. She's going to be preframing this style assessment to then upsell on that call into her main thing.
(07:06) I didn't expect, especially given the nature of the traffic that she had, which was high intent, that she would really need more than call it like a 3 to seven minute video before the call explaining the offer, setting expectations, and this filters out bad leads and pre-sales good ones. The reason pre-selling is important, especially as you scale, is that you want to always shorten sales cycles.
(07:23) For example, it takes you two calls to close prospects on average. If you can take that from two calls to one call, you can double your sales with the same size team. So, it makes you more efficient per salesperson that you hire. And some of you guys have three and four call sales processes that absolutely can get cut from four to two or sometimes even one if you add in these pre-selling components because functionally, this is the belief that I would encourage you to adopt.
(07:50) It only takes a moment to make a decision. What takes prior to that decision is the information required to make the decision. When you have four calls or six calls or three calls in order to make a decision, it's because it takes that much information or you're inefficiently delivering that much information. And so we have to think what are the core elements of all three or four or five or six calls, whatever it is that it takes you currently to close a prospect.
(08:10) And when I say calls, this could be conversations, it could be emails, whatever it is that you communicate with people on. How can we take the most salient elements, bring them all to the front, and have everyone watch it so that when you start your sales conversation, you start with somebody who already knows all the main things, and we're really just talking about decision to make a purchase.
(08:26) And so, not only can we eliminate or decrease the number of calls from call it 3 to one call, but we can also take our calls from call it 60 or 90 minute calls to 15 to 20 minute calls. Again, further increasing your efficiency with your sales team. And this is ultimately one of the most high leveraged things that you can do in building a sales process.
(08:43) Don't worry, I'm not going to leave you hanging. How do you make a VSSL? I'll just give you the quick and dirty. There's obviously more to this, but I'll just give you the things that can get you started. And I will give you this one caveat, which is don't obsess. I would spend so long on the lead magnet that I wouldn't even get it out.
(08:56) Or I'd spend so long on my VSSL that I wouldn't even do it. You want to make it good, but you want to make it. And it being made is it being posted, it being live. Now, here's the cool part. You can always make it better. You can always make it better. You can always revisit it.
(09:09) There's no VSSL that I think that is active in any company that I own right now. I'm just thinking outside top of my head. Don't want to make a a major claim here, but I'm pretty sure that is the first version. We make it, we listen to the objections that come up on sales calls, and then we add those objections in, and then we listen to more, and we add more of those in, and it's really simple.
(09:25) All you do is you record it, and then you just add a cut in afterwards that says, "Hey guys, I got a couple more questions from people, so I figured I'd answer them for you." Now, here are the four steps. Number one, review your most common objections in your sales recordings if you if you're recording your sales.
(09:34) If you're not, you probably still know what they are. Number two, record you answering those questions as a video. Keep it light. It depends on how in-depth your thing is, how many requirements on their part. So again, for her, high intent traffic, 3 to 7 minutes works fine. And then make sure it gets sent to every single prospect in the funnel.
(09:51) Here's the little pro tip for you. You want to make sure that they watch the VSSL. So how do you make sure they watch the VSSL? So the way I like to ask it is, hey, we want it embedded automatically. Now, in that process, we'll still follow up prior to the call and say, hey, did he get a chance to watch the video? If you're doing a set call that leads into this, so a tiny bit different, but let's say you called outbound, you can still add a VSSL in, you call the person, you set the call, and then you say, "Hey, I'm going to give you a video. Would you rather watch
(10:14) it on your own on your own time or with us?" Now, most people say, "On my own time." And so then you just give it to them to watch before the call. By giving them that choice, it makes it much like softer. I don't know, just it feels better. What happens if you get on a call and somebody didn't watch the video? Didn't watch the video sales letter.
(10:30) It is my belief that you want to maintain the frame. And this is why I prefer shorter VSSLs if whenever possible because then I can say, "Hey, you know what, John? We got an hour. So, let me give you the video right now. You can watch it. I'm going go grab a cup of coffee. I'll be back in 7 minutes and then we can talk about it.
(10:42) That way, you don't need to change your scripting because then you have multiple variations of prospects that are coming to you. Some have watched it, some haven't. No, you want to unify and uniform the process as much as possible." So, we added a lead magnet to fix the funnel. We added a VSSL. The third thing we did was we qualified harder.
(10:57) There are some things that in my entrepreneur career have continued to be more true over time. They like age like wine. One of them is speed over everything across everything in the business. The more I'm in business, the more I think about speed for qualifying prospects, the more I think about it for products, the more I think about it for results.
(11:12) I always want to shorten timelines. Another thing like that is qualifications. We always have this big fear that if we qualify prospects, we're going to lose leads. But the thing is is that if you don't qualify prospects, you're going to waste your time. And what happens is if you qualify well, you actually turn people who are maybe into yeses because they're like, "Whoa, these guys are legit and they serve people only like me.
(11:33) " And so qualification in a way is almost like positioning yourself within a niche, but the niche is qualified customers, right? And so I said this earlier, but Bant is the IBM invented this. This is not me. Budget authority need timing. And we include that in the intake form plus a question about income. And so for her, she didn't have a sales team and she knew she needed they need to have money.
(11:49) And so she asked that question ahead of time because if they didn't have the money to buy the clothes, they weren't going to buy your services. She could spot those serious buyers before they even had the conversation. So she could automatically cancel and say, "Hey, you don't qualify.
(11:59) " And then she doesn't have to create a personalized style assessment before talking to them. So it saves her time. Step four, she had this funnel. What we needed to do was rewrite the headlines. Now, if there's ever something to test on your funnel, it's the headlines. 80% of your advertising dollar goes to the first words that someone sees.
(12:15) It literally frames the rest of the page. That's why headlines are so important. It's not just that it's compelling or interesting. It literally shifts how every other piece of information is consumed. It's the lens through which they consume your copy. We rewrote the landing page headline and sub headline to focus on the freebie.
(12:28) Rather than trying to say, "Hey, come home with me. Hey, come marry me." We say, "Hey, why don't we just get coffee? Why don't we just have a date? Why don't we just meet each other first?" What we renamed it was free lookbook to dress for your tone or skin tone using your existing closet. If you're like, "How do I make a good headline?" It's how to yay without boost insecurity.
(12:47) The yay here is the dress for your tone. Also, the free lookbook. The using your existing closet is going to be the thing that they're worried about. What's my biggest objection that someone's going to bring up? They're going to be like, "Well, I don't want to buy a whole bunch of stuff." So, it's like we want to lower the bar for now to get them on the phone.
(12:59) Free lookbook to dress for your tone using your existing closet. Now, there's no true boo on this one, but I would say that using your existing closet is a combination of biggest insecurity and the boo. One phrase that kind of combines both. And that would get us way more people to opt in and then ultimately book calls.
(13:13) And so the first thing we did was fix the funnel. And so she was converting barely eight of her 1,800 blind clicks before. Now with this new setup, complete with a lead magnet, a sales video, a real qualification process, and a better headline, she should hopefully convert a lot more.
(13:28) And so the reason we did all this first is so we could be confident our bucket wasn't leaking before we crank the dial on customer acquisition so she doesn't waste money spending on ads that aren't going to convert. Ashley is a textbook stage four in the $und00 million scaling roadmap. So, she needs to identify and double down on her top 20% of customers and she needs to make better free stuff to increase her conversion rate and she needs to add qualifications or friction so the extra volume self- selects.
(13:54) So, let's just have a look at our handydandy uh road map here and see if that's actually what we tell people to do because you know what businesses behave in patterns. They're very similar across industry, across size uh because we hit these stages these are typically the problems that occur. So specialized product price to serve niche down avatar which we had fixed make better free stuff and more creative to boost volume great add qualification to friction so the extra volume self- selects like every single one of these and also track her KPI so
(14:21) we can start managing this so she had this data because we asked for it for the episode that we did but she didn't have it before that and when you do look at the data here's the crazy thing with data is that when you do look at it a lot of things become obvious eight out of 1800 feels low you better believe it feels low what do we need to do to fix it and so if you want to figure out where you are at exactly on the scale ing roadmap, you go to a.com/roadmap.
(14:42) And if you want us to take a look at your business, like we did with Ashley's on the thank you page, book a call. Every month, we hold a workshop here at our headquarters and it's the easiest way that we can make a huge impact on someone's business is actually meeting you face to face and just working through this stuff.
(14:56) Next up is her biggest untapped gold mine. So, this was awesome. I was so happy when I found this when we were doing the diligence. Uh, you're going to love it. So, the second problem is that she had a massive missed opportunity. And I remember when I saw this, I was like, this is the Mondo move.
(15:08) If we did nothing else, this would be the big thing. And so when I asked Ashley where her best customers came from, she said, "Probably the matchmakers and social clubs I partnered with." Cuz I was like, "Wait, six partners send you a third of your entire business." And she nodded. And I asked how she found them. She said, "Just Googled them and sent them some emails.
(15:23) " And that's when I knew we'd hit a big gold mine. Those six partners found through basic Google search and a few emails accounted for one-third of her total revenue. And so then I was like, "Okay, how many emails did it take you to get those six?" And she said, "40." Think about this for a moment. If you could send 40 emails and get a third of your business from it, which before you had sent those emails would be a 50% increase, wouldn't you send more emails? And to put context on this, relative to her revenue, that's $2500 per email
(15:50) sent. Those metrics are absurd. Most founders would kill for a paid ad channel or paid acquisition channel with those numbers. And here she was barely using it. Again, a huge missed opportunity. And this is the kind of leverage that gets me excited. And the thing is is that almost every business has multiple of these.
(16:05) They're just hidden in plain sight. And the issue is sometimes it takes someone from the outside to to see this. There's a Yiddish saying that I like a lot, which is your mouth is an inch below your nose, but sometimes you need someone else to tell your breath smells. We're so close to our own businesses as entrepreneurs.
(16:17) I'm not saying I'm immune to this. You have your own banner blindly. Like you're so in the weeds, it's hard to zoom all the way out and think, "Huh, man, this is a lot of work. This is a fire. But if I just did that, if I just poked over here, this will give me a huge return and make all the work that I'm doing right now irrelevant.
(16:32) " Many of you might be laughing that Ashley had such a big gold mine she was ignoring. You and me have these issues within our own businesses. And so sometimes we chase new opportunities without tapping into something that's already right in front of us with massive potential. You do something once, it works, and instead of doubling down, you chase the new thing.
(16:46) And this is super common, especially the smaller you are. This is a perfect example of more then better than new. So why do so many business owners fail to tap into their kind of like obvious gold mines? Honestly, I think it's because they're distracted. It's just there's so many things that are going on in the business.
(17:01) And typically when you're a smaller business, you're managing not only acquisition, you're managing pricing, you're managing delivery, you're managing clients, you're managing employees. There's all these things that are going on. Sometimes it's hard to think strategically and think, where do I get the biggest bang for buck? If I could only do one thing to double my business this year and it had to double the business, what would I do? Great.
(17:17) Why am I doing anything that's not that? So sometimes these questions kind of open your mind, but you have to ask them from the outside when you have a little bit of space. That was the problem. So what was the solution? This is what we did to scale her affiliates. We didn't change the play at all.
(17:30) We just ran it way harder. The first step we did was we was build the list. So if you're following along, you're like, "Oh, I could do this." Yeah, you could. Everybody can build a list. All right, so we expanded the affiliate avatar beyond just matchmakers because let's face it, there's probably not 100,000 matchmakers in one city.
(17:43) There might be 20 or 50 or 100 or 300, but there's not an unlimited amount, right? What other types of businesses would have this type of prospect in this particular moment of the buying cycle? And this is key. She identified when we had our conversation that it's like divorces or single people who are executives who have never found love or sometimes it's wives who feel like they and their husbands don't dress according to their social status or their perceived social status.
(18:07) We expanded it to private social clubs, executive coaches, high-end personal trainers, divorce attorneys. All of those are people who own a business that contain the ideal avatar for Ashley's business. Ashley could serve their clients and make them look good in the process. And the beauty of this is that she's not competitive with them, right? Like a divorce attorney there doesn't lose anything by referring their divorce client over to Ashley to look better and feel better.
(18:31) If anything, it's a benefit. That list is not exhaustive, but it was a great place for her to start. And for you, if you're looking at your business, we just have to think what other businesses sell to our customers. And everyone typically goes to my competitors aren't going to bring those people over. Yeah. But there's a ton of businesses that are adjacent.
(18:45) And this is also one of the strongest reasons of staying focused in your business. If you try to do all things for all people, you also can't partner with anyone. And so if you stay very focused on one specific avatar and selling them one very specific thing, then you can go to other people who sell something different and then you guys can work together.
(19:01) And so one of the ways that she did this is she would hold these events that then benefit all of their customers because it's all these divorces that would want to meet other divorces because they're all now recently single. And so you have this kind of meetup thing that she could sponsor and adds value to the divorce attorney and also it works as a way for her to solicit new customers. Win-win.
(19:15) First thing we did was build the list. The second thing we did was send the darn emails. So I gave her the goal of 10xing her existing volume. So she had done 40 over her lifetime. I said, "Why don't you do 400 in 30 days?" 40 emails generated six high leverage partners. Then 400 might be able to get us 60.
(19:32) If she had 60 high leverage partners, you can do the math on that. It would be a lot. And so she committed to sending the 20 out outreach messages per day. No fancy software. Literally just on her email, just sending it out. Keep it simple. The third thing we did was activate and retain because affiliates you have to treat like customers.
(19:50) And this is where people go wrong with affiliates. Like no one's going to do that work for you. You have to work it. You have to work them. You have to work the relationship. So it becomes much more like enterprise farming sale. So there's hunters and there's farmers. Uh so it's more of a relationship manager, but you basically need someone and sometimes that's you to continue to farm the relationship to keep them activated, keep them engaged, keep them retained so they keep sending you customers every single month. And so you want to think
(20:14) about them as nodes of customers, 20 people that I need to hit them up regularly so I can provide value to them, buy them dinner, host events for their customers, all these things to remind them to keep you top of mind. So why is this so powerful? Affiliates will keep selling for you. They are a recurring customer generator and they'll send you a few leads a month or sometimes hundreds of leads a month that have demonstrated they're already willing to pay for similar services.
(20:35) So they're most qualified. They're just like warm referrals passed on to you. The likelihood that you close these prospects super high intent is very high. If you're like, "Man, this sounds kind of interesting. I would love to have an army of affiliates just sending me customers." Like, she only had six. That was a third of her business.
(20:48) If she had 60, my god, it would be a lot bigger. And so, I wrote an entire chapter on this in the $100 million leads book. It starts on page 227. And I give you the list inside of the book of exactly what to do step by step to set up an affiliate army. I've grown multiple businesses where affiliates were the largest uh source of business.
(21:03) School is one of them. More recently, Allen, my software business before that, Prestige Labs, our supplement company, all of those built up affiliates. So, I feel very confident in talking to you about this. But this is the quick and dirty. So number one, find your ideal affiliates. That was that list.
(21:16) Number two, you have to make them an offer. So for her, it was like, can we can I throw events for your customers? I'm going to pay for it. That makes them look good and gives you an ability to to sell them. Number three, qualify the affiliates because you want to make sure that they're actually like good and they have your right audience.
(21:29) Number four, figure out what to pay them or compensate them in whatever way. Sometimes it's like, I'm going to do stuff for your customers that'll make you look good. Sometimes it's I'm going to bundle an element of what I sell into your core offer so you can charge more for your core services. or my thing can be an upsell that I give you 100% of the cash on or you can sell my thing and I'll give you some percentage of it.
(21:46) All of those are different ways to structure these affiliate agreements. I talk more about it inside the book. But once you figure that out, then you just got to get them advertising and keep them advertising. The getting them advertising is how do we launch this relationship? Because typically they're going to have an existing base.
(21:58) How do we promote this new partnership together so everybody wins? And then once that launch occurs, we want full integration. So how do we make sure that month after month they're sending you customers? And so most people spend $10,000 a month on ads and completely ignore affiliates that might bring way higher returns.
(22:12) And so Ashley was already doing it. She just needed to scale it. And so we first fixed Ashley's leaky funnel. Then we took advantage of the huge affiliate opportunity that she had in front of her. And now we're going to fix pricing, which is problem number three. She had some big pricing inefficiencies. Her clients were high income.
(22:26) She served CEO CEOs, socialites, frequent flyers, people who could afford outcomes, not hours. But her pricing model didn't really reflect that. and she was charging a onetime $8,500 onboarding fee and then offered either the $2,000 a month for ongoing styling or $4,500 a quarter. So solid numbers, especially for a boutique high touch service.
(22:43) But when I dug into her existing clients, most of them weren't actually paying those rates. They were grandfathered in at $1,500 a quarter or less. Worse, the website and intake process didn't clearly set those expectations. And so there was no pricing revealed until after the call. No mention of tiers, no mention of value framing.
(22:59) This is supposed to be a premium experience, but it was being delivered like a commodity. This happens a ton, by the way. Like a lot of businesses like want to be boutique, but then the sales process completely breaks the frame. If I could give you one word for what your sales process should look like. It's congruent.
(23:13) If you are high-end, your ad should look high-end. The lead magnet should look high-end. The people you're qualifying should look high-end. The price point should be high-end, and then the product and service should be high. Everything has to fit. And if it doesn't, it'll break the frame, and immediately something feels off, and it'll plummet your conversion rates.
(23:27) And so, when I asked her how many clients were actually opting into the $2,000 per month, she said only a couple. so far, which wasn't surprising altogether. And so the question is like why wasn't she getting upsells? Number one is she had recently changed this price. So that was for sure a factor.
(23:40) It's also pretty common that as a business expands, especially when you're smaller, that you don't charge enough upfront cuz you just want to get going. And that's okay. It's normal. But in time, you start looking at your margins and you're like, you know what, maybe I can expand this. Now, to be clear, she had 42% margins.
(23:54) Not bad. I mean, that's probably pretty good. There's no issues there. I never limit myself on like, oh, these are good margins, therefore I should not make more money. by all means make more. There are no rules. The thing that she was missing was two things. Number one, she didn't have a price anchor, which would dramatically affect the take rates on that back-end offer.
(24:09) And number two is she didn't have a frictionless upsell from her main offer into continuity. So, she was selling the $8,500 thing pretty okay. She just wasn't getting as many as she wanted into the continuity, which is the real value of the business. The first thing we did is we introduced a highest tier continuity option that would make the existing $2,000 a month or $4,500 per quarter seem reasonable by comparison.
(24:30) And so even if only 10% of the people took that high-end offer when that high-end offer is 10 times as expensive, it's it still effectively doubles the revenue of the business. And for everybody else, it makes the normal price, which was once the most expensive price, feel like a deal. Now, if you want a pro tip on this, if you don't really plan on selling a lot of your price anchor, what you do is you want to have it be as similar as possible to your core offer and only change one or two things that most people don't care about. Now, the richest customers will
(24:57) always just want to buy the most expensive thing, but for everyone else, they'll see, wait, there's a dramatic price difference. It's a very small feature difference. This is now a steal comparatively. So, we set the frame and then we operate within that frame. So, the second thing we did after the anchor was a back end.
(25:13) And not only did we have the backend because you already had that, we actually made it default. All right. So, how do we make it the default option? So, one of the I remember the first time I learned about this ages and ages and ages ago was in a book that talked about a one country that was able to get like 70% plus of their citizens to opt into being donors.
(25:30) And every other country was at like less than 10%. And the main thing that country did was ask people to opt out of being an organ donor rather than every other country that asked the people to opt in. And so basically customers have a customers humans have a default bias which is if they think this is the thing that most people do they will typically do that because crowd mentality herd mentality keeps you safe.
(25:53) If everyone's doing it it is already tested they're all alive. It is lower risk for me to continue to do what everyone else is doing. Not the best recipe for outsiz returns but a very good recipe and reasonable for decreasing risk. And so we want them to decrease risk by buying. So instead of repitching continuity from scratch, we just positioned it as the next natural step after onboarding.
(26:13) So you've already invested in your transformation, let's make sure it sticks. And so often times the best thing to upsell people, by the way, if you're like, "What do I upsell on my back end?" Here are my two favorite ones that you can use all the time because they only always work. It's more of that thing they just bought or more help with that thing they just bought. They work exceptionally well.
(26:29) And what you want to do with this is you want to have an assumed close here. This is how we've always done it. This is how this normally works. We had the price anchor that we reintroduced. We made the back in the default. And the third thing we did is we push price. Now you might have heard Ashley's original price is at 8,500. She's already priced so high.
(26:43) Why would she raise prices? So there's this thing in economics called a Vlinin good. Vlin good is a good where when you increase the price it actually increases the value which is especially common in luxury items. If people know, especially if people know that something costs a lot of money, they will then want it more.
(27:00) Isn't always the case, but sometimes it is. And in other cases, you can just raise the price and it just changes nothing about the conversion rate. The easiest way to make more money in any business is charge more for the exact same thing, provided around the same number of people take it. Here's a pro tip for context. The point of maximum profit is after the point of maximum conversion.
(27:18) This should seem obvious, right? You made it for a dollar, she could get more people to buy than if she didn't. Now, in her particular case, it might be so cheap at a dollar that few people would even believe it was good. So, that gets into a different issue of pricing. But within the context of in general price, supply and demand, typically as supply shrinks, the price will move, right? Given the fact you're selling to luxury people, luxury buyers don't want the cheapest option.
(27:40) They're literally trying to look better than other people. They want the best. But if you don't give them a premium path, they'll just default to the lowest tier. So, we had to make that path for work. What we did by reframing the offer and adding in the anchor and tightening the handoff from onboarding into continuity, Ashley could boost LTV on the back end and be able to slowly continue to push her prices until people weren't going to buy or until the point where she was making less money than she was at a lower price.
(28:03) But the thing is, in my experience, there's so much more room here because think about it like this if it were a curve. Most people will try and be here where they have like, let's say, maximum yeses. But the thing is is that sometimes the maximum gross profit is here. This is a bad line to illustrate the point, but your nos are going to increase and your yeses will decrease.
(28:20) But if the price here is 3x this price and you're getting half the yeses, you make more money. And so far, just key takeaways. So number one, we fixed the funnel first. She was already doing two to threex. So we had to added in the VSSL, the lead magnet, and we qualified her leads. So that was the first thing we did to improve the conversion rate on the funnel itself, all automated, which I think could give her 2 or 3x there.
(28:41) We also fixed the headline. Again, that's an estimate, not a guarantee that's going to happen for her, but that's my estimate. The second thing we did is we doubled down on the huge missed opportunity she had, which was that she had one-third of her business coming from six affiliates. And so, we got her to build the list, commit to sending 20 emails a day, and then afterwards activate and retain them by giving them high value that she could deliver to their customers that they would get credit for.
(29:00) And then third, we continue to push pricing. And in order to do that, we reestablished a price anchor. We made the backend default so we could increase LTV. and she committed to continually increasing price until her conversion rate dropped such that she made less overall money. Now the business could attract more customers, convert them better and retain them longer and price higher with higher gross profit.

(00:00) the bigger the monster the greater the hero the things that we go through work on us more than we work on them and in this video what i want to break down is the things and how we call the traumatic events that happen and how we view them can change how they affect us and how they create us and shape us as people and i was recently interviewed in a two-hour podcast with graham stefan if you don't know who i am i'm alex mozy i own acquisition.
(00:22) com we own a portfolio company that is about 85 million a year and so on this podcast probably the most shared and retweeted and cut section is a section i'm about to show you um it was where i got into it with one of the other the the interviewee or interviewer of the podcast uh talking about trauma specifically we get to some really deep stuff and i think that you get a lot of value from it if you've never watched any of our videos welcome to mozy nation lots of love and i'll see you guys in the next couple seconds would you consider yourself emotional yeah i mean
(00:48) probably so i think i have emotions got it because a lot of the times at least in my experience like and and what i've seen people that are nihilus it's easy to that's like an easy out if something bad happens if something good happens it's just like oh yeah that's fine sweep it under the rug it's not it's not it matters anyway so bad happens it's not like you actually deal with the process whatever you know event or action occurred that make you felt that emotion if we believe that we have to like why should we why should you feel that
(01:11) emotion like why should we process a traumatic event like what does that mean well i do believe that there are you know things in your brain biologically that if they are deprived of something or there's like some bad traumatic event or something like that will affect your biological dramatic versus non-traumatic i mean i feel like the definition of the word trauma would probably but what would be the line between like okay and like let's let's give an example of something terrible actually not because it's a podcast and people might hate on
(01:39) graham so let's just say something bad happens that we describe as bad in this culture in another culture that might not be bad it's trauma in this culture it's not trauma in this culture so if the circumstance is the same why was it traumatic circumstances weren't the same why not because the culture the facts were the same will we describe the facts as changed which means that we can choose to call something trauma but wouldn't isn't it doesn't it make sense that people would be built up due to a culture and environment 40 year old guy
(02:03) sleeps with a 15 year old girl terrible we won 200 years four year old guy sleeps with a 15 year old girl 100 normal how is it trauma now and not trauma that and mind you like this is not my state i'm just i'm you have to pull an extreme example if we're going to talk about trauma to illustrate the concept so if it's traumatic in one instance and not traumatic in another then it means that we can basically change the cultural narrative that we're ascribing to our context and make it not traumatic that makes sense which means
(02:27) it didn't matter which means the only thing that matters that you chose to make it meaningful well let's say like like the the the passing of a parent or like a 100 or something like that if we think we feel like we have a narrative that says if i don't mourn it means i didn't care about them right that's a statement of belief i could say that if i don't mourn about them it means i totally cared about them like why does my morning have any indication of how much i cared they're non-correlates right but it's just because we have like
(02:52) we have so many of these belief statements that quote society or things that we inherit but we just choose to say that this is how life is and so i think it's just like monitoring what those statements are and so like one of my favorite one of my favorite sayings probably like if i had one thing on my tombstone it would be it would be a permutation of a quote by orson scott card which is we question all of our beliefs except for those that we truly believe and those who never think to question yes they get clumped right
(03:14) so it's like we like oh of course i'm opening to question my beliefs it's like what's trauma like when someone's like i was traumatized it's like were you or do you just choose to label this trauma and then now you [ __ ] up the rest of your life because you call it trauma when 200 years ago it was life and a thousand years ago having your parent come in front of you was just nature if you want to go biology and so we're just like we just choose to create meaning around things and so like at the end of the day
(03:34) like end to end end bottom bottom bottom root yeah all our brains do is just create a new story meaning and so we say this is a threat this is not a threat we make like we need to reinforce this behavior we don't need to reinforce this favor all through meaning and so if you can control what you d d meaningful you can massively shift the odds in your favor because you don't need to ascribe meaning to well couldn't that be let's say like like 500 years ago you see like a parent killed in front of you isn't that because all you have in your mind
(03:58) is like food shelter water sure and now that we have those things taken care of our minds go to other places sure i just don't think it changes the actual facts so it's like we have we there's there's stimulus response right and so like we get to control the response we control the stimulus was it um it's either seneca or epictetus who's like no one yells at a rock right so it's like if you are the rock then like just it doesn't matter right like you just like eventually like people just [ __ ] off and just leave you alone and so like and if
(04:25) you if you see stimulus of life that way in terms of like how you deem things or label things traumatic or not dramatic or good or bad you know it's the same thing i'm sure with like the hate comments and whatnot is like if you deem the comments of of the fans as meaningful then you will both care about them being positive and you will care about them being negative but if they're not meaningful at all to begin with then like i don't think you can do either i think you just either have to participate in both sides or you remove
(04:46) that is also a belief statement right so like maybe you can so you know interesting thoughts so how did you transition from assume i'm assuming you used to care a little bit more about beliefs and stuff like that how did you transition from that to now not caring and did you have to completely change your mindset to where your automatic response to things was just like what what are these chains of emotions and like the cultural constraints and stuff like that that are making me feel this way yeah that did you just switch that light switch or do
(05:12) you still on occasion catch yourself slipping i just did right now i was like i just said that as a belief right that's what i figured 100 yeah i mean i think you systematically you hear like that's why the talking is so important like what words are we using what do those words mean like you say trauma like define that what do you mean by that which is why like when you hear really good writing that's academic like the first few pages will be like we're going to talk about this and this is how we define this and this is how we define
(05:33) this it's like we're putting constraints around the words that we're using because they mean they equate to thoughts they're just buckets right that we like say a word like trauma and like it means something different to all three of us so it's like we have to agree on the definition before we can talk about it that makes sense um and so no i had um so i i definitely made a conscious effort when i was like 19 or 20 i became a born-again christian um the dunk the whole thing was like oh my god life's amazing jesus is great and
(05:57) then i ended up falling away from that because i was like i don't know if this is true and then i spent the next five years dedicated to apologetics which is defense of faith of the christian faith so just learning the arguments around like why christianity like is true right i ended up not believing in it and i can give a variety of reasons but i'll give you the simplest one hopefully i'm not insulting anyone this is just my belief that i'm sharing which is a lot of one of the biggest one of the strongest arguments for
(06:23) christianity against other world religions is that other world religions say like if you go to the good place so if you do a good job you go to a good place right and fundamentally that's it's a it's a hard paradigm because it means like at what point are you 51 good versus 49 should i have just held one more door open and i would have gone to the good place forever not even talking about like finite circumstances and creating infinite outcomes but like whatever and so if you can draw that line then it makes it it kind of makes
(06:44) it ridiculous right it like kind of breaks down on the like be a good person system and so that's all world views with the exception of buddhism and christianity with christianity they're like you don't have to be good you just have to have faith and if you have faith in jesus and you go to the good place right and so the the reason that for me fundamentally i didn't believe in that was because you actually create another false binary which is believe or not believe when in reality is to what extent you believe it's how hard you
(07:07) believe and again you create another 50 line which is i believe one percent more and then i would go into the good place forever so anyways the point is is that i i studied apologetics for a long period of time and then i was really sad and i was just like [ __ ] sad i was like [ __ ] happiness i was like i'm just going to do stuff that i think is cool and that was like that was like the first break in the chain for me um my slogan to myself was actually just about happiness and that was wildly fraying because i stopped judging myself for not
(07:31) being happy and then i was just like oh i'm like i am unhappy i'm like cool whatever i just kept going and all of a sudden just like stop mattering to me like i don't think about it i genuinely like i don't think like does this make me happy does not like i don't think about it you just do what you want to do in the moment do whatever you're doing and it's not like it's like all short-term like all pleasure-seeking whatever like i still have a long-term perspective of like this is what i want to build yeah like i want to write these
(07:50) books i want to build these courses i want to do this stuff but it's like those are things that i enjoy so that's what i that's what i do i love it it's great all right i don't have anything i mean i had questions but now i know the answers to them just based off here i'm just listening i'd rather just listen and not say i know it's like i don't want to mess it up but then i created a belief that now i'm going to mess it up why does that matter i know i mean i know it's crazy stuff but like i think that like if you want to you can't do
(08:24) what 99 of people are doing if you want to be in the one percent yeah fundamentally and so like you have to have like what i would consider like maybe uncomfortable conversations just be like that's okay like cool like i just i'm gonna do my thing and then they're like and the thing is a lot of times if you just even just make your statements of like this is how i believe like people feel like you're attacking them especially if you articulate it well because they're like why i don't i'm like cool like i don't get like do
(08:46) whatever you want like it's all good to me and so which is why i don't talk about it as much publicly how about this yeah what bothers you there's got to be something out there that like i also haven't wasted a lot of time it's the only thing i don't have a lot of this may seem like a silly question but if you go to a restaurant and you order something let's say you order a steak and you order it medium well and it comes back medium rare do you say something not worth its time no i don't actually you don't no why would i i
(09:09) don't care but at the same time i was like well a lot of people would be anxious to say something and i figured you probably wouldn't care about those emotions right i wouldn't even have an emotion first i mean that's such a yeah yeah yeah i mean maybe like like like we have a big ad campaign that's supposed to go out and like i get all the creatives today before and it's supposed to launch would that annoy me i'd be like yes but let's fix it you know like this is bad we can't run this let's try again you know and in the end it won't
(09:32) matter because we're all gonna die and this money's gonna go back to the game i'll give you this one analogy this might be a good wrap up so this is like my mental analogy that i make sense to me which is like if if if life were a game and all of us are given a token to like enter like a casino because we're in vegas right so we're all getting you know a token we enter the casino we sit down at the table to play poker and everybody's playing everybody's got cards and all you know we're dealt cards everybody's dealt different cards and we
(09:56) got to play the hand we're done and depending on our level of skill we amass more and more chips throughout the game and um at the end of the game the difference between the real world and the casin in the the game of life in the real world you just you go and you can cash out your chips and you walk out with money and there you go there is your day but i feel like in the casino of life you get tapped on the shoulder by the grim reaper he says your time's up and then all your chips get pushed right back to the middle of the table
(10:18) and then you leave the casino empty-handed because it was a fake game with fake rules that didn't matter and so like we accumulate these chips that i'm just gonna push back in the middle again that other people are gonna play on and like the reason that that analogy became real for me is like i bought this piece of land in austin and i was like that's neat and then i was like how many people have owned this piece of land it's like the guy you know the guy before me owned it and the guy before him owned it the guy before him doing it
(10:40) and i was like and they were like this is mine and they die or they sell it and someone was like this is mine it's like they're just chips that just get played with and they just get amassed and they get redistributed it just doesn't matter like death taxes everybody 100 so like everyone's like estate planning it's like dude 500 generations from now a your your offspring are you know 500 to the you know 0.
(10:59) 5 or you know one half to the 500th power of like diluted they're basically just humans at that point so if your wealth somehow is a big enough that it can be diluted that that much and last that long the people who own it are just humans so like they're so they're just as close to me as you are you know it doesn't matter um and then the alternative is the people that i'm giving this to are just the ones that i care about are the immediate family but then when people get resources that they didn't learn how to uh use or manage then it destroys them because it's too
(11:23) much potential energy they can't handle it and so it's like it's really for nothing and so like if you want you can build something that you think is cool but like at the end of the day like we're just going to cast the chips in so anyways alex's world views but it's a great analogy just lots to think about this one yeah i don't have to re-watch this but you know you know what's funny i was actually thinking i would yeah re-watch this listen to podcasts this segment i would actually listen to this yeah money income no earth
(11:50) [Laughter] investing indexes savings accounts what credit cards that's good geez thank you so much thank you alex for coming on this has been an incredible podcast yeah i think so i appreciate i appreciate you having me and to the audience like i know that a lot of the stuff that i say can be uh triggering and i know that at different points in my life if i had heard someone say what i'm saying in the position that i am i would be offended um and i want to make it clear that it's not my intention to do that um at all
(12:21) it's just me sharing beliefs that uh as i understand the world and that there's no way projection on you or how you see the world et cetera it's just this is how i see the world and these are beliefs that served me well um that helped me overcome a lot of things that i thought mattered you thought there we go that was it that should be our intro yeah that could be our intro that's a good segment to put right there in the beginning because it's going to catch people where they were like what what's offensive but
(12:48) what am i going to disagree with perfect let's do that thank you so much thanks for coming on man it was nice meeting you too thank you good luck on your tinder date thank you thank you should grow the stash out by that you think so i mean if you want to that's why i shaved it last night by the way

The Ultra Rich Playbook [Legal & Tax-Free] - YouTube
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6x3re5-Ms1E

Transcript:
(00:00) how the ultr rich get rich and avoid taxes legally and if you don't know who I am my name is Alex rosi I got my first $100 million by age 32 and I did that by taking $42 million in distributions from my first big company gym launch and I ended up selling that company for 46.2 million I reinvested that 42 million in distributions into portfolio of companies that's today at acquisition.
(00:25) comom just over $200 million a year and so that's my evidence to why I have something worth saying about this now that being said I'm going to split this video into two parts one is the four strategies that the ultr rich use in order to get wealthy and then the second half I'm going to explain how you can use those same four strategies to reverse engineer a $10 million goal and the reason I use $1 million as the net worth goal is because $10 million at four or 5% per year which would be basically a RIS risk-free investment
(00:53) strategy you'd be able to live like the top 1% in today's market so you could move these dollars up as dollars get uh inflated and all that kind of stuff but for now these are the big four strategies and so these developed over time as my understanding of money improved and so for me I now want to make a billion dollars or at least be worth a billion dollars haha lots of zeros okay so the first version of this that I thought in order for me to be worth a billion dollars was to make 1.5 billion dollars I know a lot of zero
(01:31) in income all right because after taxes which would be 67% taxes in the US which is the highest federal tax rate that you can that you have to pay you'd be left with $1 billion overall post tax okay that's the zero leverage version of making money so this is just income Generation all right V2 of this is thinking okay well if I make a billion dollars or I make income every year I'm going to invest a certain percentage of that income into making money for me passively and so this feels harder than making $100
(02:10) million per year and reinvesting that money at 9% so the Clear Point here is I'm just saying this is just the S&P this is just the market this isn't doing anything fancy you're just buying indexes of the S&P 500 now at $100 million a year in 10 years you would make $1 billion now that's because this post taxes uh you'd have 600 and sorry $67 million post tax income that you then invest at that same 9% which would get you your billion dollars after a decade you're like okay well making $100 billion a year in income versus making $ 1.5 billion in
(02:53) income over however long period of time this feels a little easier because now I'm giving two things I'm generating income plus I'm using public equities all right so I'm I'm using passive investment strategies for things that are ready available to the public for everyone the V3 version of this it gets spicier and spicier every time is that you do you make $1100 million per year and you own the asset you own the business that makes this much money and you sell it at call it 12x when I say 12x means 12 times earnings which a company of
(03:30) this size it' probably be fair that it would get that kind of multiple because it's so big which means that you would make 1.2 billion which would leave you post tax with around $1 billion now what people don't talk about this as a total side note and as somebody who sold multiple companies is that everyone has this big dream to sell a company and get the check but what they don't tell you is that you then have a check and then you have to do something with the check so now you have to translate that check back into equities so you just sold
(03:57) equities and you get money and then you have to buy equities yet again and so then you have to think to yourself am I going to get a better return on this billion dollars than I do within the existing business or asset that I ended up selling and I'm going to translate these zeros down to the $10 million goal that we're talking about in a second but I just like to show what it looks like at scale so that this can just so you can see how the Big ultr Rich stuff actually happens in the real world now this is the the V3 version
(04:22) this is income so that's the skill plus private Equity all right so this was public Equity this is priv private Equity all right so a little bit different this business isn't available on the market there's institutional buyers who raise funds and then they will give you a check for the business that's V3 of this now V4 of this is very sexy and has three different sub strategies all right and so in this instance you have your business that makes $100 million per year and so you choose one of three paths path one so we'll go a we'll go B
(04:58) and we'll go C so at the top level you can do something called an ESOP an ESOP is an employee stock ownership plan where you sell between 33 and 49% mind you this is a minority stake in your business and a bank will finance your employees back stopping that debt with the equity that you sell them employees get the equity here bank is here and then there's you and so the bank gives you money and lends it to the employees to pay you using the stock that you gave them as collateral now what's interesting about this at least
(05:34) in the United States and I'm sure there's different functions like this internationally is that this payment at least in our tax laws is taxfree and so you get a smaller multiple because banks will always pay less because they have to think about risk not upside then potentially a private Equity buyer would but this is taxfree to the owner which is pretty sweet now one of the other nice things here is that you still maintain control of your business because you still own majority and so if you do it in this way you can help your
(06:00) employees get wealthy you get a taxfree check uh they get to participate in the growth of the business and often times esops can go well because then now you have a huge team of people who are also incentivizing growing the business and quote act like owners but they didn't need to come up with the money it's like here's your stock and then they go straight to the bank and then the bank gives them the loan to pay you for the stock you gave them it's kind of how it works okay that's version a of this now the way this works though is that you
(06:26) just traded the equity and you get cash for what you gave the employees but you still own the asset and so the asset is still worth what it is in the private realm so if you add those two things together you still have a billion dollar but you get the liquidity and you keep the control the version B of this is something called a dividend recap so dividend recap is using the same bank structure that you'd have with an ESOP except you just cut the employees out of it you just go directly to the bank and say hey how much will
(06:56) you loan me using my entire business as collateral now if you think huh that's weird think about it like buying a house if you buy a house you go to the bank you put x% down and they give you debt for the rest of it and then you pay that debt off and so the business actually works the same way so if you have no debt on the business or even if you do have debt on the business you go and say hey we can reliably produce this much income and so we could pay off this level of debt and so then a bank would say okay well we'll give you four times
(07:20) or five times your total eida or your earnings for the year roughly and will give you that as debt so if I make $100 million a year they might give me a $500 million loan that they know that my business will be able to pay the interest off on which for them makes sense because they're just getting paid to give money that they that they loaned out right and then you have terms associated with that debt right now if your business is growing then it makes a ton of sense to do that you drisk a little bit as an owner and the key Point
(07:45) here is that the business carries the debt not you personally and so you as a person the owner of the business gets to take the $500 million but the business pays the debt off and so let's say 5 years later maybe the business pays all of the debt off you got the $500 million and you still own the business just like owning a house at the end of paying it off works the same way kind of cool now the third version of this is one that people are a little bit more familiar with which we kind of used earlier which
(08:14) is public equities meaning you go public with the company that you have and so now when you go public you only have to sell a small percentage of shares in order to make them available to the public and by doing that the remainder of the stock that you have starts to have an actual Marketplace value and so the value of this and one this is one of the biggest benefits of going public is that you don't have to sell 33 to 49% of your shares you could sell 10% or 5% of your shares and then the other 95% has a market value in real time and so then
(08:45) you can still go to those same institutions Banks Etc and say Hey I want you to loan me and the thing is is here you can do it peace meal you don't have to go through a six-month process or 12month process to get one specific amount you can say hey lend me uh 5 million a day lend me 20 million tomorrow lend me you know 100 million on this other day and you can do that process in 24 hours because you have equities that are publicly available which they can collateralize meaning they can then take that if for whatever
(09:12) reason you don't sell and so most of the times banks will loan up to 50% of the value of the stock that you have and so if I have a billion dollars in stock I can get a loan up to $5500 million and so this is exactly what Elon did when he went to go to go buy to buy X he just took a loan out of his wallet and then just bought it in cash kind of cool right and so the idea here is that these are three different ways that you can use and you're like okay well then what's the meta strategy for V4 V4 is you have an income producing thing plus
(09:46) you understand debt because all three of these strategies use a bank or an institution to front the capital and the main thing with all three of these is that you actually retain ownership and control and so as my understanding of money and markets Improv approved I started to understand different ways that I could achieve my billion dollar goal now if you're like okay Alex that sounds great but you said there was something about the ultr rich and avoiding taxes well let's talk about the taxes and let's translate it to the $10
(10:11) million goal okay so here this is taxfree pretty nice with the ESOP thing the dividend recap also the uh this isn't taxfree because you have to take it as a as a as a payment right so that one you still have to pay taxes on here it's taxfree because it's it's a loan against your public equities part of me feels like dividend recap might be taxfree not sure on this but the uh public equities absolutely the loans that you take against them are tax-free because they're loans and you pay interest on them and then you have to
(10:41) pay loans back and that's the big thing and there's a big you know I would say a little bit of a misconception on this it's like oh these rich people uh they should be paying tax on unrealized gains well until someone gets money for something I think that it's like having someone pay income tax on a paycheck they haven't gotten yet I feel like that's a little bit ridiculous on the other hand with the public equities peace you still have covenants that you have to be responsible for to whoever gives you the money and so it's not like
(11:09) you get the money and you can do whatever you want with it you have to pay it back that's how loans work now the only way that this works longterm is that your business continues to grow if the business goes down then you're in deep so you can lose it all and so there's risk that's not being appropriately valued when people say oh these rich people just take loans off their stuff but this is fundamentally how you can do it and get liquidity or cash from something that you own that's valuable okay now if you're like all
(11:35) right Alex that sounds fantastic but I'm not trying to make a billion dollars right now I'm trying to get to $10 million over the span of my life ideally as fast as possible in net worth and the reason I use $10 million is that because at 5% you can make about 500,000 a year at least in the US which would be about the top 1% in terms of earnings pretty sweet now as a side note this you also pay less taxes on so this is usually going to be something called qualified dividends meaning you only pay 20% on this rather than paying income tax so
(12:06) you actually get more for your money when it's off of passive distributions Okay cool so if we're using these four strategies here V1 of this is just the pure income method which means that over the span of your life you're going to need to make $15 million in income and then after your 67% tax rate you'll be left with 10 million bucks okay that's V1 not a lot leverage but you can do it that way the V2 version of this is that you make your $1 million per year per year oops there we go $1 million per year and you make and you
(12:45) still pay your taxes on that but you invest that post tax at 9% and then after 10 years you have $10 million so a total interesting side note on this is that with 10 years then at 9% and given the the tax rate that exists in the US is that on a 10-year time Horizon you can measure how good someone is at investing their money based on what their value of their portfolio is 10 years later relative to what their income would have been untaxed and so if I made a millionar a year in 10 years I should have $10 million if I paid zero
(13:19) taxes but since I pay 37% taxes or anybody who would make this would pay 37% taxes then every year they're actually making $670,000 and so if you invested that 670 at 9% then you'd make at the end of that period $10 million so you'd actually be back where you started because you had to invest to make up the difference in taxes and obviously the first year of that 10 is significantly more valuable because of compounding than the last year of that 10 I'm keeping this simple and not getting into living expenses and things like that
(13:49) which obviously would complicate this okay so that is income income plus passive investing income Plus active investing so V3 of this is that you make $1.2 million per year from an asset meaning you own a business that let's say it does $10 million in revenue and it does $1.2 million in distributions or owner earnings all right and let's say that you can sell this thing at uh 10x all right so less than the company over here but the only way you'd be able to sell a company at this value which you can at this size uh
(14:24) reasonably you know if it's a business that truly is an asset so right now there's HVAC companies that are selling at 10 12 14x there's dental offices there's accounting firms so these are real businesses that can be sold if you're in the right Market again I'm going to use Simple illustrations here so this would then give us $12 million that you would get pre-tax and then you pay your capital gains taxes that you'd have to pay within the US which would leave you with 10 million bucks now again same as before okay I have this
(14:54) thing that was passively making me $1.2 million a year $100,000 a month well what am I going to buy with my $10 million that's going to replace this thing sometimes thinking the Second Step Ahead can influence whether or not you want to sell this overall but I do like to make the point so this one is income plus our active or private Equity so we had public here we had private here and then V4 is going to look a little bit different because we have this $10 million goal and so I want to tell you a different strategy that I think is wildly
(15:27) underrated which is you can go and become an employee at a company or a partner depending on how you want to see this of a company that then goes public for a billion dollars that you own 1% of and that you earned over five years and what's cool about this particular path is that you get all the benefits of this path over here is that you can take loans against the stocks that you have that are worth 1% and you too can live like the ultra rich and take those those loans taxfree now you can't do an ESOP because you're you're not the owner of
(15:58) the business but you can do in my opinion the most attractive of the three of these things which is that you can have in real time access to liquidity or cash to buy the things that you need based on the value of the asset you have and so let's say that you uh you start working in a business they say we'll give you 0.
(16:16) 2% per year times 5 years and you do the five years and the over that time period the company goes public for a billion dollars da one billion well you get the idea then your stock is worth $10 million but here's the nice part is that you paid probably a very very very gracious tax amount to get this or these options Associated um with the shares and then you have something that is worth $10 million that you can then take loans against all right so these are the four strategies from the ultrich translated into normal income goals now I want to zoom out for a
(16:48) second because I think this will be helpful for everyone no matter which of these paths you choose or the versions of the past that you want you'll notice some common themes the first one is that you have to be valuable like you have to learn how to provide value to the marketplace either as an employee or as a small business owner or as a larger business owner overall but either way you have to learn how to generate income and the way you generate income is by solving problems for other people and learning skills and so a lot
(17:14) of time I see dedicated to content from people who don't talk about the most important thing which is sure you can have all these passive investment strategies but if you're working off of $35,000 a year it's never going to happen like we like to talk about the one lady who worked at McDonald's for 50 years and saved every penny she ever had so she could end up with a million dollars but is that really the ideal strategy when maybe taking a weekend and getting a certification can bump you to 50 or $60,000 a year or you just learn
(17:43) outbound sales and you bump yourself to $150,000 a year five times the earning potential and so I think that the investing stuff gets really sexy because it feels passive but you live your whole life and so you might as well get five times 10 times more for the time you are guaranteed to have to give we all spend seconds every second we're alive and so you might as well get more for them the second one is what I want to talk about is the fallacy or the three fallacies of Warren Buffett so Warren Buffett a lot
(18:08) of people like I just want to do what Warren Buffett did he just slowly invested right well let me walk you through what the fallacies of Warren Buffett are so three fallacies of Warren Buffett number one I'm going to be just like him well did you buy your first at age seven and did you do that weeks after Pearl Harbor when there was literal blood in the streets well if you didn't buy your first stock at age seven literal weeks after Pearl Harbor then maybe you don't already have the makeup of somebody who's going to be the greatest investor
(18:51) of all time something to consider the second is are you going to live through the greatest growth in American history as you start your investing career which is exactly what Warren Buffett was able to do and the third one is one that I actually talk about that I don't hear talked about a lot which is just luck and so let me hear me out I think Warren is brilliant and I talk about him all the time and I think there's a lot of things we can learn from him but what I see when I look at the top 0.
(19:24) 1% whatever the top of the top of the top of the top is that you have all the skills all the traits all the everything comma and luck because the only way like if you were to think of the hypothetical the the number one person on Earth in general would have all of the things plus luck because some everyone's going there is luck that goes around and so the number one person is going to have everything that's required plus luck there's plenty of investors that are brilliant investors that are worth $1 billion instead of $100 billion they just didn't get the
(19:53) luck part right or they've been only investing for 30 years instead of 70 right or 75 for 85 or whatever the amount of years he's alive now all right and so I think these three things are some are things that are not considered when people like oh I want to do the strategy and I want to highlight this because the main theme of all of these is that you have to generate income you have to make money it's the only way you can even have the income so like right now I have a handful of Investments that are doing exceptionally well but the
(20:19) only reason that I would be able to make those Investments is because I have excess capacity in terms of cash Capital that I could deploy if you don't and this is where like living below your means to make more so you have the Delta so you can can you can get aggressive is so important and I think it's really lost in the narrative today and so the last thing I want to talk about is what Rich parents give as the greatest gift to their kids and so the number one predictor of success longterm is the zip code you're born in all right and I find
(20:46) that really interesting and also disparaging in some ways because it means that it controls for IQ it controls for ethnicity controls for gender it's the ZIP code that you're born in and I see that as mostly due to the association conditions of other people in that zip code and so it's like okay that means that conditions can create our Behavior or shape our Behavior so then what Behavior changes happen in a rich environment versus a poor environment and I think that it can really come down to one main thing which
(21:12) is the leverage of the opportunity vehicles that you pursue and so I remember this clear as day because I I came from what I would consider upper middle class so my dad's a doctor um but when I went to Vanderbilt I was exposed to an entirely different level of wealth that I didn't even really knew existed I'm from Baltimore there just wasn't any like New York money like it wasn't really a thing like if like it just it was a concept I didn't understand but for them the opportunity vehicle that they wanted their kids to
(21:41) pursue had leverage meaning they got more for what they put in and so a middle class parent might say hey you're a Salesman awesome and you sell cars okay well you sell cars and cars cost whatever and the top top top cars SM salesman might make you know 300 to 400,000 a year okay now some people are like there's this one guy cool well good for him but for most like let's call it top 1% are making $3 to $400,000 a year now the upper class salesmen or the upper class or the ultra Rich whatever you want to call it Ultra
(22:18) salesman sells companies and guess what he makes 4% on the deal and so if he sells a $200 million company he makes 8 million bucks for one sale and so same fundamental skills obviously there a little bit more analysis here but fundamentally you are selling stuff and all somebody who is wealthier does is tries to get more for what they put in they try and add zeros to the price tag of the things they sell if you sell a $500 million building you get a commission for that just like you get for selling a $50,000 house same
(22:53) concept you just add scale to it and every one of these people has the same number of hours per day which just means they get more for their time and so thinking through this what poor people or middle class people miss that rich people or Rich Kids Rich parents pass to their kids is which opportunities to say no to they don't even consider the quote lower class or middle class opportunity and I think of this on something that I like to refer to is measuring sticks and so I'll give you a little story to illustrate the point so when I
(23:28) was a kid in high school I worked I started my first job when I was 15 and N months which was like the legal age that I could start working I started working as a blender tender at Smoothie King and as I as I leveled up and became a lead and then I think a manager at some point and then eventually I shifted to catering uh which I got 25 bucks an hour for which was awesome back in my day anyways I was hoodrich and the thing is is that I measured how much money I had and how many Chipotle burritos I could buy because I knew that Chipotle Burritos
(23:57) were about seven bucks and so so I was like man I just got you know 200 bucks for this shift that's like 28 burritos that I can buy now which is awesome right I was super excited about it and so what happens is the measuring stick that you use to measure stuff the wealthiest people in the world just have a larger stick in two ways one is they measure over longer time Horizons and they also use like they literally call by the way in Wall Street a stick is $1 million so that's the slang among rich people like if you're like oh I didn't
(24:29) know that there was slang for a million dollars there is slang for a million dollars when you have lots of millions of dollars you say give him two sticks it means two million bucks and so when you hang around people who talk in increments of $1 million imagine the opportunities that they're pursuing and more importantly for everybody who's listening to this the many things they say no to and so this is where you lose years and Decades of life is that you say yes to opportunities that you otherwise shouldn't and so they're able
(24:54) to be patient or more selective because they know that they're going to get they want to maximize how many dollars they get out for the effort and time they put in and unless something is going to ladder up to remember we're thinking longer time Horizons something where they can get sticks for their time then they're not going to do it they're willing to take a job for 50 or $60,000 a year or $80,000 a year as an analyst at you know PWC oron young or McKenzie or an investment Bank League Goldman Sachs they're willing to eat dog
(25:23) for that period of time because they know that that's not the plan this is just the period that they're learning and gaining experience so that they can do the next thing they see it in stepping stones and the vast majority in my opinion of people who stay stuck don't have a plan they don't see where things lad are up to and they don't reverse their goal into the present and so no matter what whichever of these paths you use one you have to focus on income generation and learning skills two you want to make sure that you
(25:50) actually say no to the things that don't matter and be very selective about the things that will give you the highest return three surround yourself with people who have bigger measuring sticks in terms of time and money than you because whatever opportunities they're discussing will likely be higher leverage the opportunities that you're considering and then finally in with regards to the fallacy of of Warren Buffett if you want to make obscene amounts of money you will not make it the way that someone else has already
(26:18) made it it will be made in a new way which means the single greatest and most valuable skill that a human being can have is the ability to come to their own conclusion and have the confidence to act on it despite it being contrary to what other people are doing because if it's what everyone else is doing then it's not an opportunity because the funny thing about opportunity is is they look like Risk while they're opportunities and the moment they're no longer risky is when the opportunity has closed and that's how life works you
(26:47) have to make bets and you want to make the bets that you feel like you have an information advantage over other people so you can come to your own conclusion rather than listening to other people have an amazing day hope you enjoyed this stuff that's how the all Church do it and if you you like these kind of deeper business Concepts I have two two free gifts for you I wrote $100 million offers and $100 million leads these are both available for free on my podcast which is the game Alex Rosa you can just search my name you'll probably find it I
(27:09) also have these in course if you like watching rather than listening uh on my site at acquisition. comom you can just click training and you'll see the courses that we available they're all free um but if you do like something hard you can grab these wherever you buy books and uh hopefully make a lot more money

Transcript:
(00:00) spent two years of your life dedicated this book we blew the launch out of the water so what now today we're going to be going to four different podcasts to talk about what's next for the brand and Beyond thank you oh it's your last one I'm not gonna do that too no no I will never take a man's last piece of gum no it's crude and unusual thank you hello the last piece is always a holy piece I would have done this with him and like split it late in the stop yeah let's rock your wedding ring is rubber yeah the other ring it was like
(00:40) it would get a little tight while I was sleeping and I would end up taking it off while I'm asleep and I'd be like where is it Mark you are ridiculously good at manuals for how to make money but if people don't know how to think and they've got a life structure that doesn't make any sense and they're wasting time on the social media or even just a friend group that is going nowhere fast what advice do you have for them to get back one of my favorite quotes from BF Skinner who's a behavior psychologist from way back in the day
(01:06) was you can lead a horse to water but you can't make a drink he said well if you bleed it out enough and you starve it and you leave it in the sun and you put the water right in front of its mouth he said I can invaritably guarantee that I can make a drink and so if you were to think about yourself as that horse then it's like okay well what is the equivalent of the the bloodletting the dehydration the starving that you can put yourself into get the behavior you want so starving has a negative connotation but we can
(01:29) also starve out the negative things in your life like you can starve the alcohol you can starve the friends and I think the easiest way to do that is to get out of the environment you're in I think this was in atomic habits in Vietnam like I think it was like 10 of troops or something we're taking heroin when they were there in the 70s and they thought there's going to be this massive problem when they came back to the States but when they came back to the States almost no one continued the heroin habit and so
(01:55) going from Vietnam where you're doing heroin to the U.S where you're not doing taking heroin had a 90 success rate whereas the inverse is true of recovery centers in the United States today people go there and 90 of them relapse when they go back home and so the difference is that people were doing heroin in a different environment and then they changed their environment and then they never went back to the environment that they did heroin in to be fair I think the reason a lot of people kind of like some of the content
(02:17) that I put out from a money-making perspective is how can I operationalize this word right so like patience for example is when people throw out a lot but for me defining patience was helpful which is figuring out what to do in the meantime like that's patience like you're like I'm not patient it's like no you just need to figure out what to do in the meantime I think these are like mental models around using emotions to fuel the behaviors that you want so me defining amorphous terms like confidence winning respect loyalty
(02:45) sadness anxiety have come from my own desire to understand the words and reading the dictionary definitions and feeling like they don't provide much and they can't help me what is love and you know people like it's a feeling that that doesn't help me how do I operationalize this word love for me how much are you willing to sacrifice to maintain a relationship that is how you can measure love you could use an example of like man that guy works on that piece of crap car all the time he must really love it right
(03:16) like he's willing to sacrifice a lot to maintain that thing to the same degree many people would sacrifice everything for their kids now there's plenty of times where they don't like their kids but they'd be willing to die for their children you might be willing to die for your country and so when I Define these terms it has been out of my own self-interest to learn how to navigate life better you just did a book launch it was Unreal I mean really like blew people's minds set a standard or what did you demonstrate in the way that you
(03:44) did that that other people don't understand with each book I wanted to demonstrate the concept of the book with the book itself since the concept of the book was to advertise and to get lots of leads then I thought it would be appropriate to advertise and get lots of leads and I used every method in the book I ran ads for it even though I didn't need to run ads we still got 137 000 people from ads we had Affiliates we had 104 000 people there from Affiliates we had 27 000 Affiliates promote the book we had customer referrals people sent their
(04:14) friends there so I had an incentive that if you just get 10 people to come you'll get two bonus chapters that aren't released with the book and so you know the next book I'll try and continue that meta theme of I have Concepts in this book and I will show you that they work because I will use them to Market and promote the book tell me on a nose trip it says b one of zero what does that mean so one of zero is a brand that I am really passionate about the concept one of zero actually came from my media team you know we talk
(04:41) about content in general is one of one content like we try to make content that only we can make and that's actually one of my Big Marketing rules is that say what only you could say show it only you can show as we were approaching the event the team learned more and more about what we were going to be giving away and how much we're putting into it and they're like dude this isn't even one of one this is one of zero and that statement just clicked and then everyone latched on to it because it wasn't about just doing what only we
(05:04) could do it was doing what no one else would do if you look at one of zero one divided by zero from a mathematical perspective it's undefined and I think a lot of that is stuff that I resonate with which is doing work that no one else will do is doing the things that other people will tell you not to do and foregoing the shoulds and the must and the have to's that people around you tell you to do because they want to project their life and their expeditions on yours but you want to live in direct contrast to that because you want to be
(05:32) your own person and be Beyond definition and let your actions be the only thing to Define you one of one is doing the things that only you can do but one of zero is doing things that you're not even sure you can do yet appreciate you man a Chick-fil-A action what is the Chick-fil-A order I go uh 12 count grilled nugs four count fry tenders and then a spicy chicken Deluxe no cheese with Chick-fil-A sauce and ranch that's the go-to if you can only choose between one sauce out of every restaurant it would be uh no it'd be um the Persian yogurt sauce
(06:10) go with the roots yeah I mean it also has nutritional value It's Yogurt it's got protein in it right a little fat it's refreshing what's the sign of a good podcast interview for you number one is my uh rapport with the host if we're comfortable then automatically the conversation is going to be better the second thing is how much they know about me and our stuff if I'm doing like Recaps it's less interesting if I were to do a third and fourth thing it is quality of the follow-on questions because there are some people who have
(06:39) like these are 12 questions that I will ask Alex they ask a question I answer the question then they say question two and then they they don't dive deeper into it which to me makes it almost makes it seem like they're not listening because then it's not a conversation it's really just like 12 short clips the last one uh is really their ability to let silence exist I will say that I have noticed this about the best podcast hosts is that like they will ask a question and then I might answer and they will just they will just sit at the end of
(07:08) that and then give me another second or two and then I might add something to it that might be the the real nugget or crystallization of thinking and if you have a really rushed Cadence in terms of how the conversation is going it becomes more difficult to have thoughtful responses oh wow what's up stud how's it going man good to see you man what have you learned in the last year the hardest work I've done has been my redefining winning I think for me that is like that has been my big unlock for how much effort I can put in
(07:41) to make better and keep pushing so I think one of the hardest things as an entrepreneur or just an individual is Shifting how you define winning for yourself and it's easy to say it and say of course I'm in the game I'm winning it's much harder to actually believe that and so it's easy to make the Instagram clip but it's hard to live it and what's been interesting for me is that I feel like it's unlocked a different level of work ethic I thought that the fear of the gun to your head is still the strongest motivator and it is
(08:05) in the short term but if you need to run a marathon then you need to have something that is going to sustain for a longer period of time like punishment is always stronger the short term reward is always longer in the long term and so we have to redefine uh we reward ourselves for the work we do and so since I don't believe in Legacy and I don't believe that in 5000 years people are going to remember who I am I had to make winning working as hard as I could on something how do you measure working as hard as you can tough I think about a
(08:36) future version of myself who has all the context in my current situation my skills uh the information available to me the resources I have and that man that feature man knows what perfect work looks like which is how much effort can I put into this thing and not be distracted and continue to Chisel away at this project it's very hard because it means there's very few projects that I can do if I have that level of work as my new standard and so if that level of work is the standard and that is what winning is then I can
(09:08) only do it for a few things there's just a lot of things I'm not going to be able to do which is sad in some ways but I think a necessary trade-off because like we have one human life hair band no strip ready I tested a zillion different bags to get the bag that I have I wear one pair of shorts and one beater if I want to conserve space I can do two to one so I can do two beaters per one pair of shorts I can wear shorts twice I know I'm risque I like that I bring no strips and I usually have one flannel or button
(09:37) down that I bring with me and I wear the same shoes that are appropriate in all venues I can wear in the gym I can wear them to a restaurant I can wear them on stage that makes packing take less than a minute for me and that's how I like it and so I can pretty much work until the moment we have to leave and I just throw my two beaters in and my shorts and I'm good to go the first time you put them on you're like this is not going to make it better if you ever have breathing problems whenever you've got like a good line of of air you're like
(10:01) don't with it you know like just let it go so you go here to just destroy all of the good stuff and then you take your first breath and you're like I didn't know the air could be so sweet the studs what's up man what up Council we need to do something about billionaires I am proposing that the city of Los Angeles banned billionaires from the beach what do you think is the biggest mistake content creators make today not being them basically getting taken over by the algorithm and then like talking about blue trees when they don't actually
(10:38) with blue trees right but they did it because they did one blue tree post and people brought that back right so it had to um and so you got a lot of likes and they're like maybe I'll start making more stuff on Blue trees but like then they go down that Alleyway for six months or a year and then they're like oh I'm like the blue tree Channel but like I don't even care about trees like that's not the stuff I like talking about and so they can't actually sustain it because the biggest brands are built over decades not days or weeks or months
(10:59) a secret confession the majority of my news feed almost all of it is uh Comedians and that's because I like comedy and I think comedy and philosophy are probably my two great interests in terms of things that I consume because they are the two the two truth tellers of society it's philosophers and comedians I love what they do and I also think like what more philanthropic line of work can you have than to just bring joy to people I think that's really cool and I I have a lot of admiration for the craft and so
(11:29) I'd like to do more stuff in that Arena if the comedic world will happen as of this morning both 100 million dollar offers and 100 million dollar leads are on Amazon charts so top 20 books on all Amazon we have two of them yeah we beat Harry Potter take that JK I'm kidding you're amazing and I'm a huge fan of your work I'll say American chicken and rice is like man that's why you got to go off the sword gotta go Middle Eastern style some jujit Kebab if you know you know [Music] hello hello how are you bro good man you
(12:03) need to get back in the gym I know I cleaned out a little bit the challenge for you is going to be you continuing to grow and experience and dig deeper into not becoming a repetitive like everybody in the space yeah you know exactly what I mean because you are the best right now and you take on that title it took you a while you were like a rising dude coming up from like he's gonna do it he's gonna do it he's gonna do it now you've done it and by the way when I talk to other people this is kind of a consensus it's not like I'm giving
(12:28) you some compliment no one else has told you I think you're the best right now thanks man I say right now because that's not a title that you need to keep long term you have to keep arguing and fighting for it and scratching but you're the best right now you just spent two years of your life dedicated to this book you spent six hours every day writing it and so what now more better we will do more of what we were doing before we'll do it better I do have my project uh you have one of zero that I'm working on in the background at the same
(12:59) time I still have my third book and I think a lot of a lot of people are going to make a lot of money from it which I'm very excited about and we'll you know get more companies in acquisition.com but uh I have I have two big projects that I'm working on one is the third book uh the other is is one of zero and those are kind of the two big projects that I have for the next two years

How To Win Sales Without Being Skilled (ALEX HORMOZI) - YouTube

Transcript:
(00:00) good morning everyone it is 4 30 a.m rocking in from uh downtown austin or not downtown austin suburbia austin um but i am knee-deep in creating our new phone sales training um super robust and then training for our glx class um and jim lords and so i'm i'm very very excited about how it's coming out it's one of some of our best stuff um but while i was going through it there was this one kind of way i phrased something that i really liked and i wanted to share it with you which is uh one of our one of our gyms had been really struggling with
(00:34) sales and uh he gets on the daily call every day which is why we encourage people to do it where i just coach all of our gyms one on one and he heard something which was to the to the extent of remember why you're doing this right remember why you're caring about the customer now here's where this gets really cool he uh went over whatever over 20 or something and then something switched and he went five for nine right overnight zero for 25 to five for nine right and this is the one thing that switched and this is how i want to
(01:07) share it with you he essentially the person who wins so every every sale is the same right and a sale is always made either they sell you or you sell them but who is the person who makes the sale the person who makes the sale is the person who cares the most about the buyer think about that for a second and so that's the phrasing that i'm using in the training is the person who cares the most about the buyers interests is the one who will win the sale all right like this was super profound for me and so when you're approaching the sale
(01:42) you have to come at it from the perspective of i care more about this person than this person cares about themself and this is what that gym owner was able to flip in his mind was he remembered why he was he said because i i give him the term commission breath right people can smell whether you're in it for their for your agenda or their agenda right and so if you want to win the sale you have to come at it from the perspective that i care more about your best interest than you do right you're gonna throw these things in my way but i care
(02:14) about you enough to get us through them so we can get to the promised land which is you getting help which is why you're here right and you have to expect that you're going like the sale is not going to go the way that you imagine in your head because people bring all this emotional baggage to the sale and it's a problem that's covered in shame and guilt which uh which is a great uh a great way of saying uh it's not easy to get people to to trust you to build rapport so they can actually be real with you the moment
(02:43) you're able to get someone to be real with you in the sale you've already won the sale right because at the end of the sale if for some reason they actually can't afford it which is a very very very very very very very small percentage of people then you're on the same side of the table with them and it's like cool then let's actually figure this out together but you're coming from it from a perspective that they trust that you were acting in their best interest right and so that's ultimately the sale that's that's being made is
(03:09) that the person needs to trust that you care more about their agenda than they do think about it that's the sale that's being made if they believe that you care more about them genuinely than they care about themselves or have demonstrated care about themselves then you will win and so that's why i see some of our gyms who honestly aren't the most skilled sales people but they kill it and i cause i know these guys because there's some guys who are just very process oriented they follow the [ __ ] script and they crush
(03:43) it right and that's great and i know why those people are successful because they were successful at everything but there's some people who are quote personality driven sales people and these are like the really genuinely kind-hearted caring people that you can immediately tell from their vibe that they really love fitness and really love helping people get in shape and lose weight and take control of their lives those people get away with so much lack of skill in the sale but are able to close because the people believe that they
(04:13) really are acting in their own best interest right which is why having conviction in your product is so important and so if you can simply have that one reframe before you go into the sale which is i'm going to approach this from the perspective that this person needs my help like actually though like actually getting them to like you actually believing that they need your help and that you have to have their true best interest at heart more than they do which is why if you do genuinely have that belief you're
(04:46) going to force them to confront the limiting beliefs that they had right and you'd be like listen like let me be real with you here like do you think that the reason that you haven't been successful is because like you've you've kind of just like fallen off the bandwagon like you've you've been putting the food in your mouth right so that's whose responsibility is that is that is that your busy schedules is that your husband who's whose responsibility is that right and they're like well i guess it is mine you're like right and i'm not saying
(05:14) this to be mean to you i'm saying this because i want to help but this time is going to be different right and so that way you can break these beliefs systematically throughout so you can actually help this person all right because sales is just coaching right with an outcome that's defined over a period of time and so i guess the biggest point that i want to make here is that if you can just think about it from that perspective this guy had the same script from his first you know 25 reps to the the last five of nine that he had right
(05:43) and mind you he made this realization at rep 25 which for some reason is a magical number all right but at rep 25 he realized that he just was trying to sell on his agenda and not on the agenda of the other persons and there's sometimes it's it's uh i mean one of the things that i was just talking to our sales team about is advanced salesmen are advanced because they never don't do the basics right people are defined as advanced because of their outcomes not because of their tactics all right advanced lifters aren't doing different
(06:13) tactics than novice lifters they just lift more weight and the reason they do it is they've just done it consistently longer right or they're more consistent in general they never don't do the basics they always sleep they always do the recovery mechanism they always eat the macros that they're supposed to hit right it's the same thing with business and sales like the best sales people are consistent because they never don't do the basics the tactics don't change it's just your execution of them all right and so when i look at professional
(06:39) development so this is a big zoom out but i think it's important when i when i talk to higher level you know entrepreneurs who are at like 10 million 20 million et cetera and they're like what do i need to do to you know to get to the next next thing is i see three major breaking points in professional development as an entrepreneur the first is skills right people enter the marketplace of entrepreneurship with no skills they have nothing to offer of value and so they have to go acquire skills and there's far more skills that
(07:06) you need to acquire than you think right you're like i need to be able to get customers but be able to get customers is a lot of skills put together right you have to know how to write copy you don't have to know how to create creative you have to know how to build landing pages you don't have to have to have to be able to buy and place traffic uh you don't have to know how to nurture leads to get them to show up to both schedule and shop to a sales event you have to know what type of sales event you want to have is it going to be a
(07:30) presentation is it going to be a sales call is it going to be an in-person appointment is it going to be a two-step sale like you have to know what the conversion mech is it going to be a sales page right you have to know what the conversion mechanism is going to be right and then from there you have to know the actual script and closing mechanisms it's not just the words it's how to say the words what the tonality is how you ask the questions how you confront obstacles how you overcome them how to process payments how to like that
(07:53) like this you know i mean like the the number of skills stacks in order to make it but its skills is the first block right the second block is the character traits to execute the skills right as soon as you have your first your first box of tools what separates the people who are really successful from the ones who are just moderately successful is that they have the patience the endurance the discipline right to execute their skills within a defined way and that is how they're able to consistently grow because they're
(08:25) consistently executing and so it goes from needing to acquire skills in the beginning to needing to acquire character traits which is why i love the game of entrepreneurship is that the way that you win consistently evolves right it's literally not just more it's different at every level right and then that's kind of level two is that you have to develop the character traits to be able to execute the skills and then the third is your beliefs right your beliefs about the world your beliefs about the market your belief about what's possible your
(08:54) tolerance of what is acceptable in your organization from an act a standpoint of speed a standpoint of excellence and those beliefs are top down those are from you right and so as you move move through i think it's cyclical right i think it's every level encompasses all three of those things and you kind of have to spin your way through the three of those things over and over again and the reason it gets difficult is that you still have to maintain the skills the beliefs the character traits of the base below before you can get to the
(09:28) next level where you have new beliefs new skills new character traits that need to be developed and that's why i think most people love entrepreneurship or at least hopefully you like entrepreneurship if you're in it is that it constantly forces you to grow and growth is painful right and so it's this weird masochistic desire to continue to improve and yet suffer the entire way but love the process while you're suffering so it's this kind of meta thing but anyways i won't get too deep into that big point here is that if
(09:55) you're trying to close and you're trying to get your sales team to close the person who cares the most about the buyer will win if the buyer cares more about their outcome than you do then they will win if you care more about their outcome genuinely than they do they will feel that a and b when you confront their beliefs they'll see it from a place of genuine care and they will be real with you and then when you get to the close they're not going to bring their baggage because you confronted the baggage because you did
(10:21) it from a place of care and then they will trust you in the clothes to to take them where they need to go all right so that's the big point that was the big uh that was one of the things that i'm going to be i'm putting it to ourselves training right now um hope you enjoyed this if you did drop a like or a comment if you didn't still drop a like or a comment all right anyways uh have an amazing thursday i'll catch you guys soon [Music] you

Transcript:
(00:00) big [ __ ] takes time and I had to learn that like I want you to feel that cuz it took me a long time to learn what I see happen all the time with entrepreneurs especially when they apply to acquisition. comom you know they've got a million dollars in profit maybe it's the bare minimum for for us to consider for investment and they're like here's my idea for how I an expand and how I want your help I want to start all these new product lines because I've already saturated my market because I'm spending $50,000 in Facebook ad and I can't spend
(00:23) any more than I currently am otherwise I lose the profitability of the ads so I'm going to start selling more and different offers and add massive complexity to my business business that only makes $3 million top line per year that is a mistake and in this video I'm going to walk through why and the reason this is so important is because many people hit this first plateau and then think oh I should start a new business oh I should start a new product line when really they need to confront the problem ahead which is they don't know
(00:46) how to get more customers within their current Niche or space your Market isn't capped your mindset is capped what I'm going to do is break down the three different Frameworks I used to think through this so that you are never capped in whatever Market you go after number one from from the marketing perspective you have your method which is the biggest thing you do it's running paid ads it's making content it's doing Outreach it's getting referrals it's getting Affiliates those are the methods that you do to get customers underneath
(01:12) of that you've got the platforms that you do that method on you've got Facebook you've got phones email Hulu YouTube You've Got Google ad underneath of that you've got the media on the platform so if I'm on Instagram I can go Instagram DMs I can go Instagram stories I can go Instagram posts I can go Instagram reals I have all these different media within the platform platform one level below that is how much volume am I doing within that media am I posting one story a day one story a week multiple stories a day multiple
(01:38) post today so like that chiropractor agency if there are a hundred other agencies that market to chiropractors and they're all marketing on Facebook then you could probably add up all of the ads spend of every one of those agencies together and that just gives you an idea of how much there is available in terms of numbered new clients per month that all of them together are selling just on Facebook ad rewind real quick if you're trying tock pick what Market you're going to go in I talk about this in my book $100 million
(02:03) offers there's four things I want to look at number one are they in pain am I actually solving a problem for someone number two are they easy to find cuz if I can't find them I can't sell them right number three do they have the money to spend in order to buy my thing because if I'm trying to sell to broke people it's probably not going to be a good idea number four are they growing I don't want to be selling to newspapers I want to be selling to something like old people that are there's more of them every single day that are retiring if I
(02:25) have a market that checks all four of those boxes then I know I'm at least in a good opportunity now once I have that in place and I looked at the four variables that I talked about earlier can I do a new method can I do it on a new platform can I expand to multiple types of media within the platform I'm currently on can I increase the volume that I'm currently doing in the mediums that I have these are the things you can do immediately to get more customers get more leads today let's say you've capped all of those things which is probably
(02:50) not true but let's say you did because we're going into Fantasy Land here I'm going to introduce you to what I call the Pyramid of markets there are five directions that you can go in any Marketplace to expand I'll tell you a story of when I learned this I went to this Meetup of eight entrepreneurs together we were doing $500 million a year in Revenue this was like a multi-billion doll room which is kind of cool and I was one of the smallest guys there I think I was doing 30-ish million a year at the time and they were talking
(03:16) about their businesses I was like these guys aren't smarter than me and I didn't feel like they worked any harder than me and I was like why are they making so much more money than me two main factors number one almost all of them have been in business longer than me big [ __ ] takes time and I had to learn that like I want you to feel that cuz it took me a long time to learn all right there's not many billionaires under 30 that made it themselves like 10 in the whole [ __ ] world there's not a lot of them and fact
(03:39) Checkers maybe it's 20 it's not a lot the second lesson that I learned is that all of them were going after bigger markets than I was cuz at a certain point you do saturate a niche and I'm going to give you context to what that means so gym launch was a licensing company we specifically at the time only focused on micro gyms now we do health clubs and micr jyms cuz they expanded The Market within that pie there was only 50,000 micro gyms in the United States we' already spoken with 20,000 of them we had absolutely have really
(04:04) maximized every media every channel we call call we C email C to we run ads on Google we runs on YouTube We runs on Facebook we runs on Instagram we make content like we do all the stuff and we have really done a good job building a market leading business there but again it wasn't as big as theirs and that's why we decided to open up another Avenue now let me tell you about why we decided to do health clubs so when we looked at our adjacent markets we could have gone down Market to personal trainers we could have gone upm Market to health
(04:28) clubs we could have gone to physical therapists or chiropract was actually very similar or we could have gone more narrow those are the directions we could have gone in I asked our our team one question I said of these different potential Avenues or avatars that we could pursue who do we provide the most value to by dollars made it was no contest health club Owners we are able to immediately make them like tens of thousands of dollars within the first like month by restructuring some of the things that we could do within their
(04:53) business and then doubling or tripling their bottom line by reorganizing their onboarding process reorganizing their sales process how they handle retention and how they handle upsells so if you deal with hair salons maybe you sell Consulting service you sell to salon owners that's your current market you can go in five directions number one is you can go up Market that means on the pyramid there are fewer people on the higher part of the market and they cost more but they spend more typically higher quality customers that's where
(05:19) you go into Enterprise sales we're talking franchisors as in people who have hundreds of locations under one umbrella or multilocation or chain owner that's up market for salon owners down Market the second Direction you can go is you go to hair stylist you talk about people who are running chairs and doing hair with their hands full-time not running the business there's 10 times more of them the third Direction you can go is you can go adjacent so what's something that's similar in nature but not exactly the same that would be like
(05:47) a lash and nails place if I were a chiropractor it might be Physical Therapy like they're similar but different you want similar business characteristics similar Avatar in terms of the owner similar types of customer within the same larger industry when you do that that you just open up another vertical and you attack it the same way you did your first one the fourth Direction you can go is you actually go broader now imagine a pyramid that's all the way like this and it includes all the adjacent pyramids within it which
(06:12) would then just be Beauty so that includes medspot owners lash owners massage studio like all of that kind of falls in the same psychographic they serve the same customer so that would be going broader if we wanted to really open up the net the last Direction you can go is the only one that makes your Market smaller but it doesn't necessarily mean you make less money you could become narrower instead of just being all salon owners it might be salon owners who specialize in extensions or a blo hair place you know that they just
(06:40) do the Brazilian Blowouts like they're just doing that specific thing often times when you do Niche down sometimes you can still make more money because if you're not even close to tapping the methods the platform the media or the total amount of volume you need to do to reach all of those people within that Niche and so then when you Niche down become more specific with your messaging your offer and the value delivered because if you can make this one specific Avatar 10 times more money than the broad Avatar you should absolutely
(07:05) Niche down on that and we've done this with companies and doubled or tripled or sometimes 5x the revenue in the business despite cutting down who they Market to by like 85% by getting really specific about who we serve best big picture zooming all the way back out if right now you're not getting as many leads as you want and you think that your Market is saturated because of what you do you should be looking the way an investor looks at the marketplace and says this is a $60 billion industry I have not even 1% of this industry my whole point
(07:33) here is you have your four initial levers that you can immediately pull to grow how many leads you're get it and you probably haven't even done one of them do one of them do another one of them and then eventually try and do them all usually there's this big checklist that you probably already know as an entrepreneur of what I call the should do I know I should be calling my leads faster I know I should be following up better I know I should be making more content I know I should start a Cod call thing I know I should be running ads on
(07:55) more platforms but you're not and if you're like man that's going to take a long time welcome to the main point I had originally which is it takes time to build big [ __ ]

Building a $3,500,000 Business for Two Strangers in 52 Minutes - YouTube

Transcript:
(00:00) This is Calvin and Air, a husband and wife duo that run a Thai restaurant that does $3.5 million a year and has lines out the door. But they're opening up their second location next month, and they're not ready. If they mess this up, they could lose their savings and the reputation they spent years building. I'm Alex Shamoszi. I own Acquisition.
(00:18) com, a portfolio of companies that generate hundreds of millions of dollars a year. Earlier in my career, I sold a service business for $46.2 million that help brickandmortar businesses like theirs scale. So, I'm excited to help Calvin and Air open their second location, get one-time customers back more frequently, supercharge the reviews, and a whole lot more. Hi, Alex.
(00:36) How you doing? My name is Calvin, and this is my wife, Air. Hi, welcome. We're the owners of Basil and Co Thai Cuisine in Diamond Bar. 2024, our revenue was 3.5 million. Gross profit was uh 670,000. Our net margins was 19% and served over 100,000 guests last year. First impressions, restaurants have the highest failure rate of all businesses.
(00:56) So, the fact that they're at uh you know 19% margins, I would say that's good. I would love to see if we expand it. Now, some people might hear that and be like, I thought the average restaurant margins are smaller. Yeah, they sure are. And that also doesn't mean that we need to be constrained by that.
(01:13) So, what is the goal? So, our goal is to open 20 restaurant locations in the next 5 to 10 years. And we want to bring in over $80 million in revenues. All right. And we want to get there by providing nice and comfortable space for friends and family to gather over a delicious meal. Another mission that we have personally is really is to create an environments for staff to showcase that talent and also receive competitive pay.
(01:32) How did you start the business? Maybe 15 years ago. And that is when Calvin and I met in a Thai restaurant in Santa Monica. He was a buser and I was a server. So naturally, you know, we talk right and then we talk about a big goal wanting to become an entrepreneur and own a restaurant in the future.
(01:52) Well, that plan goes so well that I end up marrying him. In 2019, we opened our first restaurant, Basu and Co in Diamond Var, California. Within the first three years, we max out our capacity. We actually leased the next unit and we able to meet the demands, but we are starting to max out again. So, a sneak peek is our AR Thai Eyer in Asus, California coming up soon. Okay.
(02:13) So, who do you serve? So we serve our local communities, businesses and families in Diamondbar. Now people who walk into the door, we see an age range between 25 to maybe 60. And we in a very situated mid to high income neighborhood. Awesome. Well, how do you make money? Let's go through the numbers.
(02:33) So our average food item is $16. Okay. Our most expensive one is $68. The Crying Tiger. Average ticket size is $60 to $80. 80 on the weekends. Takeout is 30%. Dining is 70%. And our most popular dishes would be the pat thai, patu, and drunken noodles. And we also do beer and wine, but it's only 1% of our sales. Dingle lingaling here.
(02:52) So, right off the bat, they have beer and wine. And the fact that they have 1% of sales from arguably the highest margin item that they sell, there's probably more we can find out and some uh big opportunities there. How do you get customers? How do they find out about you? So, we have organic page.
(03:08) It's about 50% of our business, we think. 1,300 reviews, 4.6 stars. Google is 460 reviews at 4.7 stars. Instagram, Facebook, word of mouth, our customers like to spread the word of mouth a lot. Paid ads, we do Yelp, $1,200 a month. We do affiliates, foodie collaborations on Instagram.
(03:28) But word of mouth is really through our server talking to our customer and when we are at the restaurant, we talk to our customer, right? And you'd say about half them come from they saw, hey, I saw Google. Yeah. My mom was here yesterday. She said, I need to come try and come try and then they say, I'm going to go tell my friend to come try. And that's why I think word of mouth is a big thing for us as well. I would say almost for food more than almost any other business, word of mouth is just huge.
(03:48) I really believe that the food sale itself. Yeah. Yeah. No, that's great. On a long enough time horizon, the product of the business is the only thing that matters. Marketing just pulls up your timeline forward. It gets more people introduced to your product faster. And so marketing can accelerate growth, but it cannot create a good business.
(04:05) And so I think this is one of the big things a lot of marketers don't understand. And this is something that took me years to figure out, which is that being good at marketing sales can absolutely make you money, but it just accelerates how quickly you decline uh if you don't actually have a good product.
(04:18) But if you take it the other natural extreme, which is that even if you had zero marketing and one person eats, but it's so good they tell five people and then those five people come and it's so good they tell five people, you can quickly get to capacity if the product is good. And that works for services, that works for SAS, that works for anything. Okay.
(04:34) So how many customers do you help? What's the sales velocity of the business? Average day we do 340 guests, two to three on the weekdays and four to 500 on the weekends. Okay. So weekends are significantly bigger. When you said the average order was $80 on the weekend, $60 during the the week. Yes. Is that off the same menu, just people are ordering more. We only have one menu. Got it.
(04:53) I would think that maybe the weekday because a lot are business. So like when they come in, they just order one plate of patai, right? That's $16. But during the weekend, it's more like a family. So it's like a bigger ticket. Mhm. What's holding you back? So, we actually have a few problem that we want to talk about.
(05:11) Like the first one first is to increase the sales during the non- peak hour. Like during the peak hour, we're good. We actually have line out the door, but during the non- peak hour, we we still find a way to better fill the house. We also want to improve on the takeout sales and also alcohol sales.
(05:28) Because we are opening our second restaurant, we really want to get Alex's help and also guidance because we open our first restaurant and we kind of like just roll with it, right? And we're just like, "Oh, it turned out great. Perfect." But now that we're thinking about scaling, we don't want to just roll with it anymore, right? The stake is higher. We're not open up with a small hole in the wall. We want to make it right at the get-go.
(05:50) So having Alex on board or guidance us, that's tremendously helpful. And then also the other reason why this is so important to me, especially with our like second venture is because I just quit my full-time job and I am going to be committed and fully focused on this restaurant.
(06:09) So increase alcohol sales, increase takeout sales, attribution for sure. I think with this business particular, it'll be more difficult to do attribution than maybe a traditional business. That's okay. I'm not I'm not as concerned about that. I'll introduce a couple things that I think might be able to help us out.
(06:21) So looking at the problems that they presented, I think number one, we can increase sales during non- peak hours by actually changing pricing during peak hours. Second, how can we increase alcohol sales? Well, that's going to be through recruiting, hiring, and training staff. I would say takeout sales and attribution I would put as kind of like the the third priority for me going into this.
(06:41) What kind of promotional offers do you run to kind of attract customers? We like to give free items instead of giving percentages off. Big fan. So, real quick, one of my big beliefs in business in general is not to give discounts. Basically, it's either full price or it's free. I'm a big fan of that, especially for food establishments. Like, you don't want to have people who become like discount seekers. Like, that's not good.
(06:58) Which I I do want to be clear. I separate from, you know, if you have a prepayment discount for services or you have some sort of incentive for someone to buy like on a sales call or within 24 hours. That I see is different than like running a promotion that's like 20% off. Not a huge fan of that.
(07:15) I'd rather give a free item and then have a clear ascension path to how I'm gonna get that person to become a full paying customer. We especially like to do that on the big holidays, Mother's Day, Valentine's Day, Christmas. So, mostly seasonal, nothing that's standing or rotating. Do you have a process in place right now for basically what recommendations your servers recommend, number one, and then number two, what things they can add on to their orders.
(07:35) No, we do not have that yet. Okay. There's going to be a really big opportunity there. Okay. Okay. And then in terms of encouraging people to come for that second visit, is there anything that you do special for first-time customers? I think we we just treat everyone the same. Uhhuh. Yeah.
(07:53) Yeah. No, no, that's okay. There's I've I have ideas. I have ideas. Yeah. No, we we don't we don't do anything special. No, you're good. You're totally fine. I know you want to increase your weekday volume, right? What have you done or tried so far? We're thinking about doing a happy hour on the weekdays. Okay. And you haven't done that yet. You just It's an idea that you have.
(08:10) No, I think what currently what we do is for the weekend like our entree for example like the the stir fry you have to order rice on the side but for the week for the weekday is actually come as a set right. So you order a stirfry let's say you order hot basil it already come with the rice. Okay so it's a search charge of rice on the weekend. Is that what you're saying? On the normal basis. Yes. Except for lunch. Lunch we do that together. Okay.
(08:29) So tell me about this new store that you guys are thinking about opening. Okay. AR is in Noa. Yeah, it's actually a little bit bigger this time. We actually have a bigger bar with bar seats. We wanted to put bar seats in this time to make sure that when the guests are waiting outside, sometimes up to an hour, that we have something to sell them at the bar.
(08:49) And also, it's it's a bit bigger, so it's about 100 seater going from a 72- seater to 100 seater. Yeah, I was curious about that because, you know, one of our big things is nail it then scale it, right? And so, I know that you guys are trying to from obviously trying to hit 80 million.
(09:05) So if you're going to try and do multiple locations, we have to make sure that the model is super dominant. Exactly. Yeah. So I I feel like on the paper seems like we're doing good. I mean like I have a complaint about it but but I know in terms like operational there are lots of thing that we can still tweak and do more and that is why we want to do this between the two concept as a test drive and then we'll take the winning model and then we'll just go from there. Got it.
(09:27) Well do you want to improve this location though the main location for now? Yes, of course. Yes. And what's the plan for the grand opening for the next one? Grand opening we actually will not want to do until like six months later. I just want to make sure that we have a 100% operating smoothly. You mean you'll soft open? We soft open. Yes.
(09:44) So we for sure will soft open. Uh but in term of ground opening, we haven't really put any package together because we think it's going to be 3 to 6 month down the line. So one of our internal mottos is nail it then scale it. And the reason for that is that a lot of times small business owners will get really aggressive and really excited and want to expand faster before they've really solidified their core model.
(10:08) Basically, it's like it might take you less time to get your second location, but it'll take you more time to get your 10th location. And so, I want to make sure that those fundamental unit economics are right. How much does it cost to open? How quickly can we get it to be profitable? How long does it take for that location to pay for itself entirely? What does our grand opening promotion look like? How do we recruit, hire, and staff a new place and get the culture to be what it needs to be? And so, these are a lot of the questions that happen, especially in a heavy staff business like restaurants
(10:31) where there's a lot of people that work under one establishment. Okay. Well, I have buckets and buckets and buckets of notes. So, I have I have lots of stuff um for you guys that I think will we'll be able to help with. I'm going to focus primarily on this location and then I'll talk kind of at the end about kind of what we can do to hopefully set up the second location to succeed. Cool.
(10:48) All right. Awesome. And uh we also bring a special gift for you, Alex. So, but wait, there's more. Yeah. Yeah. Before we get into business, we gota feed oursel first, right? It's customer. Yeah. I I rushed into the business too fast.
(11:05) We spend a lots of time thinking about what we're going to serve Alex cuz we want to make sure he love the food, right? So, well, he's, you know, like the fitness guy. He's like the training. So, we thought, okay, maybe meat is a good choice like packed with protein. So, Crying Tiger happened to be our bestseller and it's something that we really proud of. So, that is definitely is a no-brainer.
(11:24) The pineapple curry prawn, it's a little bit of a risk we want to take because it's not on the menu. It's something I I tried making at home. I loved it and I just want to see like if other people will like it. So, he is my guinea pig. And last but not least is the mango sticky rice.
(11:46) I think that is a Thai staple and we just have to showcase who we are Thai person and and that's what we want to bring to the table. So, I'm going to eat all of this and then we'll start. Thank you. M. That is great. Okay. So, what is this? Uh, river prawns. Fresh river prawns. River prawns. Fresh. I don't even know what that is. Really good. Thank you. Really good. Special dish. All right. I have to try this.
(12:10) All right. You won't be insulted if I just don't finish everything. All right. Okay. But I am going to try all this. I can see why it's doing so well. That was delicious. That was unbelievable. This obviously everything was good. That was exceptional. Mhm.
(12:27) Seeing Alex finish that red curry in two bites is like, "Oh yeah, we we might need to put that on the menu." That's why we do this. Fill my heart. Fill my heart. Oh, the river bronze were fire. Really, really good. I mean, it was obvious why the restaurant's done well, cuz the food is good. And this is just like the simplest thing in the entire world.
(12:46) And I use restaurants as a simple analogy because everybody gets it is like a lot of people obsess about all the marketing and all the sales hacks. At the end of the day, if you have good food, people will come back and tell their friends. Like that's really what it comes down to. And they focused on the thing that mattered most. I'm happy to help with all these kind of little things that can maybe improve the business model, but they had the thing that matters cuz if they had bad food, it didn't matter how many taxes I was going to give them. They were just going to get people in the door and they were going to leave and never come back. And so they'd have to become a marketing business in order
(13:10) to stay alive because their product was inferior. They don't have that problem. And so I'm stoked to see what happens. The kind of four categories. Actually, I'm going to split into five. So we've got pricing we'll talk about. Number two is the actual menu itself.
(13:22) So I'm going to ask you a bunch of questions about the menu cuz I think this is going to dramatically affect average order value. Number three is going to be training. So this is kind of the staff stuff that we're talking about. Mhm. Number four is going to be alcohol. So I'm going to split this out specifically. And then five will go to next location. Okay.
(13:38) So those are kind of going to be the big overarching topics. So what I want to do is kind of like are there ways that we can immediately potentially increase the profit of the location without dramatically changing the operations. And so there's two things that we could do. One thing that you can do, and I remember seeing this at restaurant, is that you can just add your processing fee and you just put that on your menu.
(13:58) Mhm. Which says plus 3% processing fee for credit cards. Right. And you can do 2.9, you can do 3.9, whatever you want. And then that way when they get the bill, it'll just say processing fee, whatever. And it doesn't usually affect anyone's take rate from from like what they choose to order and whatnot.
(14:15) But for you guys with a 3% increase would be like a 15% increase in profit. Mhm. From one thing. So we don't need to do that. I'm just like that's that's one one consideration you can do. Mhm. The second thing that you can do is I noticed that you were at 0 in terms of your pricing. Was there a reason for that versus doing like $16.
(14:36) 99? I felt like the 1699 or 1695 thing was kind of old school. I just want to make it simple and and clean. Well, I'll briefly push back just because the where you're at pricing wise if you were, you know, I would say higher end. I think you guys are upper middle, right? You're not like here, right? I would say yes.
(14:56) If you're serving, you know, $29 to $50 entre as the primary, then I think having 0 could make sense. Typically with luxury brands, they don't have 99. But I think that you're in a spot where I don't think it would detract from your brand to have $16.99. And the reason for that is like most people make their judgment off of that that character in terms of pricing, right? And so this though it may seem really small, if your average ticket is $16, this is 6% absolute, which for you guys is plus 30% in profit margin for the business. Mhm.
(15:25) So like if you went from 19% currently Mhm. because that's a 6% increase in total in in in average revenue that would take you to 25% margins from that which is a 30% increase in profit. So that 600 and whatever it was 670,000 in profit would be an extraund20ish 220,000 a year from one move. I don't I don't think it's going to affect your sales. That's just me personally cuz it's like we're not even changing any of the characters.
(15:53) you're already kind of like paying the the fee of being at $16. I don't think anyone buys 16 doesn't buy $16.99. That's just my opinion. Yeah. So, this is a monster moment. It's like, yeah, one change that probably has no effect on your sales velocity could have a dramatic effect on your profitability as a business.
(16:12) When we're talking 20 bucks, 10 bucks, like this is a high volume business. Those tiny little dimes and nickels and pennies, they add up in a huge way. And like I said at the beginning, restaurants are notorious for having small margins. If we could have a 30% lift from one tiny change in terms of reprinting the menu, we should do that. Let's just use simple math.
(16:33) If every person who walked into their restaurant last year only bought two items, that would be $2 extra person. They served a h 100,000 customers last year. That would be $200,000 dropped to the bottom line. I've never thought about, okay, if I just add 99 cents, how much would it translate into like the percentage of sales increase? It just like the light bulb is just like pop and I was just like we're doing it.
(16:57) The next one is because you have you're turning people away on weekends, right? Yeah. Yeah. Have you considered having weekend pricing Saturdays and Sundays or Fridays and Saturdays, the menu that you hand them is different. So you've got weekend menus and then you've got weekday menus. And so then the weekend menu can add $2 per dish. It's the search pricing fundamentally. It's just like Uber.
(17:15) Like if it's if it's really busy, they charge more. If it's less busy, they charge less. And so I'd rather you just add it on the days that you have it and they won't even feel like it's being added. You're just you're just giving them the the weekend menu, right? It's just like different places have like a lunch menu and a dinner menu. The dinner menu is more expensive than lunch menu. No one's offended by that. It's just kind of a standard practice.
(17:35) How does that feel? Worth considering. Uh but but you know be scary to do all three at the same time. Yeah. No, no. I I don't think you necessarily should, but I want I didn't particularly like this one the most. I've thought about it, but I think it just we never actually had that percentage breakdown and how much is going to increase.
(17:53) So, we didn't see like the whole picture and how it will impact profitability. I think this one actually reenter%. Well, this one definitely resonate with me the most in term of processing. Yeah, I if you don't like it, don't worry about it. This is why I leave these out and it's a lot about you and how you feel. It's your business, right? And so, if this feels light to you, you're like, I think we could just, you know, we literally the cost of this is reprinting the menu.
(18:12) Mhm. That's it, right? So, check this out. So, this is the $100 million scaling road map and they are at stage five product size. So, they've got probably 20-ish people who work for them. And if we look at the constraints of the business for them, let's look at the things that I'm I'm I'm talking about them with.
(18:31) Most of the scaling road map I tailor more to service based businesses. And the reason for that is because 78% of businesses are services. And so, I tend to skew in my language about that, but the actual things that are happening are the same, right? And so a CS playbook to onboard, all of that is going to be around how are we getting customers this consistent experience.
(18:49) We talk heavily about training, right? Connecting CS to product, that's getting feedback loops based on what people are eating and what they want. Like spinning that, make something new to sell them. I mean, they functionally had alcohol, but they weren't selling it. So now we're pushing that a little bit stronger. And from a finance perspective, like we need to get better at their finances, which is why a lot of the improvements that I had were very pricing ccentric probably because they didn't have good enough financials to be able to see, oh wow, when we sell this, you know, this
(19:14) product, we're almost breaking even, but when we sell these ones, we make a ton. They didn't have that kind of information, which would have helped them reconfigure their menu to be the most profitable menu possible that also brings customers back. And if you're like, man, that would be useful to know what stage of scaling I'm at.
(19:31) All you have to do is go to acquisition.com/roadmap, put in your business information, and we have this little automated thingy that will tell you what stage you're at, what problems you're facing, and most importantly, how to solve them. And if you want my team to take a look at the business and uh, you know, reaffirm those things or you'd like to come out uh to our headquarters in Vegas and potentially be on the Cash Cash Show, on the thank you page, you can schedule a call and we'd love to help you out. So, the next thing that um that we'll we'll go over is the actual
(19:54) menu itself. So, with the menu, how did you think about laying out what they get when you know when they open up the menu at your at your establishment? The way I thought of the design of the menu is the way the customers think when they sit down. Sure. Okay. Cool.
(20:11) Which is order a drink, order an appetizer, and then afterwards focus on like the big piece and then the small complimenting piece to go with it. So like I would like drinks, appetizers, specials. Okay. Like the big entre and then carbs at the end. Okay. Mhm. Okay. So on the menu, do you have highlighted boxes for the key the key items? I think we have a section for the specials. Yes. And then a special section for our dessert, I believe. Yes.
(20:34) Yeah, we have special like special section highlighted. Yeah. Um we are working on an updated menu right now. And what we did is like when we laid it fried rice, we will highlight what we want to sell. Yeah. Good. Yeah. So, so there's two components to it. So, let's say you've got your sides, you've got your your appetizers, you got your carbs, whatever.
(20:51) Within each of those boxes, number one is I would rate I would rank them from gross profit top to bottom. So, which of these is the most profitable? We'll put that first cuz that's the first thing people are going to consider.
(21:04) And then the second thing is I would have your highlight box, which is the um and I put at the bottom of the menu like if this is your first time visiting, this is the one you can't miss. Right. That way it's like that way people cuz no one wants to make the decisions fundamentally. What's good, right? What's good? Exactly. So that way if you have each of the highest grow gross profit margin things that also happen to be the things that most people love and those should be the same ideally that we we want to make sure that it's really clear and it's prominent on on the on on the menu per box that they're
(21:27) kind of working through. So any kind of business that has a menu and the term having a menu comes from restaurants because many people have eaten at restaurants but you go to a mechanic shop there's a menu right and so in general I like having a couple things to be true about my menus. One is that I prefer to start at the highest prices.
(21:46) And the reason for that is because it anchors and they've done research studies on this in terms of how they lay out like wine menus. If you put the most expensive on the top, it anchors the remaining prices underneath of it. And so number one, I like having higher prices higher. Number two, I like higher gross profit margins because two things could be $16, but one of them might cost the restaurant $6, one of them might cost them $1.
(22:03) And remember that 99 cents that we added added 30% to the profit of the business if executed no sales velocity drops. So, us having just get more people to buy a thing that has $2 or three more dollars of profit can make an enormous difference to this business. The third piece that I that I want to hit on is what's the stuff that that brings people back. Like, what's the stuff that's so good that they're like, "God, I have this again.
(22:22) " And so, balancing those three priorities is how I think through laying out a menu, whether it's a services business or it's a restaurant. So, the next thing that I have for you, this is just menu. We're going to get into training stuff in a second with like how do we increase alcohol sales and things like that.
(22:38) But what I want to do is increase the likelihood that people are already thinking about it, right? And so there's two things that I want I want to think about. Number one is with each of the dishes you could put underneath of it pairs well with Mhm. what drink this would go well with. And if they're reading it, they're they're going to be thinking, "Oh, well, they're saying it goes well with this.
(22:54) " You will get more than 1% of people to buy alcohol just from just adding what it they just look at the menu, right? Yeah, I love that idea. I love that. Yeah. And this is all profit, right? Pairs with Does that make sense? Okay. So, this may be a wink wink from my next book that's coming out, but there are a number of ways that you can make a customer more valuable. There are eight of them.
(23:14) One of them is a cross-ell, which is, do you want fries with that? For them, it's going to be, do you want an alcoholic beverage with that? And so, what I want to do is make it as easy as possible for the customer to say yes, and I want to make it easy as possible for the staff to not forget. And so both of the tactics that I'm going to lay out for them are going to mirror those things.
(23:33) How to make it easy for the customer, remind them to do this thing. And the thing is is they're getting 1% of their sales from alcohol, which is super high margin, right? So if we can get that from like 1% to 6%. So just adding 5% to the business in terms of total revenue from this very high gross profit product line, then again, we have another 25% increase in profitability.
(23:50) And that's just going from 1 to 6%. If you flip the table from no one's getting an alcoholic beverage to every person buys one, the profit of that table jumps through the roof. And so we only need like one out of 10 tables to do that. We always thought that the alcohol should be better than it is. And and would be a huge opportunity if we could improve it.
(24:07) And I mean, we see industry standards being like 5 to 15%, maybe even 20, right? And we're at less than one. So that's a really big weak point right there. Do you have specials in terms of drinks? No. Okay. So, I would recommend having one special that's a drink.
(24:28) So, just say like, "Hey, we also just freshly made a Thai mint, my Thai, whatever, you know, whatever whatever cocktail you want. It's made fresh here on staff. It's super refreshing for the summer or whatever months, you know, make it seasonal for, you know, whatever whatever time it is." And that way, some people were coming back, it's like, "Oh, that sounds good." Like, all we want is like, "That sounds good." And then it's like, "Great, we have the purchase." So, I would include that as the first thing.
(24:45) So, basically, there's have, "Hey, before we get into drinks, can I say the drink special?" We make one every week and we spend a lot of time. We taste test a bunch in the back and we come up with the best one and it's freshly made here blah blah blah blah blah. And I think people would really like that.
(24:59) So rotating one drink special. There we go. So tell me about the actual tabletop. Do you have anything on the table at all? Do you have like one of those little A-frames or one of those spread open? You know what I'm talking about? Like where they the table? Yeah. You don't do that. Okay.
(25:15) Okay. Is that too below where you want to be in terms of vibe of the dining? Um, I'm okay with putting it. Okay. Especially if it's like, you know, a special. Yeah. Yeah. Like something that we want to do. So, I would probably do that because people like the visual. So, I probably So, that's a difference. Right now, right, customers sit down, we bring our menu.
(25:33) So, we have like a menu and like a special menu. So, the special menu have like all the picture and a recommendation. A menu is just, you know, like the list of item with ingredients, but it's not left on the table. So when you say like having like a little kind of like a placement or it's kind of like there in their face while also I'm thinking about the servers right like how can we help them do their job easier and so if they can just point and then the visuals right there and they can see it I think that's pretty compelling right and I think the way that you make that look is what will
(26:03) determine whether it looks cheap or whether it looks nice obviously I wouldn't go lots of neon colors with the tropical background like that would probably not be the right so you know keep the the look and feel of it upscale but You still want to have the really nice elegant descriptor underneath of, you know, once a week the entire team tries, you know, five different drinks.
(26:21) We pick the best one and then that's what we decide as as a team to offer for the week. Cuz if we can get the team bought in on it, they're like, oh my god, it was so good. Like, you guys should you guys should try it. At first, we're like, huh, we don't should we do it? Should we not do it? Don't we don't want to be like kind of like a a fast food joint? That's why deter us.
(26:37) But then the fact that he say well it's depend you can decide in a way that is nice presentable and high class like yes we can do it how come I don't think about that before we really are doing something very similar we have like wine or specials menu that we give out with the menus but the table tent is it stays on the table so no one's ever going to forget it's always there.
(27:04) Are you talking about like maybe just one item special one item or is it like maybe like a few item on the me personally just one I want I want to draw Yeah, exactly. For me, this is me as a consumer now talking when I see like 10 things that just is like another menu, right? I want to draw attention to one specific thing really clear image you know the benefit is underneath and then they draw my attention to it and to me that's really good. Now the back of it we're going to save for some review stuff. So, I'll get to that in a second.
(27:27) On table one item special. Okay. We good on this so far? All right. Good. So, let's talk about getting people to come back, right? So, we want to have a way to identify who the new customers are.
(27:48) Like, hey, it's your first time dining with us, right? Is there something that we can do to identify to everybody else that like if someone says yes to that, can we put like just, you know, a drink coaster on their table that's a certain color or a napkin that's a certain color, whatever. But the reason it's so important is because then the whole staff knows, hey, these are first timers, right? And so obviously you want to give everyone a great experience, but just knowing it's someone's first time helps, right? And so one is identify first timers and I would give them some sort of surprise free thing at the end since it's their first time. So that's if they have you know a dessert or something
(28:20) like that whatever the you know whatever the cheapest dessert is. Yeah. Something that would be but uh people remember things something called peak end bias and so people remember things two key moments of every experience. They remember the peak emotional experience and they remember how things ended. Yeah.
(28:38) And so if we can just really make that ending really nice, I think that would be something like um surprise Mhm. um dessert for first timers. And what I would want to do is then give coupon of some sort. And the way that you can do this, if you want to do it classy, is that you have the manager put their card and and then write free dessert on the back and then hand it to them.
(29:02) Okay? It's way better than a coupon, right? because then it feels like it's a personalized gift, right? And so you say, "Hey, next time you come in, just bring this and I'll have another dessert for you in the house." And so now it's like we're creating that loop. We want to bring them back in. Does that make sense? Does that feel okay? All right. So these are This is for first timer. Okay.
(29:22) For existing customers, I think you can offer the free dessert in exchange for reviews. Now, I know you guys do something like that now. Correct. We have done Yeah, we have done it. We've done it before. I'm a huge fan of the free drink/free dessert for for review. And the time that I found it to be most effective is really at point of sale. So basically when they get the check. Now I have a couple ways of doing this.
(29:44) So I want you to tell me which one feels just kind of like I said the pricing thing earlier. I'm going to give you two or three different ways of doing this and you tell me the one that feels better for you. Okay? So the first way is hey if you guys want I can take care of one of the drinks if you're just willing to leave us a review.
(29:57) It would mean it would mean the world to us. We're a small family-owned business. And if they do that, then you say, "Cool, let me take the check back. I'll take it off and I'll come back with it." Mhm. And so then it's like, great, every one of these and it's at the point of sale. So you want to give the discount now.
(30:10) The whole idea of like your next if you leave a review next time you'll get it's like no one cares, right? They'll they'll just pay. No one gives. So it's like it has to be immediate. So that's that's the that's the first version. So free for review is thing one. Okay, that's the first version.
(30:28) The second version of this is when the check gets delivered, the manager comes after when it's sitting there or whatever before it it gets scooped up and says, "Hey, by the way, um you know, your server's name was Judy and just you know, Judy gets a small bonus if she gets over, you know, 10 10 five star reviews in a month.
(30:47) " That way it's like we're doing it for Judy, not doing so then you don't have to give anything away for free, but then you kind of just have the reciprocity of if Judy did a good job, you know, you can give her a $50, you know, thing. Uh, so this is the manager ask. Those are probably my two favorite ways of doing it.
(31:07) So either the immediate one in exchange for something or hey, can you do it because of my because of the staff that you liked, right? Either one of those feel better to you. The first one you like the first better. Okay. And that's what we kind of do from time to time, but we're not consistent. Yeah. So that'll get into training, which we'll get into in a second.
(31:20) But because of the business that you're in more than anything else, it's so reviews driven, like online reviews. You know, if you took your reviews from, you know, 1300 reviews to 13,000 reviews, the amount of, you know, people that are coming through the door and like all we have to do, you serve 100,000 people this last year or total. Just last year. Yeah.
(31:38) So if we got 10% of people to leave a review, it would I mean it would change things for the business. It would be. And so it's like do we think one and and the thing is is you have multiple people at the table. Yeah. And so where this gets kind of interesting, hear me out, is that you could say, hey, if you each leave a review, then I can get all your drinks and in one table we can get five reviews, right? And so mind you, you don't have to do this forever. It's just a and this is obviously thinking about the next location, too. Would I be
(32:01) willing to give up the cost of a drink in order to get a review? For sure. Not even wouldn't even think about it. Right. And so Right. And so that's that's you're willing to make the trade. And the thing is it's because it's on the check right now. They're like, "Sure, I like this place. This was great. I'll save five bucks. Whatever.
(32:17) I would have I would have done it for free." Except they wouldn't have. But right, but like that little incentive helps out. So for brick-andmortar services or restaurants, just local mainstream businesses, the vast majority of people make their decisions by searching online before they go. I mean, when you're about to go to a restaurant, what do you look at? You you just look on Yelp, you look on GrubHub, whatever.
(32:35) and that you see the reviews. And so, I don't know about you, if I'm like looking at a dessert place and it's got three and a half stars, I'm not going. I'm not going to go. I'll just go to one that has four and a half stars.
(32:48) Like, why would I risk it? People only go out certain amount of times per month and they're not going to blow their one time out on a three and a half star place. They're just not going to do it. And so, we need to boost the hell out of that so that not only do we have good reviews, but we have a ton of them. And so, let me give you a different example. So, let's say that you've got one place that has 50
(33:06) fivestar reviews and it's a 5.0. And there's another restaurant that's 13,000 and it's a 4.7 where you going 4.7 13,000 no question because you know this is a business like 13,000 reviews like holy cow like this place must this is probably iconic this is probably a destination which if you're a small business owner what higher praise could you want so when I read the review it's it's really is give us just not comfort but also encouragement right and if I feel it I am sure anyone who come on I page read that review would feel the same way.
(33:37) So to me that that it's important is how we communicate with our guests. I was thinking about a way to increase the average order value, right? And so in the e-commerce world, it's like you get free gifts over a certain amount of spend or you get free shipping. I'm trying to think of a way that we could tastefully do that within this business, which is like it'd probably be better for takeout than I think in dining, which is like at $50 or at $100, wherever, you know, if if the vast majority set at 60, right? $60, whatever it is. It's like, then we want to put the free gift at like 75 or 80. And so maybe on weekends you make it
(34:05) 100, on the weekdays you make it you make it 80. So you just push that extra $20. It's like, hey, just so you know, you get an extra full whatever I just had um for orders over $80. Mhm. And I think that'll nudge a decent amount of people. Just put it right above where they're currently at and it's like you get a full another order on top.
(34:25) And you guys have good gross margins on the food because I just want to I just want to bump it up. And you saw with the the 99 cent thing, yeah, a dollar or two in this business makes all the difference in the world. And so this is basically an AOV, so average order value increase with break points above current average uh threshold.
(34:49) And for this like this particular one, do you foresee it doing as like part of our business going forward or is it supposed to be kind of like tied to special event or like certain time of the year? So, the reason I said takeout is because if you're on the phone or something like that or if it's on an order page online, it doesn't feel weird to me.
(35:05) Like, because we have to think about the obviously the servers, right? Like they can only remember so many things. Yeah. Yeah. This is actually lots of information, too. Oh, sure. Yeah. Yeah. But because but because what we're going to think about this is from the from the experience of the guest, right? So, they're going to come in. Are you new? Yes. Great. Cool. So, they know if they're new or not. Then they're going to say, you know, can I tell you about the drink special? Yes.
(35:24) Then they walk them through the drink special and then we get way more people to do it. People are also going to ask questions because it says it pairs well with You're right. Right. And so a lot of people are going to ask questions about that and then you're going to get more upsells which they're going to want cuz their tips are going to go up.
(35:35) So they're going to want to sell the offer. Right. So they have an incentive to learn that stuff and then basically from that point there's really nothing different except at the very end they're going to do this. So there's not a huge amount that we're really we just have to know are they first time customer? Mhm.
(35:47) We're going to make sure we do the drink special. Mhm. And then at the end we're doing those three things. Yep. Mhm. That's it. So as much I know we talked about a lot but in terms of what they have to do it's not too much reduce this down to this we will worry about adding more work to our worker right but then the way that Alex told us today it's not adding more work it's just adding pure profit so simple solution simple solution and we were complicating the whole thing and not able to get past our own thoughts so one out of three strategies actually succeed in a business and that's a McKenzie
(36:18) study that they did and some businesses have two out of three strategies succeed and the big difference is culture which is the reward and punishment that exists within a business which is fundamentally like how do people behave how do people do stuff and so this is a peopleheavy business and so I wanted to not just give them a bunch of you know here's all the stuff that you can do but I wanted to translate that into real world how are you going to get your staff to do it right because if if they don't ask people what beverage they want or ask
(36:44) them if they want to get dessert very simple lines but if they don't do it it's a huge cost to the business and so we had to make sure that they would went home with clear items of like this is how I'm gonna train the staff and make sure that they do this every time. Otherwise, this is just a lot of fun entertainment, but nothing's going to happen to the business.
(37:01) Do you think we could change this coupon card to sign up for our loyalty program, you get a few free Mango sticky rice on your next visit? Oh, but you said you like the physical card. I like the physical card a ton and if you're like, "Hey, if you're worried about uh losing this, just take a picture of it and just show it to me on your phone when you come back.
(37:19) " That way that people can bring it. And what if what if they they share it and people who came got the picture of the back of the card like so they brought new customers in. Oh no, right. So it's okay. So you can have them take the picture of it and be like, "Hey, if you don't if you feel like you're going to wash your jeans and it's going to get, you know, torn to shreds, you can take a picture of it, too." That way you have it. It's a little thing.
(37:40) The only reason I hesitate with the loyalty thing is just like how many people are actually part of loyalty programs for restaurants? Restaurants? I'm not sure, but cafes is normal, right? Yeah. No. No. Oh, so they have like the punch card and they have all that stuff because you said you wanted to be more on the upscale side.
(37:55) I have a whole thing on loyalty programs. I didn't get into it because it I didn't know I didn't feel like it was necessarily the the best feel. I can talk about it and then you guys can decide. Mhm. So, I know you guys right now you do three if they on their third one they get they get free sticky rice, right? When they come back if they do that they on their birthdays they get free sticky rice.
(38:12) Probably every 200 spin they get a free Tai tea. We can bump that up if we So, I think you'd have to sell me on the the the benefit of the loyalty program and I would I probably would even I just hate the like I all I think of when I think loyalty program is someone's just going to spam text me all the time and so I never right and so for me the loyalty program would be like you get three things is out on your birthdays we're going to send you free stuff we're just going to give you a coupon for coming in when you're here you get uh your first alcoholic drinks free or something like that you know cuz if one
(38:43) has one sometimes they're more likely to have second, right? One per table or per party. And then number three, when we have a weight, which you do on weekends, we prioritize you, right? Now, for me, that third one alone would be enough of a reason. So, I like that. I mean, I think a lot of people would join for that for for that benefit alone.
(39:01) So, I'll put F. I'll let you guys work the specific details of what you want in there because also when they fill that out, you can also get what their lead source was like, how'd you hear about us, etc. Big picture, I am split on loyalty programs in general. main reason the food is the loyalty program.
(39:18) Your food's good, they're gonna come back, right? And they're gonna tell their friends. And so other businesses, I think loyalty programs can make a much bigger difference. Like if you have a med spa or something like loyalty program is like the business, right? But for them, I was just thinking through, okay, well, if this clearly meant a lot to them cuz they brought it up a couple times and so I wanted to give them something if I were to do it, this is how I'd approach it.
(39:36) And these are just based on things that I've seen work across industries. So running starts, which is where you have, let's say you have 10 punches. If you give people two or three punches on their first go, they're like they feel like they got free stuff. But it's really like you just make the amount of punches that you need to do free and you just give them that start ahead of time.
(39:53) They they've already proven this from uh from a bunch of studies that running starts are like two or three times more likely to actually finish out their punches than people who had the same amount of punches remaining on a shorter punch card. And so it's like, well, if you're going to do it, do that obviously.
(40:11) But beyond that, I think through the same value drivers that I mentioned in the offers book over and over and over again. So this is page 56 of the offers book. Um, check this out. So whenever I'm trying to improve any product or service, I always think through the same value vectors, which is what do I want to have happen? How do I make it less risky? How do I make it faster? How do I make it easier? Those are the value vectors.
(40:35) And so I'm thinking as a restaurant, I'm like, how do I make it faster? And as soon as I was thinking through it, I was like, "Okay, well, you know, trying to say that they're going to get their food first when they walk in, like when they walk in the door, that's probably not going to be realistic." Like the cook takes a certain amount of time, and some people don't want to be rushed to dinner.
(40:47) So, like, in that instance, speed is probably not the right variable, right? But waiting in line and being able to have first access, okay, well, we can make that part faster given the fact that they already have more demand. So, I'm like, okay, well, that that's a good one. The decreasing the perceived likelihood, the the risk factor, that's what all the reviews are for, right? you know, how do we, you know, decrease effort and sacrifice? Well, we're going to make it really easy for them to buy the alcohol because it's going to be right in front of them, and we're going to pair it with the food that we think
(41:12) would pair best with the specific drink. So, they don't have to think, I'm not sure, like again, this friction. I'm not sure which beverage to have. Boom. It's already solved, right? I'm just trying to remove friction from a lot of the parts of the process. And if someone's willing to pay more or get some sort of benefit for giving us their information, then we'll happily pass those things on as a reason to do it. Good on this. Yes. Don't worry. I know you'll be able to watch the episode so you'll have it. Can
(41:35) we take that paper back as a souvenir you? Yeah, of course. So now we're talking about we're going to talk about team and operations. Okay. Okay. So this is the training. What we really need to train them on is kind of the upsell process. Number one, they have the greeting.
(41:52) And so when I think about training people, you want to think of it as almost like skits because whenever you teach something, you have a condition, you have something that happens, and then you have a behavior. So when this, then that, right? So it's a rule. If this happens, then you do this. And so each of these are basically behavior rules. And so it's like, we're only going to teach you four rules. And the first one is that when someone comes in, you ask if it's their first time.
(42:09) If they say yes, you take this thing out of your pocket, you put it on the table. Now everybody knows. Mhm. That's thing one. Let's practice. And you sit down on the table and you go back and forth. And the next person comes up and you drill it with them. Next person goes up, you drill with them.
(42:21) And you just keep going through. Do it for an hour. They'll have 20 reps in an hour of just doing skit one. Tomorrow we'll do skit two. And that training just gets so ingrained if you do that on a regular basis for the I'm sure before the shift starts they have a 30-minute little pow or 20-minute pow. You just do this. And so you have the greeting for first-time customers. Mhm.
(42:41) The second is going to be the beverage which is we're going to be practicing getting the alcohol upsell. So let me tell you about our our one beverage of the week. So in the back we you know try out every week we get together and we try out five different cocktails. And the one that we say is our our favorite is what we make for the week. And so it's made fresh home here. We did it just a couple hours ago.
(42:59) It's, you know, it's freshly squeezed mint, blah blah blah. Um, and a lot of people love it. Would you like one of those? That's it. That's all we do. And then the next person goes up and you say, "Do it again." Right? And so you want them to get five 10 repetitions per practice session. And so it's it's that way you can hold them accountable to because if you do this on a regular basis, they'll do it.
(43:17) Then we have the pairings which is when people are ordering their mains just reminding them that it go that goes really well with would you like a lot of people like it with and just doing that little reminder. So it's going to be sides plus alcohol.
(43:34) So with every one of these dishes I mean there's a reason McDonald's has do you want fries with that? Do you want to superers size your meal? Do like each one of like it's two two three questions after every time somebody says they want this thing. So yes I want I want the pad thai. Awesome. Do you want to have extra noodles on the side? A lot of people do. No. Okay. Uh, it pairs really well with this.
(43:52) Do you want to go ahead and take one of those? And even the way I'm saying it, like, do you want to go ahead and take one of those? I'm telling them to say yes by how I'm asking the question. A lot of people do that. You want to go ahead and do one of those? They're like, uh, okay. You know, uh, I'll do it. And so, we just want to practice that.
(44:09) So, the the practice piece would be I order and then you ask me question one, question two. An experienced salesperson will know those tiny little nudges. And in a rapid sales conversation, which is what a waiter or waitress has to have, let's say you have a table of five people, you're going to have five sales interactions.
(44:28) And so we're talking like one sentence or one phrase that we're adding on per kind of exchange back and forth. And so we just have to get the team to practice those little nudges, which is like, would you rather have chocolate or vanilla? I like chocolate, right? Or most people like chocolate. Or that's what a lot of people do here.
(44:41) And this matters more especially with first-time customers because they're like, I don't know how it works here. And so then you're like, well, this is how it works. This is what most people do. This is this is what get maximizes your experience while you're here at this restaurant. And so what we're doing functionally from a value perspective is we're paying down risk.
(44:54) We're increasing the perceived life of achievement. We're saying, you want to have this amazing experience, I'm going to help you have the best experience by just helping you navigate this menu and ordering process to get the best stuff. And I'm incentivized to do that because I want you to have a good experience. So you tip me well.
(45:08) For every alcoholic beverage, what what do you charge for the drinks right now? Uh it's pretty affordable. I think we're at like $6 or $7. Super affordable. So they're going to get about a dollar at it. So it's like when you're looking at the table, just think every question you ask, you have a dollar just sitting there and you have five people at the table and you've got $2 each one of them. That's just right there. Yeah.
(45:27) And so, okay, you get three of them. Great. You just got $3 from from just taking orders. I would translate it into what it means for them. Does that make sense? Yeah. Okay. From a team perspective, I would put a little a little leaderboard in the back for the server that had got the most alcoholic beverage sales and then you can give them 50 bucks or 100, whatever.
(45:45) Or maybe they just get priority to pick what uh schedule they want for the the next month. Okay, just little things like that I think work really really well. So the last step is review slash comeback offer. So if it's a first-time customer, they're going to get the comeback offer. If it's any other customer, it's going to be the review offer. Gotcha.
(46:05) SLloy if you want to if you want to do your your loyalty offer and that's why we set this up so that we can do this and if they forget they can look down at the table and remember what napkin they put there right that's why we do this right we this is how we make a little system out of it does that make sense you feel like they can do this yes I want to do it so I think if we just do these things that we just outlined there's a lot of points but not I think it's doable is kind of my point right like we just kind of went through almost most of the things that they have to handle the rest of it is menu you know moving the menu stuff around adding the
(46:34) 99 to the price like very small things that could be big differences to the business. So, the last thing we'll do is I'll cover the next location and then we'll wrap it up as one list and we'll prioritize it. Cool. Cool. Okay. I think when you do your pre-opening, what I would do is I would do an influencer night. And so, you make it a VIP event.
(46:53) they can videotape it and they could share it to their stories and that you can give them the promotional offer of the free dessert, the free sticky rice or free drink, whatever that uh you could trace back to them. And I think that would be a great first launch and then you can also use all of their creative that's the deal for getting the the VIP experience.
(47:16) So, it's like you get all these influencers and they make these little videos about your about your restaurant and then you can basically run an ad after the fact and people recognize them because they're influencers but they're talking about your restaurant. Mhm. All right. So, check this out. So, what I'm talking about is affiliates and partners. All right. And so, the big key here and is an affiliate is a lead getter. They're an independent business that tells their audience to buy your stuff.
(47:36) And so, if we're going to have a full night, right, we don't just want any kind of customer in the door. We want customers that can bring us boatloads of customers. Like their normal business is one customer tells two or three people and then those people come in. But the value of an influencer or somebody who's a local celebrity or local influencer who who runs a forum or whatever it is locally or they're just another local business owner that has exposure to many other people who are walking in their shop, their auto shop every single day, then you invite them out and they can then tell a hundred people on your behalf. And so it's simply that it just gives
(48:04) you a lot more leverage and you're willing to make a little bit of a trade. And so you might do it for free, you might do it at cost. You might give them half off because it's pre-opening in exchange for them, you know, videotaping it or making a post or something like that. Those types of things are great ways to kind of launch the word of mouth from the people who have the biggest megaphones.
(48:22) So number one thing we're going to do is we're going to do plus 99 on entre. Number two is we're going to reorder menu in order of profit. Three, you're going to add pairings alcohol with entree. Okay. Number four, drink special with table top pick. All right. So, we're going to do first timers training. Mhm. Which is napkin plus comeback offer.
(48:55) And then for returning customers, we're going to do manager card for VIP. uh treatment and then seven you're going to have daily training on five scenarios doable. Yes. Okay. So, let me show you how this actually adds up though. So, if we see no change in sales just by adding the 99 cents, we get plus 30% of profit from this.
(49:25) Now, reordering the menu could actually have a really dramatic effect cuz if we just got a higher percentage of people to just buy the things that have the highest margin, M that can have a really big effect on the bottom line because they're buying the stuff that costs the least, right? That has the most markup. And so this I would estimate might be somewhere in the neighborhood of like 10 to 20%.
(49:42) If this um succeeds, this one I feel really good about. This obviously is going to be huge for you. Yes. I mean, this could be somewhere in the neighborhood of like 40% plus um increases. Like this is really big. Mhm. Both of these together. First timer training.
(50:00) I think this is going to be more important for the second location because you need you're already you're already at relatively full right now. So getting people to come back, I think it's going to be really important for the for the second location. But this might also help with some of the weekday, right? Because if you just get more people to come back, especially if they come during the weekdays, then those are the ones we really want to incentivize because it's like we'll come back again during Tuesday, right? So this might be some I would probably estimate this might give you like a and again 10 doesn't sound like a lot but it's 300 400,000 a year
(50:24) you know what I mean given your revenue. So it's not it's not nothing right manager card. This is going to be reviews you know I would bet this is probably a 20% lift somewhere in that neighborhood. And then this is just going to be overall the execution. But these are the three that I think will really move the needle the most and you don't have to do a lot to to implement them.
(50:49) How's that? I can do it over the weekend and be That's my favorite kind of implementation, right? Yeah. Fat, fast, and easy is where slow and harsh. Oh, yeah. No, this is easy. I can like just crank it out tonight and then print it out tomorrow. Good. How do you feel about this whole plan? Great. Doable and it's going to make a big difference. Yeah. Very great. Okay.
(51:05) Well, you know what we have to do now is we have to hug and then I have to finish your food. I never thought I would do something like this. Super nervous. When he's like, "Are you going to go on the filming?" I'm like, "Nope, not doing it." scared to death. But I'm glad that I actually get out of that mindset and choose to do it because I found a lots of not just a helpful tip, but also I feel like I received support and guidance which is really important and I'm I'm so glad that I made decision to be here. Really happy to be here. Um made me feel a lot more comfortable with
(51:36) learning how to scale better and trying to do it the right way the first time. So Calvin and seem like amazing people. Incredibly humble, very hardworking. I love the immigrant story obviously and it seems like they actually have a very good restaurant and so I'm very excited to see them implement some of these changes and potentially dramatically uh enhance the profitability of the business to hopefully set up their expansion strategy so that they can go on and dominate and the entire world can have lots of amazing Thai food. And speaking of alcohol stuff, since that's what this uh restaurant was all about,
(52:05) we actually have a bar consultant that we had a B2B business in services that we did a full breakdown on. So if you like this, you'll love

Transcript:
(00:00) so if you need money that's number one easiest thing to do and so what i wanted to cover today was i was calling cash flows oxygen how to get some um but this is actually part of a larger discussion um that i'm half targeting towards my coaches um and half y'all can just join in on what i would be talking to them about and so um one of the skills that a coach has to have and if you are coaching yourself you are the coach you're the master of your own domain you're the coach of your own business right and you have to coach
(00:30) you better than anyone else can right that's good to have outside counsel that's what we have coaching that's why i get coaching but you have to be your own coach because you're the one who's going to be making the decisions for your business more than anyone else right and so oftentimes when i am on the phone with a business owner i am listening for the majority of the time of that call and i'm looking for certain things and so some of you may have heard of a swot analysis right strength weaknesses opportunities and threats
(00:56) more commonly now in mba schools they've actually reversed that and they called an atsu and what that means is opportunities threats are disproportionately um weighted as far more important and then then you have strengths and weaknesses and so the reason that i'm saying this is that most times when i'm listening to a client who's saying i'm struggling i'm having an issue where i'm at a bottleneck it doesn't necessarily need to be that they're losing money but just like i can't get past this point what's the issue
(01:25) i'm going to be looking for cash flow opportunities that are sitting on the ground and massive threats those are the two things i'm looking for in the beginning once those boxes check off then we go down to strengths and weaknesses for example if someone is bleeding cash i'm not going to tell them to to to fix their culture right fixing their culture is something that they absolutely need to do but it's not going to be the thing that's going to save their business tomorrow right they need money and so like it's one of the things that drives
(01:55) me nuts because it's not prioritizing the actions according to the to how important they are right and so an example of this i mean i just use the culture example but let me look at another one here's a more relevant one retention right and believe me i'm like the king of making sure that you're doing a good job to your customers right but if your retention is [ __ ] right it's absolute [ __ ] um that's if you need to make payroll in the next 30 days implementing retention system is not going to solve your problem it's going to take 12 weeks for
(02:23) that set for that to pan out now this is what you should do absolutely after you have milked out all the big opportunities that sit in front of you and ensure that you're not going to kill yourself from a threat standpoint now if you're if your retention is like you're you know you're turning 30 mother month and that becomes a threat it's not even a weakness it's a threat itself to your business now the number one thing that i see and this is like when i'm when i'm getting on the phone now and like i i occasionally take
(02:49) calls which i want to to kind of like just poke and listen um and i try not to advertise it because i i couldn't like i actually thought about this like yesterday i was like i wonder if i could take one call with everyone if i did 30 minutes for every person once a month and i was like oh no it's still taking me three months so i can't do it i tried and i thought about it it can't work so all i do is give you the lessons that i have learned from the people that have spoken with and so if for example you don't have a one-on-one nutrition
(03:15) accountability program that you have plugged into your facility on top of your group training that is the biggest opportunity that sits on top of your business right now would you like to have an extra fifteen thousand dollars a month spent zero dollars in ad spend get it in 28 days and you have literally no risk and it's only profit that you'd add on top of your business basically no cost you don't have that cool nothing else that you're going to do is going to matter and so this is called opportunity cost of all of the things that we can do
(03:45) doing this alternative what other things are we doing that we're saying no to right picking out which of the opportunities to focus on is usually the focus of a good coach and this is where experience of a coach matters because they have more plays in their arsenal they have more cards up their sleeve that they have seen be executed uh with precision over a short period of time and so to a new coach they may only have okay we need to run more ads we need to work our leads harder we need to sell better those are all very true things
(04:22) those in my opinion would sit within the strengths and weaknesses area right but if you are bleeding cash and you need to make money fast right there are three things that will make you money fast one is if like all three of them by the way include selling [ __ ] to your existing customers that is it you don't have enough time to start a campaign bring people in market it's not like that takes time and if you don't have it then there's only three ways to make money and all three are selling to your existing customer base
(04:50) all right in a gym the first and easiest and least amount of anything effort is to take three people run a reason why campaign which is like a uh hey i just turned 30 and because of 30 i'm gonna take three people with me on a one-year transformation it's gonna be awesome and i'm only like i said i'm only taking three people on it's me three thousand dollars you know text me if you want it just like that you make nine grand all right you have 100 people you're gonna have to retake the offer alright so if you need money that's number one
(05:21) easiest thing to do you don't want to sell all of those limit it limit yourself but those cash pops help right cash is oxygen so you can buy yourself time to have more perspective to make better judgments about the business next play is you run an internal play to your existing customers right now i guess this one would technically be like subset and subset b which would be the final two if you have like in a normal gym if you just want to run like a big booty boot camp or an abs challenge or uh whatever right doesn't
(05:52) really matter right buns and guts any of those things you can market to your existing customer base and you have two things that you can do from there one is you can actually sell the thing itself which normally you'll get about 20 25 take rate of your entire customer base if you sell between 100 and 200 right and so if you have 150 people 25 would be whatever that is i don't know uh like 35ish 40ish whatever somewhere in there right and so you have 35 people who sign up at let's say 150.
(06:22) okay well made five grand but then you have some more fulfillment so maybe the painful thing that the three people might be a better player for that so we'll see which one if you did the other one recently then that that would probably be the play dead now if you wanted to make even more money right then you should make the thing free that you're giving away and then upsell them into food and supplements right up sell them additional services once they start because you'll get an 85 take rate and you'll close 80 90 on the
(06:48) upsell right so it's more work but it again in a short period of time you can sell people other stuff that's ancillary services and that's all free money there's no there's no fulfillment that really has to happen there right so like you buy something or in our case you don't buy something you just go into prestige labs and you click send and then they you never have to touch inventory but point is is like you're taking something for five dollars you're selling it for 20 and then you just take the in-between and that's it the
(07:16) shoppings you keep the money great right so that's another easy way of making 10 15 20 000 in a month the third thing and this is the one that i'm gonna drill home for everyone is that you have the same amount of effort that is going to go into dealing with any kind of internal play so beyond the first thing which is like quick text blasts limited spaces make 10 grand tomorrow right that's like cool make 10 grand tomorrow but if you want to make like if you want to start having established recurring revenue right add an additional level of
(07:49) service right simply giving people one-on-one nutrition one-on-one accountability that's it a lot of people struggle with getting the gym a lot of people would love someone to text them every morning ask them what their weight is how they're doing make sure they show up at the gym what this also does is your churn goes through the floor as in like your retention goes up people stop turning up because they have a regular communication kit now if i had 150 customers what would i do i would being the enterprising mofo that
(08:17) i am give everyone at my gym 28 days free or 21 days or 14 days free depending on how much work ethic i have right now for me if i gave everyone in my gym all 150 people an amazing 101 experience that they've never had before and after this 28 days you can keep doing this for 49 bucks extra a week right and that's half of what i'm gonna sell new people into it so they're getting a great deal right what percentage of people do you think would say you have one-on-one contact with them for a whole month what do you think
(08:50) half being a third would stay probably higher than a third i think half would stay i think it's higher than a half but let's just say half right half stay now you're not going to get 100 take rate because you never get 100 take rate on these types of things but you get 85 let's say you get 120 people to take the offer or you could have to stay so you got 60.
(09:13) and you got 60 at 200 a month extra that are paying for one-on-one nutrition accountability what's the cost of fulfillment there very low right 20 goes to a coach cool so you pay 2 400 out of your out of your 12 right so you're at 96 and now every single month from this month going forward you make your 10 grand a month and that is profit that is in your pocket that you can do tomorrow right so if you're if you need more profit if you need more cash there's a million ways to do it and a lot of times like and this is me somebody who's a long-term player
(09:47) sometimes if you need it fast fixing your culture is not going to do it you need cash today and so once you can have that and you can plug the hole or you can plug a threat or whatever it is right then you can start fixing the processes that got you into this pickle to begin with but sometimes you need cash tomorrow and so those are the three easiest ways that you can get cash tomorrow the last one one-on-one nutrition accountability by different um because of marketing so don't get scared away nutrition accountability is kind of part of the
(10:14) game when you're a gym owner um that being said it's free money and so if i'm talking to a gym owner i'm going to check off the boxes of which of these things they have done and most times when i look at all the opportunities they have floor in front of them asking them to take it and so right now if you're looking at your business there's probably a million things that you could do and arguably should do but which one thing given the same amount of time is going to make you the most money forget about everything else and just do
(10:48) that and most times you're gonna make the right call and what a good coach is supposed to do is figure out of all the plays that they know in their arsenal right all the cards that they have to play which one is best suited to you right now that can have high impact and and require low resources right those are the best high impact high resources like yes it's going to take a lot but it's going to it's going to cost a lot right whereas here you actually get the benefit of having the profit without the risk right i'm not saying front ad spend
(11:18) i'm not saying you know like there's literally nothing that needs to get added to your business besides one person with 60 clients one person can handle that and that can be you if you want to you can keep the extra 2400 a month it's your call but all that to say if you're looking at your business it is your job to be able to weigh which of the things that are in front of you because there's a million plays that are out there and that's where people get overwhelmed they're like i don't know should i run a 28-day
(11:42) transformation should i run an internal play should i run a a paid in full should i run a year of change should i run a like should i run a hybrid one-on-one accountability nutrition right what should i do look at which one makes you the most money it takes the least amount of resources depends how quickly you need money the money tomorrow you got to do paid in full it's gonna be a text blast you make the money if you can if you can wait two weeks to make the money you're gonna do an internal play if you can wait a month to
(12:07) make the money then you should probably do hybrid give everyone the free play and now you just added 120 grand a month to your facility top line right and then bottom line you add actually sorry you would add more than that top line you had 144 000 top line 120 bottom line all right one play is it worth it arguably what most people do not that and that's why they struggle so don't be one of them cash flows oxygen make sure you prioritize the opportunities that are bigger and once you do that once you execute those things then yes you'll have cash
(12:40) flow to breathe and then you can invest in things that will actually solve your problem then you can pay someone to start helping retain your customers so that you don't have the term problem and you can wait 12 weeks and now you have cash flow from the recurring revenue stream that you took a month to build all right so i hope that makes sense drop a like drop a comment tag someone if you feel like it three ways to make cash in the next month lots of love keeping amazing have a wacky wonderful wednesday all

Transcript:
(00:00) I'm Alex rosi and I'm an investor and I own acquisition. comom it's a big portfolio companies it makes me more money than I'll ever need rest of my life I had a 100 business owners who FW out to our headquarters to scale their companies and so they ask me questions for an hour I try to do my very best to make the solutions as tactical ass humanely possible so that you can watching from home immediately use them in your business first off I have to say thank you for uh taking me out for dinner last time that conversation that
(00:23) we had literally changed my life and changed my business so um yeah I appreciate that um can I tell the story of what happened for sure we had an event that was scheduled had to get moved the memo got passed down and everyone found out except for uh one sales guy and he sold six people into an event that didn't exist on like a random Monday we had six people showing up came from Israel and he was like hey I'm here for the workshop and I was like this looks awesome for us I'm really happy I'm really happy that we that we're in
(00:56) this situation we've always tried to come from the perspective of like when you when you have something that gets me up like you can't just like refund somebody cuz they're still net negative right like he still flew from his real if i' said hey my bad here's the money back he still like screw this guy right and so we had the team spend the day with the the six and then we took them out to dinner and I I bring that up just because it was a great like example um of like something that took me too long to learn was that like you can't just
(01:23) make it right you have to make it more than right um in order to actually make it right you know that was obviously a super unfortunate situation and you know every business if you have humans you make mistakes right and so that was a mistake that we had made I remember hearing the stat from Disney which is that it takes 37 magical moments to overcome one tragic moment and so the moral of that statistic is not let's do 37 magic moments it's avoid the tragic moments if at all possible but if you do find yourself in a tragic situation here's an interesting thing that Lila
(01:53) taught me which is that believe it or not the people that you wrong and then Super compensate to make it super become your biggest ambassadors he flew back out and he gave such a heartfelt you know you know story that like it took somebody who was negative and I think you know from at least what it sounded like he was super positive towards us and I think that that's in some ways as terrible as it is when you do have one of those tragic moments just see it as an opportunity to flip someone from a hater into an ambassador rather than being like Oh we got to give these
(02:27) people refunds it's like no like we actually get to build a reputation and decide what kind of company we want to be we're we're stuck at right now so we're selling the backend offer 195 a month um for semi-private okay um or four months for 5.95 our turn for both of those is 50% so weighted its 30% churn and the reason why we've got such terrible churn is nobody shows up like 7% of our student body actually shows up to the calls and actually gets the value from the thing they purchased what's the onboarding look like so we have the closer um get them to see the calendar
(03:06) of we have eight sessions a week that they can join so they show them the calendar they say okay which one of these do you think you can come to and then they get them to say okay this one and then the closer says okay I'm going to tell Jenny who's the coach on that call she's going to be expecting you there's two there's two kind of like different angles to attack this one is the kind of like logistic side which I'm going to cover first because it's easy and just process stuff and the other is kind of like the bigger Mor morphous stuff which is like how do I make our thing easier uh easier and more
(03:35) enjoyable for people to kind of experience um on the logistic side I'm sure that you're on my email list if we had dinner you better be on my email list uh by the way if you got anyone here read the mosy minute anyone I think it's the best like I some of the best stuff I put out anyways it's really good I think it's really I spend like my Sundays on it um anyways so band famam is way of life so book a meeting from a meeting right and so the sales guy should obviously book to the onboarding call right or the whatever I do think that you probably need to add one onboarding call that's specific to the person not just have them drop in how
(04:08) much do you want this to work really bad okay so this is what I would recommend doing you'll probably want to do something in the neighborhood of four to six sessions that are oneon-one I'm just being like now if you need to adjust price in order to do it fine but it's four to six sessions of one-on-one before they kind of like qualify to go into the kind of the group setting and so it's like you you will personally onboard them so that they have this way better buyin they're way like they don't feel like they're just like in no man's land and just getting tossed into the middle of a conversation like you kind
(04:36) of like on-ramp them after you have the onboarding which should be and you can you can cut I mean at the very beginning just do two you know what I mean just to start and then you can kind of see how it goes um from there you basically want to keep bam faming um per session so all the people are showing up the last five minutes I would say okay everybody let's pull up the calendars when are you guys showing up again great and I would book it with everybody so that keeping people forward and you have to back that up with probably the reminder sequence that they're going to get because it's actually a scheduled session so they
(05:07) should get automated reminders and they should probably get a manual reach out from the person who's running the session of the people who are supposed to who are supposed to attend at the very least do the automated one and that would probably get a huge amount of like that will probably do a lot and so this is actually believe it or not this is an onboarding process for a gym so if you have large group training if you take people and just toss them into the group it's much harder than having kind of a more dedicated onboarding experience the ideal is you do like six one-on-one
(05:32) sessions with someone they feel more comfortable in the gym they understand people they understand how the kind the vibe the culture is and then they kind of graduate into the group sessions and so what happens also is that the group sessions are now on a pedestal it's like you're not you're not ready for that yet right it's like you got to earn that and all a sudden becomes the prize that they earned and now they got onboard does that make sense can you see how that would work for sure yeah so this would probably be you set that up as like a
(05:54) big head longtail sort of pricing system and the question that you'd ask um if you want to give an AB close for this is you would say would you rather train uh you know start your start your thing in a group or oneon-one with me that's if you're selling if it's somebody else or one-onone with John and they're a lot of times they're going to be like I'd rather do it with John and you're like great so this is the price for that and then you just go for that sale if it's not like no worries we can just start
(06:18) you here not a big deal and then if you want if normally you sell six you can say you know what I'm still going to give you one if you do that because it's going to be way better an experience for you so then it feels like a gift and doesn't feel like they're like well now well now I don't want the group thing right so just give them one or two if you if you sell a six for example does that make sense so um he presented obviously with a a low consumption issue which then probably translated into low
(06:44) renewal and probably low high turn and so the the the issue that typically precedes that is low consumption right and so in order to first get consumption you know figured out I like to get attribution in place and so I don't know what kind of tracking he had but I think he said like 7% or something like that um and so he had some level of tracking which allowed him to even take action on the problem but most times when I ask more questions i' say nine times at attend the entrepreneur has a problem but doesn't collect any data that precedes the problem and so then the first step is to just go collect the
(07:17) data and once you have the data typically the solutions become obvious and so a lot of time is wasted in this space of like trying to ideate and figure out this hypothetical solution without any data and you're like I don't know is it this or this or this that we could do it's like well you have no data so you have no idea and so you just keep circling and so when you don't know what to do get data first and then it makes the path easy I sell career coaching services to corporate Executives um so basically we help these people find their next role so we did 7.2 million in Revenue last year congrats about 2
(07:48) million in profit amazing and um we know how to grow BC we know that we can do that but we're really wanting to get B2B going okay so these Enterprise level deals are a little bit more they're a different ball game right okay so we're struggling to get our first B2B do because they have to be big enough to have the budget why do you want to do B2B so this entrepreneur is obviously doing well you know he's doing multiple millions of dollars a year and he's got something that says decent margins and he said in order to scale he should do B2B but he was in a consumer-based market and consumer markets are huge
(08:17) there's way more consumers than there are businesses so he had a proven product with a proven acquisition Channel and was profitable and was growing and he was spending you know $3 or $5,000 a day I was like this is nothing um in terms of the amount of scale that's available for the product that he had and so when he said he wanted to do this other new thing I had an inkling that it was for no actual reason besides he probably encountered some sort of difficulty that he assumed the New Path wouldn't have and so this is just a classic woman in the red dress why can't you just do more what you're
(08:47) currently doing we can I mean like we hit like 980 and uh in October and like that was a big like a million month like that was the Milestone where it's like okay let's start doing different stuff I I'll tell you what my initial reaction is what you're already probably guessing which is like I will exhaust more before I look at anything new and so someone would have to make a very strong argument for me why I can't do more of what I'm already doing so if I were to like buy your company tomorrow I'd be like yeah don't worry about that just
(09:11) what are you what are you currently doing to get uh to get customers oh just Facebook ads okay so what are you spending a day uh anywhere from 3,000 to 5,000 a day right I'd be like okay so how do we get to 100,000 a day and spend a day yeah wow like what stops us from getting to 100,000 a day okay and the answer to that question is the con straint so what stops you from getting so let's say 10,000 a day so that's a triple so like what stops you from doing that we were there in October right around 10,000 a day and then we had like sales efficiency issues and stuff like that obviously Q4 is not like the best
(09:42) time to have that type of service and so really just like making sure that our backend or our front end like sales called to close rate all that good stuff is like able to profitable and we have a lot of like services like one-on ones that we pay our coaches really well we have a writing team in house that we pay so there's there's cost so what would but that those costs are fixed because you'd have that cost of the BB right okay so what stops US the problems that exist in the BET Toc scenario also exists in the B2B scenario and so he's like hey I've got
(10:11) I've encountered this problem I don't know how to solve and so my way of solving it is to not solve it and start something else that will C create even more problems in my business and so when you say it like that it sounds ridiculous but this is a decision-making process that or rather a mistake making process that a lot of people follow fundamentally you want to ask why can't we do more and the answer to that question is the constraint and the only in my opinion proper constraint for deciding to uh go after a new Avatar is
(10:35) that you run out of the existing Avatar so think about this just have you ever done B2B like Enterprise okay so the thing is is that um they are higher leverage but you're also going to have like 10 15 touch points and so the number of deals per guy is going to go down a lot there's also going to be multiple stakeholders they have to get involved on their side and multiple stakeholders that you're going to introduce on your side so just in general for B2B like Enterprise level sales you increase conversion rate and
(11:00) stick of a customer by increasing the number of people that are involved in the transaction on both sides so basically you want to show you want to show as have as many of these ties as you can to do Enterprise sales the the lowest risk adjusted return move in any business is to do more of what's already working and answer the question why why can't we do more and so if you have a sales efficiency issue then like solve the sales efficiency issue because it's holding you back from tripling the things that you brought up are all fixed problems as in their they're problems on both paths so to to to forgo the path
(11:34) you're currently on for A New Path that's completely unproven with with the same problems that you know already exist is a much higher risk move than just saying yeah why don't we just get to 30 million okay so just focus on maxing out B Toc about B2B till we're like fully confident BC like we're doing everything well not even that you're doing everything that you have exhausted the market of C's okay okay right like it's so if want diversity then I'd still I would rather you go diversity of Channel rather than changing customers the
(12:05) riskiest thing you can do it's a new business basically you're have you have to have a new offering you have new acquis like everything's new and so I would rather if you if you have the itch for new just get a second Channel but I don't think you're even close to that you're at 3 to 5,000 a day I think you can totally spend 50 100,000 a day for sure just on meta what will likely be the next uh thing that gets in your way is that your rowes is going to drop uh and so typically that's going to be uh
(12:30) you're going to need to have option one better lead magnet option two better creative option three Superior cro conversion rate optimization just on the the pages option four improve sales efficiency option five all four and then that allows you to scale and like fundamentally the difference between companies that can spend 100,000 a day and 5,000 a day profitably is how good they are it's literally just making all of this pieces better and that takes time because you're going only change one of those at a time and this is why business takes time to grow I sell bleacher rentals to festivals and fairs
(13:02) so we do around 4 and a half million in revenue and about a million in uh profit congrats what's stopping me is having my leadership team delegate fully some of their responsibilities and I think it has to do with um creating processes that are followed by all if we need to hire key people and we don't have the processes then we can't delegate properly so how do you train leaders so this this is this is a good question that I'm going to Chunk Up one level because I think it'll be valuable in general um which is that fundamentally when we're hiring anyone we look for the smallest skilled
(13:40) deficiency possible fundamentally you've got traits as people call them and then you've got skills now based on Alex's worldview uh this is not a thing it's just that a trait is just a series of skills right and so when you hire a CFO for example you're going to try and hire for the smallest skilled deficiency and so if the CFO is a dick for example but they're exceptional and all these other things then you're like maybe I can teach them to be kind in these ways now that'd be a big you it's a lot of skills
(14:15) to just have some like go from not kind to kind right a lot of subskills underneath of that and so if it's two days to train sales and two months to train kindness take this person who's kind and then train them on sales later on sometimes you have people who you're like okay this person's a little different than our Vibe they're not going to be you know oil and water um but they have this massive skill set that we can use and this tiny deficiency that is around this stuff that we can be transparent with them up front that they need to fix I've seen this happen like again and again and again where a
(14:46) manager or a leader talks to somebody else and says hey and then uses a morphous terminology that's very hard to pin down to basically say change your behavior and they're like but how and they're like change it and you're like okay I don't know what that means and so the reason so obsessive about operationalizing terms like what is patience what is courage what is you know what is humility like what are these what do these terms actually mean in terms of behaviors like patience is figuring out something to do in the meantime like if you do figure out something to do in the meantime you're by default being patient right and so
(15:13) it's telling someone what they actually have to do not who they have to be stop being lazy is very hard for someone to solve it's like I keep telling her to not be lazy and she keeps being lazy but you have to break the term down into what behaviors you describe as lazy cuz when you talk to you know your your partner you talk to somebody else you say hey Sarah's kind of lazy have you noticed that there are things that she did that you observe that you ascribe the label lazy too and so you have to think more deeply like what did they do
(15:41) to deserve the title and it might be like they don't respond quickly to slack messages these are things that if you said hey Susan instead of insulting her and saying hey you're lazy instead we'd say hey you don't respond to slack me
(16:00) ssages quickly enough you aren't responding you know after hours and our hours keep going till 9:00 p.m. and you're not responding until after you know after 5: and so for this week I want you to focus just on responding to slack messages so let's turn on notifications let's turn it on both of your phones and and turn it on your computer so that you can see it is there anything else that's going to get in the way of you responding quickly now when we ask that question we might find out that Sarah's overwhelmed because she's doing somebody else's job who we laid off and we haven't backfilled it's like okay well now we have context but until we get to there we can't appropriately measure Sarah's inherent value or traits
(16:30) rather behaviors to give her a label so to your question how do you train leaders I think that attracting good leaders so one of it's recruiting right so um Chick-fil-A's head of people said this she said a lot of people are trying to fix process when they really lost the championship in the draft and so a lot of people are trying to to figure out what Playbook they should be using with a team that's never going to win so the big framework that we use for training in general is document demonstrate duplicate
(17:02) and so first you figure out exactly what the checklist is and I like checklist more than quote Sops that's a a personal preference and say like and you want to be able to break it down into behaviors and I think this is where a lot of training goes wrong I think most companies aren't very good at training they're just they basically hire a bunch of people see who's got the skill and then fire the rest but if you do get good at training it's like how do you train kindness well you say okay well people who are kind when they come on a
(17:25) phone they they smile right and they nod their head when people are listening and they repeat back what someone says and they you know raise their voice when uh when uh they walk into a room right and so if you boil it down to some of the behaviors then the onus is on us as Leaders to be more specific with what we tell our subordinates to do and I think a lot of times if you're struggling to train some of these key traits with leaders it's because you're not being specific enough about what you want them to change and so it's like you're just
(17:53) not getting it it's like well no one can do anything with that and so it's like you have to and this is where the work comes in from the top down we're like okay when you do this and so the easiest way to bucket this that's a p there we go is Sarah I need you to stop doing this I need you to start doing this and I need you to keep doing this and so just being more granular about what Behavior you want them to stop or what Behavior they're not doing that they need to begin or combination and so um giving someone the
(18:27) feedback of I need you to do this in dead of this has been some of the most effective way that I've been able to change people's behavior and it's about around the specificity and so if your leaders aren't doing what you want them to do document demonstrate duplicate this is the step process let me show you how I do it now you do it in front of me and this is what we're going to have you stop doing you're going to now do this instead and keep doing the other stuff that's good I sell professional book publishing
(18:51) services to entrepreneurs and Executives we do a million dollars in Revenue I'd like to be at 3.2 million in Revenue very precise and I just 32s my favorite number this the best this is the best explanation for of Revenue goal I've ever had that's great what's stopping me is I'm at the stage where I need to make more money before thinking about other things and the challenge I'm facing is a lot of things have worked for us up to this point but I need to know what to I need Clarity around what to do more of so what's the
(19:20) input so what's the thing that drives the business the the biggest thing that drives the business right now is referrals okay second biggest thing is related to organic in the form of speaking social media and guest coaching and then we have a split between cold email outbound and Facebook at you're doing all the acquisition channels all of them and we didn't even mean to do all of them we just kind of tried them all and they all seem to work enough what's the greatest percentage of your customers what channel they come from the greatest percentage of the customers be after referrals would be organic okay
(19:51) um and that's now you you put that both in organic content but also like speaking and things like that okay how many speaking things are you doing online like a monthly basis it's about one per year last year okay so I have an idea um so I would I would ask the question like how like I think I might have told this in a short but a really close friend of mine um he took over uh reel which is a public traded um real estate brokerage their primary way of getting more agents is him speaking at real estate events and so in Q4 he did
(20:23) 66 speeches and um in 24 months he took from 200 million to 1.2 billion in Revenue and so he's doing you know 270 plus events per year uh in person we were having dinner and he was like no one gets it he was like no one understands how much more we do than them and I'm I'm I'm only telling you the story not to make hopefully it comes across the right way yeah um because I think you just you like if if and I'm guessing if that event generated business for you yeah I mean every time I speak we make a significant amount well yeah so I'd be like let's like how
(20:58) do we go from you know one a year to one a week and start there just like Target 50 next year and so he rightly identified that he simply needed to do more the next natural question I was going to be asking is like what are all the ways to you customers which he obviously answered and so then it was like okay the next followup question I'm thinking is where do we have the most leverage so either that's going to be which thing is taking you the least amount of time that makes you the most amount of money uh or which one is the thing that cost you the least amount of money that makes you most amount of M so
(21:23) it's either time leverage or it's money leverage or both now the fact that he said I always make a bunch of money after I speak I was like okay that's a positive indicator and as soon as he said I only do one Speaking event a year I was like I don't need to know anymore like if you're get if if that's a significant amount of Revenue and it's one day once a year like I see that and think okay well we could 50x the business if we just did 50 of those and so then the constraint then becomes okay how do I get booked on these stages but then that's you follow the same core for you do the Outreach you post cont and then you reach out to people to find out
(21:53) and sometimes you have to pay to be on the stages sometimes you get a booth and then they'll give you a speaking slot there's always ways to get on if if you need to uh we acquire companies in the UK and Dubai um current Revenue across the portfolio is about 35 million the metric isn't so much want to get to a revenue metric want to try and create a minimum of around 50 million Enterprise Value um do you own all of them out right no so it's it's varied I think the problem is do we focus on building out the double down on the companies we already have grow eidar that way or do
(22:26) we keep acquiring and build the eidar through acquisition how many do you have 14 14 are they similar no that's the thing so if we was to grow through acquisition we'd have to try and create Synergy down a line yeah so you're you're in a very classic kind of PE No Man's Land uh so you have more companies than most funds would ever have um and you didn't pursue a synergistic strategy in order to accommodate volume and so on one extreme you have like constellation which you're probably familiar with Canada it's like they only buy vertically integrated SAS and they go sub3 million and they just do 100
(23:04) deals a year right and they just know their playbook uh on the other side you have traditional PE that would have a variety of different businesses they buy you know detail shop and then a supplement company and then a whatever but they only have 68 companies in a fund and they have a decent you know decent holdco team to to to add value um to the company and so if I were in your position first thing I would do is probably ask myself who do I want to be when I grow up in terms of what you want the actual day-to-day of the business to be because you can hit 50 on either of those paths right and so it's which of
(23:33) these do I feel more like more me like do I feel like I do have a couple of these businesses that you're like I really understand these ones um and if you don't feel that way then I would probably look at these and go 8020 and say okay what's the 20% that's driving 80% of the of the Enterprise Value and trim honestly I would just like go completely passive on those ones or just return Equity or do some sort of deal so I could get my attention back and then double down on the ones that you are good at so this gentleman who had a had a PE firm uh suffered from a classic
(24:05) issue that I cover in the offers book which is that he had not committed to the niche so this is Page 38 of the book and I tell the story where um I try not to Niche slap people which is that they need to pick one Niche ideally now this gentleman had basically two paths that he could follow he could follow a more concentrated path of just a few companies that could be desperate or different in nature but because of a team of fiveish people he could probably preside over those call it six companies that are the the better ones of the portfolio double down on those inject Capital bring you know recruit higher
(24:43) higher level Talent maybe improve the strategy and then grow the companies the alternative path um was that he just gets really vertical meaning he tries to get as many uh companies that are of the same type so that he can see trying not to use fancy words but synergies between the companies so that they all together kind of the sum of the parts is greater than the whole because you can centralize some costs which adds profit to all of them you can have cross business learning so if you have 10 HVAC companies started by 10 different
(25:14) Founders all of them are going to have a few things they do well so you take the best practices from each of them individually and then you implement them across all of them and so you get this cost savings off the bottom line by centralizing costs and then you distribute out best practices is and so that is a typical uh kind of private Equity play which is a rollup play where you can buy 10 things for a million dollar and sell all 10 together for 50 million and so he was obviously shooting for $50 million exit and the crazy thing is and this is true of Entrepreneurship
(25:42) is there's a lot of ways up the mountain the bigger the goal is the fewer the ways up the mountain there are so you want to get to a trillion dollar company well there's you have to you're going to have to do some crazy new technology that probably doesn't exist um in order to get there if you want to have a $50 million exit you can do that with just about any business by just getting it to a decent amount of size and yes that includes chains of brick and mortar that includes online B like you can you can
(26:07) absolutely do it in any Niche no matter how small it is I sell health and wellness so basically Physical Therapy personal training 35 to 45 year old athletes okay are is the Avatar and we do about a little over 3 million the biggest thing that's stopping me you have a huge shortage in practitioners um to give context there's about 16,000 open positions you're Supply constraint yes so um I need more producers to produce um so I decided to kind of pivot and say well if I can't find the people I'm going to increase price well I'm glad you did that as as the thing you decided to do so that's
(26:48) fine like I started another business on e-commerce yeah yeah instead of start teaching people to uh yeah yeah so that went well to the tun of we didn't lose Revenue okay um but I'm at that point where now do I go all in on continuing to increase price and move more into almost like a concierge membership model or do I go all in and just try to crush and find the people and do what nobody else is possibly doing do you have any issues on getting customers no we have more demand out that we could book people so um have you
(27:27) heard my story about uh buddy m is the cleaning business all right I'll tell I'll tell you so um former gym owner uh crushed it with gym launch and then decided he started making enough money that he started investing in real estate as all entrepreneurs do and then after he was you know crushing in real estate he was like you know I should probably start a cleaning company because he started doing airbnbs out of his real estate he's like this is costing me a ton of money I should vertically integrate and so he started the cleaning company uh to clean you know his airbnbs and he's like
(27:53) well now that I have the cleaning company I might as well start selling other C don't want to leave money on the table right uh and so you can see how this spindles right the moral of the story though is that I called I called him up um and he was telling me he like dude it's crazy he's like selling cleaning customers he's like CAC is like 25 bucks it's insane every like it's so easy to get customers and I was like oh you should scale this to the Moon he's like yeah you know it's kind of hard to get English-speaking Maids who don't take stuff from people and do a good job and show up on time and are willing to
(28:23) work for $115 an hour and I was like okay so the nice thing that you have is you have a supply constrainted business that he was used to Fitness which is typically demand constrainted so it's just it's it's hard to get people who want to show up to the gym right uh not hard to get people to say they want somebody else to clean their house um and so basically the reframe that I gave him is what I'll give you which is you're not actually in the physical therapy business you're in the recruiting physical therapists business the whole Paradigm that I would have
(28:52) around this is what do the career path look like for the physical therapist so that I can make this really enticing on top of that I have to still think through the same you still have the same core four right you've got you got warm Outreach you've got cold Outreach you've got paid ads and then you've got um I should know these I wrote the book okay organic content right so these are the these are the four things that you can do right and then you've got head hunters right which is basically recruiters um and you have uh Word of Mouth from your existing oops Word of
(29:23) Mouth from your resisting staff and so these are the ways that you can get um physical therapists and so we have to approach this the same way we approach getting customers they are just now the customer and so um maybe running in dads is probably not the way that's that you're going to get them but I'll bet you that Outreach will work exceptionally well um to get therapists and I would probably bet that if you had a really good referral incentive um over time that would compound now small not as much you'll probably need to do this
(29:53) to start as you get bigger though there's going to be enough of a base where a few percentage every month of referral girls is material and so let me just put this in math for you so that you can so this will motivate you to do it how much do you make in gross profit off of a physical therapist per year on average about 350 okay so if I told you that I could add $350,000 in gross profit per year to your business how much would you be willing to pay for that in the first year quite a lot right and so giving
(30:24) someone $500 for referral not that motivating if you said I'll give you 20 grand for a referral I'll bet you'll get them to move most businesses are either comp Supply constrained or demand constrained now if you have a business that's both then it's like you don't have customers you don't have employees like that's a tough place to be most of the time it's one or the other and what's interesting is that entrepreneurs will often try and solve basically like not solve the real problem and this was kind of exact what she was presenting with she was like
(30:53) should I do this other thing or should I like should I should I change my model all together but the crazy thing is just like her model was doing great she was making good margins she had she's doing good Revenue out of two locations it's like why are we going to break the model like the constraint of the business is that you just don't know how to recruit so let's just solve that problem because her other path of like just raising prices which to be fair I'm all in favor of at some point it's like you can't raise the prices anymore like you're becoming like a luxury business and it's
(31:23) just like you're changing all the Dynamics of the business but her business worked already and so for me the lowest risk thing to do is not change the business model but just figure out the problem of the business and solve it and for her biggest problem was I can't get people but I don't think she had Quantified how much she should be willing to invest in getting more talent and I think this is wildly underrated it's like think about it from a return on on profit I only did it on gross profit right it was $350,000 per employee so I'm like why would you not pay I mean like just being real why would you not pay $50,000 or $100,000
(31:54) right if you know that if I people are happy to put you know $100,000 in the stock market and get 10% back and make 10,000 but in their businesses they're hesitant to give a commission of of $110,000 for $300,000 thing right and so if you're like well what if that doesn't work out then push it out where there's a contingency that you're happy to do it and if you want keep raising the price until you get people to refer like with enough incentive you can move the world and So speaking of this Physical Therapy
(32:18) brick and mortar business uh I did a brick-and-mortar breakdown of five locations of caropractor that had done through m&a uh on how to accelerate the growth of the business and it's super tactical and it works whether you have a single location or you're even virtual a lot of the Tactical carry over to any business to help it grow enjoy

Transcript:
(00:00) in this video i'm going to talk to you about one of the questions that i get most frequently and that i one of the problems that i have to solve again most commonly in some of the companies that we take on in our portfolio one of the goals of any business is to maximize the amount of revenue per customer you generate right and a lot of times you want to have what's what's called like an accommodating buying curve and so what that basically means is at every rug right if someone is wealthier you want them to buy more and
(00:27) spend more money with you and if someone has less money you want them to still buy from you but potentially buy for less right and so this gives way to a lot of these crazy product and service listings where people have you know 100 different services and products that they offer because they want to have the ability to serve everyone at the maximum degree the thing is is that most times that will create so much operational complexity and create so many little appendages right little sticky things that are stuck onto the side and bolted
(00:59) on and globbed and duct taped onto a business that it becomes incredibly distracting for all of the employees because they're thinking about all these different things and here's a funny one is that most times if your employees don't understand all the different types of things you sell and the price points you sell them at your customers for sure don't one of the things that we will do when we're looking at a company is we will simplify the product offering and instead try and reach the maximum buying threshold per prospect by changing the
(01:29) payment terms now in a perfect world if everyone had absolute information and everyone was unbelievably well trained and you had great infrastructure and all that stuff then yes the more products and services you offer in theory you would make more money but we don't live in that theoretical world most of the time and most small business owners are not that good at operating right it's the number one issue they have they're super disorganized they feel like they're spinning their reels all day their team completely has no idea what which way
(01:56) they're going they change things all the time etc and so in an effort to combat that we have used this process over and over again and it has worked very well so it is as follows we sell two things and i've done this in virtually every business that i've ever owned we sell two things two products or two services and this is once we're going from one to ten million all right zero to one million you sell one product and one service one avatar all right that's it one channel one product one avatar that's it right but
(02:26) once you're going from one to you know one to three ish million and you're trying to go to ten you introduce the second product line and so here's how this works if you have two things that you sell you'll have a front-end thing and you'll have a back-end thing we can still have a massive accommodation in the buying curve based on the payment terms that we introduce so for example people will look at their monthly expense more than the total contract value that's a huge money hack i'm giving you right now this is a wealth hack this is
(02:58) something that will build make you a fortune in your life if you can properly understand this people do not look at the length or the total contract they're signing they will only pay attention to what is it going to cost me every month because no one is good with their money all right so they only look at the cash flow expense month over month over month and they just think can i make it happen yes cool i'll sign they don't think about the total contract value for you as a business owner the contract value matters almost more than anything so
(03:27) i'll give you a quick hack on this total side note tangent for you life hack pro tip if you want to extend the contract value that you have i have a saying which is the bigger the head the longer the tail all right and so what that means is the more you can get someone to pay up front and relative to the upfront cost of signing up or what they paid down the lower their contractual recurring payment is the stickier it will be so i'll give you an example if i had someone sign up for 99 a month for whatever it doesn't matter that
(03:56) price point might be medium sticky depending on the value that i have now imagine i had someone pay five thousand dollars down and ninety nine dollars a month after that how much more sticky would it be significantly more sticky now the beauty is if you have one of these up front tight payments you can also use that to liquidate your ad cost cover your commissions for the salesperson cover the upfront fulfillment in onboarding which is going to cost more for a new customer than an existing customer and so you can build
(04:23) all that in if you know that the thing that you are selling has very high gross margins then you can still have a lower cost as long as you know that the person is going to stay for a long time and so based on how you structure the pricing you can actually get some you can use the pricing to actually get people to stick longer pro tip complete that is it moving back to the original thing that i was talking about in one of our portfolio companies we actually had this as a really in-depth discussion that we had to make a decision about all right
(04:46) and so they had a different you know mentor person whatever advice uh who told them that they should have three products and they should have a you know low a medium and a high product and then based on you know what the salesman thought the salesman would sell them the low medium or high in my experience it is not that effective and that is because the salesperson can't decide which of these things they are trying to sell most of the time and so what we have found is more effective is you give the salesperson the one dream to sell
(05:15) this thing is going to solve this person's problem and we make it the most valuable thing that we're trying to sell because at the end of the day you do want to solve the the customer's problem right we do want to actually make sure that we're providing value rather than having a diet a medium and a grate right simply having one thing that solves all the problems and then based on the the customer's budget we can decrease how they pay all right so hear me out so let's say that uh we want to do a uh this is a six month implementation of
(05:44) whatever kind of solution you sell if you have a six month duration you can have the person a pay the entire thing up front so that would be for somebody who has the highest budget version two would be a split pay version three might be three payments right with at twenty percent higher and then finally you might have a have a have a you know a six pay or whatever over that period of time so one two three six now here's the cool thing the more payment options you provide the higher your conversions are that's
(06:13) proven all right so the more options you give someone to pay the more people will buy period now you might not make more cash flow because if you give your sales guy more options then they might use though they'll end up defaulting to the lower ones right but if you have one thing to sell then they only have one thing to convince the person of because a confused mind doesn't buy if you have too many options the salesman won't know what to sell and the prospect won't know what to buy and so i prefer when i'm coming into our portfolio company i'm
(06:43) thinking what is this true problem that we are solving with this business for what avatar and we make that the main thing and we communicate it clearly in the scripting and the sales person has clarity on what they are selling and they're always solving the same thing and so the question becomes no longer which of these things are you going to buy but once you are buying how would you like to pay and so then the discussion is around what payment plan is best for them rather than what product is best for them and so by doing that you can
(07:12) get people to go between different payment terms that is not going to change whether they're going to buy but if they're unsure about which product is going to best suit their needs and the salesman doesn't know because at the end of the day he's just trying to sell the most expensive thing then you'll have way more confused people who leave on soul so this is a single tactic that you can use to execute within your business which is why i'm a big fan of making offers people cannot say no to is that you can focus all of your sales and all
(07:36) of your persuasion attempts on selling the one thing which is getting them to say yes once they say yes we can we can reach the we can accommodate their wealth and their budget based on the payment terms that we provide and if we have done or we've structured our offer properly the offer in and of itself should already be very high gross margins which means whether or not the person pays a thousand dollars a month or a hundred dollars a month it's still almost all margin for us because of how we structure the thing that we are
(08:00) selling and so we are able to capture higher ltvs by getting the people who have more money to prepay the thing up front that is how we do it and with those people you'll be able to ascend into the second thing faster because they've already prepaid that thing and then you can solve the next natural problem in another sales conversation rather than trying to pick all of the things in one conversation which makes it incredibly difficult to do this is just for everyone again a broad brush stroke of statements for
(08:31) most entrepreneurs who are not very good at operating their businesses uh her operations is not their strong suit and are below three million dollars a year all right so anyways moseynation there's a lot of people who are broke i don't want to be one of them which is why i make these videos keep being awesome i love you and i'll see you guys next bit bye

Transcript:
(00:00) a lot of people have heard the term your network is your net worth to a degree that's true to the other degree that's the average of the five people you spend the most time with well it's not true for bill gates and for jeff bezos because the people that they spend time with are less than their net worth which would mean that their net would be less than that and so you know there are statements that are thrown around frequently that don't have necessarily a lot of evidence but you know are i would say spiritually correct and so what i
(00:25) want to talk about today and for those who don't know me my name is alex for mosey i own acquisition.com it's a portfolio of company that does over 100 million a year make these videos because i just love getting troll comments about being in my mom's basement this is not this is actually just a closet cause i just like having no windows and i wear the things that i'm comfortable in that being said in the last year i would say that i fell out of touch with the last two friends that i had from high school and or
(00:49) college and this has been a process that's happened you know gradually over time and i was having a conversation with dean graziosi who has become a very very close friend of mine and i brought the topic up with him and i thought the discussion would be worth sharing and so one of the things that he told me early on in our relationship which really really gave me a lot of pause was the cost of his dreams and so i asked him earlier on and it was about 18 months ago before layla and i decided to build kind of our personal brands etc
(01:18) about you know the cost of fame and he said yeah you know i've got people who show up at my house and people who leave weird mean comments and he's like all the time the thing is is that that is a price i'm willing to pay to make the impact that i want to make with my life when he said that it just it really struck me because to me it was in a lot of ways you know selfish to kind of not spread the message out of fear of what it would cost me that being said there's obviously pros that you know you know we've made whatever decision that they
(01:44) outweigh the cons but it was just an interesting perspective in terms of just it is a price that he was willing to pay and so i want to lead this discussion towards the friend conversation that i had with him and he had said that he recently had lost one of his last friends the last friend that he had had from kind of his childhood and i think that there's a lot of people who are like you know never forget where you come from and the people who supported you etc and i think that's true but i think for the mass
(02:07) majority of us a lot of people don't support us on our way up at least it felt that way for me what's interesting is that a lot of people root for you until you do better than them and they stop rooting for you and i'm not saying that the the people um that i'm talking about were like that but it's just that was like the first wave of friends that i lost and it was just because they didn't actually want to see me win and i had a quote uh the other day that went pretty viral on twitter which was real friends talk to your face and
(02:31) praise you behind your back and fake friends do the opposite and when i say talk i mean like bullshitting you know what i mean like give each other you know give each other flack if i'm giving someone flack they know that we're homies you know dr cashy i was i was i was thinking about patenting uh the hormozy advertising cycles i spent so long developing the cycle which is going to be in one of the books that comes up you know in the future and his comment was get over yourself and that's what i and that's exactly what i want
(02:54) from a friend right i want somebody who's gonna say that rather than be like oh that's cool and then be like i can't believe this guy and so we have these people that we collect you know throughout our lives and sometimes that come in you know you've probably heard the saying they're here for a season a reason or a lifetime and i think you know for me a lot of people have been seasonal and so i wanted to share that because i know that i'm sure some of you have had a similar path to me in that i didn't have a
(03:21) tremendous amount of support from my parents i think they now retroactively think they supported me because it's much easier that way but i did not i did not have any support from my parents for the decisions that i took until it was already beyond obvious that i was going to be successful and that took years and that was very hard for me at the time i think friends fell in that same category and so when i was having this discussion with dean we we dove into this a little bit more but as we you know ascend towards our goals and i don't say a send
(03:48) in a literal sense in terms of like socioeconomic status or whatever but just like we move closer towards we want to where we want to go and our vision and our mission and our lives become clear it also becomes clear when you have contrast with people from your past and i have several rules of thumb that are i've begun to develop around these relationships one of them is if i could only talk about the past with someone they usually aren't good friends of mine because i don't really live in the past i live in the future i live in where i
(04:15) want to go what i want to do the things that i find interesting or the present of the things that i find interesting today or right now top of mind and if i can't talk about those things with somebody then our friendship kind of by its very nature will decline over time because there is no growth right because it's only in the past and i have felt a tremendous amount of guilt around the loss of those relationships but i also felt a guilt of carrying them on as in i felt like i needed to water these plants out of necessity rather than out of you
(04:41) know some sort of exchange now some people might decry that or speak against the idea of having an exchange but i don't think that's realistic i think that people stay in relationships because there is an exchange of value that occurs now i think the difference is the strength or depth of the relationship is how long you are willing to wait for the exchange to occur so a parent for example is willing to wait a very long time for a positive exchange from a child coming back to them right now and some people could make the
(05:07) argument that you know children are a gift throughout that entire period of time and that's awesome and that's a perspective whatever but just to use the time frame as a nice thinking process if you just met someone if you don't feel like there's you know a huge benefit to to to knowing them uh you know within the immediate future you probably don't really pursue them out and the longer you have had positive exchanges the longer you are willing to wait for the next one right it's it's intermittent reinforcement from a behavior uh
(05:32) standpoint right like we are literally reinforced in this relationship and the way that addiction works is the same thing right like you immediately get positive hits and then you can start extending how long before you get another positive hit which is also how abusive relationships work right like abuse abuse positive abuse positive pause and pause and then like abuse and then positive is a little bit later and then a little bit later until the point where there's almost no positive whatsoever i'm not saying that's how you
(05:54) should run relationships but more so how we work as humans the point of me breaking this down is that i have lost a lot of the friends or almost all of the friends that i had when i started my journey and the upside is people will come into your life to fill the vacuum that the other people left but sometimes it doesn't happen immediately and i think getting comfortable with having space is a good thing and a lot of people have the impulse or urge to always have people around them and i think it's to their own detriment
(06:24) because i think if you can spend time alone with your thoughts and be okay with just being you without other people then you are more selective and it's the same way with dating some people can't be alone some people can't be without a significant other and so they just end up chatting up with the first person they see after they become single again right and it's because they have a fear of being alone more than they hold a they have an aligned mission with someone that they think that this person is really the best pick and so
(06:49) a lot of ways are similar to dating with friends in that we can hold out uh and really just pick the best people and i think that you know if we at least for me if i have two or three good friends i'm i'm more than satisfied my cup is very full but i think where i feel drained is where i feel like i have lots and lots and lots of acquaintances that are transactional in nature but purely transactional or at least they have a much shorter time horizon for the transactions to occur and so i sell this to say if you have lost
(07:17) friends during the process of the climb i don't think it is something that you should lament or be upset about i think that it is a sign of growth because a lot of people say hey you've changed and the only natural response that i can have to that is you have it and i think that that's kind of sums up the entirety of this of this video which is if you grow you change some people most people don't like change especially if they themselves have not grown or changed and or if they have grown in a different direction from
(07:49) you and it is natural for us to not want to continue relationships with people that have grown or have values that are too far in contrast to our own in those contract those values can change over time and that's okay and so i think that for me it took me a really long time to navigate through this and it was kind of an emotionally explorative experience to just say that's okay and is this price something that i'm willing to pay and for me it's a resounding yes i would be far more sad that i had not realized my
(08:23) potential or what i hoped to accomplish in my life in exchange for relationships that that i sacrificed in order sacrificed my dreams in order to maintain now that being said it almost appears as though i'm sacrificing all relationships in order to have the dream and that's not what i'm saying i'm saying that you will sacrifice old relationships and you will create room for new ones and so i think that there's this i don't know old wives tale or a societal expectation that if someone sheds friends for lack of a better term
(08:52) or loses friends or friends you know dissipate into the distance over time that they are a non-constant person and i think that the answer to that question is yes we grow and unless the friends you have are growing with you and are pushing you to grow then they are probably not friends who will stay with you for the long haul and so for me i'll leave with this kind of last thing that i think about for the people that i want to be friends with i want friends who root for me behind my back and that is rare most people do not root
(09:22) for you behind your back it is sad that there are more strangers on the internet who root for me than people who knew me from back home and it's because we had a shared context at home and the discrepancy between where you are and where they are over time they personalize the fact that they are not with you because they had the same resources at the same beginning and so you're in a different place as a result of your own decisions and so as a result they feel bad and they don't like that and you're a reminder of that what i
(09:47) seek from the friends that i have um are one that they genuinely are rooting for me and that is evidenced by them rooting for me behind my back i also hope that they talk to my face because that is what makes life worth living for me but i hope to admire them i want to strive to be more like my friends in certain ways and i hope that they raise the bar for me to be better and be better in the ways that i want to be better and so in that way picking friends who are people who are further ahead of you doesn't have to be financially it can be
(10:21) it can be in marriage it can be physically it can be whatever and then the hope is that you are better in some ways than they are and then they can grow from you in that way and in that way you both get better and then you have a an extended exchange that continues directionally towards both of your goals my definitions and my view on friendship has changed over time it probably will continue to develop and refine but i mean this because i have a lot of people who message me and are like hey i feel really alone right now i don't feel like
(10:47) a lot of people are supporting me and i make this video say that's okay and i think that there are seasons and at the end of a season when you have a vacuum someone does step in to fill it and i can promise you that if you have a higher standard and you wait and you don't just give of yourself for no reason just because you are afraid to be alone or be without friends you will end up with better friends who actually root for you and are not just place fillers or false friends who you know smile to your face but stab you
(11:14) behind your back or actually talk down on you and so i think if you can have that bar and you can have that tolerance and give yourself that space and that permission to say i've lost a friend and that's okay and i still love them as a human even if i can't give the time that i once did because it doesn't make sense for me anymore because we've grown apart and that's okay and so i've given myself that permission to say these are the prices that i'm willing to pay to grow into the person that i want to be and that's okay and so mosey nation i
(11:39) love you all the road can be can be arduous but i i think the road itself is the reason we do it because of the person that we hope to become and in the process of becoming which is the successes i've defined it is the process of becoming and the process of striving is the success and so anyways my friends keeping awesome i love you all i'll see you guys next vid bye

(01:41) upload a customer list if you don't know how to do that that would be video number four which is how to create a look like audience on facebook and then number five give them something for free in exchange for their phone number that's it you can get leads you're welcome it'll take you 60 minutes and this by the way is what every third-party legion company is doing and they charge you five times more for that process they also pay someone and just from a belief standpoint every single i know all the guys in that space the guy's pushing the buttons they
(02:13) train in less than seven days with two hours of videos and they're paid under 15 bucks an hour this is not hard stuff people just don't know how to do it and now it's very easy and it's all on youtube cool because that's the that's like the really button clicky stuff i wasn't going to stand up here and be like all right connect here and i think that'd be a waste everyone's time so this is going to be the stuff that's going to make the return on that significantly higher is that cool all right awesome yeah 112 million that was cool all right so um
(02:43) using the four frameworks we're able to double down again and again so that literally was my bank account and over the next 44 months we're room will spend 3.1 million in advertising um which gives us a 36-1 lifetime return on advertising um so i don't know what your return on advertising are um but i'm told that's pretty good and so i'll just share stuff that worked well for us okay so that's me co-founder my beautiful wife who's up here being awesome and dealing with me but that was me when i started albert you and i have
(03:13) very similar stories slept on the floor i had no idea what i was doing went to a facebook marketing event literally the week before my gym opened and was like oh so this is how i'll get customers and i was able to actually fill my gym up using that stuff in 2013 and so i was able to scale from zero to six locations in under three years as a kid off cash flow which is pretty neat and then i sold all of those and uh lost everything and that's where my bank account was at the end because the guy that i got into business with was indicted for fraud um and so i had that entire process and then i had
(03:44) nothing again i screenshotted it because i was like i know i'm going to tell the story so um from there because i still was good at running gyms uh we started gym launch my wife and i we went from zero dollars when i took that picture to 2.
(04:01) 4 million a month in 18 months we ran 74 net margins on that business very good business um prestige labs went from zero 1.7 in six months the reason i'm telling you the speed on these is because the acquisition stuff i'm gonna share with you all right allen which is went from zero to one point four in six months this is actually my most reconnected recent acquisition we went from 40k to 700 000 a month in 10 months um and so just so you have an idea in terms of different spaces that's b2b licensing this is ecommerce direct to direct to consumer this is agency software um and then this one is a brick and mortar chain of childhood
(04:30) magical experiences the thing is you should see the numbers behind this thing anyhoo so this is what we do now take interest in seven eight multi figure businesses and grow the eggs in three to five years that's what we do the reason that uh this presentation is so cool for me is that i don't usually get to talk about this stuff so i'm pumped about it but what was really cool was during that process we've made over a thousand success stories like a lot like a lot of success stories um using the framework i'm gonna show you create 71
(04:54) millionaires and counting so very happy about that and so i just want to take you through this the frameworks that we use to scale our companies and this is what we do when we're scaling companies it's the same checklist every time this is what i look at so this should be right for everyone who's either under 100 dollars a month this should help you establish your first reliable acquisition channel what i said in the very beginning that's the tactics google those five videos you'll have lead gen that's that all right but i'll show you how to do it and make way more money from it the second is if
(05:22) you're over a hundred thousand dollars a month how to get your next acquisition channel profitable so you can get your current acquisition to your next acquisition brian asked me to give you some really tactical [ __ ] they can use uh so the four frameworks uh my goal is not to break beliefs or tell stories or motivate anyone i'm going to say the stuff that's like working right now so uh mental rewind was totally a business game of golden bbs and not silver bullets so today my goal is to give you as many golden bbs as possible very
(05:46) candidly there's going to be a lot of things you're going to think about this like a checklist all right you're going to have a hole here there's a pocket of money here a pocket of money here and i just want you to scoop up as many of the ones that make sense to you some of them you already have some of you maybe not but you'll have by the end of the presentation i guarantee you'll have a lot of ways to make more so quick groundwork this is the first thing we do so only two ways to grow a business that is it i start from the top and then we'll break it down from there all right
(06:08) number one is you get more customers seems obvious right this is where everyone looks number two make customers worth more there's no other way that's it get more make them worth more and sometimes simplicity is the ultimate in elegance i think coco chanel said that or aristotle either way it's so cool but since everyone here probably is trying to grow your business that's all we're going to be talking about so four frameworks one get more customers two make more money framework number one the math which is going to be how to acquire customers as
(06:36) a profit who here has a marketing budget you have a marketing budget i will show you how to get rid of that shouldn't have one because if you can spend to acquire customers at a profit as in they are net cash flow positive it means i make money before i even have my credit card due which means it eliminates a acquisition as a bottleneck in your business and b if you don't have capital like you saw my bank account at the beginning of this thing you can compete against anyone still if you have the skill like this is real
(07:01) like you can still crush it right now against people who have way more money because they don't know the game right the game that's happening under everyone's nose so that's the math all right we call that customer client finance acquisition number two is the offer so how to get complete strangers to raise their hands and make offers so good they'd feel stupid saying no all right so i'll show you how like kind of how i said that little ad that's going to break down what we do there number three is of the traffic so once you have
(07:25) those two things in place you know what math you need to hit you know what you're going to give them then we got to go find traffic all right so i'll give you the six traffic sources that exist right now that everyone has access to and my hope is that you'll probably find two or three traffic sources that are in front of you i've got a special page for brad in there so you can look out for that your team can look out for that sorry i'm gonna give you guys homework and then the fourth one is the money right so the whole point here is to make money and i'll show you
(07:47) exactly how we maximize back back end ltv which informs the front end which is why ultimately it's much more of a circle than it is steps so that makes sense we have the math we make our offer go to the traffic we make money which means we update our math and around and around we go all right that's the game plan cool yeah all right rock and roll so if you like childhood pictures this is what i like to draw so you see a lot of doodles in this presentation this is the simple way of seeing it so you got math traffic offer update and then you got the money that you're reeling it in
(08:17) okay quite literally so we're going to start with the math there we go client finance acquisition how to require customers out of profit this is the entire process mapped out don't worry you'll i'll break down each of these steps but this is what it is all right so this is i'm going to show you how to make money with no money which means if you have money you'll be able to do far better than this this is how you do it if you have zero dollars in your bank account right now so if you have less money than your competition or feel like you need to spend or you're spending too much to require customers
(08:46) this is for you this is how you do it so quick definitions real quick cost you require a customer because sometimes i say these quickly and i forget who i'm talking to so cost required customer i say cac all right all costs um required to acquire a new customer advertising payroll media buyer creative team software all that stuff is cost required customer number two cost of goods sold direct cost of fulfillment gross profits the amount of money that is left over after the direct cost of fulfilling so
(09:10) if you had one more customer how much action would you have to pay to fulfill that everything after that is the juice right gross profit payback period the time of period it takes the business to receive the gross profit necessary that it cost them to acquire the customer back right you put a dollar in you get a customer you know tomorrow and then it takes you two months for before you get that cash back in your wallet to spend again all right those are cash conversion cycles i'm going to show you how we do this quickly the more you can condense the cash conversion cycle the faster you can grow all right especially
(09:36) if you don't have funding which i've never had all right and then 30-day cash is something that that's not that i invented it's just something that we track which is the amount of gross profit that i can extract from a new customer in the first 30 days the reason i track this so vehemently is that like many business owners here everyone has access to one thing which is a credit card and so i basically know that i i have 30 days against the clock that i can spend whatever i want and as long as i have it back plus some in 30 days i never have to use my own money to grow
(10:05) so i have all the financing i need and i can grow for free and essentially get my customers to pay for the growth of my business okay so doesn't worry this is the only math equation the entire thing this equation is what has created everything in my life your 30-day cash so this is the plain english of this i have to generate more cash in the first 30 days of running an advertisement than it costs me to acquire two customers and the cost to fulfill both of them cost of acquiring customer and the cost of
(10:29) fulfilling them times two if i can make more than that in the first 30 days off of one customer i can grow unlimited that's how we went from zero to two million zero to two million zero to whatever in six months eight months ten months because it really becomes operational drag not about the acquisition so um and it's a positive cash flow so that entire process while you're growing we're taking cash out every single month while we're growing it's cool cool to experience um and so this allows all of us smaller players who are not bc backed to outspend everyone okay so this is a
(10:59) quick walkthrough i'm drilling this one in because it's really important to understand this concept works so you borrow a hundred dollars from a credit card to a park two customers at fifty dollars each this is a hypothetical two of those customers each spend three hundred dollars with you so you make six hundred bucks now you're up but you still have to fill the customer so cost you fifty dollars each 100 total at the end you have four hundred dollars plus you have two new customers and you can continue to sell those and you have 400 in your bank account what this looks like visually this is how you generate buckets of cash
(11:28) yes all right this is what it looks like visually i'm a big visual guy so zero debt zero money zero customers day zero all right from there we take our little debt there we go 100 and we spend 100 bucks in ads we do exactly what i said in the beginning you're going to get your you're going to run your little ads and you're going to get your opt-ins there we go so they're going to run the ads in front of eyeballs eyeballs are going to get clicks which burton's going to track for us right we're going to get
(11:53) opt-ins we're going to schedule them we're going to they're going show and then we're gonna get sales and there's two of those people so it's visually what i just said i'm just depicting it for you all right and now we have to fill fulfill those people so 600 goes to 500 500 goes to 400 400 goes to my bank account and after the dust settles this is what happens good suspense though right when the dust settles there i am debt free i have 400 in cash and i have two customers that i can now sell whatever the [ __ ] i want for frey
(12:23) that's the game you can add zero subtract zeros but this is what we're doing all right so you have to understand the math before we get into the stuff this is when i doubled down so then you double it down again you do the whole process boom 800 400 goes to fulfillment it's literally just going black on vegas in vegas again and then that was our first round and our second round we doubled the amount of customers the third round we quadruple the amount of customers and a round and round we go if you can execute client finance acquisition until your operations break this will therefore eliminate the need
(12:51) for capital to constrain on your growth i think this is a big deal just like cool i just want to make sure i'm like tracking them okay cool so that's number one the math how to acquire customers as a profit client finance acquisition and there's my little arrow and my check mark it's been a long time making here the check marks work okay the offer how to make offer so good people feel stupid saying no that's the little wormy guy right here got to get the fishies to bite great slime offers how to make off so good people stupid saying no so the problem so right now the first one i said is right now if you
(13:20) spend too much money to our customers or you have a marketing budget or any of those types of things that's your problem if you don't have that problem this might be your problem if your ads aren't converting well all right clicks versus opt-ins like you're like i feel like we're spending but we're not getting [ __ ] right or your sales team has trouble scaling like it's hard to ramp up new guys um they're having trouble closing all that kind of stuff obviously the sales part you've already got covered but a lot of times it's the offer so i just actually
(13:43) had a consulting day yesterday we rewrote the entire offer and i'll give you a couple cool examples that i've done with the companies that i've worked with so to catch fish you need bait for an offer the starting point of any conversation to initiate a transaction with a customer what you are literally providing to them in exchange for their money usually with marketing campaigns it's going to be the number one driver of success what does it do if you do this properly it'll allow you to sell in a vacuum so you don't have price shopping or any of that stuff all right it creates a category of when it forces
(14:08) customers to make a values-based decision instead of a price-based decision lately and i sell days of our time for a hundred grand and like that doesn't make any sense because there's plenty of marketing firms who do a full day for free or a thousand dollars but because it's incomparable they'll do that all right people will pay it so the goal is to decommoditize the offer and if we do this properly we'll increase our click-through rates our ctrs which means of the eyeballs that see it more people to say decide to take one step towards us of the people who take a step towards
(14:40) us more of them think it's interesting and decide to opt in and then not only that once they're on the phone with us because the offer is so compelling more of them say yes and so this is a multiplicative effect and so the translation is more leads more sales higher prices so here's uh two real life examples so when i had my my little gym i struggled to sell a 99 a month boot camp like i could not i couldn't even close people on a free trial it was sad i switched from a 99 a month boot camp to a free six-week challenge and the way that we structured the offer was people would come in
(15:13) they would put 600 down they lost 20 pounds i'd give them the money back but 48 hours after they bought we sell them 300 supplements 21 days after that we'd say hey you want to just win the challenge right now and stay on as a member we'll give you the 600 back as credit towards a membership you want to do that we close 70 to 80 of people on that and so if you follow the money it was just 600 300 12 year 12 month contract my cost of acquisition dropped by a tenth and um we would get 30 to one up front
(15:48) before our membership dues so the reason i was able to open six gyms in three years as a 23-year-old who didn't know [ __ ] about [ __ ] was because i was making so much money in the first 30 days i could open a gym sign a lease and have it completely full on someone else's money before the first client showed up and i had all the payroll staffed and paid for for the next six weeks before the eft kicked in eft is the recurring revenue [ __ ] all right and so it was simply by changing the offer i was i was still using the same platforms i was still the same salesman right but it was changing the offer so many more
(16:18) people clicked so many people more people bought we had so much more cash flow up front and i'll give you seven cool upfront offers that you guys can take home with you here's a different example b2b agency all right so a lot of agencies that are in the lead gen world for small businesses charge like 1500 bucks a month we switch that for the agencies that use our software to pay me once and then only pay me after that if someone shows up we'll generate the lead we'll work the lead will do everything if they show up to the appointment then you pay us how do you not like that right
(16:46) we went from the average agency getting half to one returns on their advertising to getting 11 to 1 returns before their retainer before before they got all the recurring revenue on the back end which means that they would make 11 to 1 in that 30-day cycle they could keep pouring cash in until their constraints were operational and not acquisition based all right so this is these are the actual numbers of this example because i thought this would be relevant for you so if they're spending ten thousand dollars a month this is
(17:12) before and after the same amount of impressions the response rate is what went through the roof it was two and a half times higher percentage of people who responded all right after that you had a higher result of people who are booking there we go look at the difference in appointments same same advertising spend same show rates closing percentage 2.
(17:35) 3x because the offer was better so we already have a 2.5 and a 2.3 on this thing let's see how far we can go and the price we quadrupled the price we're from a thousand down then 1500 a month to pay me 4 000 today and that's it you never have to pay me again unless someone shows up but that basically just means we got the first three months up front and then we still got paid two days later when the first person showed up and so the difference was making five thousand dollars up front off your ten thousand dollars announcement to a hundred and twelve thousand dollars up front up front an 11
(18:01) to 11.2 to one return before the back end kicked in is that like is everyone getting this like this stuff happens now okay so you might think that's so neat but how excellent question so when we're looking at offers there's seven things that i'm looking at so how can i how can i improve this offer so whatever it is if you're the business owners which is why i asked you to raise your hand you have control over this the first thing is what is the promotion it's either going to be free discount or premium all right basically if it's not a free or
(18:30) discount it's premium the second is the core offer which is the main thing it's the steak not the sizzle and i'll get to that i'll explain the difference in a second the bonuses these are the things that are provided in addition to the main thing dude scarcity we have x left and i'll show you how to do these even if you don't have x left and do it morally and ethically all right urgency i'll show you how to configure the offer so it feels like it ends tomorrow even though it may not necessarily end tomorrow but it does in
(18:54) the way that you can position i'll explain how all right guarantee i'll show you how to stack guarantees like if anyone have a guarantee i'll show you how to have multiple guarantees everyone's stack guarantees before very interesting i'll show you how all right and then seven is the magic naming formula so one of the cool things about this is that if you run this play over time it gets tired like the marketplace has seen it before and so i'll show you how to reskin the same thing over and over and over again
(19:18) that's what allows you to get evergreen lead generation so free so quick point on this if i'm starting with a new business i pretty much always start with something free and i do that because the first thing i'm going to do is always create flaw i create flow then i monetize the flow and then i add friction so if you're like man i'm so worried about being overwhelmed with leads i'm like well [ __ ] you all right so so the point is is that typically free offers will convert it five to ten times any other type of offer all right so i'll always start here and then try and
(19:50) use my brain to figure out how can i turn something that's free into something i can get paid for i'm going to give you seven offer structures to show you how to do that there's 19 in total you get the rest of my my book for 10 and this is where i start every business all right so that's free second is discounts one thing that's important to look at with discounts is that there's four different ways of displaying them all right so if you have a discount offer right now that's tired you can redisplay the same thing in different ways so you could say it's x percentage off you could also flip it and say what
(20:17) the absolute amount is off you can say the relative amount so it could be like it's enough to save your entire your entire month's mortgage if yours b to b or b to c um or or it's enough to get a steak dinner once a week in savings right so it's how to display the same thing in different ways right and then the final way is doing is just saying what the price is now versus what it was before all right so it's four different ways you can display a discount and that's what will keep your promotion fresh and then obviously finally is the premium
(20:44) offer um this is you know what i call straight for the jugular this is when you're selling your hundred thousand dollar day um what's interesting about when you do premium offers most of the time you just need to charge way more than you think you should and then these the economics behind this can get really wild because in terms of return on ad spend if i'm selling 100 000 500 000 million dollar things the other people i'm competing against usually aren't selling anything close to those types of prices and so that's how
(21:09) we can get 30 to 150 to 1 returns on advertising on a regular basis because if you looked at 36 to 1 that means half of my advertising has gotten me more than 36 to one return wild right and so it's because we we use premium offers but we layer them after so bring them in free and then we'll upsell them through premium stuff so that's number one number two is the main thing all right the stake most of times when someone is is is working on an offer of some type they've got some sort of service it's really boring and it's not very uh attractive right and so there are four
(21:40) variables to value that we've broken down after looking at this at a lot of times and look at a lot of offers the first is the dream outcome all right so everything on the top side of this equation is stuff that people value they want more of this this is great we try and increase this the bottom side of the equation is stuff that detracts from the experience that makes them less likely to want to buy all right so the time delay effort and sacrifice all right as i've studied as a quick aside as i've studied
(22:03) bigger more successful businesses i noticed that in my beginner days i focused a lot more here on promising more trying to paint this beautiful vision of the future when i look at netflix and amazon and these guys who are trying to make seamless experiences so that thoughts can become you know drones delivering packages that are door is they're trying to eliminate as much effort sacrifice and time as possible for their customers and that is how they're increasing value and so as we've shifted our businesses we focus a lot more on this now than we did here
(22:34) but just something to consider all right i'll give you an example of each one if i'm trying to get brad to give me money i'm probably going to say hey brad let me show you how to do this marketing stuff for lightspeed rather than hey i'm going to get you a six-pack why because for him he values that more and so whatever the thing is that you're selling the audience now for a woman it might be different right but for the avatar painting the dream outcome will increase the value right making sure that that once like it's to compare two different offers right b to b versus b
(23:02) to c once if you're comparing two things in the exact same market that are savings that are satisfying the same need i'll just use weight loss as an example because everyone understands that one then then you kind of move on to the next step in the equation the next is perceived likelihood of achievement so if i have somebody who's a plastic surgeon and they say they can do a tummy tuck and this guy's done this is his first surgery he's ever done you got another guy who's done ten thousand surgeries are you willing to pay more for the guy who's done ten thousand surgeries same surgery it'll actually
(23:29) probably take the guy to ten thousand even less time too because we value the perceived likelihood of achieving our goal right certainty and decreasing risk is something that we value so if you can think about ways that you can decrease the perceived risk in the customer's minds and i'll show you more tactics about that later but if this is where the social proof this is where the testimonials wall this is where the video the video that you have them watch watching the lobby of the of the lady whose life got changed all of that stuff
(23:52) will literally increase the value of what you were selling without having to do anything to it it's simply the perception of the value now that's the top side of the equation that's kind of the easy part i'll make you a lot of money and uh here's all these people that made money too right the bottom side is where it gets interesting so time to life there's two components of time delay to increase the value of the product that you're selling one is the immediate first first outcome so for example um if a girl comes to work out
(24:17) at the gym oh he's weight loss right and she feels better the first day she has she has an immediate value receipt of value right she doesn't look better but she feels better right and so you want to have some sort of first win early but the second piece is how long is it going to really take so and so to hit their goal right if it's going to take them a year if i can get if i can if i can shrink the time horizon then i will increase the value of the product from selling one of the easiest and best ways to make a product more valuable is look at what everyone else can do in a
(24:46) time period and cut it in half and then deliver that it's the easiest thing in the world to sell speed people love speed all right and so if we can shrink the time delay between when they buy and when they get our product becomes more valuable the next one is effort and sacrifice so if i'm if i'm trying to sell suzy q on losing weight and i say you've got two options here right option one is you can give up everything you love you can wake up at four o'clock the morning every day you can be sore as hell you have to eat separately from your family
(25:15) uh you know what i mean all the you know you got to have people laugh at you you got a brisk injury all of that stuff you know by the way it's going to take 12 months maybe right for you to get to where you want to go right or you can just breathe in some gas and wake up skinny which one is she going to pick right reality is that's why the same outcome is 50 000 for one and you got to arm wrestle someone for an hour to get closing for a thousand dollar deal for training or gym membership right it's because the same dream outcome has she knows she's probably not going to show up to the gym so her perceived likelihood of
(25:50) achievement's low she knows it's going to take her [ __ ] forever she's got to give up everything she loves right and she's gonna also have to it's like the only thing she's gonna enjoy is the fact that she feels better and that's it and so if you can look at these four variables within the context of what you are selling you can manipulate these to make the core thing more valuable simply by changing their perception around it so that's the main thing that's the stake right that's the main step that we're offering so first is we're going to try and figure out if we can do some sort of free or discount
(26:15) version the second is we look at the main thing to see if there's ways that we can make the thing more valuable third now notice when you have free or discount you can give away bonuses as part of the free thing and then upsell the core thing right which i'll get to in a minute but the bonuses are things that we've provided in addition to the main thing all right so for example when i used to sell those boot camps i was talking about earlier i was selling 99 month boot camp i was throwing everything i possibly could i was like i'll do your food i'll give you
(26:44) massages i'll drive you home like whatever you want please sign up right what's interesting is that if i just say hey you get the workouts but if you sign up today i'll also give you food preparation instructions and eating out guide you know grocery list i'll give you uh how to you know how to eat on the weekends how to drink alcohol and stay skinny like all of these extra bonuses but only if you sign up today all of a sudden my core offering which is literally the same thing i was doing before is perceived as more valuable and this
(27:11) is what it looks like visually because you make the ask after the core offer right if you're selling and then if they say no or they say need to think about whatever right that's when you start stacking because when someone sits down like the whole time the first thing you present after you've been selling this whole period of time that's what they anchor with so just like there's a price anchor there's a product thinker and so they think in their mind this is what he's been trying to sell me this whole time and so they're going to anchor okay well
(27:39) i tried to compare this price to this product but then what i do is you stack and stack and stack and stack and stack and stack and then all of a sudden the product the bonuses seem like such a steal compared to the thing that i originally mentioned that it's like why be a [ __ ] idiot to not say yes today so when you can stack this stuff it also gives you a really nice way to get around the whole discount thing so rather than rather than be like well let me talk to my manager and get you 10 off it's like well how about we throw this instead let me throw you this instead let me throw you this instead on top right and so that way it gives the
(28:10) sales guys like our guys have a huge vault of private client private access client materials that they can use to close deals and they have street value because they're listed right some extent so you can literally make products put them on your site you might sell it might not doesn't matter the point is that they're perceived as valuable and then you can sell something for two thousand dollars and give them fifteen thousand dollars of prizes whatever upsell the bonuses i have more bonuses there are always more bonuses i have lots of bonuses okay
(28:39) so that's the sizzle right so the steak and then that's the sizzle so if i'm looking at a business the first thing i'm looking at the promotion the next thing is i'm gonna see how i can adjust the stake and make it more valuable see if i can change and alter services around that would cut the time in half decrease the effort that they have to put in increase the likelihood that they think they're gonna achieve it and then right when they're about to make a decision i say oh by the way that's just this big let me tell you about all this other [ __ ] that we're going to do for you and they're like holy crap i'm definitely going to sign
(29:02) up oh by the way i only have two spots left and i have 16 more appointments this week so what do you want to do right and so then we have scarcity all right so there's three ways that i've seen how to do scarcity ethically all right one is if you actually have a limited supply that's awesome right but one of the things you can do is you can have a limited supply of bonuses so you don't have to say you have a limited supply of the core thing i could have limited supply of the bonuses that i'm giving in and i can
(29:27) re-wrap the bonuses in different ways re-skin them put on a new headline or whatever to change make the same thing different which i'll show you is the seventh step of this thing is re-skinning them so that i can pretty much always have limited bonuses that i can always provide scarcity with does that make sense yes okay so those are the scarcity pieces all right urgency this one is probably the one i use more than scarcity to be candid with you all right because i think it's easier to run on a regular basis so just a quick side note the difference between scarcity and urgency is scarcity as a
(29:56) function of units units or quantity urgency is a function of time people want to kind of lop them in together they're different all right so the first one and this is probably the one that i use the most all right is cohort based urgency so it's like hey we've got a new group of clients starting on monday you're not going to miss out we've got a bunch of awesome killers in that group right it's it's thursday right and they're like oh well i don't want to miss that group like yeah you should do it the guys are awesome just get started it just gives you this little nudge now when she signs up if she says no and
(30:27) comes back on monday i'm like you should see the nest group it's good that you missed this room because the next one's even better and it starts on monday right and so you always have this rolling cohort that can happen which you're probably already doing you're just not selling it the next kind of urgency is uh it's name based urgency so this is where you can reskin the same offer and say hey um this this promotion like you should enter promotions every month and just reskin them and then start it so that you just have this false urgency it's not false it's real
(30:52) urgency but it's saying the new year thing ends in our brazilian special foreclosure school ends january 31st well guess what we've got closers for lovers opening in february which then closes february 28th and so it's the same program it's just the promotion is different and the promotion can still even be the same price points you just name it different but that promotion is technically over right so you can happily get around um and use urgency and scarcity to your to your advantage the promotion of pricing and the bonuses themselves each of those to be exploding which leads me to the exploding piece which is the next one
(31:27) this is if there is a way right now where anything in your marketplace is sh is changing it's shifting um this this sounds like crazy if you can get like if you're for example if i was saying you know what it's not about newsfeed ads anymore it's all about inbox leads right because dms on social media you're getting direct to the decision makers and the software that we have does it for eight dollars and 33 cents a day and delivers 13 to 15 fresh leads in your inbox as anybody who responds back right but the thing is a
(31:56) lot of people can get in on this soon so you're going to want to sign up now so you can get a disproportionate amount of the gains right so this exploding opportunity is arbitrage so if you can think of ways that you have your own product and make it into an exploding opportunity it'll create more urgency to take action uh number six this is really cool so most people either don't do guarantees or just do one and they really lame boring guarantee but most people don't do two all right so i'll show you how this works so i got this closed from jason flatland
(32:24) and it's one of my favorite closes of all time and so when he's closing someone if he has her hat ever has a 30-day satisfaction guarantee love her to leave it whatever you want to say you say hey i'm not asking to say yes or no today i'm just asking you to make an informed decision which you can only do on the inside of the program which basically gets them to delay the decision by buying it's [ __ ] awesome and so if you ever have stuff like every single person if you have a 30-day lover to leave a guarantee you can basically get people to you can make them feel safe get them to say no hey would you be
(32:55) opposed to moving forward today i wouldn't be opposed to moving forward today cool because i'm not asking to make a decision right now i'm just saying i just want you to make an informed decision which only do once you start with us right and we can only make this kind of guarantee because we know we're so good at what we do and we know people would say otherwise we wouldn't be in business right right okay cool so let's get started so that guarantee is [ __ ] awesome and so if you can do an under conditional guarantee i would highly highly recommend it here's what's cool
(33:18) you can have an unconditional guarantee that's based on one timeline and then you can have a conditional guarantee that's based on another timeline so it's like not only that and this is the one that you make crazy all right so this is when you say hey not only that if you don't make 10 grand using my software in the first 30 day in the first 60 days i'll give you 10 grand because that's how i know it how good it is but you got to show up to every one of the calls that we have you got to make sure all your payments are on time
(33:45) you've got to xyz the things that are your activation points for your service or product the things that you know will make someone actually successful and then you just bake those right into your conditional guarantee and so they're like wait so if i love her to leave it and you're telling me that 60 days from now like if i don't achieve this crazy result if i do these three things then like that's all you need me to do to buy and there's only two spots left and so when we stack these things you can
(34:09) massively increase the closing percentages for the team and make the offer more compelling from a marketing perspective last one okay magic naming formula so how to name how to use the same offer and rename it reskin it over and over again this is especially important if you if you're in local markets so uh i'll give you i'll give you an interesting one so let's say you've got this this big bundle i was talking about the 360 challenge i told you about earlier right so let's say that that's our that's our original bundle it's fitness and nutrition stuff right
(34:39) then we call it the fall six week challenge then we call it our spring 28 day blueprint then we call it our halloween 42 day detox same exact thing it just keeps it fresh and so that way we don't have to change the operational structure of the business but we can constantly keep the marketing fresh all right okay and that's the uh that's what the magic stands for so it's the magnet which is make a magnetic reason which is why i like having a reason why of some sort it's like it's fall it's spring it's whatever right it's you know my kid lost
(35:11) a tooth it's our fifth year anniversary right which is a great one we just started running a fifth year anniversary ad that's why i'm running this offer and people like oh that's why he's running the office like i ran the offer last month too but now it's our fifth year anniversary right and the thing is is you can be like it's my wife's birthday it's my birthday it's my company's birthday it's like three times a year you already got birthdays so you can give reasons why for it right like you can always i always used to i always tell people think like a fraternity party planner just like you need this
(35:34) much to create to have a party it's like stu got his wisdom teeth out rager right so it's the same idea in terms of reason why okay so we have our magnetic reason we have we announced the avatar so we say who we're looking for so it's you know a little black dress which would prob that would include that would be implied sorry uh bad example uh six week you know guys uh you know lean down i said six week already and then the container would be like takedown or whatever right uh blueprint jumpstart kickstart you know sprint accelerator whatever right the point is that we put these things together now you don't have
(36:12) to have all of them but if you just have these on the back of your mind you'll always be able to spin headlines very quickly and name products and offerings um that will convert those are the seven things that i look at when i'm trying to adjust a business's offer to make the marketing more compelling and get more clicks check number two you guys with me so far we still good all right cause i'm about to show you one of the sexiest things that i have all right so i can guarantee everyone here that you will get more customers from the thing i'm going to show you so yes i guess a couple people moved around
(36:40) in their chairs fantastic this is our pond we have our little our little wormy guy and now we got to put in the pond so we got to find our pawns never go hungry again this is actually the the photo shop uh the ceo is like this is my never go hungry again framework so he has this posted behind his computer so he knows that there's always ways to get more customers you can take a picture of this because this is this is like my holy grail if i ever need more business this is where i go all right so you've got paid media you have earned media you have phone media you have outbound you
(37:09) have affiliates and partners in your referrals and i'll show you the the ways that we use each of these um i've i've done i've done 20 million out of every single one of these boxes except for earns media um so that's actually the one that and i'm just starting doing that now um but the other five or whatever um i've made over 20 million from each so i'll tell you like i'll tell you what we do right now that's working um and so yeah i'm going to show you a lot of [ __ ] here you're probably not gonna like just pick one or two that you actually will do and
(37:39) like if you do that then you can go to the next one like give yourself permission to do the next one if you just do one of them okay so paid media and i've got one for you in this one okay so remember we have our little equation we've got to make more in the first 30 days and it costs two buy two customers and fulfill two customers all right so if you if you don't have an action this is the action for you just spend 100 bucks a day on those lead ads that don't sell you all right if you do this give give yourself a slush fund
(38:02) there we go give yourself a slash fund one of the one of the early marketing mentors that i had told me instead of buying all these courses and coachings and whatever just say whatever amount of money you're willing to blow every month on advertising and then always spend it and that way it'll force you to do it and the thing is is you won't have your ego tied up and you're not gonna be like [ __ ] i suck it's like well i'm supposed to suck i don't know what i'm doing but you will figure it out i promise you if you actually just spend and i just recommend people start 100 bucks a day
(38:31) and you'll start to see some traction you'll watch some more youtube videos and you'll learn a lot faster than all the many many many things that you that are out there okay cool so these are the examples of paid media youtube facebook instagram influencer shoutouts is actually underrated podcast gdn podcast meeting you can get the insert the you can pay the person to basically say commercial like radio uh gdn search radio branded search is a hack that i'll show you in a second that just about everyone here is losing money
(38:58) all right it'll give you like your highest return on advertising so this is our advanced lead generation got a little magnety guy a little promotion then what we do is we give them some offer to liquidate our acquisition costs our upfront cash offer that's how we get all that money back we have two ups we have upsell down cell and every single this this is literally every single offer that i've home runs has been every single one of them has looked just like this and then we feed them in a condo day one two three four that's what we do over and over and over again so i'm
(39:23) gonna give you one cool this is probably this is the thing that i'm most excited about stuff that i love more than anything i literally wrote a book just on this one topic so these are free cash offers so you're like how do i make money if i'm giving something away for free excellent question brad there we go limited free this is an example limited free is someone comes in for xy service that you should always know more about your service than they do and give i don't want to say an incomplete solution but give a solution that's not going to i'll give you a simple example if
(39:52) someone were getting a car wash it would be like the the lowest bare minimum the car is not even gonna look that much better we'll look better but not that much better right or if someone is coming in to work out at the gym or rather if someone's coming to lose weight right i'll say you can have access to our group and we'll give you homework outs while they're at the gym and they're like but like or you can do our super sexy guaranteed results double guaranteed has all these bonuses and it's only this for you right now to start some money you should definitely get into it well guarantee you lose 10 pounds in the first 30 days if you don't
(40:21) we'll keep working you for another 30 days fair enough right and so that is someone someone comes in for something free we give them an inferior offer and then we upsell them the primary offer all right that's what we call limited free by the way you also don't even have to mention the inferior offer because half the time they don't remember more than half the time second one free with deposit that was the thing that i mentioned earlier if you ever have any kind of service that it requires effort on behalf of the customer to get a result anything that's a lot of services right
(40:51) you can market something for free and have that like if you did therapy you did life coaching you did anything that is some sort of like the client has to do something you have to pay for the program and then if they get the outcome or if they do the habits they can get the program free or rebated or credited back to them right towards future services does that make sense it's pretty cool this one [ __ ] kills this one is awesome i'm telling you this one is awesome this was made more money than any offer on this board because what it does is it
(41:20) aligns the customer with the result when they don't have the they use the money's accountability so your client's success scores go through the roof and it's like well marjorie if you lose 22 pounds in your first six weeks working with me are you going to keep you're going to want to come to me for the next 40 and she's like oh absolutely you're like well that's that's why we do the promotion so i'm not worried about giving you six weeks free if i get six years shortly right but if you follow the money from what i said earlier she got six weeks
(41:43) free because we took the money and we credit it against her future rate which you probably put up a little bit and then discounted it off the money that you got does that make sense threes okay giveaways giveaways are awesome the way you do giveaways properly have a first place prize and a second place prize this first place prize is your core offer it's your biggest sexiest most expensive package you do that because then everyone knows the price and you market you are going to give that one away for free and the second place prize is an acceptable discount
(42:12) and absolute value so for example if i was giving away god what services i don't know a year of window washing whatever right and it's the ultra platinum window washing experience whatever underneath of that let's say that was a four thousand dollar deal underneath that i would say second place prize gets six hundred dollars of window washes right you run the promotion you wait four days give them the countdown of when the when the person's gonna get to get called then you announce the winner pick one person everyone else congratulations you
(42:45) won second prize right you can put in the in the thing more than one winner may apply you're completely compliant all right and by doing that you give every single person a 600 off your 4 000 package neat this works really well you want to get leads this works okay free with prepay this is also one of my favorites so if anybody here has uh recurring services or bundled services if you're trying to get upfront cash which is this guy then you can sell like buy three get free and you can double the price for the thing
(43:20) so you're still selling six months up front basically but it's buy three get free for buy six get six whatever and that can go with products or to go with time it doesn't really matter but when you do this though you get so much cash flow up front you can you can pretty much out market all your competition it's very cool and churn on prepaid people is one-fifth of month-to-month people fyi splinter-free so if you have a type of service or work that has to be done in that's the same thing that has to be done multiple times
(43:51) so an example would be a chiropractor or a massage therapist somebody who has this who does the same service over and over again one of the best things to do is just do a splinter free offer which means you pull one of them off right ideally you want to pull one of them off and like tanning is a really good example i'll use that one like if i said i'm going to give you a five day free vip tanning experience person comes in they're super excited we say hey how tan do you want to get i'm going to show you this book of tana be like the chocolate one like okay well
(44:18) you look like vanilla so it's going to take us a lot more than five days to get there so you want to get there cool then why don't we just sign you up for a membership right because you can't tan five days in a row you tend once in five days because otherwise you'll burp because we know more about our service than our customer does so there's a lot of things that your customer wants but they don't know how to get there we can make promotions that in their mind it's like oh it's like five day weight loss it's like no one loses right but in their minds you can then
(44:46) educate them so they're better consumers and then make a better more informed buying decision once kim really understands that she's vanilla and she wants to get the chocolates take more than five days we're already here and you like me because i'm smiling and being nice she'll sign up right and so this offer works very very well you break off one piece same thing like laser hair removal you can't do one session laser hair removal you need all six right there's lots of things like that you can break off one or two and they can't really do
(45:11) that without the other ones that's you give the two for free because you know it'll bring them in and this one this is one of my favorites so for this event for example if i were to do invisible freight what invisible free offer is is i say hey you can come to this event absolutely free but you put your credit card in at the end of the event if you don't think it was worth five grand you just let me know after the first day and i'll i'll send you uh you know we won't bill your card but the upsell that you're selling right there's or
(45:40) you can pay right now for three grand and get all the recordings and and and so you have this thing that's marketed for free the down sell is they sign up for something more expensive right the down sell is they sign up for something more expensive that gets them less right and then you say if you don't think it's worth x y and z then we won't bill you but the requirement of that is you have to show up this works with like webinars too same thing if you if you're worried about people showing up there's also a great way to get people to show up right if you're ever doing like a pitching
(46:08) thing too now they have their credit card like there's different strategies to use this one for like if you wanted everyone to pitch you could down sell everyone into just staying and offloading it so you make the prices closer if you want more people to pay today make the price discrepancy bigger add more bonuses so if it's like 250 and 200 well then i'll wait i'll wait for 250 or 200 and then i get everyone to show up because the only way they can not get billed is by showing up and then you have everyone's captive attention you
(46:34) can pitch your ass off all right this is for brad so this is the easiest hack that everyone in the entire world can do that you probably aren't doing own your damn terms so this is literally on the on the plane today lightspeed lms everybody else is paying for your terms all these guys are they their marketing guys are doing it and you're here right so it's like i got gotta say no to all these guys before i see yours and then everybody who's got an android you're not even coming up right and so it's just like if you just own your brand of terms the return on on ad spend for branded terms is stupid it's like 20
(47:09) to 40 to one it's crazy and it's so easy to set up google how to set up branded search terms 10 minutes and then you can put all these in and guarantee you like all you do is you send them to a landing page that just says email opt-in phone number like simple because they're already looking for you they're just the lowest low toss leads out there but just make sure that they're seen so it's branded search you're just you're just literally owning your own keywords you say i want to advertise for bradley lightspeed uh lightspeed lms lightspeed
(47:37) training light speed like all the variations of that someone might be searching paid media number one you're like oh [ __ ] don't worry the other ones are faster okay earn media i'll just give you a quick strategy for this most you guys have lists and contacts all right so my recommendation from a strategy perspective is to do a quarterly push i'll just move a little faster for you so when you're doing content like you kill it with content right so the strategy that we see that works is just let them know what you do not a pitch just let hey it's bradley
(48:06) from lightspeed and this is what we do and if you're one of those guys awesome then we have all the value we give and by the way if you're one of those people that has this problem that we solve you should xyz right so you don't lose anything from those people when you do that on a regular basis and then this is what um most people are missing which is a quarterly push all right so that means once a quarter you do a four day blitz on your list and that's where you promote like [ __ ] crazy for four days and they shut it with real scarcity on an offer and that way you can click
(48:35) you can squeeze your list every quarter and most people aren't doing this so if i'm going to go buy a business or buy a piece of a business i'm looking through this checklist that i'm going through right now the offer the client finance acquisition for the math and then what traffic sources we're using and i'm just checking boxes i'm like oh registers let's get it in uh let's do this and i just keep plugging these holes and just like that at the end they triple their acquisition right this is just a checklist
(48:57) all right next one owns media this is actually very similar same concept this is from your followers where you're promoting it and saying it on your podcast here you're saying it's your list that you owe everything else is more or less the same all right the difference here is that this is email list messenger lists sms list blog audience contacts in your phone depending on depending on how many contacts you're from phone this is a really good one right now this is dean jackson's nine word email still one of the best emails like ever written it's called the nine word email because it has nine words in it and it says do you still need help
(49:27) getting that problem solved that's it you email your list that i guarantee you will get people respond back saying yes i do actually still need help solving that problem that you saw nothing else don't get like don't say by the way like nine words are you still struggling with are you still struggling with issue all right outbound just fyi i mean i know you guys are more in the sales sales world but we get ridiculous roi on outbound so we have a 20 outbound team my hack here is to use multiple forms i know that the software does that too but you get way better conversions if you
(50:02) contact on multiple channels all right uh from a strategy perspective really quick uh if you're starting out on this channel i just tell everyone 100 reach out today 100 a day guaranteed you will make more money and i give people six months when i give it six months like it snowballs but i haven't yet to have somebody not kill it within six months if they do that so that's just a simple strategy and it works very very well um these still work because i feel like people have forgotten this i don't know why
(50:30) at least in the marketing world everyone's forgotten about it so it's like blue ocean for us first thing to do is to call your own leads right seems obvious that sometimes people have so many leads i talked to a lot of marketers who've never talked to early system why so first thing to do would be to call your own leads um next uh i spent fifty thousand dollars in like coaching and programs and stuff to like learn outbound didn't use any of it i think the best thing is to just start because every there's enough nuances to every niche it's worth just like you'll figure it out and that's what we ended up doing anyways on our
(51:01) own um and then yeah give it six months and then we put ten to twenty percent of our i said marketing budget even though i said it didn't say but what we currently spend on advertising we put 10 to 20 of that towards outbound not expecting an roi for the first two months and it took like a quarter basically it took like a quarter to roi but now it's about 20 to 1 for us in terms of return which is really good okay all right affiliates and partners all right so if i'd say the ones that i've made the most money from one
(51:30) two lots and lots from these so one of the things that our goal here for this is to get is to be a full integration so a lot of people do like hey talk at my thing or do a webinar with me or do a podcast with me and that stuff's great but i mean it's like you'll see a little blip but i want full integration and so what i try to figure out is who has problems that i can solve so for example if i were going after personal trainers i would go after a software that caters to personal trainers i would find out that the biggest problem that those people have
(52:01) is that the trainers need their first five clients for the software for them to stick because people don't use crms if they don't have c's customers right you can't use the crm so if you don't have customers and so i can say hey mr software guy you've got 14 000 personal trainers and i want to sell stuff to personal trainers i know how to get them clients why don't you send them to me and i'll solve your biggest problem with activation and so the idea is i want to get into their onboarding process the reason
(52:25) prestige labs which is our supplement company which does more revenue than my gym company does is because we use the distribution base and integrated the supplement cell into the onboarding process at every gym that we work with and so when someone when kimberly comes in she buys services but 48 hours later we're doing a nutrition consultation we're selling them supplements and so that all of the marketing has been that all my partners are spending it flows through big and they're happy to do it because they get paid handsomely and i'm happy to do it because i don't have to pay for acquisition
(52:54) now there's two ways that you can use this strategy that i like one of them is what i just said where you integrate where they're doing the promoting and selling your stuff the other way is where you're doing the promoting and selling their stuff where you actually become the affiliate and if you're making if you were if you're not sending too much money away a lot of times it's a lot less work to just be an affair you can get 40 50 of top line revenue that you're sending over someone for none of the work most businesses don't run with
(53:17) 50 margins so if you can get 50 of top line and do none of the fulfillment and you're already paying for the traffic anyways why not and then if that person you're from the business owner also has that list you can you can say you know what i'll refer all those people over just send some people back right and that may sound silly but if you do it on a regular basis people will do it but you have to do it first you have to sell their thing first and then they will return it all right so um can't really see it but for prestige labs we have 4 000
(53:44) affiliates that are brick and mortar mom and pop shops that sell our products allen is the software that we use we have uh 200 or 400 now 400 agencies that white label our product and then sell it on our behalf and they make tons of money doing it we just make a little piece in all of it right and so it's how can i find ways to make other people money and then integrate so these are the quick strategies and then we'll get to the the six ways to make more money on customers um okay so this is a different example that i'll share with you so uh i
(54:14) was working with a company recently the hybrid for consulting stuff and they they catered a physical therapist and so they were like how can we do this partner integration and i was like well what do you what do all pts sell to every client that who uses physical therapists as a distribution mechanism to get to customers p to b to c they're like well orthotics braces like recovery bands all that stuff it's like right reach out to those companies and say hey give me ten of your guys i'll teach them how to sell your product
(54:47) in exchange for you just sending more of your guys for me to teach them how to sell your product i'll also sell them my product but i'm selling more of your [ __ ] for you people will feed you like tons if you can solve this problem for them so like if if you can because most you guys here know how to sell so a lot of people don't know their clients they have people who don't sell their products you can take their customers teach them how to sell their own product better and then they will feed people to you because you're solving their problem we kill it with this
(55:16) and primary action for anyone here who's an action taker you can do 100 reach out today or just identify the 10 biggest partners and then spend real money to get them like real money you know what i mean send them a tv send them a watch send them something they can't ignore show up at their office and should be like can i plea i just i've got bags of money i want to throw you please please let me just give that light to you because it's just burning a hole in my wallet right and usually people will take that that meeting
(55:40) also if you send if you send letters with like a thousand dollars a day in cash people tend to return the calls you do okay affiliate partners last one referrals and then we'll get to ltv so this is the golden ratio um 30 of our customers still come from referrals our goal is the companies to get the percentage of customers who refer to be greater than percentage of customers who leave if you can achieve this you have limitless growth it's just like the client finest acquisition of customer success if we can get a higher percentage of customers to send us someone than to leave our
(56:10) business will grow with nothing else and so that is our golden ratio so that's the goal with referrals so here are some examples of stuff that we do for incentives i'm going to give you a really sexy one right now so obviously this is the there's the cash one the unlockable bonus is something that's really nifty and so if you have a vip service or some sort of thing that's of value like those bonuses i was talking about like something that's really sizzle right it could be a it could be a software feature it could be a it could be a training it could be a it
(56:40) could be anything that you can think of but especially if it's something that gives status then you say hey they're like what are world those guys got those fancy bands like oh those are just for people who send us other clients who don't hate their friends you hate your friends because you haven't done this anymore i don't know why you hate your friends so much right and so when you do that it's like a it's like a classy way of paying someone without having to pay the cash tickets to events all those types of
(57:05) things work really well for referrals all right do you know anybody who's looking to achieve x that's probably one of the best um outbound openers by the way because then you don't feel like you're spamming someone and they're like you know what [ __ ] my sister i'm the one who needs to lose weight right and then they tell you okay uh cash bonuses integrated yeah and then i would make sure that you have this integrated in the onboarding process i know some of this stuff some of you guys may have heard of but you
(57:29) might still not do them every company that i like i work with they're like yeah yeah right ask for referrals i'm like are you like we've been meaning to like why aren't you where is it in the process right just show me where it is in the process and then we make sure it happens every time and then one of the biggest pieces here that's the last one i'll say about about referrals is from from human psychology as if i if i take brad to the airport right and i do cry out a favor immediately after the favor happens is when brad feels the most positively towards me and i actually feel is the doer of the favor
(58:03) like it wasn't that big of a deal six months later when we look back on that situation i feel like i did brad a huge favor and brad's like there's nothing send me the airport and so that is why people have these weird relationships with businesses sometimes when they leave because what have you done for me lately really sits in the thing is the person who's the doer disproportionately feels like they did more than they actually did so you have two different cognitive biases working against each other and so
(58:26) when you're doing testimonials or referrals the moment you have the activation point that first positive magical moment that you probably have choreographed in your customer onboarding experience that's when you ask does everyone know where like their big magical moment their activation point of like if someone does this then they stay 10 months longer or whatever does everyone know that is if you don't take your longest customers look at what they did in their beginning and then try and model that i'll give you one more
(58:50) does everyone feel like there's a lot of different ways we can get customers now six different pools do they want to have at least one of these that you're not doing that you could immediately just pull cash out of okay good uh most businesses would do very well if they just started up by picking the biggest pile of money in front of them most of us have these big bags of money that are sitting in front of us that we just don't pick up and so what i you know what i end up doing for these companies i just like let's start with this big pile of money and just take 10 minutes on youtube and get creative
(59:18) terms up within by by 5 o'clock today because it takes that long right and then you have leaflet i've lit i've never had less than 20 to 40 increase in number of customers from just doing one of these things i mean that should cover a lot of guys growth for this year all right so we got the math to how to require customers at a profit the offer on how to get complete strangers to say yes because it'd be stupid if they said no because of all the things you made where where to dangle that little double guaranteed super secret double bonus six week whatever in front of the in front
(59:48) of their name and then finally how you become unbeatable all right so this is where the numbers and metrics become really cool this is probably the part that i spent the most time on not because it's long but because it's sexy so how to become a beatle make so much money for a customer that you can use any channel you damn well please does anyone feel like it costs too much to acquire customers one person anyone else feel like it costs too much required customers two people anyone else three people four people five people okay five people this is for you guys everyone else chill the thing is is that eyeballs
(1:00:15) are never going to get cheaper than they are today think about it they will literally never be cheaper than they are right now and so if you feel like they're expensive now then what is it going to be in five years more expensive i can guarantee you that i will bet everything i have on the fact that basically more expensive five years from now and so this is the only lever that you can pull to be unbeatable so that you can outspend everyone that way you can use all of these channels because if you made a million
(1:00:38) dollars a deal you could use direct mail and still work use radio nationally and still work because you make so much more per customer right and so as much as this is an acquisition thing the back end informs the front end sometimes when i teach this i go backwards um so let's play a quick money game it really likes money games all right so this is the business genie exercise this is our sample business we get 30 new clients a month one client a day the average client stays with us for three months the price per month is
(1:01:07) 100 we currently have 100 clients we're at a point of equilibrium that means that we're not going to grow at this rate we're not going to shrink at this rate we're going to stay even we have 20 margins we're doing 10 000 a month which means we're taking home 2000 a month sad face this is our business in this business genie this beautiful icon of a business jd business gin if you will shows up and says i can double one aspect of your business which one would you like it to be it's very it's a niche genius all right
(1:01:37) option number one i can double the number of new clients that you sign up every month option number one option number two i can double the price of your product or services everything else is the same in all these examples choice number three i can double the number of purchases per customer which do you choose you only get one it's a business it's a business genie all right so do me a favor all right i'll do raise hands on choice number one choice number one this one double number of clients okay choice number two double price of product and services
(1:02:13) okay number three double the amount of purchases everyone makes all right so we have a really even split which is perfect all right somebody walk through some cool [ __ ] with you so if i double the amount of clients that i have right that i'm coming in then i'm going to go from 30 to 60. the math behind that means that i'm going to go if the business will double eventually right because the churn stays the same it's going to double and it's going to get to 200 clients at 100 a month so i'll make 20 grand the 20 margins is 4 grand so i double the
(1:02:44) amount of profit did everyone follow me with that yes cool so number three if i double the amount of purchases per customer it works out to the same thing because each customer becomes they buy twice essentially because they're buying two different things from us right so we're an easier way to say this in a recurring business would be you're doubling the lifespan of the customer they're buying twice as many times they go from three months to six months right we'd be cutting churn in half this is a different way of saying it right and so by doing this this has a slight advantage over number
(1:03:14) one does anyone know what it is you don't have mics i'll tell you what it is the advantage of this one is that your your ltv per customer is twice as high so now i can spend more on the acquisition right and so the point here is i'm making twice as much profit per customer i'm making twice as much profit in each of these scenarios from a business standpoint i'm making the same amount of profit but this is a better business because i'll be able to grow this one more easily now for this example i'm keeping all their variables the same but my marketing cost would be half on this
(1:03:46) one because i can acquire the same number of customers to get them to stay twice as long does that make sense okay if you double your price you make six times the profit so let me walk you through this if you're at 100 a month and your cost of fulfilling was 80 that's the 20 margin we double that we go to 200 and we're still at 80 to fulfill so we now have 20 and the 100 in profit so now we have six times the amount of profit as we did before and no one [ __ ] pays attention to their prices pricing's everything it's the number one lever on how much money you make
(1:04:25) so is that cool this is what we're going to talk about this is my probably my favorite subject so that is how important the six levers that i'm going to share with you are so when i said make them worth more it's an increase in lifetime gross profit now people have heard everyone hear the term lifestyle value it's defined a million different ways if you if you google it you'll see six different definitions of it so i will define this for you lifetime gross profit the purple is the juice all right that is what we that is the squeeze that is what we get at the end all right that's
(1:05:01) the chop that's the gross profit it's not the chop that's that would be not profit but the gross profit is the cost of fulfillment costing goods sold and then what is left over to them pay all the other should we have rent all the other stuff but it comes out of this right gross profit is 50.
(1:05:21) this isn't a good business by the way this is just an example because it's simple all right so i'm going to use this as kind of the case study for all the examples i'm going to give you and i'm going to show you every lever that i pull in a business to make way more money for a customer all right so in this business the lifetime revenue is 500 lifetime gross profit is 250.
(1:05:42) everyone's with me great all right so if you don't know how to calculate this in your own business does everyone know what their number is in their business lifetime gross profit per customer for everyone who didn't say yes here's how you do it this is the simple way and then i'll show you what if you have a recurring based business this is the simplest back of napkin way of doing it take the total revenue that you've collected since you started business literally just add up the bank statements times your gross margin we should already hopefully know what your margin is on the on the services you deliver
(1:06:10) which is like if you do services for example i pay extra hour it takes y hours to to get the result why hours compared to the prices is 20 of the price that makes sense if i sold personal trading and it was 20 an hour and i sold it for 100 bucks i'd have an 80 gross margin is that fast okay thank you so i've got the total money times the margin and then i just divided by the total number of customers i've ever signed up this will underestimate it but i'd always rather round down and then make more money but this will be the closest estimation because if you're like well we're better
(1:06:44) now than we were before cool that's okay you can always make more money but it's better to underestimate these numbers this is better if you have uh just selling products or like one-time purchases if you have a recurring business or a business where people will buy more often then this is the way you do it same top line the only thing is different is that you divide the bottom uh by total number of churned out customers so like if 900 of my thousand customers have turned then it's going to be divided by 0.9 which basically makes my ltb go up because 10 of my customers still are
(1:07:18) going to keep paying me does that make sense i know that was kind of complicated but does that kind of make sense i feel like a kinda all right just go with me don't worry all right so here's why this is so important this is probably my favorite quote of my own the business owner that can make his clients more valuable to his business than his competition wins all right i even misquoted myself but that's the idea all right so the idea is not like i'm not trying to outspend everyone i'm trying to make this human
(1:07:43) being more valuable to me than anyone else so that means that i'll be able to acquire him better than anyone else and so the more i can spend an acquisition the more channels will be opened up to me and then the more depth of the channel i can reach like if i get priced out of facebook when i spend what's like once i go past 300 000 of my audience because it's too expensive to reach the next part then i get priced out right so if i can spend more than i can keep going deeper and deeper into each of the channels that i have on top of that i can also get more depth in the actual
(1:08:09) market like market penetration because i can still outspend my competition right so if you can only spend a dollar to acquire a customer you'll probably never be in business and so but no one looks at this and like my marketing doesn't work it's probably because your business doesn't work right and that's the issue okay like even facebook which is free makes forty dollars a year on everyone crazy right haven't thought about like two dollars and fifty cents a month goes to facebook for when you log in for selling your eyeballs so this is what it looks like in real time so this is let's say this is a gym
(1:08:38) owner even though he's got a tiny business thing let's just say it's a gentleman so there's got you know he's got old spice marketing to him he's got he's got equipment manufacturers that's their ltv or ltgp excuse me uh then you've got apparel and then you've got software and then you've got gym launch me marketing against right well i cannot spend all these guys so this is what happens i own all of his eyes his eyes are mine because i can outspend all of them i'll just i'll artificially raise the prices
(1:09:10) so that they can't bid on his eyes so it's a ethical i don't know ethical it's a legal way to create a monopoly if i could make so much more money than the rest of my competitors then i can own every eyeball that's in my audience because i'll set the cpm so high no one else can bid i'll bid against myself to give them high does that make sense that's like position to [ __ ] you that's what the back end does okay and that's why i refer to lifetime gross profit as the arms race of business like if you have this you have the biggest stick
(1:09:40) so here's the six ways that i increase lifetime gross profit number one you can increase the price which we did in our little genie example that's just one of them the second one is you can reduce the actual cost of fulfillment and i'll show you some of the ways that we look at number three is you can increase the number of purchases that a customer does number four is you can upsell them which has two different types of upsells one is making something better the other was selling more of the same thing so one is quality one is quantity down sells is the opposite of that so it's poor quality lower quantity
(1:10:10) or fewer fewer and then six is cross sells so it's what's the adjacent need they're gonna have all right a lot of people just kind of lock cross cells and upsells together and i don't like to i think there's more nuance to them if you can think as you can think in nuance you'll act in new ones you'll be able to think more creatively about the business so increasing price this one's a quick one look at the difference in lifetime revenue and gross profit if i increase the price by 50 i doubled my profit i have this conversation with gym owners all the time on average we increase the recurring revenue by 38 a month the
(1:10:41) average gym makes 12 and a half percent net margins the average gym is at 129 a month so if i had 38 dollars and they're making 12 and a half i just 3.1x their profit they're like what do i care about 38 bucks i'm like i'm gonna triple your [ __ ] profit that's why that's why this is important so number one if there's a way to increase the perceived value that's what we do the bait the bait the offer all that stuff is so that we can raise the price that we can make more money number one i told this one be quicker they're just more visuals but they're fast fast and easy that's what my wife called
(1:11:11) me here we go so number one is if you have people in your company that are doing like basic administrative or even semi-skilled work you can outsource it for four dollars an hour to 12 pages and they do a great job just fyi so you can probably cut down your cost of fulfillment for a lot of the services that you sell or products that you sell and by doing that you still increase the margin which increases your lifetime gross profit which allows you to make more and spend more aggressively all right another one that we do uh is tools and software so like subtitle for example i've got this video guy that i
(1:11:40) paid that i paid that i used to pay to do all this stuff but now we can do other stuff right which is like automatically get the the things captioned get that nice like meme cover and like the progress bar it does it all of that all of that with a click of a button and so it's like well great well then now you have all this other time to do high value stuff rather than do this this kind of stuff design pickle things like that so there's software that can they can take a lot of the high value labor and just automate it technology so if you have tech so like our our our
(1:12:08) agency software for example makes chat responses you know it increases the chat efficiency of a person by about 100 x all right and so by doing that we make the cost of fulfilling lead nurturing 100th of what it would normally be and so i can sell it at a reasonable rate but it cost me pennies compared to what it cost my competitors and so when you have this type of advantage then i can make ridiculous profits because i'm pricing at market but it costs me nothing and so i have so much more room compared to everyone else and then forecasting if you're in a products business
(1:12:39) buying wholesale obviously if you have the cash flow we do that a lot on our supplement side just to decrease our description our cost of goods all right so this is what it looks like visually and then that's what it looks like so the top line didn't change but the bottom line did that's the difference this still is an increase in lifetime gross profit check box number three increase number of purchases here we go so number one is decreasing churn which is aka getting people to buy again all right so that is
(1:13:04) providing a better service doing more activation more onboarding etc number two is increasing the quality of the product next was increase follow-ups for repeat purchases all right so most people right now don't do any of this like there's so many ways to reach people so i told you like there's little pockets of cash right now in your business this is probably a pocket of cash for you just like literally just waiting for you just like okay increasing the follow-up and then finally uh increase client outcome to
(1:13:28) increase volume uh for rev share that was for you right and so if i can if i can increase the number of purchases effectively if i have a rev share thing then how can i increase the outcomes how can i teach them skills that will make them more money right so that they will in turn pay me more money all right and this is what that looks like so if i'm increasing number of purchases i'm not increasing my margin on a relative basis but on an absolute basis i now have twice as much as i did before is everyone thinking like the purpose of this is so that you can think about your own services and products and think oh
(1:14:00) that would be an easy thing that i could do right now just make more money right these are all the different ways you can increase the lifetime value of a customer upsells all right so there's two types of upsells number one is you can sell more of something one burger goes to two burgers number two is you can make a better burger you go from a small burger to a big burger or a normal burger to an organic burger whatever two different types of upsells so right now if you have a core service if you're thinking
(1:14:24) what kind of upsells can i do can i sell more of it can i sell a better version of it those are easy things a lot of times you just survey the customers asking what they want all right so when i'm thinking about upsells number one is units i can sell more web pages if i was selling a web page service now i can sell more types of pages right number two would be like if i'm selling service i can sell it by units of time so i've got units in terms of quantity and i also have time so if i'm trying to upsell for more i think about both of them right so right now if you have
(1:14:53) different things inside of your business like if you're currently selling support why don't you sell 12 months of support why don't you sell 24 months of support if you're selling one one site why don't we sell a 10 tab website it's units right there's always more units you can sell if you think if you think you're a problem next one is survey says morse this is what it looks like visually boom so now you'll notice again this is the same duration of time they're not staying longer necessarily but we're getting them to buy more of the same thing that's why the margins are the same right i'm going to show you
(1:15:25) a different example later where the margins are different all right so now this is the second type of upsell which is better all right so you've got let's say normal service and that could give you expert service that's quality right a different version of quality just because i like to give examples is the enhanced burger like i said earlier before that you've got web page design and then you've got web page design that loads really fast speed remember they said the value equation these are the values quality
(1:15:56) time decrease after preference degrees effort and sacrifice decrease time right those are the things that you're reversing when you're thinking about your upsells right another version of this if you have a slow burger or a fast burger right you can wait 20 minutes for you to get in three it's more valuable right so you can upsell that same with service do you have chat support where do you have phone call support that's an upsell right so that's access and convenience and in the burger example are you are you eating at home or is it
(1:16:25) getting delivered all right so if i'm thinking about upsells for enhancements that are better you've got quality you've got speed and you've got access and convenience so right now does anyone can anyone think of something they should be upselling that's one of these things in your own business great awesome so pro tip is anyone here competing against somebody who gives their stuff away for free like what you sell sometimes it happens in software so if you're ever competing against a free competitor
(1:16:52) the only thing that beats free is speed fast beats free if once a year chipotle gives away a free burrito to anyone who dresses like a burrito and if i want to get chipotle on halloween i gotta wait two hours if there was a line next to the free line for ten dollars to buy chipotle i would pay the ten dollars to not get the free burrito and wait people pay for speed so fast speed's free a lot of people think about the components of time for their offers okay with better it's the same concept all right but you'll notice with this upsell
(1:17:27) i can make much more profit right and so interestingly your upsell can have a lot more profit than your core offer cam right which is pretty nifty i have the numbers over here if you're seeing them in the hypotheticals and so this is a quick pro tip for you as well if you are doing upsells many times you want the upsell price to be five times the core offer price here's why customers are fractal they're 80 20.
(1:17:59) so it's the pareto principle right and so 20 of my customers one out of five if i want to double my revenue i 5x the price so that one out of five buys my five times higher price and so i double the revenue my business by adding a single upsell but i might have way higher margins on my outsole that i have on my original so i might 2 or 3x or 4x my profit by having that upsell down cells so this is an easy one that [ __ ] no one does um there's two types of down cells the people that we're going to say no that then say yes and the second is people who are going to leave but then stay all right and so
(1:18:27) think about all these as little golden bb's in the business pro tip for this is if you're if your sales guys for example never sell the the low cost things they get on the phone and the kids like just you have this thing they never sell it we do a we do a we buy you lunch it's the simplest thing in the world we say who's buying lunch today and so if anyone sells our low-cost product because everyone every once in a while you get an unqualified lead you can't buy the real thing right and so whoever sells the the lowest ticket thing that day the lower ticket thing the down sell lunch is bought in that
(1:18:57) sales guy's honor it worked better than commissions they were just happy to get stick you know steak or grub hub every day and so they just motivate them every morning to try and get to get lunch covered for them so a downsell you have a worse version right you have one on one you can't really see it here and then group right version of whatever the thing you have is the level of support you might have a full suite solution and then you can have a done with you or a do-it-yourself solution so you have different levels of service that you're gonna you're gonna put with it okay and
(1:19:26) so let's say in this first example someone says no and then says yes so they say no to the core offer so we make no money and now we make an extra and here's what's really cool the down cells oftentimes for us are actually higher margin so we sell stuff that has almost 100 margins for our down cells so even though we make less absolute money we still usually do a pretty decent profit on it right and so and that's natural because they're going to be buying something that is lesser naturally right so you don't want to give something that's like equal or still costs you time and money on a down
(1:19:55) cell all right so the second one is uh instead of getting them to leave we get them to stay and so we say hey i know you were at this level support we'll let you stay for this now we're going to remove one thing that you don't care about and so you probably have more than one service or feature that you offer remove one and then give it to them at the lesser price that way you can ethically say that you're not charging different rates for different people so make sense which of these things catherine do you hate that you never use this one great knock
(1:20:21) it off now you can get it at this price because especially like software you'll get a lot better you'll you'll extend the ltv to the customer last one cross-sells everyone talks about these i'll show you a couple cool things with these that we do okay what are all aspects of the customer journey immediately before and after purchasing permit what is their next national need so this is the question so if you're looking at your customer journey what is the thing that they normally do immediately before they start doing business with you and what is the thing
(1:20:48) that they do immediately after they start doing business with you after they purchase there's usually a next natural thing there's lots of pairings that happen with with sales right there's like you you made them make the decision to do or invest in something right usually there's other stuff that comes as a result of that decision we did the hard work of spending money to acquire the customer getting on the phone doing 16 follow-up calls to get them to close then get the rest the [ __ ] money around them right and so there's two ways to do this
(1:21:16) number one is you can refer the business out and receive commissions we do this all the time we've made millions in commissions just for sending business that we say hey this is our preferred partner this is who we recommend and just like i told you earlier if i'm sending these guys business they'll send business back right and i'll get paid on it so i'm sending business getting paid and getting customers as of goodwill does that make sense yes okay um number two is that if if it's like a lot of money that you're referring away so for example with the gyms we taught
(1:21:45) them how to sell supplements i saw i did the math in my head and i was like there's a lot of supplements so let's build that so we decided to build that right the entire business ended that's what um alberto is doing with the mortgages he's doing the bank now because he's referring that business out and at a certain point you look at the math and you're like [ __ ] we should be owning that right we're sitting these guys these guys are making more money on our customers than we are if that's ever the answer these guys are making more money than my customers than i am then
(1:22:09) that makes sense to do business most times they're not so i might as well just take 30 20 40 commission and not have to deal with a headache but still get all these little revenue streams right i'm an affiliate for like 20 different things that we just get paid for every single month because we would tell them to do it anyways so like susie signs up for the gym well i'm going to tell her well hey they become affiliates of ours for the supplements because they refer the business right but it's like what
(1:22:34) apparel grants because they're going to be like what things my hands are hard what gloves should i use here's here's my book of all of my affiliate links i'll buy them with you together and just like that we made another 200 on the customer that took no effort right so there are these next natural things that your customers are buying know what they are and then just provide them for them ahead of time and get paid for it so cross sells the simple answer simple simple example burger do you want coke with that right it's different it's not another burger or a better burger or a faster burger it's a
(1:23:05) coke right if i'm selling fitness it's all fitness would do you want supplements with that yes right next version if i'm selling website design i say hey now that we have your website do you want to get advertising with that hey do you want premium support with that right these are all next natural needs they're going to have do you want ads and premium support and fast cloud service hosting whatever the you know tech stuff whatever more of that stuff right all of these are cross sales that we'll use and so if you can list out the customer needs and think about before and after that's
(1:23:34) the easiest way to think about it then you'll be able to capture all of this gold in front of you all right and so this is where a lot of the juice is squeezed you go from you know you had 500 revenue 250 in gross profit to you know 520 just by this example right because you have a ton of extra margin of these i think i have an example right here so i don't know if you guys know this i stole this from digital marketer you can actually build an entire business off cross-cells so if your core product doesn't have enough juice in it you can actually mark it down
(1:24:04) below the competitors give it away for free or at a loss call a loss leader and then upsell the coke and the fries because you know that's where all the profit is right you make the better burger you sell it at cost or below cost and then so you said this is the example you spend a dollar ninety one to get a person to drive through earn 18 cents in gross profit right on the burger but then you make on the two dollar burger sale but you make a dollar fourteen on fries and coke right you're making six times the profit on the upsell so if you know these things about your
(1:24:34) business and you know that there's an adjacent thing that's way higher margin and easier for you that you're usually just referring it away well hey make sure you're capturing it and b if you're not then bring it in-house so that was the six i'll do i'll do this real quick for you so you can see it and how you make your customers more valuable and be able to use any acquisition channel you download please so that is that is the six of the arms race of lifetime value there we go check box worm guy math traffic offer money those are the four frameworks that we use to go from a thousand dollars to 112
(1:25:03) million in sales in 44 months you guys good with a quick wrap-up yeah okay fantastic so i know we covered a lot we talked about the only way to grow a business there's only two get more customers make them worth more right we talk to the four frameworks we got the math how to require customers in a profit the offer how to get complete strangers to raise their hands and give you money uh number three how to never run out of customers because there's unlimited different pools that you can go through and then the money how to
(1:25:26) become unbeatable on the back end this is the mass framework that i showed you guys earlier hopefully this should now make sense to you in terms of how you can actually make a profit with zero dollars up front on acquiring customers the number one formula that is literally been the base system which i built my acquisition life how it works in a day-to-day basis from day to day today as you're doing this process uh the offer itself right the seven components that i look at uh that i can kind of boost any of the offers i have adding guarantees recycling the you know recycling the naming formula adding
(1:25:55) urgency adding scarcity uh making the core offer smaller adding the bonuses making sure that the core offers solving the four main value drivers um seeing if i can offer free front end or discount front end so they can attract more customers um the value equation itself we can always use and think back to to make your core thing more valuable there's the visuals for those scarcity urgency guarantees magic naming formula the traffic we talked about this the six different new client sources the boom if you didn't get that picture earlier and then the make them worth more that's
(1:26:28) the equation that we use for if you have a simple business or a recurring business there's the equations to calculate it and then you can always measure against that we now know how much more powerful pricing is compared to adding more customers we're getting them to buy more both those things are good this is the biggest lever in your business so i showed you six ways to make more money the customer that's the top one six ways to increase ltgp increase price reduce cost increase number of purchases upsells downsides cross sales getting down cells you can either get
(1:26:57) them to stay longer or just turn to no into a yes from that all the different versions of the cross cells that exist not that you can think of which is always the next adjacent need so let me ask you a quick question let me ask you a slow question do you feel like you could use any of these frameworks yes do you feel like you understand how to acquire customers profitably and grow without capital for those of you who don't have the capital spent do you feel like you could create a more valuable offer that would get more conversions at higher prices now
(1:27:27) do you feel like you have new client sources that you have neglected and can easily use right now even if you use just a single piece of a single framework to get you more customers or make them worth more would you say our time was well spent yes awesome thank you for having [Applause]

Transcript:
(00:00) Remember that friend of yours who got rich dropshipping, day trading, buying crypto, and wholesaling all at the same time, right? Me neither. And so today, you'll watch a single mom of five who could potentially be making much, much more, but she keeps launching new businesses and she's incredibly spread thin and overwhelmed.
(00:16) If you've ever been in her situation where you have constant FOMO and you keep chasing new opportunities, this video might save you years of your life. Let's just start with playing the clip. So last year, my company made a million. I've already made a million this year, so I think I'm on track for four, but I hope to hit 10.
(00:31) So, here's the deal, okay? Is that I get really bored, right? And so, I'm also a really amazing visionary. And so, I've built a lot of different things. And what I'm needing right now is I need clarity, okay? And I need you to I would love for you to help me focus. Okay? I'm going to share with you what I've done.
(00:52) I'm going to share with you what I have. And then what I would love for you to show me is how do I get clarity? Okay. What do you sell? Yeah. So I have a publishing house. Okay. But really what I've sold is that I take people on these fiveday adventures, like luxury adventures, and I can help people channel their books in 5 days.
(01:09) And that's what's filled my pocket. But it's also just not scalable. And why is it not scalable? Well, because one week a month I'm on these adventures and I love it, but it's like there's like a ceiling. And so then I like rented this island in the middle of the British Virgin Islands. I took 15 people there. We all write their books for five days.
(01:29) And so that was like scalable, which that landed me a TV show. So now I have like this TV show, but then I have like like my publishing house. And then like I have this business school for women. Yeah. And then like I'm also like a single mom of five kids. Also, I like write books on the corner.
(01:48) Also, I did a live event in January and closed 1.25 25 million in five minutes to a crowd of 30. So it's like I have all these things I just like I just need some So she's got a lot going on as you can imagine. But the thing is is like before I had kind of like my big entrepreneurial breakthrough. I had my six gyms.
(02:13) I had a chiropractor uh agency. I had a dental agency. And then I had the turnaround launch business where I was flying out and doing done for you sales. So I had nine different businesses and I was doing around the same revenue that Kira says here. I was doing, you know, a few million dollars a year. I was so spread thin and so overwhelmed.
(02:29) And the thing is is like if you want to unlock like super super success in my opinion, you have to concentrate your energy like you have a magnifying glass from the sun. Think about your potential or your intelligence or your work ethic as like the size of the magnifying glass, which is the more you know sun it captures. So you have potential, but it doesn't matter how big the magnifying glass is that's capturing the sun.
(02:49) If it's not focused on one point, it's not gonna do anything. Yeah. You gotta pick. You got to pick one of your five kids. The 10-year-old all day. There you go. So, you just got to you got to think about which one's the 10-year-old of your businesses. The thing is is the more talented you are, the more opportunities you know you could crush, which just means more things you have to say no to.
(03:13) And it's just like it's the reality of it. I mean the thing is is there's a price to that which is um if you continue to doing what you're currently doing you pay a price on either side on if you continue you pay the price of how big the impact you want to have and how big of a business you ultimately build. That's the price.
(03:31) What you get for that trade is you get to have the novelty and the excitement of new things happening all the time. On the other side, you build something really big um that has teams and systems and it just, you know, grows really large, probably maybe maybe not bigger than your vision, but large, much larger than what you have right now.
(03:51) Uh and what you give up for that um is all of the novelty that's associated with doing your things. Yeah. So, which one? Well, it sounds like you know which one you should do and you want to do something different. I feel like when I when I've been looking at like, okay, well, what has brought people to me? It's always the books and I keep trying to get out of it because there's so many people and there's so many things and all these systems in publishing and I'm like, but if I just ran the business school, like I don't have to have all these like editors and
(04:22) formatterers and book covers and Right. But then I look at like, well, what do people always come to me for? It's always books. Mhm. Yeah. This is, you know, Alex's two cents. Well, you're on my channel, so I guess I guess it's okay for me to share my two cents. There's big visionary stuff, and then there's just kind of like real everyday business.
(04:43) And so I'm going to give the real everyday business perspective on this. Go where the money's at. If everybody comes and says, "Hey, I want to give you money to do something." Or, "Hey, I want to buy this thing from you over and over again." Listen, that's feedback from the marketplace to use the, you know, fancy business jargon.
(05:00) If everybody comes to you and says, "Hey, please solve this big problem for me. You're really good at it and I don't know any else who can do it." It's like, "That's amazing. Means you can build a business around that." In my business career, every business I've had has not been like the thing that I thought it was going to be when I started.
(05:15) Almost every time I have this idea of like, "Oh, wouldn't it be cool if," right? And then what happens is I end up going to the marketplace and people are like, "I actually want this." And I'm like, really? Huh? Wild. Okay. And so I have to sometimes it's massive pivots that end up happening. But it's like you need to be a blood hound for for for value.
(05:34) And the way that you are a blood hound for value is you solve other people's problems which they give you which you know you've solved them because they give you money to do it. If I have three different doors that people can come in and they keep knocking on one and I'm like don't why don't you why don't you buy two or three? Two or three are great.
(05:49) It's like well they're like I just want one. instead of just being like trying to get them into two and three, just crush one and then remove all the other doors and then go all in on that. So, you run the business school, right? Yeah. So, imagine I come to you Mhm. and I'm saying, "Hey, I've got this business that everybody wants to buy from me. It has good margins.
(06:06) I sell it like crazy, but I have like four other businesses that I want to start. They don't grow as quickly as this other one. What should I do?" Weird. Sounds so easy when you say it. Yeah, obviously. Right. Right. Right. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. What you're encountering is a is a problem I think everybody in this room has dealt with, right? It sucks.
(06:32) It's like you have to realize that like you can't pursue every opportunity. Not only can you not approach every opportunity, you basically have to say no to every opportunity to be able to make one opportunity worth pursuing. If my TV show is on Amazon Prime and I'm helping people write books and then I'm like, but I'm pushing my business school.
(06:49) Like, that doesn't even make sense. Yeah. I wouldn't push the business school. Just have the media asset of Prime that pushes you writing books and then help people write more books and then have a second season of Amazon Prime helping you, you know, people writing books and then sell more people writing books. Yeah. All right.
(07:07) Like, that's my financial adviser on the front shaking her head. We got this, Julia. Yeah, Julia was like, "I've seen the financials on the book one. Like, do more of that." Right. I had these these massive multi-year plateaus where I just stayed stuck because I wanted to pursue every single thing. Yeah.
(07:24) And so, you have to trade novelty for loyalty. And so, it's like you become loyal to the business. I also think that occurs with relationships like you make the trade the new person everyone, you know, every week, every month, every whatever for somebody that you know that you've built something meaningful that's deeper, right? And I think that you it's kind of like I think business in a lot of ways is like a fine wine where like you understand it at a different level um as the years go by and you go through different seasons. And I think that you
(07:48) miss out on that opportunity if you're going after you know one night stands and flings from a business perspective. Do you know my life? Yeah, you have to like life will not give you what you want if you want everything. Damn. like we we have to make trades or we get nothing and it's tough.
(08:12) And I think there was a big I had a big realization I want to say a few years back where um once I realized how much work it takes to make something truly great and something big. I had this moment of like deep sadness where I realized that I could only do a few things throughout the rest of my life.
(08:27) I was like, "Oh, I only have like two maybe three entrepreneurial seasons left in me." Yeah. Which is kind of like crazy to think about. It's like I only get two or three more big swings. That's it. And the real real is that if the swing just keeps going, which is what I plan on doing, acquisition.com, it's like this is it.
(08:43) I'm going to do this until I get too old to do it. And that's it. That's all it is. Now, what I want to do is give you something tactical. All right? Because that's this is we were all the way up here. You have to take your creative energy, and I have a lot of that, too. Um, and you have to channel it into something that is accreative to the business, something that adds value rather than something that detracts value.
(09:01) And so, what are the components of the business that need novelty on a regular basis? Um, I think I can give you a hint. What? Marketing. Marketing. I was just going to say sales and marketing magnets. Yeah. Like, so if you want to build and you want to create, I have the same itch. Yeah. I put all of my ADD into content.
(09:23) I've become a significantly better entrepreneur by making content because it distracts me from [ __ ] up my business. This is legit. I just wrote a book about this. I just wrote a book about when leaders get bored, they just [ __ ] it all up and burn down the city. Yeah. And I just keep doing it over and over. So instead just like just paint the city. Okay.
(09:43) Just paint it. Don't destroy it. Just paint a different color. Got it. And so that like and that goes for everyone like my my ADD like I put it into ads. I put it into like the reason I write books is mostly for me. Like Ila's like can you just write another book? Because she's like you're just getting into all of these things that you should just not get into. Right. Yeah.
(10:00) And so the thing is is that when I am in writing mode, the business does exceptionally well because I do so little. Yeah. Right. Feel this. Yeah. I don't normally um talk about this, but I think this will this this feels incredibly relevant. So this is going to feel real for you. Yeah. Uh and everyone else. So let's imagine the business like everyone's revenue here represents this like this this line your revenue not aggregate but like this is that's your business.
(10:27) That's normal business that's happening. What I realized, this is me, so this is anecdotal, is that whenever I decide to make a change in the business, I see about a 20% decrement or decrease in performance um from whatever that change is. So I change a sales process, I change a leader process, I change an onboarding process, I change something that I have to train people up on something new.
(10:47) Now, even if that change is something that I think is superior, I'm still going to have an immediate decrease in performance. Now, what what if if I if I assume this to be true, which in my experience, it's been about 20%. So if you're like what's the data research behind it? It's Alex doing this. All right. Now if I think that this improvement is going to make let's say a 5% improvement in the business like I think this will you know improve our our closing rate by 5% or something like that then I'm going to take a guaranteed 20% loss for a potential 5%
(11:17) increase. Bad trade. Now how many months is it going to take me in order to make up for the 20, you know, 20%. It's going to take four or five months, right? And it's gonna Now, here's the really fun thing is that on an alternate timeline, you have this thing, but when you leave people alone, they tend to just get better at their jobs. So, you'll get the 5% improvement.
(11:40) And so, what's happened is that I've actually created this rule, which is that if I don't see a an adjusted a riskadjusted 20% improvement. So, let me explain what I mean by that, which is I need to see a 40% improvement that I think has a 50/50 shot at happening for me to make any change at all. Damn. Let's say that you are going to run a test of some sort.
(12:08) You want to change your sales process, change something on a landing page, you want to I mean change anything, right? You have some belief that it's going to improve, right? You wouldn't do it unless you thought there was a chance that it would improve the business, right? Of course not. But the thing is is that what is that chance? And so your ability to estimate I think we have a 50-50 shot.
(12:25) I think we have an 8020 shot. I think we have a 2080 shot that this actually works then allows you to over time get better and better at estimating what the potential upside is for a given intervention. And so if I know something is going to go down by 20% no matter what because I change something and that 20% decrease comes from training team and people kind of dealing with change.
(12:45) That's the price tag of trying. So the thing is like you don't have unlimited shots. So people talk about testing all the time. Test test test. Yeah. But there's also a cost to test. And so if you think you can maybe run only one test like even on even on something that's automated like landing pages. If you change multiple things at once, you don't know where the the the correct attribution is like what actually made the benefit or the the decrease, right? And so you really only have like 52 tests a year. You've got about one a
(13:13) week that you can maybe do with sufficient volume of traffic. Right? Right now maybe you have two or three different areas you know funnels that you could do it on but even then there's actually significantly fewer tests that you can run. Now in the people side of the business it is way less than one a week.
(13:28) You're talking okay maybe you think one a month. I don't know. It's like we just did this this month. Are we going to really change the process again? So maybe you've got like one a quarter. So you've got like four shots maybe that you're going to change in a department in terms of a true change that's going to occur in terms of process.
(13:44) And the thing is is most entrepreneurs number one don't think about it like they've got a punch card that only has four changes on it. And so I kind of like this from the Warren Buffett's perspective of like picking stocks and investing. He said if everybody just had a punch card where they could only make 20 investments their whole life, people would do it exceptionally well because it forces you to actually think, am I really buying this company? Am I really doing it for the long term? Do I really believe in this? And so to the same degree you as
(14:06) an entrepreneur, we've got like one punch a quarter. And the bigger the company is, sometimes it's even fewer than that. And so if you only had you're like, "All right, is this the is this the bet I'm going to make?" Like this is the shot on goal that I want to take of all the different bets, all the different ideas that I have.
(14:21) This is the one that I think has the highest upside and highest likelihood of happening. And so by me shifting my perspective on this and when I when I have so I have this big massive list of ideas, which we'll talk about in a second in the video, um I put an estimated value next to it. I think how much do I believe this could improve and how likely is it? And so when I have that, I can rank order these and then when we do have bandwidth, I'm like, "Okay, I think it's time to try this one.
(14:48) " But it's better be worth it because the price tag no matter what is that your business gets worse. And so I have a list right now. Mhm. Um it's Alex's big list of ideas. Yeah. Which I encourage you to have. Okay. And I have it. It's on my phone. Um where every time I think of something else that we could do to improve this business, instead of messaging the team and saying, "Hey guys, emergency meeting.
(15:08) We're going to do this. this is such a great idea. I just write it down. Yeah. And I just keep living my life. Okay. And every once in a while I'll have one where I'm like, this is actually a 40 50%, you know, potential move. Then I'll go to the team and say, here's my reasoning behind this.
(15:31) And then they'll say, cool, you have four other 50% return moves that you've told us about in the last 30 days. is this better than those ones? And then I'll look at it, be like, no, it's not better than those ones. And so then I'll keep it on my list. And in the event that the entire team has bandwidth and they're all breathing a little too easy, then I can go destroy their worlds, right? But what's ended up happening is that my businesses have improved so dramatically by me just saying, let's just let's just let people do their jobs. And so I'm
(16:02) gonna be crude yet again just to emphasize this point, which is that I have grown to accept that some [ __ ] stays [ __ ] Yeah. And so there are tons of things about the experience that you guys went through today. Hopefully it's been really positive between yesterday and today. I hope it has been. The team was great.
(16:18) But there's probably a hundred things that I want to improve about it. But every time I want to go improve one of those things, four others drop. And it's not worth the cost of change. And so most of us just don't factor in the guaranteed 20% decrease for the potential which we are usually overly optimistic on. I think this will be 40%.
(16:39) But then after it is all said and done it's five. Was that worth it? No. And so hopefully this is not you know this is I'm not just talking to you. I can see a lot of heads nodding. Um this has been one of the most useful razors that I've used as an entrepreneur and it has made all of my business significantly better.
(16:56) I realized that there was this decrease in performance every time I change something because I have had enough fast speed fast feedback loops across different departments. And so like if we have something in sales and I want to change the the sales process, I know that the first week we change something in the scripting, even if we think it's better, the team's going to take a second to adjust, right? Like they have muscle memory.
(17:20) They got to rebuild that muscle memory. um when we would you know even change an onboarding process like I know that people are going to drop the ball they're going to mess something up in the beginning but then like they got to get their reps in and they can fix it um in the advisory practice which has been you know um super successful at acquisition.
(17:37) com helping you know helping businesses scale uh that aren't necessarily like you know ready for investment um we've been able to like you know tweak many things about the process but I do know that every time we do make a change I can see the decrease in performance before I see the increase. Now, we do get to the increase, but every time I I have to bear that cost, I'm like, h, I don't know if I want to change something again.
(18:01) And I think a lot of reasons that entrepreneurs don't realize it is because they don't track. And so, we are I will say like one of the things that we're pretty good at is like we're very good at tracking data at acquisition.com. And so, we have a very I I have very good metrics that get pumped to me. And so, I can I can I can see the pain.
(18:18) And if you're too far away from it, you don't see the change in customer satisfaction, the change in NPS scores, the change in, you know, ascension rates, the change in churn, the change in whatever it is. If you don't have real-time metric, if you're looking at something on a monthly basis and you make a change and then the next week like again nothing happens, the next week nothing happens.
(18:36) Then you get, you know, numbers in reverse, you know, one month or three months later and they're not even necessarily accurate or they're very vague or they're fudged and they're or there's multiple data streams that are conflicting, right? All those things make it very difficult for you to see clearly the cost of the things that you're doing.
(18:51) But the real real underneath of this is that the vast majority of entrepreneurs are changing so many things so often that they never know what was the thing that broke besides them. And so tactical takeaway for you is number one, channel your ADD into the stuff that benefits the business by being creative.
(19:08) Number two, make a list of all your crazy ideas when they come up and don't tell anyone about them. Okay? And if it seasons for two or four weeks and you still think about it, it's like maybe when you go to the store, you're like, "Maybe I'll buy this dress." I don't know. I'm just pretending to be a girl for a second. And then you decide not to.
(19:21) And it's like if you still think about the dress a month later, then go back and buy it. But in the moment, if you buy it, then it's usually a terrible decision. And so it's the same thing with this. Put the list down, sleep on it. If you're still thinking about that idea a month later, it probably has some legs. Yeah. Right.
(19:35) And then number three, if I am going to pull something off of my big list of crazy ideas, it better be worth it because I'm going to absolutely detonate a bomb in my business and it better be worth what's going to happen when the dust settles. Wow. This was hard for me to hear and like everything I needed. Thank you.
(19:53) Cool. [Applause] Thank you guys. Hey guys. So, if you're seeing uh Kira, who's the lovely lady in this um video, and you see kind of the people around, that's at our actual headquarters here in Vegas. And so, if you're a business owner and you're, you know, feeling stuck or you're not sure what the next step is uh to maybe have to pivot the business or you're just scaling well and you're like, I just want to make sure that I can pay down my ignorance tax and just keep the scaling going. Uh we'd love to help. We'd love
(20:24) to meet you in person. And the reason that I even decided to do this in person thing at my office is that like it's not scalable. Um, and it's almost like purposely not scalable. And so it's just very cool for us. I think it's like it's deep, right? Like we get to actually meet you like I'll meet you.
(20:43) Um, and really get to know the business, right? And get to know you and um, and provide the the the highest value I possibly can. Um, and so the reason I was willing to do that is because I think word of mouth travels faster than the amount of people that I can fit into a room. Um, and so we try to make it, you know, absolutely exceptional experience and, um, the reviews seem to indicate that people really, really like it a lot.
(21:04) Um, and so yeah, so if you are a business owner and you have been like on the fence or debating, um, you know, a big decision that's coming up or like what the missing link is or you know, where you need to focus in the business where you can get the most returns, um, that's our bread and butter.
(21:17) That's what we do every day. Um, and yeah, we'd love to have you out. So, I'm sure there's a link somewhere. You can probably click it and get stuff and book go with us.

Transcript:
(00:00) You're having a tough time right now. I think that if we get this right, the locations that you have will continue to grow even better. This is Anie. She runs a chain of eyelash salons doing $2.3 million per year. But she's dealing with challenges with her business partners. And she spread way too thin. And if she doesn't fix this fast, this business won't just stall.
(00:18) It'll start falling apart. Hi, I'm Annie. I own Amy Lash and Beauty. We are in the business of empowering women with eyelash extension service with a revenue of 2.3 million 644,000 and 28% net margin. We have seven locations, been in business for over 10 years and helped over 20,000 clients. Amazing.
(00:40) What's the problem that you're dealing with right now? I have three problems. First is lead generations cuz we always need more clients. Second is making the service better. Manager training is inconsistent because the managers are spending most of their time doing lashes. New employees aren't getting trans quickly. Third is partner problems.
(00:57) Some partner have dropped responsibilities since the initial equity agreement and I don't take a salary for doing most of the work on marketing and scaling. What happens if you don't get these solved? The company is not going to grow. I'm doing unpaid work. So I feel unfair. I don't know how to have hard conversations with the partners because they're also my friends. All right. Tell me more about the partnership situation. Have three partners. Mhm.
(01:21) Right now they are just not aligning with my new goals and mission. Yeah. To grow the company. They kind of have their own thing. One partner has her full like full-time career. Yeah. And a new baby. And a new baby. They don't uh manage the lash artist. They don't train them. So that the customer service and the fulfillment are not as good. Yeah.
(01:46) That's probably why those locations don't have as many customers. Mhm. Word of mouth. Yeah, we kind of have to fix these, you know, call it seven locations first. And I think if we nail the model, you'll sleep better at night. Definitely. Right. Okay.
(02:04) And so that 600-ish,000 that you have in profit, is that before you split it between all the owners? Uh, yes. Okay. Got it. Yeah. You're you're having a tough time right now. It's a lot of it's a lot of people to manage. I'm feeling a little bit stuck because I'm having a disagreement on how to grow the business.
(02:22) I have a bigger vision where I want to take the company, but my partners they share the same vision. Who do you help? So, I help 99% women mostly in their 20s to 50s. Women who just value time saving or want to look good without needing a lot of makeup.
(02:41) Is there an income level that this associated with or does it work in any market? The people who come back to continue the service would need a higher income. But for someone who just went for an event, it could be anyone. How do you help them? So for a new client, our lash artist go through consultations, make a recommendations, and apply their first set of lashes.
(03:01) If a client decide they want to continue with the service, they come back every two to four weeks for refills. I want to double click there for a second. If they decide they want to come back, how does that work? They just come back in basically when they want to come back. Yes. Ah, noted. So, this is a massive untapped opportunity that so many businesses miss out on. And so, there's two versions of this that you can do.
(03:23) Number one is something we call Bam Fam, which I talk about all the time, which I got from Shirro Savata, which is book a meeting from a meeting. Bam. That's what it stands for. So, if you ever have the opportunity where someone comes in and they're going to have to come in again, book it then.
(03:35) just get it done rather than trying to rely on them coming back by chance or remembering you or just even just creating the administrative burden of later having to schedule it when they're not right in front of you. The other way is just creating some sort of membership. Now, those are a little bit harder to sell because people don't like having recurring billing.
(03:47) That's why BAFFM is one of the easiest ways you can implement just about any business, but the recurring membership component, if we can structure the membership well with a really compelling offer, it might be something that's going to drive more and more people into it, which will stabilize the business. Okay.
(03:58) So, how do you make money? depending on the style of lashes between 170 to 300. We do have an intro promotion for 99. When they come back between two to four weeks is 70 to 270. The longer they go in between fills, the more it costs. So, let's say that someone comes in for $200 worth of lashes.
(04:18) What does it cost you in labor and what does it cost you in lashes? We pay our lash 50%. Really? Wow. Do they cover the cost of the lashes as well? Well, we pay the cost of everything. Wow. Wow. Generous. So, they get 50% of topline and then you deal with the cost of goods, marketing, rent, cleaning, everything else. Yep. Wow. It's impressive that you're running 28% margins with that.
(04:48) That means you're running everything else on 22% all your Our supply is cheap. That's why. Yeah. No, but I mean still 22% that's really impressive for literally giving 50% of top line away. Okay. So, how do you get customers? 50% of clients come from Google. It's unclear whether this is organic SEO or pay ads.
(05:08) Although I do spend $1,000 a month on Google ads per location. No, totally. Come by. Yes. With the $1,000 per month, you're saying you spend between five locations. Yes. So you're spending $200 a month per location. Mhm. So spending uh a,000 bucks a month between six locations. So that's like $180, whatever the math is, per month that she's spending. It's not a lot. Think about this. She's spending $12,000 on a $2.3 million business.
(05:35) So if she spent 1% of her revenue be 23,000. So she's spending a half a percent on marketing, which to me is either like this marketing isn't working or she's not spending nearly enough. And I think she's actually in the camp of not spending nearly enough. If she tells me anecdotally that half the people coming in say they heard of her from Google, I'm going to bet it's doing more than nothing, I'm of the camp of like, man, she's probably on a gold mine right now. Her probably cost to get a customer is almost nothing and she should spend way more to get more people in the door. How many customers do you
(06:01) sell a month? On an average month, our total appointment is 1,700. Total guest scale is 1,100. 30% new clients, 70 recalling clients. 50% our clients stay longer than 3 months. Do you have the same prices during the weekend? Uh and during like search times. Yes. Same pricing for weekdays and weekends.
(06:23) When is it busiest? Usually Friday, Thursday, Friday and Saturday. Is there a time of day or is it just those days all the way through? Just those days. So the oldest law in business is supply and demand. And the cross point is where you have price. And if there is more demand and less supply like for certain times, certain days, then price typically can and should go up.
(06:41) And so she's running a business right now where she has some supply constraints that are temporal, meaning either time of day or day of week where she has constraints only on those days. And so on those days, it would behoove us or behoove Anie to bump the prices up to reflect that shift in the supply demand of the business.
(07:01) Now, if you're like, "Oh, but wouldn't it piss off our customers?" Of course, everything is about how you frame things. Now, wouldn't it be nicer if we said, "These are the prices on Thursday, Friday, Saturday, and the rest of the week you get a discount, right? And that'll also drive more people to come the other days which will then smooth out her demand curve and ultimately keep her staff better utilized during the week and then by doing that increase her availability on weekends which would then drive more people to those times that she can fill back up but again at a higher price.
(07:28) Genius. Brilliant. Let me ask you a big question. Would you say that you have more of a limitation on doing the work or getting customers? Getting new customers. Interesting. So, you could handle a lot more volume. Mhm. So, it's more demand issue. All right. Beyond that, why the rush? There's no rush. It's just that I don't see an improvement.
(07:55) Can I tell you why I ask? Yes. You have two or three different partners? Mhm. Why' you take the partners on? I did not have the manpower to manage, didn't have the money to hire like a manager. Then I'll ask the question, why the rush of opening before you had the money and before you had the manpower? I just thought that we would make more money with another location. I agree with you.
(08:25) You probably already noticed though that the next location is significantly harder than the first one. And the profit, I'll bet you a big part of the profit is probably from your first. the ones that you have the most direct control over. So I thought when I open more locations I would make more money but then I realized the manager aren't training the new employee as well.
(08:44) The fulfillment of the service are not as good. Some location aren't do as well. So I have a lot of empathy for Anie because I made the same mistake and so I had six locations almost to the you know same thing. I had multiple partners. I did this. I did this.
(09:01) And the reality is that if I had just continued to cash flow, you know, the first location that I had rather than getting really aggressive with my expansion, I would have expanded better, more profitably, and I probably would have had a stronger brand going into new markets. And so sometimes we have to go against our desire to do things fast, make them easy, just make quick big bets on new people that are unvetted or untested.
(09:19) Whereas, if she had been able to maintain control and maybe have three locations by the same time period, and she owns them all outright, she would be consistently stomping out these new locations, because here's the really fun fact, the fastest way to five locations isn't the fastest way to 50 locations.
(09:41) You might go slower for your first one, two, three, four, but by doing it that way, you set up the infrastructure, the foundation to be able to then aggressively go from four to 10 and then from 10 to 50. But you can't do that if you have all these hodge podge deals on the side. Because let's think about this all the way at the natural extreme.
(10:00) Do we think the future version of the business is her with a 100 different partners? Probably not. And if that's not the future version of the business, why start doing that today? And the answer to that question is one word, rush. This is the prolocation numbers. You own number one and number four outright. Number one makes the most profit, I'm guessing. Mhm. Does that one run 28 or is it higher margins there? It's around the same margin. Okay. So, it's like 20. So, really? Okay. Mhm. Cool.
(10:23) So, that one makes like 250,000 a year, something like that. Yeah. Okay. And then all of them kind of maintain the same margins or is any of them not profitable? Are they all profitable? very similar margin. Really? Yes. That's interesting. That's not common. That's a good thing. Yeah, that's a that's a kudos to you.
(10:42) Talk to me about the membership process. So, we just started a membership. We're still working on it. Not rolling out yet. So, you've never really tried to have some sort of upsell offer. We do have an upsell. When a client come in for that $99 set, I usually upsell them to 170, which is like a better set of lashes. Okay.
(11:01) What percentage do you upsell? I can upsell 90% of the time. What about the team? Probably do less of 50. They don't even ask. They don't even ask. They I mean I guess they're getting you know if they have 50 that's not bad. 50 is not terrible.
(11:17) Also I in terms of close rates I you have like 99% close rate for people who walk in the door. I probably wouldn't I don't even know if I would track I mean it's worth tracking to see if it falls falls off. But what I'd be more interested in seeing is the close rate on upsells because the $99 thing is not where you're going to not where you make your money.
(11:35) So, she's got a really big opportunity here where she's saying that, you know, they close 100%, but it's a basically pre-closed people who already checked out on a page. And so, when someone walks in already having spent the money or knowing that they're going to spend this money, they already know the price, they have the card down, those are like, in my opinion, just absolutely assumed closes, like you're not going to mess those up. The real opportunity though is that these are essentially lead magnets.
(11:52) They're front-end promotional offers that are not designed to make money. the offer that's designed to make money, the profit maximization component of it is the upsells. If she's not getting a huge percentage of people to take the upsells, those are all the missed opportunities because think of it like this.
(12:08) Let's say she breaks even functionally in terms of cost after payroll and taxes and materials and and rent and labor and all that stuff on these these promotional offers. Cuz if she only did promotional offers, she wouldn't have any profit in the business. So, the real business is the upsell and that's what we have to be focusing all of our attention on so that we can maximize that step one to step two take rate. What's the incentive for the girls to stay? The lash artist. Mhm.
(12:32) Cuz I'm I'm assuming that you could lose them pretty easily. I'd offer training and to, you know, advance their techniques, but mostly the other people aren't delivering on money. Yeah. Yeah. So, are do you lose them to other competitors or do you lose them more to them just going out on their own? going out on.
(12:52) That's uh one huge problem that I have is I don't know how to prevent them from taking our clients either. Yeah. Mhm. I have ideas. Ready to dive in? Yeah. Okay, let's do it. Come on over. So, here's how we're going to do it. Number one, we're going to talk about pricing. I think you have a little bit of an opportunity there that I'll walk through in terms of surge pricing.
(13:11) Number two, membership that you're trying to put together. I have a lot of ideas on what we can do to make that better. Three is going to be the upsell process. Next one is going to be career path for your team so that you can try and keep more of them. Ads plus attribution.
(13:29) How do we know we're getting what we're spending for? This is going to be a big one. Partnership. Man, it's hard for me to even talk about the other five without going into this because I think that this is like this is the one that feels the heaviest to me right now because fundamentally if we don't nail a partnership then none of the execution is going to happen.
(13:49) That's what happened after I went back from the event like, hey, these are all the things we I want to do, but they're not really on board. Yeah. Okay, check this out real quick. So, this is the $100 million scaling road map. Leila and I spent 200-ish hours going over all the companies that we've owned, invested, scaled, and tried to break down where were the points that we got stuck and then what do we do to break through and we broke into these 10 stages and Anie is at stage six, optimize.
(14:13) So, let's look at some of the problems that she's dealing with. She has to run more ads than she currently is. So, to graduate here, she's got to implement the ad assembly process to increase volume. If you're like, "What's that?" I have a whole video on it if you're at stage six.
(14:29) She has to install a product improvement process for both products because the second product here is the membership product, right? And so we need to put a process in place so that we can continue to improve it so we can decrease churn and get more people to to take that upsell which also goes handinhand with installing sales training systems and individual coaching and a team cadence to make sure that they're maximizing that upsell at step two when they come in for that promo offer.
(14:47) We need to get more people to take that upsell both in terms of just the immediate upsell but also the membership upsell. And the only way we're going to do that is through training. And I think Anie says this, she's like, you know, the team's not as trained train trained as well as they should be. And if we're thinking about like what layer is this, she's got two layers of management. She's a full team of managers. Every one of these locations has a manager.
(14:59) So these are the problems that she's dealing with right now. And for her long-term, right, she almost shortcut the idea of getting good managers by just partnering. But what she really needed here, like what was the constraint was that the number and type of role she needed exceeded her current network, right? And the thing is is that she just used her current network to just pull people in. And that has become an issue.
(15:24) And so these are all problems that happen all the time at stage six. And so if you're like, man, I would love to know what stage of business I'm at so that I can know what the constraints are and what I need to graduate. And so this is 100% free. You go to acquisition.com/roadmap.
(15:40) You type in your business information and it'll it'll figure out what stage you're at and give you the potential solutions that might help you get through that stage with your business. And if you'd like my team to actually work with you um in person to make sure that this is stage you're at and these are the things that can help debottleneck your growth then on the thank you page you can schedule a call with our team and we'd love to potentially see you out here in Vegas.
(15:56) Well then I don't normally do this but let's talk about the partnership first. Let's resolve that and then we can talk about all the downstream stuff. You have three sets of partners. You have two that work full-time and then one that you've done multiple partnerships with. Mhm. Which one do you want to tackle first? The big one. Yes. Yeah.
(16:15) The reason I wanted to talk about her partnership structure is because all of these things that I'm going to go over are wonderful ideas and they're great things that she could do to potentially grow the business. But if she's using up 80% of her mental bandwidth on these partnerships, then she's never going to be able to execute any of this. I want to maximize the likelihood she succeeds.
(16:33) And part of that is deconstruing the biggest time drain she has, which is these partnerships that she hasn't visited yet. Which is why one of my favorite quotes is everything you want in life is on the other side of a few hard conversations. You know, my heart goes out to her with the partnership situation, and I know that firsthand, having nine failed partnerships. All the big jumps in my career happened after I had tough partnership conversations.
(16:50) If she doesn't deal with this thing, it's just going to get bigger and nastier. And so, you might as well deal with it now. And so, this is me also talking to Anie and her potential partners. Please try and resolve whatever concerns you have and set up clear expectations. Don't leave it in the gray. Don't leave something the gray because you don't want to confront the issue.
(17:11) like whatever you say to your husband or you say to the people behind one another's back, just say it to each other. Get it out there. Be clear about what you want. And then ultimately, I think it's going to be better for all parties. I think that your initial inclination is right, which is that you have option one is that there's a role that doesn't exist within the business, which is to do this level of work.
(17:28) And so I'll tell you a story. So when I had my first partnership ever, I or second partnership ever, I had two people come into the business. And so they were all one-third partners. But I was the one who ran the gym, but I didn't get paid any more than the other two partners who never stepped not really didn't step foot in the gym comparatively to the amount of hours I did.
(17:45) The big issue that I had was that I never asked for basically what I should have probably been paid, which would have been what a manager would have been paid. And so the actual business has artificially high profit margins because there's a role that I'm doing as owner, but I'm also doing the role of somebody who would be working the business because long-term, in order for it to really scale, you can't work in it. So you're basically running as manager probably for multiple locations right now. You're basically
(18:08) doing as an unpaid manager, which is not uncommon in the very beginning, but over time it's like as cash flow is there, you really want to have that role so that later you can say, I'm going to hire someone and we're going to pay them the same amount that we paid me to take this role. And so it should be the rate that somebody else would be able to do the same work for.
(18:26) It's super important for ANI or anybody who has a model that they intend to scale to pay what would be market rate for the role that they're fulfilling within the business. And the reason that's important is because if you want to open up more locations, you're going to have to leave that location, which means you're going to have to backfill your skill set there.
(18:43) There's a couple components to this. One is if you're doing like four different things at 25%, then that means there's something wrong with the model. We need to better organize the team and the roles so that all that work gets covered. And if somebody else is going to come in and do those, you know, four 25% rolls, fine.
(18:59) But we need to make sure that that's factored into our return on capital in terms of how much it costs to open up a new location versus how much we're going to make from it. And so let's say that we've got a location that's making $300,000 in profit and it cost us $50,000 to open. We'd be like, "Oh my god, let's let's open a ton of these.
(19:11) " But we then find out that it costs us, you know, $200,000, for example, to pay somebody who's good enough to be able to execute the business model there. All of a sudden, now we're making only $100,000 in profit per location, $50,000 invested. Now, mind you, that might still be a good return, but we still have to factor all of those pieces in.
(19:28) Is is this the real return or is this artificially inflated because people are are acting as owners and just getting a profit share of it? Um, and it's not really built into the overall economics of the model. And this is why we say nail it then scale it. That's option one. The other option is if you decide that you don't think the partnership is going to work out long term, that I do think it makes sense for you to split the partnership.
(19:47) Now, there's two paths there. So, path one is that she buys you. the other path is you buy her. Right now, I think the fairest way to approach it is to do something called a shotgun offer, which is like I will buy you out for this, but I will also accept that for you to buy me out. And so, you can make it basically make the price and the terms.
(20:04) So, it's like pay me over two years, pay me over 3 years, don't have to pay it up front, but when that happens, you're going to be running this business and I'm going to be running my own locations. I think that if we get this right, I think the locations that you have will continue to grow even better. It's just the problem is what if they say no to the buying out part.
(20:22) Well, the thing is is that you have leverage. Mhm. Which is if you're the working partner, you can say, "Well, then I'm not going to work anymore." Okay. So, there's leverage. Yeah. And to be fair, they have the equal opposite leverage. But if they already are not working, then there's less leverage.
(20:39) Being the person who works and brings it in always gives you leverage in relationship. The idea here though is that I think the fairest offer is I will buy you out at this but I'll also accept that. But either way, I don't think this is going to work longterm because we have different goals. Yeah. And also because you have multiple locations together. You might be able to do just a straight equity swap which is like your 50/50 here and 50/50 here.
(20:58) Let me just take this one. You take that one and we just go our separate ways. And that's super smooth cuz then you really it's a it's an inkind transaction. There's no taxes and you basically just swap equity for equity. I've actually done a deal like that. that might be the cleanest thing for you to do cuz it's a clean break.
(21:16) And now all of her focus is like I just have to make this one profitable and then you just get the other full one and if you want to be really generous about it, you can say I'll let you pick which one. Okay. If you want to be really generous with it. Yeah. How do you think Do you think you'll take that? I think it's a pretty reasonable offer. Yeah. Yeah. Well, that gives you three different paths.
(21:28) I think the salary thing is going to be hard given what you said. It sounds like a clean break is the way to go. So, either buy me out or let's just trade. So, we have path A. You do an increased profit share. Path B, which is shotgun offer. Path C is we just consolidate. I take the other half of this one. You take the other half of that one. Which one you Which one do you think you'll offer? Offer the first one first.
(21:52) And then if they say no, cuz I still want to have the relationships. I still want to run this business together if they on board. If How many years have you done this with them? Five. But it has been working. So before we just kind of we were friends. We would just let it be. Yeah. Uh there's not a lot of growing the business, right? Does just more like hiring and different goals. Yes.
(22:19) Now it's like I want to make each customer be happier with the service. I want to improve our employee. You have higher goals than what she wants to do, which there's nothing wrong with that. She's a family. She has another career. Whatever. Can I give you my two cents? Mhm. I think you should do the equity swap.
(22:35) thing is is that I think you'll be able to keep the relationship longer term basically because if you have an ugly end of the partnership which you know the profit share percentage then there's like well now I feel like I'm getting paid even less and you're really just doing what you were already doing you're just being greedy you know there's the shotgun offer which then you know one of you is writing a check to the other person for the next two years and that kind of stings every month the equity swap's a very clean clean way to end it and it's just unique to the situation
(22:58) that you have because you both own multiple locations together and so I think consolidating that is very clean and then at that point you can be 100% friends and you can share all the secrets that are working you know with one another but she can choose to do whatever she wants with her location right and that way you can still talk business you can still talk all the things you normally do except the stakes are less and if she doesn't want to do so much she just have to do it that's my advice cuz I think that you want to run faster than someone else does and that's very hard to to keep
(23:25) long term that's what I would do for partnership how does it work if let's say the she picked the one that's the second location. It wouldn't be the same at the equity of the less revenue ones. Yeah, it depends how bad you want to get out. I'm serious. I gave Yeah, I gave my uh my best location to a partner so that I could split.
(23:54) You said earlier that you have about the same level of margin between the two locations. You've got two and three. It's like if you got three and you got two, that would be a quote unfair deal for for you. Okay. It would be. Mhm.
(24:09) But then you're not going to be restrained anymore and you can go do all the things and you'll be at 550 or 600 or 700 in the next 12 months because you want to do more things. Yeah. So then fine. Okay. This is a small business. You can you can very quickly change the numbers. That'll be the easy part. Okay. This is the hard part. Yeah. The rest of this is straightforward. Yep. You feel all right with that so far? Yes. Okay. Let's talk pricing.
(24:26) I think that you should probably consider a plus 20% price raise on weekends and that's because that's when demand is the highest, right? If somebody wants off hours, then they get off hour prices. If they want peak hours, then they get peak prices. And so that'll smooth out the demand within the facility so that you can actually just get more utilization out of it.
(24:44) And over time, what'll happen is that you'll smooth out the the weekdays, but then you'll have even more people on the weekends. You'll just end up making more. And I think that'll have a big difference on your profitability. And so this is where I would experiment with having a weekend search price. Now you're having people just come back whenever.
(25:01) At the end of every single appointment, we needed to have a bam bam, which is book a meeting from a meeting. So, when they finish with the lashes, they walk them to the front and they say, "Cool, your lashes are going to be done in, you know, 2 weeks or 3 weeks. Let's just get that on the calendar now cuz I'm getting booked up pretty quick." Mhm. Is there any reason you can't do that? We do have clients who book their appointment right away. But not all of them. Not all. Right.
(25:19) But if we had all of them do it, we would make more for sure. Because even at basic level, if they're coming back every four weeks or every five weeks, and we just get them always to come back every three weeks, you double the amount of times they come back in the year. Yeah. It's a lot. Mhm.
(25:34) So, do you think you your team can do that? Do we give them like an incentive to book? Can we book? You can or you can make it the job. So, we do ask them and we do ask the client book. Yes. Every time. Okay. Um just some of them, you know, they like, "Oh, I'll book later. I'm busy.
(25:52) Yeah, we would do basic sales training around this because it is fundamentally a sale. And so if someone's like, hey, I'm not sure. It's like, well, totally. If you want, I'm here and you're here. Let's just pull up our calendars and that way we can just get it sorted right now so you don't have to worry about it later.
(26:04) So, it's just like a couple lines that you can overcome with somebody that I mean, if you just train them on like two things to say if someone says, "Can I do it right now?" And maybe like, "I don't have my card on me." You're like, "Don't worry, we have the card on file and if you want here, let me just pull it up.
(26:20) Does next Saturday work? Does the Saturday after that work? Now, you might find that you have a better time booking the next appointment before you do the lashes. Okay. Because I'm sure when they're have their lashes done, they like want to get out the door, right? Yeah. But if you book it while they're doing it or before, it's like they're just sitting there. Yeah.
(26:39) So, you've got How long does it take to do lashes? Like an hour, right? So, if they're like, I don't have time to figure this out now. It's like we have 60 minutes to just get one thing done, which is like, let's just book the next time you're in. Okay. Do you feel like that's more reasonable? Yeah, we can try be before they get the lashes done. Yeah, that's a good idea.
(26:56) I prefer to sell before because once someone has gotten the value, they want to leave. And so I want to do it before they've, you know, gotten the value cuz they're like, "Oh man, I want to get this done." And he's like, "Great, then let's the these are going to run out in 3 weeks. Let's get the next one on the calendar." Okay, so bam fan will just say before before slashduring.
(27:13) Getting a customer to come back and buy again is absolutely a sales conversation. Though it walks and talks like an administrative conversation, a scheduling conversation, but a lot of sales conversations look walk and talk like that, but they're not.
(27:31) And so, we need to treat this conversation and outcome of getting them booked back in with the proper respect it deserves for the business. Because if all of a sudden we got 80 or 90% to rebook, it would dramatically change the outcome of the business. If that's the case, then we should put a lot of attention to this. And the nice thing is is this doesn't even seem that hard, which are my favorite types of implementations. Not that hard, hugely impactful.
(27:50) Now, I do want to talk about the career path. Does everyone come in and start at 50%. No. So, they start at uh 40. Not Not everyone depends on their experience. Experience. Okay. The way that I like organizing something like this is here, I'll draw it out for you. Let's say somebody could make eventually, you know, 55%. Okay.
(28:09) Okay. So, say like we got 55% and then we've got 50% and we've got 45%. And then we've got 40%. 35 and then 30. All right. Let's just say that that's hypothetically our our little path here. All right. So, they might start here and they're going to be junior, you know, technician, whatever.
(28:36) Now, we can intermediarly give them a bump. But I like to have this basically every 3 months. So, this gives you almost a two-year time horizon of improvements where you say, "Cool, I'm going to give you go from junior to lash tech and then you get the raise and then you go senior lash tech and then you get the raise and then you get what's another word for technician?" Lash artist. Perfect.
(29:13) So it's like technician is the first three. So you go junior, normal, senior and then you go same thing, junior artist and then you go artist and then you go senior artist. So that gives you six title changes and six different compensation changes and you just do it every 3 months.
(29:38) And then when they hit their their three-month or six month or ninemonth, what you can do is that with the increase of pay, you also unlock um training as you unlock these new things, we're going to give you another skill which you can charge even more money for. So it just unlocks the earning because not only do they get higher income, so basically when you give them the title, they're still at their old pay, but you give them another skill they can charge more for. Yeah.
(29:58) Does that make sense? Yeah. And so that way they're making more money at every level. One is they just literally get better economics. The other is that they learn another skill that have different tiles. Yeah. That they can Exactly. Okay. Do you feel like you could break it into like six pieces? The training.
(30:12) Yes. Cool. And then that gives you a career path that they can work into. So what we're talking about here is deconstraining a supplybased constraint, which is how is she going to get more good technicians in each of her locations? And this is a super common constraint.
(30:28) And so if you're a business owner and you're being limited either by demand or by your ability to deliver on the demand, aka supply, um we run workshops here at our headquarters here in Vegas and if you like my team to just directly take a look at your business, then you could just schedule a call with my team and as long as you know we understand the business and we think we could help you out, we'll invite you out.
(30:46) So if that's interesting, you can click the link below this video. Otherwise, enjoy. What happened after 2 years? Good question. I like the the idea that you had where you have the one girl who's 33%. I think you just gave too much. And I think that you gave ownership rather than a profit show.
(31:04) And so the way that I explain this is, and you can draw this for them or you can have them watch this, right? Is that there's four things that you get with ownership. You've got risk, which I don't know if they want that. There's control, which right now you're not giving up. You've got profit. And then you've got a sale, like if you sold the whole business. Those are the four components of equity.
(31:22) Now, they don't probably want this. they're not going to get that. And so what you can do is just give them the profit from the facility but not ownership per se. So it's like I'm just going to give you this profit share in the form of a bonus and you can bonus them out every month. Okay.
(31:40) And so if we want to say like what's the what's the end goal? What do you think would be enough for them to to be like this is cool? Like this is it 100,000 a year like what's the amount of money that they'd be like that's a lot. I think so. So, what we do is I always back into what my ontarget earnings, it's called OT, what I want my on target earnings to be.
(31:58) So, if they're going to be a true owner, then they're not are they going to be doing lashes or no? Yes. Okay. I'll tell you where I'm going with this is that I want to create a path where they can get 20% of the profit of the facility. And so what you can do is say, "Cool. You're going to have the opportunity once you pass 24 months.
(32:16) Once you pass two years, when I have my next locations that I'm opening up, I'll be able to place you in one of those new locations, and you can have one of your own." Mhm. I'll throw in all the money. You'll work and you're going to get 10% year 1 and 20% year two. So that's four years. Mhm. But you have to do this extra work. Mhm. That's associated with that. Now, the cool thing here is that it's not equity, per se.
(32:41) So that if they're not doing a good job, you could say, you know what, maybe you should just be a full-time tech. This much money has to go to getting somebody to run this thing. And it's either going to be you or it's going to be somebody else. So, I'd rather give it to you cuz I trust you and I know you. But this gives you a very long-term career path for that.
(32:57) Okay? So, it's like, put your two years in, you're going to continue to make more. You'll be fully trained up so that eventually you can train other people, which then you can open the new locations. And hopefully by two years of every location, you'll have enough cash flow to open in Iowa. Okay. For this Mhm. I'd start them at 40 though. Should I start? I can start up less. 40%. Yes. Can I stretch the new time? Okay.
(33:18) The new ones you can start lower. Mhm. Um, and when you're saying stretching out the time, you mean like instead of 3 months, can I do every 6 months? You could. I like having more frequent more frequent bumps. I'd rather I'd rather you go 40 42 and 1/2 45 47 and 1/2 50 if you need to break up the the increments.
(33:34) Okay. That it's I actually like the cadence a lot. I like 3 months cuz it's always it's it's right there. Yeah. 6 months sometimes is too far away. Okay. Yes. Mhm. So yeah, if you have to with the existing ones, you can go 40 to 50 and just break it into that's four chunks plus the four title changes. That's eight chunks. Okay. Does that work? Okay.
(33:51) And you could do it every four months and that still gets to your two years. Yes. That's doable. Yes. Do you like this? Yes. Okay. Good. And to be clear, you're saying, "I'm not going to give you a facility when you get here. I'm going to see you qualify." Yeah. But you're going to compete against all the other girls for two years. So, you got to be the best one. Yeah. Cuz I'm going to give to the best person. Yeah. That way, there's some competitiveness. Cool. Yeah. Okay.
(34:12) Great. Let's talk about the membership. What ideas do you currently have for the membership that you want to sell on the back end? Right now, we have a monthly membership, a 6 months, and 12 months. Okay. Are they paying up front? Yes, they pay upfront for the whole six months. That's what I'm offering.
(34:30) I love No, I love it. It's great. So, um for the monthly one, they not What do they pay for six and what do they pay for 12? Depends on the type of fills that they're getting now. And we multiply it by Yeah. 6 months. Okay. What's the discount for 6 months is 10% and 12 month is 15%. Okay. And then 15%. Got it. Do a lot of people do this? I haven't. Okay.
(34:56) So, you haven't done it yet. I just So, let me give you some ideas on this. So, first off, I would rather you give away free stuff than discount if you can. Because one, it'll be cheaper for you. Yeah. Cuz your costs are so low. If we can make the value of whatever it is more than 10% off. Mhm.
(35:13) Which you can do for less than the 10% of the cost because I'll get you I'll bet that the the actual cost of of stuff is I don't know nothing almost for the lashes, I'm guessing. Yeah. Right. So, what kind of free thing could you add in that would be like, you know, valuable for them? Well, I I already add in the free facials on those. Okay. So, they have facials. We for the monthly one, the price don't change, but I do have a lot of benefits.
(35:40) So, you give them facials for free when they come in. Okay. What else do you give them? Just discount products and Okay. Product discounts. Okay. We also increase our referral from $10 to 50 if they are a member. Okay. Okay. I like all that. And then just um anniversary gifts and birthday gifts. Really good.
(36:04) Do you look at our stuff? This is good. Yeah, I love it. No, it's good. Uh anniversary and then more value but don't um you don't have to change the price. Yeah. No, I love it. So, I want to understand what makes this membership that she wants to roll out compelling because sometimes people just roll out memberships that are just discount based memberships and like not my favorite way to roll out a membership.
(36:23) I want to add some significant benefits. So, it's like you want to take away bad stuff which would be money and add good stuff which would be value. I want to make it dare I say dare I say an offer so good people would feel stupid saying no. Uh and so what I'm going over here is what are the bonuses? And so if you're like huh I would love to know how to structure bonuses.
(36:44) The good news is I have an entire chapter on how to structure bonuses inside my offers book on page 117. So, how do you splinter stack what you have, pull out the different components, order them in such a way that they're the most compelling as possible to each avatar. And I will say this, I think people kind of sit on this continuum of like they have no bonuses or they offer like a 100 bonuses. I think the magic is actually in the middle.
(37:10) is you want to have each bonus in and of itself be worth the same value as the overall price. And so that someone could just say, "I would do it only for this. I would do it only for the free facials." Right? Now, would they do it only for the bump and referral bonus? Probably not. Would they do it only for the discount? Maybe. But to me, up to this point, the most compelling thing she brought up was that they would get facials every time they come in, which I think is not a bad not a bad thing. Let's see if there's something else that we can put up.
(37:34) So, one other thing that you could consider doing, and I think this makes it kind of fun, it's up to you, is you could have a little sweep stake. Mhm. Where every month they're entered into kind of a giveaway where they get something cool. Um, and then that way when you select the winner, you can then advertise it kind of all over the place.
(37:52) And also, if the person who if they were referred by somebody, the person who referred them wins, too. So, that'll give them a really strong incentive to refer as many people as possible because they'll get as many chances as possible to win. And so I think it should be like say I'm thinking like something like $200 to $500 of it has to be enough that they should be excited about it.
(38:14) So just like one last thing like maybe but like I think if it was $500 worth like the whatever the full suite you know deal is you give it to one person a month. I think that's very exciting from a marketing perspective. It's not a huge cost to the business. Yeah. Does that work? Yes. Okay. So how are we going to sell it? So someone comes online they put their card down. They show up in person for you know the $99 promo. Right.
(38:31) While they're there, we're going to try and book their next appointment before they even start or during the during the appointment. We're gonna get them booked for the next one. Okay. Where are we going to do the upsell for the service or the membership? Membership. Now, I'm starting with the clients who already coming. Okay. So, the recurring clients, yes.
(38:49) And I say, why don't you try the memberships? You're paying the same amount you're paying now every two weeks. Mhm. Except you get all this stuff if Yeah. But then now you get all this stuff and then you also get a free facial. Yeah. Uh just sign up today. Yeah, I only asked like a handful of clients. Okay.
(39:07) And how many people said yes? Um, two out of out of like five. Okay, it's not bad. The one thing that I would do is is the So the facials right now if they say yes. Mhm. Okay, that's good. Immediate bonus is strong. I mean 40%'s not bad. I would like it to be like 70 though. I wonder how many more reps you just need. Yeah, I think just offer more.
(39:27) Yeah, because it's because basically you have to I think you have to get into the conversation and kind of learn the flow of it. But I would imagine if you say, "Hey, um, do you did you want to get like some of these free things?" And they'll probably say, "Yes." And it's like, "Cool. It doesn't cost you anymore.
(39:39) " And then be like, "Oh, great. How do I do that?" It's like just sign up the membership. And the way that I'd start it is say you've been here, especially if you're upselling existing customers, you know, six times in the last, you know, whatever, 6 months. So, just look up the CRM. How many times have you been here? Like, hey, you've been here, you know, six times in the last 6 months.
(40:05) I realized that you haven't supposed to get that. And they're like, I didn't know. It's like, yeah, all you have to do is just sign up as a one of the members. You pay nothing more than you're currently paying, but you just get all of these things that you should already be getting cuz you've already Cuz like if we can frame it on the fact that they should have already been getting it, it's kind of like a default close rather than trying to get them to opt into something.
(40:24) I want the positioning to be like, you've already been paying for it and opted in for it. Now, we just need to formalize it. Yeah. I remember reading a study in a book called I think it was like 50 scientific ways to get to yes.
(40:41) And one of the things they talked about in the book was that one country was able to get like 80% of people to opt in to be a organ donor whereas other countries average like 10%. And the one thing that that country did is they had people opt out of being an organ donor rather than opt into it. And so to me that almost permanently changed how I saw upselling, which is how do I make the thing that I want someone to do appear like the default option as in they have to opt out of it.
(41:08) And so the way that I'm trying to frame this upsell for Anie is that hey, you've already opted into this membership. You just haven't been getting the bonuses. So, let's just like formalize you getting what you already should have been getting rather than do you want to do this new thing. So, upsells in a true new sales scenario, you might be at 30ish%, 20 to 40, whatever. And that's the numbers that she's getting, which is fairly typical.
(41:31) But if we can structure it so that it feels like a default close or an assumed close based on past behavior, we might overnight be at those 80 90% close rates, which is where I want it to be. the more you can get it to be like, "Oh, you should already have this." And the less pressure it is, the more likely they're like, "Yeah, okay. Sign me up.
(41:49) " How are you actually facilitating the transaction? You have the card on file, right? Yes. So, do you say, "Hey, we can just use the cards you have on file." Do you say that? Uh, no, because I haven't asked that many. Okay. Well, I would have that as my actual final CCTA. is that way you can say, "Hey, um, if you ask, I'll give you the facial right now and we'll get you booked for the next time you're out here. You'll also get a facial then, too, and you get some of these other things." And when you come to the front, cardinal file work, great.
(42:14) And then that way when they check out, boom, it's done. They're on recurring and they just sign the thing and then they're in. Yeah. Seamless. What if they don't rebook? They don't rebook. To be fair, the rebook is a is an easier sale than the than the membership. We have to first be able to close people on rebooking.
(42:31) If someone's not going to come back again, they're definitely not buying a membership. Yeah. So, we got to like like we we we foot in the door like get the small win. Yeah. And then offer free stuff and then go for the membership. Okay. So, it's a three-step. Okay. Does that make sense though? Yes. Okay. Okay. So, that's how that's how I would pitch it um for the existing people.
(42:50) Do I bother to sell the six and 12 months at all or only if people ask? So, that's a different sale. So, I'll tell you. So, the way it actually would work is that after they say yes to the the membership, you then say, "Would you want to save some money?" Okay? And then you say, "Cool. If you want to save some money, you can prepay it today.
(43:08) Would you prefer 12 or six?" Like, you're getting into a sales business. Like, this is how it works. The reason prepayment for memberships is so valuable is one, people who prepay churn at a significantly lower percentage. Number two, it pulls cash forward for the business, which allows you to grow more rapidly if you want to pay people more aggressively.
(43:25) And fundamentally, cash today is always worth more than cash in the future. And I would say third and maybe more most importantly, if they're prepaying for the year, it's unlikely they're going to go somewhere else. So you basically lock in the customer for all of the future business rather than maybe they're only going to come four more times this year and they're going to mix and match between you and two other places.
(43:43) I'm going to draw this out cuz I think it's worthwhile. So first we bam fam the appointment. We have to get the next booking. Then we have our free offer. That's kind of the beat, right? We have our free offer. They say, "Yes, I want the free eyebrows." And we say, "Cool." So, we already know when you're coming back, so you might as well just sign up for the membership. Yes.
(43:59) So, now we have our membership. Yes. If they say if we're already in on the membership, just from one tip. Mhm. This happens separately from when they check out. So, this is at the at the station. When they go up to check out, then we say, "Want to save some money? Save whatever $1 $150." Now, they're going to be looking at their bill and it's almost the whole bill. So, they're like, "Yeah, I I want to save $150." It's like, "Awesome.
(44:24) prepay the next 12. And if they're like, "Oh, I don't want to do that." You're like, "Oh, if you want, we could just prepay to six." You want to do six. That way you can save them money. Yeah. But to make it really sexy is you say, "Oh, do you want the day to be free?" Cuz they're at the checkout. They're right there. The card's on file. They're about to leave. Like, do you want the day to be free? Oh, cool. Just sign up for the next 12. Okay.
(44:47) We already have the next time you're here. So, you're good to go. Just check the box. Now, that to be clear is going to be off what you're gonna save over the next year. But we'll apply the first discount tonight. Feel all right with that. Or is that too complicated? No, I get I get Okay. But it's just bam. Just the wording. Yeah, for sure. This is training.
(45:04) This is how you train staff to do this. I need the recording. Yeah. So, I can learn it and then train other people. Yes. The training other people is hard part. Well, why don't we just cover the training right now? So, if you're in a service business, you're in the recruiting, hiring, and training business for the most part because selling lashes to me is not super hard.
(45:22) Like beauty in general tends to not be difficult to sell because people just like go in and they look better. So it's a very easy sale compared to like, hey, work out for a year and wake up early and stop eating the foods you love. Much harder sale. The real thing that will scale this brand is her ability to scale training to new people who come in the door.
(45:38) And the arbitrage of the business is being able to get someone in who has low skill, train them up on your system, and then be able to charge a higher rate for what that skill commands in the marketplace. And so basically the arbitrage of I can train someone in a week and take them and and pay them what I got them to say yes to on the way in.
(45:58) And then with the added training that I'm paying for, I can now make this spread on what the market now values this new skill out. And fundamentally that arbitrage is what exists in service businesses and how service businesses make money. So she's got to be able to teach other people how to do this. The way that you have to train this is that you have to basically have them come in 30 minutes early or whatever you know whatever the gaps are during the day and honestly like this is going to sound crazy but like every day for 30 minutes they role play with each other. So if you have four girls there it's two and two and one person's in the chair and
(46:26) they do the first part. Hey so what time you want to come in and then you have to well I'm not sure and then it's like well let's pull up your calendar like I'll tell you what days I have open. Yeah no uh if you want to do it with me and they should be incentivized to do that because they want to get the money.
(46:38) I they only have to train the front desk. One girl at one location. That's fine. Then it's even easier. So you just have to role play with her. Don't just say here, say these words. It's not going to work. It's just repetition over and over and over again. As soon as they mess up, say cool. Say it like this. Try it again. Say like this. Try it again. You did great. Do it five more times. Okay. Right.
(46:56) And we'll try from the top again. It's just a ton of repetition. Yeah. And then when somebody comes in, they'll probably say it the right way. Okay. Okay. All right. So the last piece is really just the ads and attribution. So this is actually very integrated into the brick and mortar. Okay.
(47:13) So when someone walks in, so this is during, right? This is after, which is these ones. That's after. And then I know this is looks weird, but this is before. So when someone walks in the door, what we want is we want to immediately get their ID. So hey, do you have your ID on you? As soon as they walk in, that confirms the appointment. Then you say, "Great.
(47:39) Do you have the card that you want to put down today for to to pay for the thing?" So they already have that card on file when they book. Good. So we're just confirming it. Yep. Now the next piece is great. Sign in. And on the sign in, we want to have the drop down of where they came from. That way we can have our attribution for the marketing and the referral code if someone's getting some sort of referral benefit.
(48:04) The longer you stay in business, the more you are compensated by the quality of your decisions, not how hard or how long you work. As you increase leverage in your career, you want to make better and better decisions. And one of the easiest ways to make better decisions is have good, clean data. And so, you can always just do post-it notes and duct tape in the beginning.
(48:20) And that's how a lot of people start. There's nothing wrong with that. But at some point, you have to make bigger and bigger bets on where you're going to invest, where you're going to grow, how you're going to expand. And in order to make these irreversible bets, we need to collect the data so we don't bet the farm on something that's a loser. So that way when every single person walks in, it's like, great, you have ID in you.
(48:38) Awesome. Cool. Is this the card you want to use for today? Just confirming cuz sometimes people want to change their card out. You're like, awesome. Uh, can you sign in right here? Where'd you hear about us? Great. Did anyone send you? Cool. Let me know who. If not, then there you go.
(48:57) So then you got your referrals tracked, you got your ad attribution tracked, you got the right cards on file, and you have uh confirmation that it's the person. The reason I ask for ID first is because it's less intimidating. This is just like it's a checklist and they just follow it with every single person who walks in the door. Yeah. Like the fact that you have this waiting area is the biggest advantage for most service businesses that are underutilized is cuz you can check off all things. You can get your reviews.
(49:14) You can get your next deployment done. You can get the card on file. You can find out where they came from. You can get all of this stuff done before they walk in to get their service. Y that's the big stuff. But I think we have to do the partnership thing. I think that's the big deal. Yes. Mhm. That's what what's holding me back. No, it is. Okay.
(49:30) So, let's let's recap both those for you. Let's go easiest and fastest. So, I use ice as my my little moniker. So, impact, confidence, ease. So, how likely is it this is going to work? How easy is it? And how big of an impact is it going to make? So, something that's really easy, really fast, and high impact. We do those first.
(49:47) And some things are high impact like the partnerships, but it's going to be not easy, right? Okay. So ICE is a really common investor framework and it also maps pretty closely to the value equation which is like what are the four elements of value? You have the dream outcome which ICE is the eye of impact. You have the perceived like of achievement which is the confidence score.
(50:11) How likely is this to occur? And ICE just says ease but I split that into how fast and how and how much effort is there. So there's four variables in mind. If you want to use ICE, you can use three, whatever. But the point is is that we have to make these appraisals based on what expected return do we have for the resources we plan to allocate into the business.
(50:29) What bets are we going to make? And so, zooming all the way out, I define strategy as prioritization of resources. There's a lot of things we could do to Anie's business, but the idea is that we want to allocate our resources to the fewest things that are going to get us the highest probability of high returns. And so this is how we reorder these these things that we went over so that she can get the most out of it.
(50:49) Number one is I do think weekend pricing is just like easy profit that will make a huge difference for the business. All you have to do is just have two sets of you know pamphlets or whatever that you have on the counter and when it goes Thursday then you have Thursday through Friday pricing or Thursday through Saturday pricing.
(51:10) So regular clients get annoyed, absorbed that well if you want to I can grandfather you in if you have a come also great too another great way right and actually that's amazing hold on that is probably the biggest benefit that we can put in this thing for the membership is you have same pricing yeah non surge pricing there we go now It's meaty. So, one of the beautiful things is that you can create a problem then solve it.
(51:39) So, we're going to raise the price, but if you sign up for a membership, you're not going to have the price. It's only for weekends. So, if you want to come on peak hours and not pay peak prices, just join the membership. I like that. That sounds good. That feels sellable. Mhm. Okay. So, weekend pricing, which will then pair with the membership offer. And then I think we have our before process.
(52:06) Number five we have our during process. Number five we have our after process. Six we have career path and then seven finally we have our partnership issues. Okay. So, weekend pricing I think for you is going to probably I think it's going to be a huge difference because it's going to flow people right into the membership.
(52:38) So, I think you'll probably be able to see a 10%ish increase in revenue without really doing anything else cuz 50% of the time you get a 20% bump. Do you think 20% is too high for a Do you want to do 10%. Think we can start with 10. See how it goes. You have to be sold on it. If you're not sold on it, it's not going to work. So, if you feel good with 10, I'm good with 10. All right. So we'll bump it by 10, which means you'll probably have something like a 5% increase in revenue.
(52:59) But that 5% increase in revenue given your 28% margins goes from 28 to 32, sorry, 28 to 33. And so it's closer to 20% profit increase for you. So even though it might sound small, right? Yeah. It's a whole another location. Mhm. Right. Not bad. Uh membership offer.
(53:18) So the thing here is that you said the uh a lot of customers stay past 3 months, right? Yeah. What percentage do? Around 50. Yeah. Right. So if we can get that to something like 70% plus, that will probably be one of the largest changes in the business because you don't have to pay to acquire those customers and they just basically are always profitable going forward.
(53:37) And so that's probably somewhere in the neighborhood of like a 20 to 30% lift in the business. So now the before process, this is just going to allow you to increase your ads because you're going to finally be able to attribute where are these people coming from, right? So, we're going to have that plus we're going to get more people to come back because we're already booking their next appointment from right as they walk in.
(53:56) Right? Then here is where we have our upsell to uh membership is at the chair because that's when they have to do the eyebrows. Unless we can stuff it before. That's up to you. I feel like it'll work better in the chair. I think it's well not in the chair cuz then they won't be talking.
(54:15) They need to keep their eyes closed. Mhm. and get the service done. So, you think you should do before? Yeah. Okay. After booking the appointment and then Well, then let's do this. Do the membership. Good thing is we can just cross this out. So, you're just gonna have a before and after. So, before they walk in, you're going to get your ads, you're going to get their comeback, you're going to give them the upsell offer, and you'll get your reviews because I don't want you to stop doing that. Yeah. Okay. So, that's all loaded before. Afterwards is basically
(54:40) second shot um and prepayment. So, they've already agreed, remember earlier, that they were going to sign up for the membership. On the way out, we say, "Hey, you want to have today free because the today free is basically what they would get off if they sign up for a year." But remember, you're not actually giving them today free.
(54:58) You're just going to say like that's what you're going to save in discounts. Yeah. Yeah. Okay, cool. So, that's where you're going to go and that'll pull up cash, which I think will be another probably 20-ish% um that you can get from the business. Uh the career path thing, this is just going to decrease the churn, right, for your for your staff.
(55:14) And ultimately the thing is is if you keep the staff then you won't have to keep retraining people and so the profit margin of the business will just naturally improve because the girls get better, they get more return customers. They have more repeats. And then finally the partnerships. So you're going to have to have basically three conversations. Um well really just two cuz one you're fine with.
(55:32) We just need to you know increase the ad spend which we can do once we actually have tracking. Mhm. The hard conversation I think you should do the equity swell. Okay. even if it means you're getting the smaller one cuz you're going to be able to go all in on it and just I'm sure that you'll be able if you're fully focused, you'll be able to turn it around in 2 seconds.
(55:51) Okay? And then the the one girl who has her foot out the door. I would just give her some sort of buyout so that she has some some sort of stability over the next 12 or 18 months. Okay. And then she's like, "Hey, just do one one favor in exchange for this. Just help me replace you." Yeah. That's it. How does this feel? Good. Feels like work. Yes. I like it.
(56:10) Let a little bonus one. 2.5 is follow up with leads. So you could probably pay someone $40,000 a year to do one thing, which is just call the leads that come in. Do nothing else. You have to do anything else. You can stay at home, call the leads within 1 minute. So what we're going to do is we're going to make that number one.
(56:31) So oh by the way, maybe make that zero. This one is a 2 to 3x for the business. That solves your lead genen issue. Okay. So, you're going to hire somebody who's going to call the leads. We're going to roll out the membership offer with the weekend pricing. We're going to train the team on the new pricing. The reason it's going to make sense is because they're going to have this career path and then you're going to have this conversation with your partnership because now you're going to have a more trained staff. They're going to get to pay better. Okay. So, when do we call the lease? We say immediately, hey, we
(57:00) saw that you trying to book an appointment. It didn't go through. I would just say, hey, saw that you booked our $99 promo. Oh, what time do you want to come in? Okay. And then great, what card do you want to use? And they're going to say, "Sure, here's my card." And if they don't say, it's like, "Why do you need my card?" You say, "It's how we've always done it. It's how we always do it. That's how you say it." Okay.
(57:19) All right. Awesome job, buddy. Thank you. Yeah, you bet. If you like this Cash, guys episode, which we keep making because you guys keep asking for them, we have another one of a female stylist who is a little bit smaller in the business, about $300,000 a year, and I think you'll love it. So, go check that one out. Enjoy.

(00:00) documenting your business mistakes may be the most important thing you do in your entire business career to make more money after I lost everything for the second time in my career that experience was so painful that I was like I can't keep doing this I can't keep repeating these same mistakes so I was like I have to find a way that I can learn from this and so within the next three months I started my podcast and the intention behind that podcast was that I would learn to document the things that I was
(00:26) doing and what I was thinking about and the problems that I was suffering from at that time and I always thought the concept of having like a Jeff basos Vlog with Once once a week he was like this is what we're dealing with at Amazon this is what we're dealing with Amazon all the way to his current state would have been so valuable and I always had the belief that I would get to that level eventually and so you know delusional or not so I thought why not start now and so I started documenting my mistakes and my successes and an interesting thing happened from that
(00:56) point until now I haven't lost everything again and we've built know $100 million plus net worth arguably a lot more than that but just for the sake of this video um in that next seven or so years and so I've been in business for 13 but I lost everything about the halfway point twice and so making sure that I learned the right lessons from my mistakes has been I think one of the largest contributing factors to me being able to move forward at such a fast rate whether you document it through video or
(01:27) you document it through podcast or you document through written I don't think matters I've actually done both and so I started with just podcast but the ideas for that podcast came from an email thread that I had to myself and so every year I would start a new email thread called lessons and failures and then and then the year and it would be hundreds of emails long to myself and it would just be little little tidbits little one phrase two phrase of like oh yeah I had this interview with this girl she did this thing I think that's awesome and then six months later when I find out that person's stealing I'm like oh that
(01:57) thing that I thought was good is actually not good so I'd have these kind of like continuous open looped stories that I'd be telling about what I think will happen versus what actually would happen and then it'll allow me to have much more crystallized decision-making power in the future because I was like wait a second I've seen this one before and I know how this one goes and so that happened more and more times so you think about like if entrepreneurship were a video game you have levels so if you ever picked up an old video game and then you like beat it really quickly to the levels you remember and then you get to like the level you don't know and
(02:28) then it's like really slow again and it's I think entrepreneurship is a lot the same way is cuz you were like oh I know where that pothole is oh I know I can go get the extra ammo there I know how to get this I know what this director of sales should look like I know what a director of marketing should look like oh I've never run Facebook ads before slow and then you just die die die die and you respawn over and then finally you get through and then the next time you beat all six levels and then you also beat the Facebook level and you're like all right well now we're going to run YouTube ads and you're like die die die and so I see
(02:57) entrepreneurship a lot of the same way but if there's so many things that are happening every day in business that if you don't have a way to crystallize the knowledge to document what you've done it's like you don't develop this repertoire at least for me not as easily because the Nuance of what I remember it fades right I don't remember like what was the big breakthrough here I'm like I just know that it worked but I want to know why it worked so that when a new situation comes up I can know how to increase the likelihood that it happens again and so nowadays I publicly do this
(03:28) stuff through shorts and Longs and tweets but fundamentally the thing that got me into doing it in the early days was the side benefit that people would watch it but the primary benefit that future me would be able to reference back to this thing and know where I was at that time what I was struggling with what beliefs I had and that was probably the one those was most interesting was hey if there was a period of time where I was crushing it how was I seeing the world and is it different than now so
(03:51) it's almost like having a time machine so it's like okay if all of a sudden I get into like a losing streak I'm going to go back to when I was winning and I'm going to watch some of the stuff that I was doing then so I can keep it top of mind like oh what am I what's different between these two things but if I don't have that to reference then I just have to go off memory but my memory in the current state is being jaded by my current situation and so I want to be able to have a source I can go back to truth and truth just being things that
(04:15) are documented and so I see this as a really huge problem for a lot of small business owners or really just business owners in general is that they make a mistake but they learn the wrong lesson from it and so Dr Burgman talked about this where he said it's worse to to be successful and not know why than to have failed and know why correctly and it's me paraphrasing but that struck me when I heard that for the first time and I think the reason it struck me was that it took me years to figure out why gym launch was actually so successful in the beginning now obviously for me I was
(04:46) like I'm 27 years old took home $17 million in income my first year that's not Revenue that was profit you know in my first 12 calendar months of the business like I'm so great um but we are so quick to attribute failure to an outside circumstance but we don't attribute success to an outside circumstance and I had number of things that were going well for me at that time and so it's like I had Facebook ads that were super cheap which made the stuff that our gyms were using super cheap and super profitable for me to acquire customers as gym owners was also super cheap and super profitable and so I had
(05:18) these things that were working you know I was like I'm just such a good marketer but it wasn't that right I mean because years later when that Arbitrage disappeared right it's like is the same is the same thing happening right so what happened is the gym launch had to evolve from an Arbitrage business to one that went off of execution and me basically realizing this like what why is why are why is it not printing the way it was before it's like oh it's because the context has changed and so I became a much better entrepreneur despite the fact that the net income
(05:49) went down and so learning from that is both humbling but also the only thing that you can do to get better and if we see ourselves as the asset that we're ultimately building throughout our lives which we eventually just cash in at the the end and die anyways then making sure that I'm getting the right thing the right lesson from the scar is arguably the most important thing that you can have to move faster cuz when you watch that person Play that video game again when they know the game it's not like they're moving super fast they just
(06:18) don't make the wrong turn they go directly for the ammo they go directly you know they avoid the poth the pothole they avoid the bads too um they they they hit the dragon right at The Sweet Spot cuz they know where it is cuz they died 20 other times hitting the wrong part of the Dragon that's not the sweet The Sweet Spot um and so they just it's more efficient movement they have less wasted moves and so I see that the same way as entrepreneurship it's not like the businesses that I have are so much bigger than the ones that I had before and they grow so much faster because I
(06:48) know how to go through their first early levels really quickly because of what I've documented before here's what it looks like when it's wrong so I'll talk to you know a small business owner and say Hey you know I hired a salesperson and then it they didn't work out and I'm like cool so what' you learn from that this is always one of my favorite questions like what' you learn from that and so I asked this to myself like what' you learn from that um and so with this particular individual he say like well
(07:12) no one can sell like I can sell I'll be like well I think you might have learned the wrong lesson from the mistake and like the only thing worse than wrong like than having the mistake is learning the wrong lesson from the mistake because then you're bound to repeat it again and so a fool never learns from their mistakes a dumb person learns from their mistakes eventually a smart person learn learns one lesson from a mistake a very smart person learns multiple lessons from a mistake a wise man learns
(07:35) from the mistake of others the wisest man learns from their successes too and so the idea is if we think about that as a Continuum of how we can move more efficiently through life and get more for every move it's making sure that we're like that person playing the video game that when we go back through we know what potholes to avoid cuz imagine if you played the game and you're like oh I killed this guy because I hit him in the sweet spot and you thought The Sweet Spot was here but the real thing was that you had a certain arrow that you picked up earlier in the game and
(08:03) when you play the game again you don't think it's about the arrow you think it's about the spot and so then you hit the spot again it doesn't work it's because you attributed the success to the wrong lesson and so I actually see this happen a lot I think it's one of the most common mistakes that happens in entrepreneurship is that people just extrapolate their current view of the world over the mistake but fundamentally the people who are better at business see business more clearly they can recognize the mistake more easily and they're correct because they have a high
(08:28) predictive power meaning if they want this thing to happen again they can predict that it will or what it would take to make the dragon die because they had the right thing which is it's actually not the spot or the arrow it's both you're like ah right and only somebody who's lived through both of those experiences well the next time they came with the arrows that were right they hit in a different spot it didn't work either so you're like oh it's the combination of things and often times it's not one thing it's two or
(08:52) three things that have to happen at the same time for the outcome to occur and so like when I started Allen my third company that I was CEO of at the same time you can already tell me smiling because of the obvious mistake that I was making um Allen was a hard business it was a I'd never been in software before i' never developed software before I'd never had Engineers before product design ux I didn't know any of this stuff I was like I just know that this is I knew the problem and I knew i product Market fit because I knew exactly what needed to get built and I
(09:20) knew I had a whole audience that I could sell to um but here's all the lessons that I learned from that hey and if you're in the early part of your business career avoiding mistakes is one of the most important things you can do in order to move faster not to say that you're not going to make them you're going to make a ton of them but ideally you want to make ones that you can that you can't avoid rather than the mistakes you can avoid and uh for people just getting started in business I run something called the school games uh on school.com um for SL games and in there
(09:48) I take calls I help people build their first business on the platform uh and you can start for free all right so if that's at all interesting you can go school.com games one is software is hard second that you don't want to get into a features war with competitors like competitors in software that can easily copy any features you have and so you want to have other things about your business that give you more of a moat that protects you from just a race to the bottom and a features War um the main the probably the biggest lesson I learned from it was yet again another lashing from the woman in the red dress
(10:17) um the reason I'm so vehemo about the wom in the red dress is that of all the mistakes that I've had to learn she has been the sneakiest and the most devious of them and the one that I've had to learn the same lesson over and over and over again um and I would say I IID say to a certain degree I'm ashamed of that of how many times I've had to learn not to pursue the win the red dress and it's like because every time you know now she's black now she's Asian now she's white and now she's tall now she's short sometimes she's wearing a short dress
(10:41) sometimes it's not red it's it's maroon sometimes it's you know faded mango for the color but every time I'm like no no no this time's different and you can probably tell like if you have that friend who dates the same girl over and over again they're like no no this girl's different you're like dude it's the same thing it's it's like super pacy work girl uh you know super tatted up you know dad issues whatever right it's like you'd run the same Playbook man like this is obviously not work for you obviously I also have no issues with anybody who looks like that I'm just saying as an example and the main lesson that I learned from Allan was that it
(11:10) was the only argument that Lea and I have ever been in and it was actually a business argument which I find hilarious um and she just didn't think that we had the bandwidth to do to bring on another company and do it and I argued that she needed to think bigger and that you know we had to we had to take big swings and all of that and I ended up just steamrolling her and it was a Terri decision for a number of reasons but one of the biggest ones was that my operator wasn't on board even if she wasn't my wife the person who's going to be
(11:35) running this thing wasn't on board with it and was telling me shouting at me quite literally that she she was so spread thin with the current businesses that take on something else would just one of them would suffer and so that's exactly what happened right and so it had nothing to do and like maybe if I had only done that then we would have grown it you know and been a gazillion dollar thing there's nothing wrong with the concept behind the business and often times for everybody there's often not something
(12:00) fundamentally wrong with the concept behind the business like you have some service or some problem that you solve for some specific customer it's just all the other stuff right and being able to recognize oh that is not what a sales director looks like but until you hire that person have them you know spend six months wasting leads on them and then having them fail and then hire another sales director and again six months of not growth because they're not closing the way they need to and then on the third when you finally find it you're like oh this is what a sales director looks like this is what a sales director
(12:29) does and then because guess what happens is that from that point going on in your life you know how to beat that level and so you quickly put the right sales director in in your second company your third company or whatever it is or a new division in the company because you know what it looks like when it's right and so I think making sure that it's like okay I know how to kill the dragon because the sales director can't just be charismatic they also have to have systems things and they have to do both of them and they have to care about people or whatever and so it's not
(12:53) usually one or two things it's usually a handful and that's what makes business complex and so trying to remember all of these little details is so hard that it became so important for me to document those things and you get the double benefit when you document that you make content about it and so you can both build your personal brand if you're into that and get the benefit of documenting the lessons which is the real benefit as the entrepreneur and I find it interesting because a lot of uh people a lot of business owners who make
(13:23) content ask me how do I come up with content ideas and I always found that such a silly question because I I always have so many things to talk about and I think it's because the the easiest thing to talk about is the news you just look at what's going on and you make commentary on it which is why a lot of channels or people over time just divulge into just news reporters with commentary but I don't think that's the right way to do it I prefer to talk about my news because life is always happening and so I also have problems
(13:52) and so unless you have no problems in life which I don't think anybody watching this has no problems in life you talk about the problems that you're dealing with right now and how you're approaching them and you also just do it in in AAR like if you if you don't feel like being vulnerable fine because there sometimes there's things in business that you can't you know if you have a you know employee sh I'm dealing with Daniel who's behind the camera right now and I'm like I got this problem with this videographer you know what I mean then like I probably can't talk about it right now right but if I could talk
(14:15) about it three like literally if we solve something and then three months later I say hey Dan and I we're having this beef but we figured this thing out it's totally cool right and so we just talk about you talk about a little bit in rear and that way you're not risking anything client relationships whatever but you just talk about your news rather than the news you'll always have source of content and it'll allow you to document your business mistakes and successes so that you learn the right lessons and so let me tell you how
(14:37) powerful this is so I had I had dinner years ago with an entrepreneur uh who had exited a company that was an e-commerce company and he had made the majority of their sales on Amazon this is the early days of Amazon uh when like you could pretty much just like list a product and it would just grow because like there was reviews hacking and there's all sorts of stuff and so we had dinner with this entrepreneur and I remember him saying this he said isn't it crazy that you could never have a business successful ever again like this
(15:07) could be the most successful business you ever have and it was because he attributed everything that he had in his life to the luck of things working out you know in Tandem and the reality was that for him that was true and for us it was also true but we had crystallized the knowledge because we had wanted to study what made us successful and so since that point he has not had a business that was more successful than that first one that he had we have had everyone since be more successful than the first one that we had and the difference was did you document the
(15:43) lessons are you just playing a video game that's the same game but you're acting like a new character like you've never played it before because you never wrote down what you were supposed to do when you got to the first boss or the first pothole and I think it's just as important like I said to study your successes and so like our supplement launch for Prestige Labs was probably the most successful launch in terms of like cleanliness like no problems of anything we've ever done and the difference between that launch and some
(16:06) of the other ones was that I had my operator on board the team had been completely trained up we had an alpha phase we had a beta phase we worked through all the Kinks in the process I let them set the date for when the launch was going to be we were staffed up we were trained we had inventory we had everything we had all the little holes figured out and the first month we did $1.
(16:32) 7 million in recurring Revenue recurring crazy for supplements and so the crazy thing about that was I had learned from the mistakes that I've done before and so I was like how can I not make those and also this worked out well how do I make sure that I repeat successful actions how do I make sure that I check every one of these boxes the next time because nothing feels like success which is one of Lea's favorite sayings she's like well we have to remember that it took us a year to do this and so if we want to do another thing we can't think oh we just crushed that we can Crush another one she's like no the point is that it took us a long time and a lot of work
(17:01) and a lot of buying and a lot of training a lot of resources for an extended period of time to make this big thing work right the first time and so when we do something else we have to understand that's the price that we have to be willing to pay and having that context you think wow okay I know to beat the next level it's going to take me two hours but Mom wants to go to the grocery store so I probably shouldn't start that level right now because I'm not going to be able to finish it and so having the context of what kind of resources am I going to have to put to towards this gives you a more realistic
(17:31) view of how many things you can actually take on and do well and I think that big picture that has probably been one of my biggest meta lessons is that once I learn how long it takes me to do something well I learned how few things I can actually do which means that I have to say no to just about everything even if and Steve Jobs was was famous for asking his his executive team this he said what have you said no to lately because he didn't want people to just say they're focused the focus is everything you turn away from he said it's not just turning away from bad ideas it has to be an idea that you in your bones desperately want to do and
(18:08) still choose not to because you said you were going to stay focused on the one thing that mattered most and that has probably been one of the hardest lessons it's the inverse of the woman in the red dress for me because there's I've just I there's so many things in like the business world that I want to do I want to try but knowing how much work it takes to make one thing work very well and just take a very long time to learn this um is that you just can't do many you have to learn how to say no and once you do start the game with all the lessons
(18:39) you zoom past all the levels and you get to the hard part which I call the Virgin Territory right now it's how do I hire a CFO how do I do a business transaction how do I take on debt in a way that's responsible how do I scale to a new acquisition Channel how do I go from five salese to 50 salese like what is that process what does a career path look like for a salesperson what does career path look like for customer success like is this is this customer support or customer success like like where do I find a good IT director who can actually integrate all of our systems together but what's interesting that I've always thought about this is
(19:10) that like we were able to grow so quickly in gym launch sure we had the Arbitrage of the Facebook stuff that was happening but I also came into it having run six locations with 30 plus employees and you know eight eight sales guys and so I was used to 30 50 sometimes 100 sales a day on my team and and so if I went to as soon as we started gym launch I immediately went up to what my level of incompetence was or my level of Max competence right equal opposite is I knew what it was like to spend $1,000 a
(19:41) day I knew what it was like to spend $3,000 a day I knew what it was like to uh have eight sales guys taking calls all day long and so I could quickly scale to that which is why we went from basically nothing to 26 million that next year because I was used to that level of activity we had more zeros on the price tag but everything else was the same and one of the greatest Parts about documenting things publicly is that you now become accountable to the lessons you claim you learned and so I think that if you think about the benefits of documenting business mistakes and business successes publicly
(20:12) is there's three things one is you make it for you and so it will help you learn the lesson better and telling the story makes it stick if you just try and remember a lesson it doesn't apply it's kind of like um Elon Musk had this clip that I I sent on a whole team but he talks about how education is all wrong they have a course on a wrench and they have a course on a screwdriver he said they shouldn't teach that way because you don't have context your brain can't remember it but you said hey let's take apart this engine now everyone looks at the engine he says oh I guess we'll probably need a wrench but now the
(20:42) wrench has contextualized the problem that help solve right and so when we tell the stories it helps contextualize the problem that we're solving at the time so that when a problem's similar to that when a girl with a red dress comes up and she's got short hair you're like okay I have one of you guys before I had long hair and the dress was you know shorter but I think you're related right and so you have the first benefit which is that you crystallize the lesson the second is that you're accountable to that lesson because there's people who
(21:11) are watching it who are like hey I thought you said that you didn't want to do a lot of these things you can't be CEO of multiple things right right and so it holds you accountable to that and then the third benefit is that you actually make money from it because people will identify with your values and your beliefs and say hey I'd like to do business with you that if you see that as gravy then you won't lose because you never did it for them to begin with so instead of giving a non- answer to like what's the one thing that you think you attribute a lot of your
(21:36) success to I actually do have some answers one is the time blocking thing that I that I I made a video about the other day which is like my productivity system or something some YouTube headline um but basically the maker manager time understanding the difference between those things but the second is that okay if I can maximize my maker manager time then I maximize the raw unit but now I want to get the most for that time and I think this what I'm talking about today with crystallizing those lessons has been probably the second most valuable thing that I've done in my career so it's I need to make
(22:06) time so I can do the work that matters most and then I need to document the mistakes that I made so that when I do that work that matters most I'm actually working on on the work that matters most and so using the video game analogy it's like if Allen were a video game and I'm trying to win at that game then I've got a co-op player my wife and business partner who doesn't want to play the the game it becomes very hard to win when you're doing Co-op and one player doesn't want to play or wants to win at a different game right and so there are
(22:37) a lot of lessons not just that one that I learned from from Allen as a company and I've learned lessons from every company I've had but not being able to look back because it was so long ago would increase the likelihood that I am forced to replay that level again because I wouldn't remember why I failed so if you had to apply the woman of the red dress to a video game scenario iio it would really be like trying to play two video games at the same time and win it both like just think about how crazy
(23:08) it is like there's two ways you can think about it one is that you literally try and play both games at the same time which obviously no one's going to win what's crazy that entrepreneurs do this all the time the second scenario might be a little bit more realistic is that you're alternating between games it's like one day you play this game one day you play that game one day you play this game but if you you'll notice that when you do that you're kind of like Rusty you kind of like got to like get yourself right back up to speed like your hands got to like you got to learn the key not like you got you're just
(23:31) rusty right you got to get read up or sped up now do that with three games and you're playing one game you know ABC ABC well imagine the guy who's just playing on a that guy's your competitor he's going to not be three times better than you he's probably going to be like six or nine times better than you because not only is he spending three more 3x the time on the actual game as you but he also doesn't have the cost of change and the cost of getting caught up to speed every single time and so he might
(23:58) be six or nine times ahead and you're like how is this guy beating me it's like cuz he's not doing anything else and so I like to think like how would I play this game if I had to win like there was no option for failing well I definitely wouldn't have any I wouldn't be playing any other games I definitely would Orient my entire life around the video game I would definitely make sure that like food was brought to me you know you know drinks were brought to me uh I'm you know sleeping optimally I've
(24:23) got everything that I need my lighting all that stuff would be optimized so that I could just play this game and the people who make the most money in business call it the game the reason the show is called the game is because I think everyone is in the game it's just that a lot of people don't know it and so as soon as you realize that you are playing a video game with money in business then all the same rules apply and you want to have your Prima officially official strategy guide next to you of all the lessons that you've
(24:54) learned along the way it's just that this game has way more than 10 keys on a keyboard and way more players because everyone in the world is playing and they're are no rules besides not going to jail and so you have a true open world game with real stakes and players that have been playing for 60 years who are competing against you and so I just want to do everything in my power are to make sure that I increase the likelihood that I can win so if you aren't documenting your successes start if you aren't documenting your failures start you can also not doesn't really matter when I didn't do it I made a lot less money
(25:40) when I started doing I started making a lot more money and so I would say do it whatever way you can if it's just Twitter and tweeting it or if it's an email chain yourself or it's a audio messages yourself or just when you're driving whatever version of that it is as long as you make you the main audience then you won't worry about the reviews you won't worry about the performance you'll just get get better at it and I think that honestly having done 700 and something solo podcasts up to this point I've gotten better at talking just because I was forced to if you listen to my early podcast compared to now I'm more articulate how did that
(26:10) happen because I did it a load of times and so the same thing will happen to you and you'll actually get practice on making content on presenting to your staff on presenting to your team on presenting to customers by doing it more so a question from the audience is do you see Lila as your guide so I think there's like guide with a capital G and then guide with a little G so guide with a capital would be the assumption that like Lila is my guide in life and the answer would be no I would say that we're Partners we do things these things
(26:34) together but within the context of the story in that instance yeah she came in with the insight and that's what changed the character got me over the obstacle and got me to the next thing and I think we both played that role for one another um throughout our careers and having somebody like that the hard part is just finding somebody who actually wants you to win it's just it's so rare everybody has their own agenda and it's it's how you can help them win um and so I mean that's why I think at least you know
(26:57) husbands and wives have the most L incentives and so it it helps that when they're selfish for themselves like you can believe like sometimes they're wrong but at least their intentions correct and I think what's really cool about documenting your mistakes and the lessons from them is that we give such great advice to other people and yet we don't follow it for ourselves and so when you actually write down the advice that you want to give to yourself it kind of stares back at you and you're like man and one of the most powerful frames that I've had in my life in terms
(27:25) of like navigating difficult situations is if I were coaching myself if I were mentoring myself if I were my own guide what would I tell me because the beautiful thing is that you always have complete context with the situation because you're in it so you don't need to tell somebody to try and get them up to speed you are up to speed but most people if I said Hey how do I lose weight be like hey stop eating and move more right but then when it's when it's you you're like well I have all these other things I have all these
(27:47) emotional charges around all this crap right but if we listen to our own advice most of the time we don't like information we lack execution so the question is do I get just as much value from my Solomon sessions is basically when I talk to my future self which sounds really sketchy but basically just have a chat message thread with what I imagine to be my 80- old version of myself who's already accomplished everything that I want to accomplish has all the lessons learned and can reflect back on my present situation versus what I've learned from my past self and I
(28:16) think that I've learned lessons from both um and I think time travel is one of the most useful frames for crystallizing lessons and getting insight into situations where you're like I just don't know what to do because it's like your present state in your present condition with present influences and things that are going on in your head that are top of mind doesn't but like future you definitely had will ask a different question about the scenario that often times just erases the importance of it entirely so
(28:44) the question was right now what big boss are you dealing with I think that the boss that I am dealing with right now is actually just being patient and so we have all of the skills we brought from all of the other businesses we've owned and run and we're applying it to our current business withth acquisition.
(29:11) comom and I think it's much more of a character trait test for me because the model is working above projections when I started it in 2021 and so I it's doing everything that I hoped it would do and better which Lila brings up all the time and I have a huge desire to with like I have a huge I'm a I'm a tinkerer I like tinkering with things but most of the time you don't need to Tinker when it is working and so I think a lot of times in business depending on what it is if it's not like a lot of things are good enough like if it's not the constraint of the business then it's just a cost that you
(29:48) force the business to incur by changing anything like the cost of change is guaranteed the upside from change isn't and so if you have something that's working well then whenever you change it everything sets back because everyone get has to get retrained on a new process a new anything before it gets back to even neutral let alone whether it improves or not and so I think the the big boss that I'm facing right now is just a skill thing that I'm learning which is just letting things grow without getting in the way and if you
(30:17) guys want know something very trippy about this I didn't start having compounding growth in my wealth until after I started documenting my mistakes and so until I lost lost everything the second time I did not document my mistakes I didn't document anything after that point 90 days after I lost everything 90 days three months is when I made my first podcast and from that point going forward I've spent more time thinking about why did this work rather than really anything else because if I know why it worked then I can do it again and so then I get to like conquer that level and I just know that I can
(30:53) always skip past it if I know the right why and speaking of lessons and failures I just made a video of 13 years of business lessons that I've learned in 90 minutes go check it out enjoy

Transcript:
(00:00) what you don't know can kill you and ultimately will because at the end of the day all of us are going to die and after having built two multi-figure companies another eight-figure company another eight-figure company and then now we have a portfolio of companies that do just about a million a week i've i've learned some things about financial education and things like that and i realized i was wildly deficient in other areas and so in this search for meaning and figuring out you know what i want to do when i grow
(00:28) up i've kind of bucketed the different disciplines that i think all of us have to learn as entrepreneurs to fill the hole that we have in our souls and i think a lot of us you know we we pursue business because we feel like it is going to fill this hole even on some level we know it won't but we do it anyways because we just don't have another best bet and so after having enough money to question the the meaning of life i've kind of looked at it looked at these at these buckets as seven things and so that's what i'm
(01:00) going to talk about in this video and i think it's useful because a lot of times we just don't know what we lack and simply having an understanding of the breadth of topics and disciplines that we should have and understand will show us where our deficiencies are and i believe that you need all seven in order to feel more complete and as i've made more progress in these things i feel like i've been able to unearth my singular meaning it's not necessarily yours but for me it's to learn i love learning and so for me one of the
(01:27) best ways of learning is teaching and so i get questions all the time about why i make these videos like why like why would i care about doing this stuff for free i do it for me because i love learning and i learn best through teaching you know what i'm going through right now and so these are the seven different disciplines i think every human being has to learn all right so the first is um foundational education all right now the good thing is the system is pretty decent at decent at teaching this one all right so this
(01:54) is like reading writing and math like that's how i see it it's like if you can read write and mat and do math you'll learn that from school and specifically just like reading writing yeah reading writing and math are kind of what i would consider foundational principles because from there you can use reading and writing and math to learn the rest of the principles right and so this one's foundational and this is pretty much the only one that we get taught in school which is why everyone or at least for me i felt wildly deficient to deal with the
(02:21) real world because there's so many other things right which is crazy to me that like what we cover are not i think we should just get foundations if i were to redesign our education system i would just teach reading writing and math and then the rest of it would be around these disciplines all right so the next thing is physical all right and the thing is is if you're living in this world you live in the physical plane and so you have to understand what you need to eat and how do you need to move in order to you know increase your energy longevity
(02:48) etc and so all the things underneath this is bucket energy min uh sorry uh would be like sleep you know like your own sleep routines if you have them but not to be religious about them or superstitious about them because those end up becoming handicaps more than they actually end up helping you but how to actually train to look the way you want to look how to eat the way you want to look how to eat and train the way so you can know how you want to feel all of this stuff because you exist in this plane and we have these bodies for our whole lives
(03:15) and so it would behoove us to learn how to do these things because all the rest of these disciplines are no longer a priority if your physical health is um is is waning right it's like was it the there's there's a saying about the everybody can have every wish in the world except for when you're sick you only have one which is to not be sick right and so learning this is what i would consider the second level of education the third level of education that i've outlined for myself is professional right and this is one where depending on
(03:44) what your what your skill set is right or what sorry what what career path you want to go down some schools are you know if you want to be an accountant there's pretty decent there's a decent career path there for you to learn that skill now most accountants would say yeah when i had my you know once i graduated with my mac or my master's in accounting that's when really my real education began right and so many of these are like that especially from the formal education standpoint but hopefully as i'm going through these
(04:10) you can think to yourself like okay where am i lacking and as i get higher and higher up i will tell you i think the fulfillment and the and the meaning that you can derive from them these kind of work like a pyramid right like this is the base and then you you build up all right the next level of this uh what i i would consider is uh emotional all right and uh this one you have to continue to grow over time because this is just like understanding your own your own feelings and thoughts and as you you know grow as an entrepreneur you
(04:38) have to know these things because you'll you'll figure out where your deficiencies are all of us have them and if you can't think to yourself what your deficiencies are and name them and be okay with yourself while still having them i think that you get stuck there because you just don't know how to fix yourself right not that you need to be fixed but how to grow right and so this is the kind of the fourth the fourth level of education now note this one we don't get taught anything about at all anywhere right and you have
(05:03) to learn all this stuff on your own and most of us have no education on this so think about how much time you've devoted to like this one now because now we're really departing from formal education obviously there's not much formal education around physical recess doesn't really count right the next level that i have here is uh relational all right so this is how to communicate influence and deal with others and this is wildly important because first you have to master yourself right and then the next step there is being
(05:30) able to relate to others in a way that is that is meaningful and so by doing that you're able to influence others you're able to build groups build tribes build companies all of this is going to be predicated on your ability to deal with other humans again this isn't taught anywhere right that's why you know some some of the books that that were most most transformational transformational for me in my life were books that that talked about how to deal with other people how to communicate right how to how to have people like you
(05:57) right how to have people trust you and really the flip side of that is how to be likable and how to be trustworthy rather than some like hacks or tricks it's so much more about the character traits which is the ugly answer but it's also probably the truth so these are the these are the five levels and if you're looking at yourself right now hopefully you should be like well how much time am i spending learning uh this discipline for my own emotions how am i how much time am i spending learning this discipline in learning how to
(06:19) relate to others the next one that i that i have here is financial all right financial literacy and uh i would say this first in the beginning is personal finance which is basically learning how to spend less than you make and then ideally significantly less than you make if you listen to any of my stuff because wealth is a ratio it is not a number it is a it is a ratio between how much you earn versus how much you spend so if you want to increase your wealth you can decrease your expenses and in so doing become more wealthy
(06:49) think about that for a second and while you process that i will i will tell you the the second iteration of financial which is then how to multiply so in the beginning it's about the getting getting of the money and then the next level how to multiply the money that you have right and have the money work for you and that's that's um i would say currently this is where i'm focusing a lot of my time and attention because i want to learn that game that being said a lot of these things combined together right like if you want to have a
(07:15) business you need to know how to manage your own emotions you need to know how to relate to others you need to know how to manage finances you need to have some skills that you have professionally to provide value to the marketplace in and remember with like this professional school that i was saying earlier only if you have like a formal career path or you're going to learn this in the in the in the formal education system which is you know failing everybody even more every every day but most most professions right you learn
(07:38) you learn by doing you learn by getting into that industry right and so that's why there's no school for entrepreneurship not really you know there's entrepreneurship schools but like let's be honest like they're not legit the the the real school for entrepreneurship is just getting into the game and starting to play and so right now as we're thinking you're going through this right i've named six and i'll tell you the last one in a second um but think about where you rate on these like how much time am i spending
(08:02) learning about financial education how much time i spend can i read a balance sheet right um can i read a cash flow statement uh relational right like how much time am i spending learning how to relate to others do you say things like and this is important for everyone who has an identity which is everyone right do you face things like like i don't play well with others i don't even like saying that me personally as i'm telling you this i don't like saying that because i don't like speaking that over myself but i can tell you the more you can
(08:25) become aware of how people say i am i do i have right i must i should etc people tell you their own limiting beliefs and the things that you say and the things that you speak over yourself become your reality and like this is very true like i'm i don't want to say this like people will say i'm not good with money right i don't even like saying it right because you speak this belief into yourself and that becomes your reality and so the first thing you have to do is start correcting your language so that you know it's like
(08:52) i have a i have i have a weakness here i have a deficiency in terms of my learning right because then it becomes an opportunity that you can fix rather than i am this way it is certain i speak this way and therefore will never grow right and so as you're looking through these pillars of disciplines that that come inevitably on the on the entrepreneurial journey you have to you have to see what your deficiencies are and learn them right and that's and if you're like looking at this and it seems overwhelming well you have your
(09:15) whole life to learn them which is what i think is inspiring and i honestly think for me looking at these disciplines has given me a lot of meaning in my own life because i just see this as so much stuff that i want to do i want to learn all this stuff and then it makes it makes living more interesting for me and then finally the last one is philosophical all right and this is this is the values that you choose to live by these are the things that you believe to be true that are eternal and so for me this has been
(09:47) incredibly incredibly useful and i can tell you guys for anybody who's watching this like when you have enough money to spend millions of dollars a year every single year for the rest of your life just on the money that you have assuming it doesn't even grow like you ask different and weirder like life gets weird right you have weirder questions that you ask and then you realize there's really so hopefully i can jump to the end of that for for anybody who's curious you won't get more fulfillment from all of these things any one of these
(10:12) things but it's really feeling how you can balance all these things but i think that philosophical despite the fact that i said it's the seventh bucket i actually think that it's the most important bucket and all of the changes in my own subjective well-being and how much i enjoy living have come from fundamental shifts in my philosophy about what i what i believe it means to be human and the time that we spend here on earth and so anyways if you're looking at yourself and you're looking at your own deficits um a and that's okay is one of my
(10:44) favorite sayings that i tell myself my own self-talk right i'm not good at this and that's okay right i'm not good at this yet and that's okay i'm not good at the relational side with other people yet and that's okay right because i'm going to learn right i'm not as good at the finances as i would like to be yet and that's okay right and so it becomes it gets you out of this defeatist talk this absolutism of being deficient and making it something that's an opportunity for you to grow it and i know this sounds minor
(11:14) but i'm telling you when i look at the employees that i have i look at the people that are in our company i look at the businesses that we work with i can tell immediately by someone's language patterns how likely they are to grow right and so the first thing you can do is correct your own language patterns for each of these each of these buckets but getting back to philosophical right as the seventh bucket this bucket i believe is i mean it's the meaning of life right and what will happen is if you are doing all of these things
(11:41) you're doing your financial education you're making more money you're increasing your influence through your relational discipline your your s your sense of self and your emotional management your impulse control is improving right your your professional skills are enhancing your physical well-being your energy your sleep the habits that you have around that are things that are increasing your longevity increasing your energy increasing your sense of well-being from a physical standpoint and hopefully you have the foundational
(12:05) education of learning of reading and writing which if you don't you should do that first because it's the gateway to learning all these other things but the thing is is all of these other ones if you don't know why you're doing them i think that ultimately you don't feel better so you may improve all of these things but you don't feel better and i think that most of us just want to feel better and so for me making strides in understanding why i do what i do and where i derive meaning in life has been uh one of the most fulfilling
(12:31) for me and ultimately why i've been increasing my you know constant stuff on the channels and i'm writing books right now that i'll be releasing for free for everyone just to help other entrepreneurs um and people make positive contribution with the potential that they all that we all have inside of us and so anyways i i wish you an absolutely amazing day stay tuned for uh my next video um hope you love it and uh i'll see you in the next vid bye

How I Built A 20+ Sales Team [The Process] - YouTube
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgmh7p1s7zs

Transcript:
(00:01) who's pumped about sales sort of pumped about okay so quick question so i can cater this to you guys um as i try and tell my team sometimes i'm gonna talk fast you can just listen fast so um who here has one person or less that would mean if you are selling um doing the majority of the sales in your company can i get hand raised okay so like half okay that's perfect and the other half of you have a sales team multiple two or more right okay so the name of my lovely talk um is going to be the closer framework all right
(00:31) and so what i'm going to do is break this up into two halves the first half is how you actually manage the conversation that should say work you get the idea close the framework and then the second half is how you manage the sales team so you can get wicked consistent sales on a monthly basis um so first things first who here has ever struggled with uh inconsistent lead quality inconsistent cac right you're like i thought i was at a thousand and now i'm at three thousand my leads are [ __ ] actually my leads are amazing uh my
(01:03) sales team is under work now they're overworked they said there's too many there's too few they're not being efficient at setters anyone done with any of that stuff okay cool so um i've run a lot of sales teams uh b2b we did outsource sales company we would fly two gyms actually sell for them so we'd fill them up in 30 days um with us actually flying people out and selling so we've done a lot of sales and this is the simplest framework that you can use um and so this is the first of the five c's so i try to use
(01:28) markets as 5c so when you go home you've got 10 c's okay so um the first one it governs the conversation so that's kind of for everyone who was raised there's kind of more of you over here we're raising your hands about i've got one person or it's me this is the governing framework for how you make the conversation c is you clarify why the person is there all right now when you use this framework everything that's in your framework has to be a question only do not put paragraphs do not put statements because they will
(01:55) start reading them they can't think that way only put questions because they can pause they can ask another question they can pause they can ask another question and they need no intelligence to do that which means it's scalable okay so when you're asking so all of these buckets are the buckets under which you want to create the framework that you're making your sale so it's like what made you get on the call what's your goal why is that important to you what would it look like 12 months from now if this ideal outcome were to
(02:22) be achieved right those are the clarification questions next you label them with a problem so what i'm hearing is you've done x y and z and the missing link has been x whatever is that right yes got it i now have a problem you know i have cancer i can cure it all right next is oh we're going to overview the pain okay so i'm assuming i'm not the first person you've come to to try and solve this problem so what have you done in the past all right i've done x y and z why did that not work for you obviously it didn't work because they're
(02:51) on the phone with you all right so you always have that advantage because they are on the phone with you right now so you're overviewing past pain we call the pain cycle you do that until they have nothing left and you're like awesome and then you recap the pain then s you sell the vacation this is the only thing that your sales people have to actually know there's going to be three stories that you're going to tell them they're going to be illustrative of the thing that you were helping them solve so an example
(03:16) would be fitness nutrition fitness nutrition and accountability if i was trying to sell weight loss right you're usually missing one or two or all three of these things that's why you weren't successful right you couldn't consistently work out you couldn't consistently eat the right way or no one was there to hold you accountable does that make sense yes if you're selling leads it would be like you need your leads to be exclusive you need them to be timely you need them to be geographic whatever like you're going to
(03:38) find three things and you have to give a short 30 second snippet of why that's important right if i was trying to illustrate accountability i'd be like hey did your parents ever tell you to brush your teeth when you grew up you probably hated it you're like no i don't want to and they kept doing it over time and i'll bet you brush your teeth now right you need someone to hold you accountable so you can create the habit does it make sense 30 second story they understand it that's how you sell a vacation all right
(03:59) e explain away their concerns away concerns blah blah blah you get the point all right that's where you're doing all of your optional overcomes all right crazy people buy without obstacles normal people have concerns you need to overcome them these have to be drilled all right they have to be drilled so that means that you have flash cards like i need to think about it i have to talk to my husband i have to check with my partner i have to so there's only three by the way if you don't know what they are it's price it's stall it's
(04:26) decision maker all right so all you have to do is understand what each of those three are if it's price it's a description discrepancy in value they don't understand the value if it's decision maker what you have to do is rely on past agreements that are implied that that person has already communicated to the partner so your partner knows that you're struggling with these things already right they know that you're looking for a solution right so why do you think they'd be opposed with you solving the problem that you already know you have
(04:49) that they don't agree with right overcoming okay those have to be drilled next one um is uh so we decision maker we did price and stall right all you're doing is teaching someone to make a decision because people don't like making them because they fear making mistake right perfect halfway through okay so what you're gonna do is walk them through the decision-making process so how do we make decisions either do you do you like me yes or no do you like the product yes or no do you think that will be able to help you
(05:19) achieve this outcome yes or no do you have access to this amount of money in your bank account or know someone who does yes or no yes what card you want to use right overcome you make them confront the decision all right what's your main concern then they tell you main concern you overcome it close all right last one is reinforce the decision and i like doing this and we included it after time is that people back out right so how can we slam slam it on them how can we get them super pumped so immediately afterwards that's the 30
(05:51) second video from the founder be like hey just saw you sign up for our software super excited to have you by name personalized head written card t-shirt any of those things reinforce the decision make their feet nice and hot make sense that's the closer framework every single one of these buckets has to be questions that are simple for them to ask all right so when you're organizing your script this is the conversation we're going through that makes sense to everybody okay that is the first of the five c's don't worry the other ones are
(06:16) are fast and about how you manage your sales team okay don't worry i'll be fast so that's closer the next one is don't worry i'm rocking we're good okay the next one i should know these that's okay okay call recordings and then i'm just going to write these down real quick for you so you can write them down comms cut competition okay so marcos is much smarter than me i think he's like the really classy classy person um this is like from the streets closing four thousand people one-on-one sales like weight loss susie's riding
(06:58) with you know her kids trying to write permanent marker on the wall and i'm trying to close your credit card all right so close your sequence is how you manage the framework call recordings if you're not recording every single [ __ ] call that your your people are on one you're not compliant two you should do it because then they become more accountable to following the script all right you also overview those the tool that you need to use is gong if you if you guys sell it via zoom it's the [ __ ] best it's all i can say use
(07:20) gong it's amazing all right comms you need to talk to your team on a regular basis all right the cadence there is daily huddles weekly one-on-ones and when you do the and then obviously monthly but the um the daily huddles are quick all you do is you share testimonials so they remember why they're selling so they get beat up every single day with no's they need to remember why they're still doing it all right from the one-on-ones that you're doing when you're meeting with them you're gonna record you're gonna have
(07:49) them tag you in three calls their best call their worst call on their average call when you go over in the 101s you're going to ask them to show you where they clarified the problem where they outlined the paint and then where they asked for the sale and where they overcame objections if they never clarify the pain and they've asked for the sale you don't make money so that way they always know that on every [ __ ] call you always ask for the sale you can never make a sale if you never ask for it all right that's what you from the communication
(08:18) cadence cut you got to cut the bottom all right it's the number one thing that will drive sales teams is by cutting the bottom 10 percent you do it on a regular basis it has to be on a regular basis all right even if the team is going okay when you cut the bottom you'll see a 30 jump in productivity every time so if you can have a persistent 30 jump why would you not do that that make sense okay competition last point i'm good i got a minute 20.
(08:45) okay so competition sales people are competitive you have to have a leaderboard that is published that they can see every single day that they get notified when every other guy is making a sale if it's super high volume it could be end of day but when they you've got a bell if you're in person if you're not in person you have a thread that should be all the sales guys digging they can literally send an image or a gif of a bell so it's like ring the bell right so that they know and it says volume they can see it
(09:08) there's activity there's action right it's all of momentum so leaderboard that has to be checked every day has to be updated regularly like that has to be on point and then competitions we found that six weeks works best um in terms of sending them on like closers go to vegas or go to the bahamas or whatever it is and so we put them in three men teams and that tends to work really well because they they share best practices they continue to work with each other they root for each other so it's not as cutthroat it's just always having top
(09:37) dog and in terms of how much to spend on that uh 25 percent of one month check um is usually the amount per person that a prize like that would be right so if you guys make 70 you might spend 1500 bucks to send per guy for like a three day or like a two day weekend it's not expensive five grand but it is worth every dollar so to recap if you want really really consistent sales use the closer framework everything has to be questions do not have statements have 30-second stories record your calls make sure you're sticking to the comp
(10:08) cadence cut the bottom percentage and keep it competitive so they stay in it thank you [Music] [Music] [Applause] you

Transcript:
(00:00) if i'm an entrepreneur and i'm growing my business month over month over month when should i one start taking money out and two when should i start actively investing these are some of the questions i get most frequently uh with the entrepreneurs that i speak with who you know depending on where they're at they might have uh you know five hundred thousand a million two million dollars in the bank and they're like i'm not really sure what i should do and so what i wanted to do was walk you through the thought process that i had
(00:25) around investing uh to give you a little bit of some frameworks to think through that helped me make the system making process a lot easier so first off i'm a big believer in continuing to take dividends out of a business as it continues to grow and that's because you want to decrease your downside risk right because for some reason and the statistics are very likely that the business will not succeed in the long term you know 90 whatever it is 90 or 95 of businesses fell within five years and so uh it's it's much better in my
(00:51) opinion to consistently take money out of the business as you're growing it because there's a very high likelihood that it will not uh stick around a and b many entrepreneurs have this idea that they're going to sell their business for some magical number sometime in the future when in reality only one percent of businesses ever sell and so if that is the case again well i would rather not stack the chips on a 91 to one bet it does happen but the likelihood is low and so i would like to take chips off the table
(01:14) table on a regular basis so that is the first part which is making sure that we're taking money out but the second question is okay well now that i have this money this 500 this million this whatever what should i do with it right and so one of the big things is i just like to think about this through the lens of opportunity cost which is if i'm currently making let's say uh 500 000 a year right from my business in in net free cash flow that's owner earnings what i get to take out of the business after reinvesting in
(01:39) in the growth and competitive advantage that we need to continue to maintain to to grow right so if i have 500 000 of net free cash flow that's coming to me and let's say i've got a million dollars saved up if i were to if i were to passively invest that i should get about 10 ish a year right that's just going to be investing through uh indexes like the s p 500 etc right if i'm doing that then the advantage of actively investing might be the marginal difference but it might be an extra five or ten percent so that would be a 50 to 100 increase
(02:08) because 10 to 15 is a 50 increase right but if i look at it in terms of real terms uh just purely on how much my net worth is going to increase which is the length that we have to look at this through which is the opportunity cost if i were to spend half of my time thinking about actively investing because it will take up half your your mind space i promise you because i've done this mistake before i made this mistake before then what happens is your active income will fall at a disproportionate rate compared to
(02:35) what uh your money is making you so let me i'll walk you through a numbers example so let's say you've got that million dollars and you can get ten percent a year which is a hundred grand on 100 passable right but the additional fifty percent or a hundred thousand dollars a year uh fifty two hundred thousand dollars here which would be five to ten percent of that million right you could get through actively investing well if you're currently making 500 000 a year from your business do you think it would be reasonable to take half or
(02:59) 25 of your time to go chase that when you can probably get your income from 500 to 750 000 in the next year 500 to a million and so for me that was always the opportunity cost of actively investing which until my wealth became so large that i felt like it was the opportunity cost of the money that i should be making by paying more attention to my money was going to outpace my income which is still almost not there and so for me that is why as for entrepreneurs it's my belief that a you should be ripping out cash on a
(03:28) regular basis because that's downside risk protection it's not your upside it is downside protection it's the fact that what if my business does not succeed as much as i'm a big believer in being optimistic you also have to face reality and confront facts which is the likelihood that this particular business that you're on i've had 13 businesses that i've started up to this point and now i own eight more the likelihood that the business that you start is going to be the one that you finish with is extremely extremely extremely low right extremely
(03:53) low and the likely that you're going to sell that business for a big number is extremely extremely extremely low and so you take this money out and you put it into the s p or you put it into an index because it is passive and you can put it there and the idea is that you never have to think about it again now the amount of money that you should keep in cash uh in in my belief is you should have about six months two years worth of normal living that's saved up in cash and that's just so that you can sleep well at night and that's it the other
(04:18) thing is that when you invest that into indexes why not you can always take a loan against those assets if you wanted to start something big so it's not like it's illiquid uh when it's there you can take loans against those assets at 60 or 70 percent uh loan to value meaning if you have a million dollars in assets uh in the s p most banks will give you 60 70 percent of that or at least 50 right depending on the stocks and in your history with them etc that will give you basically for free right they'll give you that one percent
(04:42) or two percent uh money that you can go and reinvest in starting another business or buy a piece of real estate or whatever right and so for entrepreneurs it is my belief that you should be investing most of your time and energy or almost 100 of your time and energy and growing your income growing the main vehicle you have but extracting the money and putting it into a low brain vehicle that's not active that's passive that's truly passive not real estate flipping that's not passive right truly passive if you're in crypto right or you have
(05:11) some speculative stuff that you that you want to get into it's probably taking up way more of your attention than it should be and it's actually going to make your main income suffer which means your net worth will grow more slowly than it otherwise would so it's all about the opportunity cost of your attention all right now i'm going to put this special note out here for employees if the the primary objective of the employee in my opinion is to increase how much your income is and so all of yours and this goes for
(05:34) entrepreneurs too the the initial parts of your investment should be growing to increase your skills because that increases your basis that increases your basic income that you can continue to yield from the marketplace based on your skill set and so this is where i think people step you know they step up over dollars to pick up pennies if you were saving you know 500 a month there's nothing wrong with that but i would be actively investing that 500 or 1000 or 2000 a month in the beginning into making my skills more valuable because i know that
(05:58) if i do that in two years i might quadruple my income because that's the thing is that your ability to earn is one of the greatest investments that's not just a billionaire saying it really is like you get like if you develop the skill of selling which might take you two years you can go from making sixty thousand dollars a year to two hundred and fifty thousand dollars a year or five hundred thousand dollars a year which puts you in the top one percent just by earning that one skill and so if you can develop that
(06:24) skill it is worth the investment and most investments in self-improvement are so disproportionately low that it is worth the investment even if there are courses that you only get a handful of things from you are still as yourself an asset more valuable at the end of the day you are the source you're the source of where all the money comes from so it's like when people don't invest in themselves it makes no sense to me i've spent every dollar i possibly could gaining access uh getting mentorship getting coaching
(06:48) getting programs buying courses buying books and and doing that stuff because i'm the source right if i can improve me as the machine that generates all the flow of income then the rest of the stuff becomes easy right and so first and foremost you have to invest in that after you have an excess of that then start pulling the dividends out of the business that you have and investing those things that are passive not active and then at the point where your net worth from your investable assets what 10 of that net
(07:14) worth growth would be is an excess of what you make per year then at that point it makes sense to start shifting your perspective towards managing wealth and growing wealth rather than growing income now like i said two employees number one is increase your skill basis meaning continue to invest in gaining skills so that you can be more valuable with the company the way you do that is by tying yourself to revenue streams that means you find ways to generate the company more money period and that could be through a
(07:37) variety of ways if you were you know in your your customer success or customer service or film it then it's gonna be how can i send as many customers as possible how can i retain these customers how can i track these metrics and show uh to the people who are deciding my compensation how i'm directly making the company more money right and how losing me would cost my company a lot more than what it would cost them to keep right if i'm on the front end side so it's going to be sales it's going to be marketing to be acquisition based
(08:00) how can i show them what how i can become more valuable how can i close twice as many deals how can i you know close at a higher percentage how can i get more lead flow by working my pipeline better how can i generate leads on my own independent from the leads that they're generating for me right all of those things are things um that you can do to increase how much you make right now like i said if you're an employee there's going to be a certain cap most of the time on what you're earning and if that is the case and you're
(08:23) rubbing against that cap you should keep your your basis for living as low as humanly possible and plow as much of that money as possible into a highly liquid asset again if you're in the situation where your wealth right the net worth that you have is 10 of that amount is still less than you make then all of your your attention should still be going toward your primary net worth increaser which will be your income and so if i can consolidate this video into a single statement you should it's my opinion spend the majority of your time on the vehicle
(08:54) that will increase your net worth the fastest and for most people it is going to be increasing their income until the point where they have saved sufficient amount of assets that they put in passive highly liquid things like s ps and indexes et cetera and at that point when the potential to earn and increase your net worth is faster or greater through the assets that you have at that point it makes sense to switch your attention towards growing those assets because now the opportunity cost is shifted away from where your income
(09:27) is generated versus where your wealth is growing and so that is my uh at what point should you start investing that is how i break it down first invest in you increase your skill basis so that you can generate more income it is the highest return genuinely i'm not saying that for jargon it is the highest return that you can get the second is that you continue to put things in the past truly passive not what people claim is passive that are really side hustles but truly passive business so that you can continue to focus on your main
(09:54) income generation and then when 10 of your net worth growth exceeds your income capacity currently at that point it makes sense for you to shift your perspective into growing your wealth and rather than your income so i hope you found this video valuable click subscribe and i'll see you in the next vid bye

(00:00) The fastest way to become the person that you want is to surround yourself with people who give you no choice but to become them. And so I think Leila and I are very proud to announce that we're bringing in for the first time ever in our career a partner into our business at acquisition.
(00:20) com which is the man, the myth, the legend, the Michael Jordan of the the real estate industry, Shiron Servata. I'm so excited to be here. This is so fun. I'm so excited. I can't believe it's finally here. Over a year. over a year that we've been talking about it now. You remember we're doing the whiteboard session in Alex's office and we were like talking about the whole plan. We plan the whole thing out and it's like the countdown began. Alex had a little timer on his phone.
(00:38) Yeah, I did. And every like for days and weeks I would just be like 78 days left, 54 days left until we could finally announce this. I think that it would be helpful for everyone to know kind of like the thought process behind the decision and kind of our relationship and how it's evolved to even deciding to do this because, you know, getting into a partnership, you know, you've heard our content before. It's I mean, it's like getting married. It's a huge it's a huge decision.
(01:04) I think we were all equally terrified. Yeah. No, just like not wanting to anything up. Yeah. And we've been So, what a lot of people might not know is that we've been friends for six or seven years now and like very good friends. So to give you some context and and we'll walk through the some of the timelines cuz I think it'll be relevant.
(01:21) But like when we were selling the company, I was talking to Shawn every morning like, "Hey, what do you think about this and what do we think of this deal term?" And even before that, uh, you know, I had I got introduced to him from a mutual friend of ours and we had a a Zoom call at like I don't like four or five o'clock at night and I don't really take calls in the afternoon.
(01:39) Was like, "This is so weird." And I was like, "I don't know, but this guy seems awesome." from what this guy had said cuz he'd already sold a company for $3.4 billion. I was like, I want to talk to somebody. He was like, it's for sure a scam. Yeah. Like I was like, who are you talking to that did that? Yeah.
(01:55) And so anyways, we hopped on and then we ended up talking for like three and a half hours, which never happens. And so I think that's pretty much how it kicked off. And we very quickly became very good friends. Well, I remember what happened was like Alex went on the Zoom call, right? And then I made dinner, all the stuff.
(02:13) He comes back at like 8:30 and then I was like, "How was the call?" And he was like, "You need to meet this guy. Like, you'd really like him." And I was like, "Yeah, most of the time when he introduced me to someone, I'd be like, listen, something smells wrong about this guy, right?" And then I remember like I was so hesitant, but I was like, "Okay, he would not like be like, "You need to meet him if he didn't think so." He's like, "No, I think like you would get along really well with him." And I was like, "Okay.
(02:29) " He's only said that about like two or three people ever. I've been right every time. Correct. Do you remember the first call though? What we did was um Alex was on the call. Yeah. And we just drew processes out on a white on a on an iPad. Yeah, I do remember cuz I remember being like blown away. I was like, "Oh my god, how do you know all this stuff?" And then I was like, "Can I pay you money? I don't know what to do." And you were like, "We're just friends.
(02:52) " And I was like, "I understand, but this is more I just need I need you to help me with shit." And you were like, "No." And I was like, "Yes." I was like, "Please help." And so I would say Shiron was the original kind of first trusted confidant for our money.
(03:09) So like we had you know good amount of money prior to the sale and then obviously after the sale there was even more. And so the game of making money versus the game of making your money make money are two completely different games. There is crossover where one makes you better at the other and the other makes you better at the first. But there's still a ton or for me there was a huge amount of ignorance that of I mean even around tax law of like oh wait hold on these I I'm getting this distribution but I'm getting taxed on this too.
(03:33) I was like, "But I paid tax on the money the first time." Yeah. And then like, "Wait, you can have other things that can appreciate and then there's blends for cash flow and and all of this stuff." And then it's like, "Oh, there's there's buckets that you can put your investments into so that you can optimize towards different outcomes.
(03:45) " And all of this stuff was stuff that we didn't know. And we ended up creating our money rules list. I think three four years ago. You guys might have seen a video of mine where was like, "These are the money rules. These are money algorithms." A lot of those stem from from Chiron. It's so cool because like you're you're really great at marketing and brand.
(04:01) you're really great at investing and you're really great at operating. And it's like every time I've seen one area, it's just like the depth of knowledge in each area, too. It's like it's not like you're shallow and all. It's like you deep knowledge in each of those areas.
(04:14) I think that's when we really started talking a lot more because then it was like, okay, we're talking about all the cuz we're doing the same and that was really fun for me. I remember when when the time between after the sale after I s we had sold Telus and I was just doing investing private equity stuff. I would just talk to both of you saying, "Man, I don't know what my next thing is.
(04:32) " And the crazy part is, I think a lot of people don't know this, but you were the first people that I talked to about the real opportunity. And I said, hey, I have this. This is super interesting. Small public company, 200 million in revenue, and you're like, you get to go work. Yeah. Go do that. It's funny to like sit back and think about it all because I think um too, I was like thinking through before we we sat down here.
(04:55) I was like, how did this conversation even start around us all working together? Because I we I had obviously talked about with Alex for years before we'd ever talked about it with you cuz I was and it was more of like um I was like, "Oh my god, is there some way we could bring Chiron on the board or like bring him in as like like how do we involve him somewhat in act?" And it was just like something I didn't know how to do and it's like normal. I remember telling him. I would ask Chiron about this, but I can't ask him about it because it's him. And then uh I'm trying
(05:19) to think about do you guys remember how we started having the conversation about I I know exactly what happened really. So, we were at dinner and then I said, "Man, I I think I've hit all the big goals." We went from 200 million valuation to a billion dollar valuation. And I said, "I'm done. I think I'm just going to retire." And Alex just laughed.
(05:37) He's like, "You would be so bored being retired again. You've already done this." Yeah. You should just come work with us. Yeah. And we could do it for a long time. Yeah. And I was like, "Ah, you don't want that." I was like, "No, I do want that. You should totally do that." And so, I'll give you a little bit a little a little bit of backtory. Well, Quinton Tarantino know this.
(05:54) We'll we'll put the pieces together. But Shrine came here as an immigrant, as the only child. His parents sold their belongings to get him a one-way ticket so that he could be here. And then immediately you met a mentor who took interest in you with your very thick Indian accent, which you can't hear anymore because he worked on getting rid of it.
(06:12) And then what did you get accepted to a program? What was the how like what was the gap there that that got you into like the that that software company? So, how how it all happened was for my senior paper in college, I I wrote this I wrote the senior paper in computer science and I pitched at a programming contest at Berkeley and one of the judges said to me uh after I pitched saying, "Hey kid, you're not going to win.
(06:34) " I was like, "Thanks a lot." But that was a good idea. I just funded a couple of the guys. I think what you are sharing would be perfect for them. And that was my first foray into, you know, having a startup. And so, I actually lived in my in my aunt's basement.
(06:52) I had no money and we were building a startup down Sand Hill Road raising cash and this was during the boom. So we we raised 20 plusish million dollars and then sold that business overall. So it was all by chance when I was of my senior paper pitching at a programming contest. So you got the exit money from that deal and learned a bunch of stuff about deal making in that process which we'll get to another time and then you took off for like five years to play professional tennis and so plays professional. He's like oh great I'm done. I don't need money anymore.
(07:16) I'm going to play tennis for the next five years. Can you imagine Alex explaining this story to me after he had you had told I was like, why is what? I was like, yeah, this guy's a tennis player and he was Indian and dad. He's a billionaire. It's it's awesome. Like what? And so so uh after that though, you're like, you know, I need to I need to get back to work.
(07:34) So then you went to get your NBA. Yep. Yeah. So went to Vanderbilt. So he's a fellow fellow commodore. For those of you who don't know, I also went to Vanderbilt Community College. Yep. Community college. Western. Um that's what they that's what the kids call it.
(07:50) Um anyways, so goes to goes to Vanderbilt for the NBA and then goes from Vanderbilt into Goldman Sachs on the credit side, right? Yeah. And then calling all these business owners to you know talk about financial products and investing things like that. Did you is that how you found Telus? Yeah. So one of my clients was also an investor just had invested in this in this real estate company and he said hey I invested in this real estate company.
(08:14) can you come and take a look at it and that's how the Telus process started. Telus was how many years? Five. So in five years Shiron went in bought a huge chunk of the company. We went from 300 million in gross volume to the 3.4 billion in five years and then they sold that company and then that got integrated into Douglas Element. Douglas Element. Yeah. And so after that sale, he then was like, "Okay, I'm going to do another five or six year stint of of of the the Chiron. What do I do with my life uh investment? I have I have so much money.
(08:47) What do I do?" Dude, I remember the first time when we hung out with you during that stint, too. Like you were like, "You guys want to go to breakfast?" at like 9:00. Yeah. We were so stressed like breakfast on a Tuesday at the middle of my day.
(09:05) So an ongoing joke that you don't know is that we are like trunk the only person we do breakfast with only literally I would I I say no to every by the way I had no idea. Oh there you go. I still had no idea until I know I thought I'd surprise you. It's like we you eat from like 9 to like 115 and it's like well there's my entire morning. Sorry. We also drank like 14 cups of decaf. So yeah until it actually starts hitting you like calf when you drink that much of it.
(09:29) But we um but anyway, so you you you did that and that's I mean I I say that jokingly, but Strillo Capital got started and then that was really the family office component of it where you did private equity and venture side investments and then a bunch of real estate stuff as well obviously because that's the the background that you come from.
(09:48) You had a huge mix of doing that and then that's that kind of got us to the to the real situation where real was doing you know 200 million or has a had a $200 million uh market cap and it was it 36 months? Yeah. Not even. Yeah. So less than three years went to 1.2 billion. So 6x in less than three years when Chiron came in. And so that is uh that is the the Michael Jordan of the real estate industry. Not not only doing a billion dollar company once but twice.
(10:13) So he's 100% on his real estate um companies getting to a billion. And so we're just honestly we're I I would just say like I'm beyond thrilled to have Chiron in here because it's it was such it was so natural because all of the major business decisions and strategic direction stuff that I would end up calling Chiron about anyways like I feel like you I was shadow I was getting you as a shadow deacto partner and so the the integration has been almost like we just get to hang out more than we did before. Yeah, it's really interesting because I also think during that time where you
(10:43) started and you were doing all the investments yourself, we kind of took your structure and mirrored it for us and that's when we learned about private equity, when we learned about investing, we then we found seven real estate partners and the only one that ever ended up working out was from you. Well, I'll say the ones that worked out well.
(11:01) Yeah. Yeah. Worked out well. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Sorry for anybody out there, but the only impressive returns and deals were from you. like now it's like I can't imagine the fact that we didn't work together before not the same time but like around you know yeah very similar time frame and then that's when I think we started talking more and more about we shifted from investing to business and then as acquisition.
(11:25) com started taking off and then you had like I don't know what the next step is then it was like it just felt like it made so much sense and I think we were all so worried like is it like how's it going to be what and it's funny cuz I remember the first your first day like when we sat down in a meeting together it was Like I was so nervous. I don't know why. It wasn't even my meeting.
(11:44) I was just shadowing and and then it was like after 45 minutes and then we're like by the end of the day it felt like it felt like this has always been how it has been. Does that make sense? Yeah. And like now it's like I can't imagine the fact that we didn't work together before for all those years. It's crazy. Well, we kind of did. I was just not on the official Slack channel, but that's fair.
(12:01) Like you've told me about this. I'm like I know. But I well I think the my favorite kind of part of the story is I got to see gym launch and sale. I got to see the early idea of acquisition.com. I got to see Acquisition.com version one, the building and the growth of Headquarters, Acquisition.com version two, and then all the stuff we're planning for the future.
(12:27) And so it feels like I've had a chance to see and be a part of it in from the outside looking in, but the inside looking in is even cooler, which is which is the best part. Yeah, it's it's just it's super fun. I think for anybody watching too, you know, as as we're talking about this, I think a good lesson to take away is like I think one thing that was really apparent to me early on at least is like why did Alex say like, "Oh, you'd like this guy, right?" He said that because most of the people that he would, you know, we we talked to and I'm sure you have the same thing. It's like they just
(12:57) want money. It's like they're in business. I think it's like there's people who are in business to make money and then people who are love business and love making cool and then make money by consequence. And when I met you, it was clear that you were the type of person that you like building you like being excellent and building a great business and money comes as a consequence of that, right? money comes as a consequence of the fact that you actually really love people and that you're a really great person and that
(13:21) you have values that you value your family and like there's just so few people who have that where I think for me especially like it's so important to me that anybody that we work with doesn't just have this one area like they know how to make money but they also can build a great business they're great to their team they're great to their clients they have a great reputation they have a great family life they take care of themselves personally and it's like when I met you it was so clear that you had all those you weren't just like one area and sacrificing all
(13:46) the Because, you know, I think there's a difference between like building a great business and making money. We all know that. And so, I think that's why also just like very early on and throughout the process of being us being friends. I think the reason it was so easy to be friends is we have shared values.
(13:58) Well, I'll tell you this one thing, and I learned this from both of you, which is you can't just be good at one thing. And to win in life, I'm sorry, you have to win at everything. And sometimes you have seasons of life where one takes precedence. Like Alex will say, I have the season of no. Or you say, I'm working on my health. That's great. But you have to win at everything.
(14:18) There is no other choice. And I I bet people are thinking, well, how did this, you know, how did they negotiate? How to do the financials of the deal? And I want to tell people, yeah, no, no, it's worth telling. Yeah. The the depth of the relationship allowed for the deal terms to be really easy.
(14:36) And um for for everyone watching, Alex and Ila said, "Hey, just write us an email with what you're thinking." So, I wrote an email and then they hit reply all, added counsel, and say, "Please draft this." That's all it was. That was the whole negotiation which would have been months and years for most people arguing over terms etc. We had none of that.
(14:56) It was a I've been through a lot of these in in my life and I will tell you it was the most gracious the kindest and it nothing reaffirmed wanting to do this personally for me when all that y'all did was hit reply all and say just paper this. It was literally the same. It was and it reminded me of like even just like in any great partnership, right? It's like you're just everything's been done ahead of time. So then it makes the hard stuff easy because you've already worked on the hard stuff. Yeah.
(15:21) And and that's I think a good lesson for everybody which is if you're getting to the point where stuff's breaking down on a final deal term means something else was majorly wrong before and so if you can get all of that in alignment the the deal points are very simple. I want to I I I want to hit on something because I think it's important.
(15:47) So, I said it very casually at the beginning, but Leila and I have never had partner that we've basically brought into our kind of like the holding company. I spend I've spent the last, you know, five five years from a content perspective and the last 13 plus from a reputation perspective building reputation. And so, bringing someone in at that level was a serious, you know, decision.
(16:11) And if you're thinking like, okay, well, then why why would why would they do something like that? like couldn't couldn't you just try and find uh somebody you could just just hire or something like that. There comes certain levels of skill and experience that are unhirable. You know what I mean? Like there's the deal that uh you know Open AI did with John Ivy, right? like he's he's now just basically a co-founder status of OpenAI because he brings such a depth of experience and a network and a skill set and and and and that to replicate that it would be both impractical and likely I don't want to say impossible but the the effort to replicate it would detract from the whole overall. It's like you
(16:48) would have to have like two companies to replicate what what Chiron can do. And so the vision for where we're trying to go, if anything, is that this has just expanded what or brought the future closer of what we have always wanted to do with acquisition.com and tried to pay down ignorance desk as fast as possible with somebody who has I mean I mean more experienced than anyone um on on the deal side, on the real estate side, private equity side like he has so much there. But then obviously from a scale perspective in the trenches building two billion dollar companies
(17:24) all within fiveyear periods. I mean I'm I'm very upfront about the the things that I I will always reinvest in our ability to do more. This was a serious call and I mean you think about for me it's like you're going to associate someone really heavily with your brand. It's a it's a huge bet.
(17:43) You know there's risk but Sean felt very much worth the risk because I think what we're going to do together is going to be really big. You know it's funny as you're saying that. You know, one thing I realized through the whole process is not one time did I have a doubt. Yeah. Like not one doubt. Like I like never I never felt bad about it. I never had any like hesitation. I just worried that I was going to [ __ ] it up somehow.
(18:01) And I still to this day I think we both have that like I'm hinged on that like what am I going to do to [ __ ] it up? I haven't heard that word. Every other situation we've been in it's just us. It's just us. I sleep fine. Good lord. I know. I just take it all for both of us.
(18:21) every deal we've done, every event, like I always am the one doubting and hesitating and I like literally never like it always felt good. Like it felt really good for me the whole time. I think part of it too for like people that are listening is like that's the logic side of it. I think there's another side which is like none of us have to do this. Yeah. And and because of that I look at it as like what's the biggest risk to any of us not achieving our dreams? Ducks acquisition.
(18:40) com like all of it is that we stop. And why would we stop? Not because we can't do it, but because we don't want to do it anymore. We don't like it. Because we don't like it. Yeah. So, like I think about it and I' I told Alex, I was like, I'm getting to the point where it's like I just want to do stuff I love with people I love.
(18:58) And so, it's like you bring in people and you become partners with people that you feel like I will have a higher quality of life within my business and enjoy myself more if I get to work with these people. I think that's really important. And so I I think for anybody watching too, like that's a that's a huge piece of it because people come to me all the time. They're like, "I'm gonna hire this person or I'm gonna bring in this partner.
(19:17) " And I'm like, "Do you like having dinner with them?" And it's like, "No, I don't like having dinner with them." And I'm like, "Well, what why are you bringing them in and giving them half your business?" You know what I mean? And so I think like that's a that's a huge point that people need to to think about and consider when it comes to that stuff.
(19:35) I would say that the second piece too is that at some point in a business like a lot of people might be watching this and thinking like maybe I need to find a partner now but I think you have to consider the size that you're at and it's at some point you're not looking to hire people anymore. Multiple people at similar levels are looking to partner because at some point it's like 1 plus 1 equals 11. That's the way I think about it except it' be like 1 plus 1 plus 1 equals I don't know 331.
(19:53) Well, can you talk about that though? um you you made a great video about it, but um the early discussions for us revolved around this metaphor of the barrel, and I think you you broke it down really well. I'd love for you to maybe share share the idea of the the ammo, the resources around it.
(20:12) Yeah, it's at some point I think we get into this pattern when when we're bring people into the business, bring resources in, it's almost like they're bullets. Like you need to give them give the resources to somebody who's capable of building something from nothing. And at some point you have to bring in a barrel. And when you think of a barrel, you think of somebody like you who can create something of nothing, who can be as effective as you at the things that you're doing. And at that point, it's like, if I'm going to bring in somebody has the same skill set as me, then that's a different type of thing. That's
(20:37) not you're not going to hire that into your business, right? And if you did, maybe you hire somebody in 10 years, they're at that level, but not, you know, and and sometimes never.
(20:50) And so at that point, you have to say like, I need a barrel, which is something I can give ammunition to, and they can just go shoot it, and they can hit the target. And so I think like you know Alex and I are each a barrel and Chiron's a barrel. So now we have you have two new barrels and we have one new barrel, right? Well, Alex talked about it when he first shared it with me. He goes, "Hey, most founders are single barreled." Yeah.
(21:08) And they've got to get to a point and maybe you can articulate this better, which is like, "All right, now I get to a point and now I've got to go raise money or create something to artificially create a a second opportunity for myself to to get the barrel bigger." And what a lot of people don't realize is the first time I met both of you, the first time I talked to Alex, I go, "Man, he can just make something out of nothing." Like he can make things up.
(21:34) It is amazing Alex's ability to make things up and just make things up that can drive brand, create businesses, etc. And I was like, that's who's going to make it happen? And so when then when I chat with Leo I was like, "Okay, well you got the make thing up and make thing happen." Yeah. And I think there's a that's why it's it's worked really well for both of you, right? And so Alex can make anything up and can make anything happen. And that's a really powerful combination. And so my my question for you, Alex, is if someone
(22:02) is thinking about that in their business, is there is that the diagnostic or would you think about a different diagnostic? So I think there's like there's so everything comes down to return on time, right? Like I think if if we boil everything down for the entrepreneurs like you only have so much time and you have to get returns on your time.
(22:25) We try and get other people who have high leverage time which is like not only can I get somebody who can do something but they're also bringing in 10 years that I don't have to learn to get that skill to then do this other thing with the the rate limiter which is the whole concept of barrels. is like you can only ship things so quickly and there's only so many opportunities that you can pursue like and I'm a big advocate of focus aggressive advocate of focus but you really never overexpand you just undertalent and I think the vast and that undertalent is just not enough barrels right you have 20 great ideas you've got one life and there's one you
(22:54) now if you had 20 barrels you could do all 20 you've got Elon he's got six big you know crazy opportunity is his highest leverage is his ability to attract barrels probably more than anything else but with I I want to circle back to She said with me and Ila. So I got to somewhere in the neighborhood of between $2 and $3 million a year.
(23:11) I can't remember the exact financials but between $2 million a year when Leila and I met. That was about where I had kind of like capped as an entrepreneur. And that was for I chased too many rabbits. I was too spread thin and I had six different businesses. I had all these different things going on. And then when Lea came in my life, she got me to focus on one opportunity.
(23:30) And then she was able to basically make all these things happen and also at the same time push back and be like great idea next year. And that from an order of magnitude perspective that went from I mean you think about where we were there two or $3 million a year as a solo entrepreneur to adding one other barrel then took us to nine figures plus right and it's like okay and that's why it's like okay well there's two and this is why Le was saying the you know 1 plus one doesn't equal two or three it's it can equal you know 11. it can be a huge increase in in
(24:00) throughput. And I think that that having, you know, a third barrel makes it I mean, we're excited about, you know, we've been we've been talking for a year. It's for everybody who's, you know, curious.
(24:11) It's like it's not like, hey, Sean's coming in because we're just going to like keep doing what we're doing. We have very big plans that we've been honestly laying since we started talking a year ago that have been in the works that you guys will find out about. I think that's fundamentally what we solve for is like with the highest leverage thing is just like not having to live Chiron's life in order to to do that.
(24:30) we can just bring Shiron in and then get the aggregate benefit of all my life and my experience, your life and your experiences and then yours together. And that's where the there the the the skills stack and compound. So there's this framework that I like sharing a lot which is like if you think about or I believe that the potential of a business is based on the aggregate skill set of the people contained within it.
(24:50) And if you're the person who has done every job in the business then it means that literally only one brain has is the max capacity of the business. And so if you were to imagine this as like a little triangle, it's like all of a sudden if you just add a second brain, how much higher the peak gets just from adding two kind of rate limiters or capacitors in the business.
(25:10) And when you add a third, the peak goes way higher in terms of the capacity for the business. That's where this gets really exciting. And there's a third kind of alpha for everyone, which is what are the opportunities that get unlocked that none of us could pursue on our own, but that we could only do an aggregator together.
(25:30) And I think that's where that's where we get these more sophisticated and yet simpler it's more more complex to execute simpler in con in concept uh outcomes that everyone can agree like man if we could just do this one thing it could change everything it's like yeah and that's where I'm like yeah we could change everything and you guys are like it will take more stuff but I I think it's really powerful though for for the person listening and watching to kind of decode a little bit of what Alex and Lea just shared is that we've experienced this and I I Really one of my favorite things about being an acquisition.com is this where we could
(25:58) have a chat about something and then Leila will say I got it and then that's it. You don't have to worry because Leila got it right or we'll be talking about something and say I got it. The conversation is over and the more people that you can that can say I got it is insanely powerful for an organization.
(26:17) Do I say I got it? You say I got it very often and I I I really appreciate that. Alex never got it. We sometimes have to text you under the table. This is this is your time to say I got it right now. No, no, but but and I actually think you made a video about this.
(26:37) You said, you know, how do you get scale? You get scale when you ensure that the the the leverage that is transferred gets transferred without a change in the performance in some way, right? Which is insane. And so probably my favorite three words that someone can ever tell me is I got it. Because I know that and if they actually got it, it's super super powerful.
(26:56) And when you have someone like that in your organization, I would support them, get out of their way, reduce fiction, get them support, make sure whatever they want is taken care of. Not that you need a partner per se, but anybody that is that can that has that level of competence and that has that level of care, I would highly take care of them.
(27:16) And if you're in an organization right now and you feel like you want that recognition, say, "Hey, partner, manager, boss, whatever, I got it." And then deliver on the I got it. That is the fastest way to kind of building that that trust with your with your team. No, it's really good. You say, "I got it all the time." And it's just like if someone says it to me, I'm just like, I will ask no more questions.
(27:32) Like as long as I you know, as long as you got it. As long as there's qualifiers there. Yeah. As long as I know they got it. Well, because I also think that the other thing it does for the person saying, "I got it," which what a lot of people don't realize is when you say, "I got it," there's an insane belief system and a responsibility that you put on yourself. Because the reason I say I got it is I can't let Ila down.
(27:51) And so I will work super hard because I put those three words in front of Ila. And the next time I say it, and if I did not get it, then she's going to be like, "What the heck?" You know? No. So there is a there has to be a 100% say do ratio and I got it. You can't you cannot screw anytime. And if you do, you're like, I'm so sorry. This is what happened. Let me go fix it.
(28:11) Right? So the the number of I got it that can happen in an organization will move the business so much faster. It's a really good analogy. Now I'm thinking about it. I'm like who says I got it the most? I can think of the top two people that say it to me the most. I'm like oh I always appreciate it so much.
(28:30) I'm like oh yeah I'll throw this in like I think um bringing a partner on I think you know this has been awesome you know for us but trying to explain like right way to feel wrong way to feel. I think just from a pattern recognition perspective might be helpful.
(28:49) one, we've been working for, you know, not working, but like we've been talking about this, so we've laid a lot of, you know, groundwork for this so that we can hit the ground running, but Chiron has given me and especially Ila attention back. And so it's like, and I don't like using soft language, but I'll use it here and then I'll explain it. But like it makes like Shiron is making everything feel lighter.
(29:06) And so I see that as okay, I only have so much time and so much bandwidth, which is even less than the time that I have in terms of like mental acuity. And all of a sudden having twothirds of the things that I was formerly working on now just gone and being done at the same level or arguably higher because Toron has more experience with these things.
(29:25) So, we're paying down ignorance as we're kind of learning the edge cases of what is the nine figure to 10 figure marketing playbook look like? What is the nine figure to 10ig sales playbook look like? What does the nine figure to 10 figure product playbook look like? We're trying to pay down this ignorance set as fast as we can across all these functions.
(29:43) But it's like, well, Sean already did this on the public level, you know, in a public company and before that in in Telas at a multi-billion dollar level. It's like, well, some of these legal infrastructure pieces, it's like, okay, well, we we can and we'll learn it or we can just not have to pay the scar that I know or the interest that is going to come due later because we just pay that debt down now.
(30:01) And I think that that habit of trying being willing to sacrifice some today to not get destroyed tomorrow has served us really well. But from a from a feeling perspective, which I don't really tap into very much, it just things feel lighter.
(30:20) And I think that if if somebody comes into your organization, obviously it works at any level, but if someone comes into the organization and it feels heavier, it's it's it's not that person is not helping you. they're not putting attention back on your plate so that you can then eat up the problems that you're uniquely qualified to to solve at the higher level than you're currently solving on it. No, I think that's really valid.
(30:40) I also think even even in that case like when you're bringing someone to make it feel lighter, whatever that may be, I think like for me it's definitely very mental. It's also from a work standpoint, but like the mental like knowing that even just like talking things through with you. It's just like I just value that so much and I'm so grateful for it just to talk through things that I didn't have anybody in the organization to talk to about before.
(30:59) You know what I mean? It's like of course but we don't even work on the same things in the company so it's different which has just been like a a sigh of relief of like me being like this is right and you're like that or like this is amazing right and you're like that's amazing. I'm like, "Oh, okay." Like, it's nice validation.
(31:13) And then also like be able to run things by you and learn things that I didn't know. You know, when we told the team that you were coming on, like the the way that I brought it up to everyone, I was like, "Guess who hasn't taken a company to a billion dollars before? Me.
(31:29) " And I was like, "So, I would like to bring on somebody who has like," and I think a a big learning for me was that, you know, I I was and of course I didn't talk to you about it because you were very busy at the time, but like I was so nervous to tell everybody like so nervous. So, like I talked to one of my coaches.
(31:46) I talked to like two of my coaches about I'm like, "How do I do this in a way that positions it really well?" And they were like, "Well, what's the truth about this?" And I was like, "All these everything that we just said here, right?" And they're like, "Well, just tell the truth." And it was so funny because I told the whole team and that was exactly the frame I used which was just like I haven't done this before. Shiron has.
(32:03) We've been friends for this long. We've been talking to him behind the scenes for this long. Like these are all the things and not one person had an adverse response and still has not like it has gone insanely well. So, what I will say is that if if you are bringing in somebody to help, you don't want to like skimp out on how you bring them in, how you talk about it with your team, um even like onboarding, like it was fast and crazy, but like I built out everything and then you were like, I don't need all that. You're like, I will do some of that, but it, you know, it's like you just never know, right? It's
(32:35) like you don't know. We should talk about Shiao Shiron onboarded because I think that would be super helpful for people who are bringing in high level executives, directors, partners. Do you want to hit on that? I mean, we can. It wasn't even as planned because I end up having to No, but I love what you did.
(32:53) I mean, so you know, the first thing that Shiron did, which a lot of So, this is I I think this is kudos to Shawn because he has zero ego, which is why he is as successful as he is. But a lot of, you know, partners, execs, even directors depending like leaders will just say might come into a company and just be like, "All right, what's my 30 609?" And there's nothing wrong with that. That's fine.
(33:11) But Tron just was like, "Okay, I'm going to meet every single person who works at acquisition.com from like the bottom of the ORC chart all the way up." And he was like, "This gets me so much rapid contact and I'll have rapport and and and he basically onboarded himself within 10 days and talked to you know 100 plus people in that period of time and was like he came back and was like I understand what's going on now which is better than like you trying to write a 16page document that trying from because the thing is is it's always going to be one person's perspective whereas if you
(33:40) get a hundred different perspectives you actually get such a such a a three-dimensional view of the company rather than 2D. kind of paper version. I'll also say that from a speed of growth perspective, if we think about the speed of a business can be derived from the speed of their ability to make decisions, right? Well, it's like then what what speeds up uh decision-m ability. So, one part is data.
(34:05) Uh well, actually data is going to be the biggest one. But when you don't have in the absence of data, you have patterns, right? You have basically past data that you can extrapolate in the future. And so to your point, Leila, it's like we might say, "Hey, um, based on reasoning, you know, just on logic and what we know about the world, we believe this is a good a good uh good direction or a good decision.
(34:25) " And having someone who has that pattern that's already recognized be like, "Yeah, already did that." Like that's the right call or yes, and add this piece because this will come up later. It it has compressed what would be maybe multiple hour, two hour long discussions to then being finally like, "All right, let's just do it.
(34:43) " But that whole process might take two two weeks or four weeks to make that call which then can now be done in 30 minutes. But then tomorrow we have another 30 minute decision and the day after we have another 30-minute decision. But each one of those would have been two to four weeks, two to four weeks, two to four weeks.
(34:59) And like that's where you can see why a company can grow at 10 times the rate, a 100 times the rate of others because minutes versus months is a massive difference when we look at time scales for growth. And I think that's one of the other massive unlocks that that uh I mean I'm excited that you've already already given us, but you know even more in the future. You mean just how we make decisions? Yeah.
(35:17) Yeah. I think part of that too is like we're so we're usually like this and I feel like you have the unique like you've done a lot of things like by having both the sets of skills. So like you can flex on either side and so like you bring a really like grounding middle ground. I don't think I ever disagree with you.
(35:35) No. Well, thank you. But the I think the interesting part about the onboarding which people need to know is the thoughtful like Leila wrote me a like a 16 to 20 page onboarding plan which was amazing because because that allowed me to saying all right let me read through that and the interesting part about that was not the plan itself was seeing Leila's thought process on how the world works. And I thought and I think that most people will just say, "Okay, cool. Hey, let's do a press release and bring
(36:05) this person on board and hey, for the first uh few months just meet people." I'm like, "No, you want 90 days of like ramping up. That's crazy." Yeah. Like you have the you need to make you need to make impact today. And so Alex hit the nail on the head where if there if the organization is somewhat larger, especially if there's a hybrid component to it, you can't wait for rapport. You need rapport and patterns very quickly.
(36:30) And so if you if you if you're talking to people and five of them say this is what they love about the company, that reinforces what that is. And if three of them say this is the same issue, that reinforces what that is. And you learn it very quickly and you learn it from natural patterns.
(36:47) And that also allows to rapport. So if if you're newer in a company, I I would suggest focusing on rapport and patterns. That would be very very helpful. The second is to be super impactful, you have to find the most granular thing that happens in the business. So for us, it was me going through every single line item in RPNL.
(37:06) Yeah. Right. And so I know you know everything because where the money goes is where the business invests and once you know that you know where everything is is at. So if you're in a in a marketing organization, you should know every single metric, every single channel and that allows you to kind of figure out that is the pattern in a lot of ways.
(37:24) So you people think about learning top down. You want to learn bottom up because that allows you to know what the culture of decision-m happens. That's what's manifested in the bottom up numbers. And if you do bottom up, you can get perspective very quickly. If you do top down, it takes a lot of time.
(37:40) I think that's what I was most impressed with is I totally saw the the bottom up approach there. It's just like already being able to recall so many of the details. I was like, "Wow." Like just so fast. I don't even have anything insightful to say. It was just like really it was really impressive. Well, I think the pattern for me is that, you know, if we bring leaders in in general, I mean, I think we've tended to we talk about this publicly anyways, but it was just further reinforcing of the framework that like a players don't usually need a long time to immediately start providing
(38:07) value. And when we hear someone who might say like, I'm gonna need a quarter just to like get my bearings, it's like probably not the guy or the gal, right? like every single player that I could name off the top of my head in this business like immediately I mean within the first five day you know first work week was like I got it I can I already understand this chunk I'm going to start eating this and I'm going to understand these but they hit the ground running and um every time that I've probably
(38:32) been like you know what we'll give them a it's like it's never really worked out long term or it's just been an also ran it's been like a they're all right like they somewhat solved the problem and they're not a screaming hot pain right now I'll deal with it later but every A player hits the ground running and you know this is obviously no exception.
(38:50) I I I would love both of your perspectives on this and I because hopefully this is helpful for folks watching as they're bringing people on or you're coming onto an organization is you want to deliver artifacts as soon as possible and it's not just oh I had impact you want to deliver something real tangible artifact something as soon as possible and when you start producing people around you are like wait a minute he showed up he tried he showed up he wrote a memo he showed up he made a video he showed up he set up a process he showed up he talked to a vendor right and so it's the
(39:17) email is not the artifact. The artifact is the artifact. And the more artifacts that you can ship early on, the more confidence you get and the more feedback you get and you you start to realize if you're coming in new to an organization, the more artifacts you can ship, the better. And when you say artifacts, do you mean like organizational wins? Correct. Okay.
(39:36) Just through Hey, um we readed this memo, here's a video, here's how we're thinking about this. Like something I always think about it as what do you have to show for it? Yeah. Yeah. What have you done this week? Yeah. which is a great Doge question, but you you have to ask yourself, what do you have to show for it? And if you have nothing to show for it, and you it's okay you made a decision, but early on you have to have to have something to show for that decision. Otherwise, you don't get cultural buyin on that.
(39:58) No, I think that's one piece that people discount a lot, which is like it I I I explain this to people. I'm like, listen, I can know what you're doing, but if the team doesn't see wins from you, they're not going to like assimilate you into the organization, right? They're not going to know why should I listen to this person because you're like, oh well, no, ask Leila.
(40:16) doing all this for eight weeks behind the scenes. They're like, "Okay, whatever." All behind the scenes. Don't be behind the scenes. The two biggest piece of advice I give to everyone that asks me, because we have so many new people, they're like, "What can I do?" And I'm like, "One, don't tell people what to do when you're new. Like, don't go around telling people that something they do is wrong.
(40:33) Like, that doesn't make you smart. It doesn't make you cool. It doesn't that's not why you're here. Like, just watch. Just watch." I was like, "The second thing is offer to help everybody." I'm like, "Just offer." just like, "Hey, is there anything I can do to help you? Is there anything I can do to support you?" Like, if you do those two things, it's like, and one thing I've noticed with you is you're like, "How can I support? How can I help? Is there anything I can do for you?" Like constantly asking those things. And it's like even if someone
(40:55) doesn't need something, it's like they feel like, "Oh, they they asked if they can do something for me and they're brand new." You know what I mean? And you always gain rapport from kind of the servant frame, right? It's like it's not telling them uh what to do. It's asking them what you can do. Just a small pivot.
(41:15) And by doing that though, then it's like now I've got one reward cycle with this person and one, especially if you come in from the position of above, right? If they know you have the authority, you flipping be like, "Hey, how can I help you?" Like I think that's the authority hijack, right? The the thing that you could do that ultimately will gain you real influence rather than title-based authority um in the business.
(41:39) The one thing I will offer is the the thing that made me feel the most welcome and secure was Leila's document because it showed me that she cared enough to spend all that time preparing for me. And I don't think most I'm just going to say most onboarding managers do that where imagine the anxiety of a new person coming on board anywhere in the organization. They want to show up. They want to be successful.
(42:07) they want to do a good job, you know, uh but it is the first two to four weeks are actually the manager's responsibility, not the person's responsibility. And us putting in a little bit of effort up front, showing them that you have saying, "Hey, this is this is a plan. Here's a here's the onboarding plan shows that you care so much about the person coming on board as opposed to, oh yeah, we'll just introduce you around and watch your No, you don't want to do that." And so I publicly want to thank you. I know how much effort went into that.
(42:32) But that allowed me to see your thinking and also feel your care which we have a bunch of new leaders coming on board that are going to work with us directly and that it you set the bar for me to think about them coming on that way. uh and almost to guarantee their success. And so I want to take I want to my effort needs to guarantee their success because at the end of the day, we just want guaranteed success.
(43:03) And so I want to I want to do the effort and I and you showed me how to do that. That was super cool. Oh, I appreciate that. I um it's funny you say that because that is when I I remember when I walked into a new job and they had a whole document packet and like basket for me and the way I felt was like I'd never had a job do that and they had like two days where they spent so much time with me.
(43:28) It was all structured and it I wanted to give more to them because of what I got there. And that was when it clicked for me of like okay when I build an organization like the first impression of just like how much effort they're willing to put in. I didn't need half of it, right? And I didn't end up using half of it, but like that they were willing to made such a difference in just like feeling welcome because you're, you know, you're nervous and stuff. And so I'm glad it was helpful.
(43:47) I know the document was definitely overblown and I did it out of complete anxiety of not wanting. No, I was it was I it was awesome. Yeah. I was like if this fails it's my fault for sure but that is the responsibility that that the leader should take right that is that is the responsibility because you spend all this time hiring going through the process making the person feel special come on board and then you're like welcome yeah or even the you know I think what a lot of people don't talk about I I prepared so much for issues with
(44:16) bringing like telling people that you were coming in of like people being like well Ila I want to work with you on this or I'm going to like this or like who's this person what's going on? Like how are we going to make decisions? Like I was completely prepared for all of that. Um because that's what so many people told me like happens.
(44:34) So I was like even though we have such a great culture and organization like I just need to prepare for it. And I think a lot of people that's that's actually where I spent even probably just as much time which was having the conversations with people oneonone talking to people. What does it mean? What does it not mean? What's changing? What's not changing for individuals and then for the company? And I think that alone is where a lot of people fail is that they don't do the work when they're bringing in a new leader or a new partner to position them well to step into the organization and be welcome. Because a lot of times they do a couple things which like one they they say it's going to be better with
(45:03) this person. I don't say any expectations because I'm like it's going to be different. Good job. Thank you for not doing that. I saw the the worst was like three years ago when a leader would like replace themselves. They be so much better with this. I was like, "You can't." And I knew. I said, "You can't say that because it's going to at first feel so different.
(45:21) They're not going to they're going to think, well, you said it was going to be better. It's day two. Why is it not better?" It's like, "Well, they're new. What do you expect?" It's like, "Well, you said." And so, that's the first one is like just don't set any of those expectations. Just say it's going to be different. It's going to be a change.
(45:31) Here's what the change is going to look like. And I think the the second piece to it is explaining how it like the highly impacted individuals, how is it, what's going to happen and what's not going to happen, like what changes and what doesn't change.
(45:48) And I think that those are also really important to explain to people because a lot of people bring in someone like you and they're like, "Am I getting fired? Is this still happening? Like what's changed?" Like there's all sorts of things that can go through their brain. So I always just try to come up with like what are the things that what are the obstacles I anticipate ahead of time that I can just overcome before they even bring them to me.
(46:05) And I think that in itself paired with what you just said like if you do those two things like you address is there's the communication plan for how you're going to communicate to the organization and then there's a plan for when you bring the person in. I think that is how you set someone up for success so when they walk in people are excited for them to be there not scared or not annoyed or frustrated or worried. Yeah.
(46:30) Yeah. I'm just excited for ACQ 3.0. AC point that was your idea. Well, you coined it. Natural progression, right? It is the natural progression. I think that's that's really I think that's a lot of stuff that, you know, people are going to start seeing us moving towards and when we allude to the big moves we make that it comes with acquisition.com 3.0.
(46:50) Um, but we're just preparing. We're uh what do you call it? What do you writing the ships? What's that term? Digging the well. I don't know. Digging the well. Yeah. I mean I I see I see it like as a progression of like I would say acquis you know 1.0 was us helping ourselves directly. I would say 2.0 was us helping ourselves directly and helping everyone else indirectly.
(47:15) So it's like if you document all these things we show what we're doing that's going to help a lot of business owners indirectly. We're not the one actually like setting up you know like taking calls for them. We're like but hey here's how we do it and here's how we do our market. Here's how we do our sales.
(47:26) here's how we do these things in the business so we can help you grow and and hopefully you know hit your goals and I would say you know acquisition 3.0 you know, is how can we help ourselves directly and help you directly? And so I see that as kind of the the vectors, which is kind of the natural progression.
(47:39) But in order to do that, you know, from the first time we met until now, the the size of the quote indirect audience uh went from, you know, a few thousand to now, you know, tens of millions uh that have, you know, directly been in our network versus the people even in our interested uh demographic.
(47:58) And so, um, in order to do it and do it right and maintain our reputation, which is, you know, what we've worked such, you know, such a long time to do, we want to make sure, you know, I'll try not to be crude, but that it's awesome and it's being done right. And that if we can do that, then I think that we can, you know, get close um to the kind of impact that I think all three of us want to have because you said this earlier, but like it's hard for people to comprehend.
(48:23) It's like Tron really doesn't need to do anything and we really don't need to work at all. We can just like live off the dividends from the buildings and the businesses that we own and like just work out all day. Contemplated however many years ago when you were postal we were post like should we just do family offices like just just chill invest our well that was the original that's the original idea.
(48:41) I know that was the weird and then I was like but that idea was so like looking back so so small. Yeah. It was also very I mean nothing wrong with serving yourself. I mean, I want to be clear, like if you want to do that for anybody who's listening, by by all means do it. But I think that to have like when I see the the the best entrepreneurs of all time, it's like they're they're able to kind of like flip their selfish interest inside out so that it just kind of pulls the world. Um, and I think that that's I
(49:06) think it's something that all of us have wanted to do and it just takes more than one or two people to do it and do it right. I just think like at the end of the day, you know, when I think about what we're building here and like how it started and such, I think it's because, you know, at the end of gym launch, for example, like it we never we didn't, you know, we got partners and then we we were out, right? We never brought partners into the business to to keep growing the business in a way that didn't feel completely exhausting because at some point it's not this isn't about the work that you
(49:41) do in the business. It's about the decisions, the judgment, the leadership, the experience. And that's, you know, it's not like we're like, "Oh, Sean's going to come and just do so much work." Like, it's like, "I know you are cuz it's who you are." But it's like the judgment you bring, the decision-m, the expertise, like your thinking, your brain, right? And I think at some point, especially like when we sold gym launch, like I was definitely at a point where like it had just run off the two of us. And I do think that I was at a point
(50:07) where I was like I was okay for a minute like in that brief moment of like thinking smaller because I was like oh my god I'm so tired. Like I was just like I'm tired. Like I've been up since 4 a.m. going to bed at 8:00 p.m. and I'm a freaking grandma and like it would be nice to just have something a little more a little less demanding of me, right? And it's funny because I look back and I'm like it was just a skill deficiency which is like I didn't have the skill of doing a couple things which is like building a team that allowed for me not to feel that way every day and
(50:32) building a team where I actually the like being tired at the end of the day was worth it because I had so much fun working with them as well as then okay maybe you shouldn't be the one making decisions all day.
(50:47) Like if I'm making 35 decisions a day is that really a good thing to be doing at that point and I knew it wasn't. Well, I think that goes to uh Alex's point of being having the the undertalented, right? Uh and the the crazy part is how many times have we all experienced this where we didn't mean to be a part of you. You hired one person and that person did so good. You're like, man, everything is so much better because Michael's here.
(51:12) Like that happened, right? And when that happens, imagine that over and over and over and over again. And that's when you get to do so many powerful things. It's permanent. I got its which then you have an organization of I got it. I got it. I got it. I got it. And then all of a sudden you create the space to then say, well, I still got some stuff.
(51:30) Like I can still go get stuff, but then all those I got it lets you go get. Um, and I think that's what allows you to build the future because so many entrepreneurs like have this it's their dream is really just a dream and never meets reality because they never have the opportunity to pursue it because they're still stuck um undertalented in the business because they're constantly feeling like they have to play whack-a-ole because they don't fully complete the cycle.
(51:53) Like they get a threequarter solution, but you still kind of like leave parts of yourself behind because you know that someone hasn't fully got it. I think it's probably my what I feel most proud of this team is just like we just have such great individuals, you know, it's like everyone's so strong and I think I used to be able to count on one hand how many strong people I had in an organization and now it's like I would have to count on one hand how many weren't and I wouldn't have any to put on my hand right now. You know what I mean? Which is like I remember dreaming of that. And
(52:20) so I think at that point then you're just like when we talk about the barrels um you know I think to a degree it's like when you have the skills to build something amazing and excellent you just realize at some point you just you just need to hook with other barrels so that you guys can help you know it's what I talked about a lot which is like you want a vision so big for something that you build that everyone's vision can sit inside of it.
(52:46) I think right now we see the vision for acquisition.com 3.0 know specifically and we all see how our visions for ourselves, our dreams fit inside of that vision and that's that's when the magic happens. And I think it's and I I'll say this with jumping on the the piggybacking on the on the talent piece which is that I think that whether you like it or not like I I mean I talk to business owners that every day and they're like I want to help a million people lose weight and I'm like well you have one brickandmortar store that has
(53:10) 100 customers like the gap between their I think it's not even it's not even a realistic dream. It's something that they say that other people say that's amazing. And so that's why they keep saying it more so than they actually want to do it because if they actually wanted to do it, they would behave differently.
(53:27) And so they have like their thing they say and then what they actually believe is possible. And I think that when you bring when you get these other barrels in and you get more high quality talent, your scope, your realm of believability expands. And so it's great to say hey we want to do this thing but like you know on some level like what is reasonable or what is feasible with our existing capacity and so we still on some level still extrapolate forward or project forward based on what we already have. And so when you bring those other people in all of a sudden like your ability to see further you're like oh I I would never
(53:57) even considered that. But now that we have John or we have so and so, like, oh, they can they we could actually connect these dots in a way that I never would have originally imagined because I would have thought I can't do that and I don't know anyone else who can.
(54:15) But then when you meet that person, you're like, oh my god, all these other huge chunky things now enter the realm of possibility and that creates all these new connections that then expands the realistic vision rather than the someday that'll never happen vision. It's totally fair. Um yeah, the um the one the one quote that Alex uh actually probably would say it better than me is this really hit me hard and I was I I'm born a very driven person and in my 20s I I really believed that it was about the destination.
(54:45) In my 30s, I realized that it was about the journey. And then finally in my older 40s, I have finally realized that it's about the company. And it is the people that that you're with, the people that you build with, the people that you grow with, the people that you can see more and farther with.
(55:05) It's doing it with great people is what makes you have the ability to outwork everyone else. Because if you think about the destination all the time, you're like, man, I got that's what the grind is. I feel like I'm grinding and I feel tired and resentful. That's what happens because you don't have the company or then you go through this period of growth and everything is painful and you're like at some point you're like I don't need to do this anymore, right? And then but when you have great company you're like well wait a minute if I don't know how to do this I can ask for help. Can someone else do it? I got it.
(55:34) And then you realize that the the growing and the joyfulness becomes so much more multiplied. I the reason someone asked me this the other day. I said the reason why I finally believe that it's about the company is because of this one thing. It allows me to work harder because there is no working smarter.
(55:52) It's like you realize you have the company so you can work harder and that's what's super super powerful. I feel that so hard. Well, the vision also expands because the timeline you think on it also expands because if you're miserable then you want the misery to end on some level.
(56:09) And so you're like, well, I can only really think this far out because I don't want to do this for longer than this amount of period of time. So then it creates this rush and this pressure to get it all done as fast as possible, which is very like pushing energy. Like you're like, I have to just keep driving even though I don't want to. On the flip side, if you're like, I'm enjoying the company on this process, it's like, well, in 20 years, we can build whatever we want.
(56:28) And so then it it just it creates a lot more fun. And you can dream bigger if you have enough iotits. And with those I got it, you enjoy those people. Then it's like, well, what do we want to do? Like, let's like let's it up. Like, let's have let's have fun. I think that's why I've like had zero feeling of rush with acquisition.com.
(56:45) It's just like it's like if there's one thing, it's like do what you love with people you love. And it's like find people that like you would want to be around even if they didn't work in your company. It's a big one. And like that has just been such a huge frame shift. You know what I mean? Um, I do want to ask you something though.
(57:03) I bet you people are wondering, especially like people who follow you, how's your content going to change? So, so far the content has always been a very niche category king type content. And the crazy part is we've had a chance to build, you know, a 1.5 million TAM audience and build a billion dollar business from it.
(57:26) And Alex, you talk about this, right? You go niche, you can actually create a lot of revenue from it. But I remember being at brunch with uh both of you and with my son Neil and the idea of making content about what you're working on. That is the thing that I'm truly excited about. I read this quote uh which was like to write the book you have to first live the book. And which is that Oh no, I don't think this is mine. No, I don't think I don't think that's mine.
(57:48) No, I don't think that's like the days of this like the days of Jim Ran when you don't know. You just you just kind of give Alex the credit for it. But if you have to write the book, you have to live the book. And and uh what I'm really excited about is starting to just look at my calendar and just talk about what we are talking about.
(58:06) Like what you and I have are planning on launching is talking about what we are doing dayto-day. And I think that is the thing that people are missing. They don't see that. They see the a lot of the how-to stuff, which is cool, but they don't see the what did you do to help your business grow. So, I'm looking forward to living the book and writing the book simultaneously.
(58:24) Heck yeah. I'm excited, too. And I think also just like for everyone that follows you, like, you know, it has been like niche niche content, but like if you just take the word real estate out of any piece of your content, like so many people come to our events and they're like, "Oh, I follow Shiron." I'm like, "Are you in real estate?" They're like, "Well, no, but he's got good.
(58:41) " And I'm like, "You're smart." Because that's what happened with Alex is like in the early days of gym launch, I had I had a a lawyer stopped me and he's like, "Hey, I listen to your podcast." I was like, "The gym secrets podcast?" And they were like, "Yeah, it all applies." And I was like, "Well, yeah, but I say gym and membership rather than contract and services.
(58:59) " And they're like, "Yeah, you just swap the words like duh." And I was like, "Huh, well, that's great." But but I mean Tron like I'll just one of the things that also made Tron unique for this situation was that he also had he understood content.
(59:20) He understood personal brand which is how do you take like when you talk talk about unicorns it's like okay you find somebody who's you know the Michael Jordan at real estate which is a massive you know market but then also has the op side of running the businesses that capitalize on those opportunity which is pure private equity you know like how do we you know increase enterprise value within the business and the ops itself of the people the hiring the recruiting the marketing sales all of those components but then there's also the like oh yeah and one of those companies was also a public company and so then there's the public securities public market which also he happened to have this experience at Goldman Sachs for years before that. So he has kind of
(59:50) like the bottom up approach of like what it's like on the floor of the of of kind of like the businesses that deal with the markets and then also being the target of of those those products and services that are sold. So it's like this 360 view from a business perspective.
(1:00:08) But then in terms of okay that's all amazing but maybe if Shiron were 80 he wouldn't be able to come into this you know our current context and understand the the dynamic nature of how business is continually you know changing and evolving especially with where attention is going and how how to just how acquisition works in general right now.
(1:00:26) And so, you know, Real was built largely or at least in recent, you know, on the back of a lot of Chiron's speak engagements and his personal brand that brought in a lot of people uh to the company, right? And so being able to marry all of these ideas and then appropriately value each of them so that we could mix those things into the most valuable thing for an entire audience or, you know, consumer base.
(1:00:50) Um is just it's like how do you recreate that? It's like, oh, I just need another person who had, you know, who's an immigrant who isn't afraid to work, came here, uh, you know, was dumpster diving in the beginning and then also was able to go to one of the, you know, best schools in the US and then go to the the best bank or what is considered the best, you know, investment bank uh, in the world and then also do the the private growth two times to a billion dollar level and do it uh, publicly.
(1:01:18) It's just like and also have the the personal brand and also be someone that we like really get along with and share the values. It's like yeah, let's just wait for the next Chiron before we before we try and bring somebody in to to do what we want to do. And so um it's like you don't find another Chiron and um if you do get the opportunity to find another Chiron, call me and don't don't bring them.
(1:01:36) Um but no, we're we're just I we're we're super pumped. So excited. Yeah. like just genuinely uh I think you know not going too much into my own but like it's just been so fun even though it's I know it's hard and there's a lot of it's still been fun. I remember it was like your fourth day.
(1:02:02) Um one of the members of our facilities teams messaged me and he was like I just want to say you seem lighter like you just seem like you're smiling more and you just seem brighter. Like is this because Chiron's here now? And I was like oh my gosh I think it is. I was like, I'm just excited. It's fun. That's awesome. That makes me happy. Yeah. I'm excited to build Acquisition.com 3.0. 3.0. 3.0.
