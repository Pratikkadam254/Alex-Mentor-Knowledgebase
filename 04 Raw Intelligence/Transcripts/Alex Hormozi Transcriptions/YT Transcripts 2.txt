Transcript:
(00:00) everybody's watching this video i'm about to make you a ton of money in a few minutes i'm gonna walk down exactly how you can price stuff to get more people to buy really expensive things that you sell and if you don't sell something really expensive you're gonna want to by the end of this video right now if you can write down on a piece of paper what the average price of the thing that you sell is let's say it's a hundred bucks what i want you to do is i want you to put 10x i want you to put 50x i would put 100x next to it now once
(00:23) you write the price of what that would be if your main thing's 100 bucks 10x is a thousand 50x is 5 000. 100x is 10 000. it doesn't matter what business you have if you want to make lots of money sell more expensive stuff there's no strategic benefit to being the second cheapest person in the marketplace but there is for being the most expensive there's only one strategic benefit to being the lowest cost person in the marketplace which means that you went in with that strategy and you built an entire business around operational
(00:46) efficiency automation and you built the whole strategy of the business on being able to provide the same thing for less if you did not do that and are simply trying to do the same business as other people and compete on price you will lose you will have no profit left over and you will get price to the point of breakeven and you will just run a non-profit thank you that's probably not why you got into business no matter what you sell you should have something that's 10 50 100 times more expensive than thing you're currently selling when
(01:09) i bought my first nice suit for myself a friend of mine was like fashionable and he like took me to the store or whatever i put a suit on i remember checking the price tag and it was thirteen thousand dollars homie didn't have thirteen thousand dollars and i was like [ __ ] and then what they did is after i took that off they put me in a suit that was like twenty nine hundred bucks or twenty 2 500 and i was like okay i can get with this right i didn't realize it then but they had completely price anchored me
(01:31) and that was 100 the strategy was get put you in the most expensive suit and then you're like geez but the thing is is that some guys will look at that and the right guy will be like done i'm in price anchors have two benefits and this isn't the only point of the video this is the first point for everybody who isn't going to buy the really expensive 10x 50x 100x thing you anchor the rest of your pricing against that first price so you're showing them this thing kind of like ripping off the band-aids like stretching the length through which they
(01:54) see your pricing if i say a thousand dollars first and then i say a hundred thousand dollars it's like [ __ ] that's huge but if i say a thousand dollars first and then i say a hundred dollars or ten dollars that sounds like less if you have a pricing menu for a membership for example of any kind you want to have the most expensive one first not the least expensive one and then everything else will look cheaper by comparison if you do it with wine you can do with software you can do with memberships it works in every
(02:20) situation because it works on psychology now let's talk about the other side of the equation all right so we've got the anchor and then we've got other options of pricing so how do we organize the other two options good question i like to use the small medium large example to kind of like break this down so you can use this as small medium large popcorn small medium large cokes whatever but let's say you've got 10 bucks five bucks and you've got this middle price where you put this middle price will indicate
(02:40) which product gets sold the most of a certain percentage people always buy the cheapest thing because that's who they are and that's fine the next people are influenced by the pricing in general so if i have a five dollar thing and a ten dollar thing i can make this medium six bucks so i make my medium a dollar more than my small and it seems like a great price but the thing is to ever forget is that we make up all the prices all of these are made up so we got 510 and we got six or 650 or 6.99 and we're gonna
(03:04) get a lot of people are gonna buy this one now if i bump this to here nine dollars and i make this 10 what are people going to do a lot of people are gonna buy this one because by comparison it's like wait just for a dollar more i get twice of the small well that sounds like a great deal and so fundamentally people want to buy great deals they don't want to buy cheap stuff think about the difference there price is what you pay value is what you get the deal is the discrepancy between the two for example and this is a big
(03:27) one this is a i want to break this belief for you if right now you sell expensive stuff five thousand dollar things or ten thousand dollar things if i were giving you a ferrari brand new and i said it's ten grand and i'm walking up to people on the street and they believe that i was actually going to give them the ferrari how hard do you think it would be for them to come up with 10 grand what would they do they would call their friends they'd call their family they would take out of their credit cards they'd take a loan
(03:51) why because they know it's worth more than 10 grand whenever you are selling something expensive the reason someone is not buying it is simply because they do not understand the value because if they understand the value and they believe that you're giving them a ferrari they will find a way to get the money i want to banish this whole concept of like they can't afford it everyone can afford it if they believe the value is there and so the idea is not that we're giving cheap stuff away we want the value relative to the price
(04:16) to be a huge bargain when you're coming up with the stuff that you're going to sell the first thing that i want everybody to do 10x 50x100x pick one and then figure out what you would have to fulfill to make it worth that they are getting a ferrari for 10 grand and that's how you get people to say yes over and over again and the other thing is is that it'll start to teach you that people are willing to spend more when they see the value the other benefit of having this huge price anchor is that whales will buy it so a certain
(04:39) percentage of population just like i said certain percentage population always buys the cheap thing because that's who they are there's another percentage of the population that always buys the most expensive thing because that's who they are it doesn't hurt you at all to have something that's super expensive on your menu put it there with the expectation that you're never gonna sell and be surprised when you do if you didn't get a gasp from the price you didn't go high enough you want that gas because that gap shows that you've
(04:59) broken the rubber band of pricing that they associated with what they expected your product or service to be priced at and so if you're like oh it's 100 grand they're like whoa i was not expecting that you're like oh no worries and then you can explain why it's worth it but then it's like you know what i think we can do 80 of that for 10 because that's our our silver that make more sense for you yeah that would make a ton of sense for me now if silver's 10 bronze is 8 and gold is 100 you need to sell a lot of 10ks because now it seems like
(05:24) nothing it depends on the customer or segmentation but one of the big mistakes i see people do is that they'll have like 100 a month 110 a month and 120 a month you want to meet buying personas so you might have a hundred dollar a month you might have a 200 a month you might have a thousand dollar a month because the people and the needs between those customers are different so you want to price based on the value delivered to a specific avatar like if i'm selling something to coca-cola it's going to be more valuable to coca-cola
(05:47) than it is to a local brewery so you can price it accordingly if you are a cro expert conversion rate optimization and you can help an e-commerce store buy 10 if the store is making a million bucks a year 10 is 100 grand if the store is doing 100 million dollars a year 10 is 10 million you literally can provide more value to them because of who they are not because of who you are so 10x 50x100x think about what you provided for each of those levels put that at the top of your menu be the first thing that you explain to people expect 1 out of 20
(06:15) to say yes to it and for everybody else to feel much more comfortable taking the other options bye

Transcript:
(00:00) my audience asked me questions for 10 hours and here are the best moments let's say my only goal was just to get rich a what is Rich AF just so we Define it 100 million why not it's a good number cool you're willing to work hard but you have limited skills and experience what business would you start like right now 2023 and I have no money right I would probably build a boring business in services and I would probably pick something around the body you know if I wouldn't just start a design firm cuz I think that has a high
(00:29) likelihood of getting disrupted or you know in some way by AI if I were you know it's as silly as it sounds like a nail salon or a lawn care service things that I mean especially body ones uh dentist stuff like you still have to go in and get your teeth taken care of and many times people value the human exchange more than something robotic so for example in the fitness world like this is my like my data point around this uh there was a a brand called cocoa fit and um they struggled a ton and then eventually went out of business because
(01:02) they tried to automate personal training so they created these all-in-one machines that would you'd have a key fob and it would count your reps and every time you went to the machine it would say how to do more and what wa you did last time it's a really cool concept the problem was their theory was that the reason that people weren't getting results is that they didn't know it to do when the reality is that no one was showing for the gym people hire personal trainers because they want another human to talk to and to hold them accountable
(01:24) to showing up same reason like if you had a robot cutting hair there might be a percentage of the population that do it but a lot of women like the going into the hair salon and having that exchange and so I would probably build a business around services in general um would be my way and then I would continue to scale that and you could do that at a local chain level and you can make a lot of money doing that or you could do it at a national level which would be like Professional Services I love the idea behind the core stuff
(01:46) that's going to be here forever you know let's say hypothetically the great fires of Las Vegas burn everything to the ground okay you lost everything you had to start again what would you say is the number one thing that you would have done differently to get to where on now and I have no reputation right no no reputation yeah it burns my reputation on the ground with it so I actually have lost everything before uh and so I I know what I did and I probably would have done the same thing so the the the easiest way that I did to like go make a
(02:15) hundred grand in a month when I had nothing uh was that I would go find a business that was local that I understood and that I could sell something expensive for I would front the capital to Market I would work the leads and I would sit at the front desk and sell and I would negotiate what they would be willing to do a big bulk of services at scale for so for example if I wanted to find a chiropractor and I'd say hey I if I sent you 100 customers this month what's the lowest rate you would do all 100 customers for this
(02:44) level of service and then I would just negotiate that down and then I would spend as much as I could and sell it for as much as I can so I can make the spread and then they would service the customers and for them it's a zero risk offer cuz they don't have to do anything I front everything else and then for me I don't have to do anything but Market and sell and I can take all of that and so like when I lost everything I immediately was able to make 100 Grand the next month by doing that playbook in your opinion what are the three most
(03:10) powerful skills that someone should develop if they want to make a lot of money I mean the Three core skills are you got to learn how to build you got to learn how to sell and you got to learn how to lead just like that there we go like in in terms of maybe like hard skills that someone should really focus on learning to develop that like sales copyrighting leadership what would you say the most important well those are the three big buckets right so it's like one is that like leadership is just the internal bucket of getting people to do
(03:34) what you want them to do at scale right and then from a selling perspective I include that in all things that are marketing letting people know about your stuff promotion uh and actually converting people into customers and then the third piece of Building Product and services is so that at scale If the product is good enough then you won't lose customers and if it's exceptional the product itself will get you more customers and so most businesses takeen to their natural extreme on a promotion level typically are leaky buckets
(04:02) because the product actually sucks and most businesses suck in general because most products aren't good and most people want to cancel very quickly and don't want to continue to use them which is why very very good companies are very rare uh most of them generally are mediocre or not good and so I prefer to solve a business from Back to Front which is like can we find something that people actually like and want to continue to use and continue to pay for and then the marketing is almost a commoditized skill like it's very easy
(04:29) to let other people know about your stuff and do so louder and louder and louder provided the product is good and then the internal has to get run with a leader that can attract the talent to continue to do this because quickly the the business will bottleneck based on the founder and their expertise or usually they have a niche they might be product people they might be tech people they might be Finance people they might be whatever um and then they have to be of the character to attract the talent that will allow them to get to you know
(04:58) nine figures or whatever it is that their the goal is you mentioned on a recent podcast with Tom Bilu uh that you don't have rules so yeah I for example you know I quite often end up working up until midnight 2 am. 3: a.m. and basically [ __ ] up my sleep schedule because I have too much Freedom right because I'm self-employed so how do you kind of strike that balance between freedom and discipline you know if you're driven and you want to accomplish big things it's it's it's kind of 020 like if you know that when you stay up
(05:26) late like there are times when I will gas it and go past my red line in terms of work and I know that I'm eating into tomorrow but if I'm like in a flow and I'm crushing it and the Muse shows up and the Muse wants to work then I work you know what I mean but if there's some days on the flip side where I wake up and I just feel foggy as [ __ ] and I just like for whatever reason I ate too much Mexican last night and my you know I I just I don't have it that day then I I might call it earlier like the idea of
(05:51) me pushing through and punishing when it comes to the type of work I do if I were doing a more uh Brute Force work then I would care less you know what I mean if it was was just like if I was just doing reach outs I was doing cold calls I was training personal training sessions I was cutting hair I'm just I'm just going to brute force my way through it because I don't need to have higher brain function and that's not an insult I'm just saying like you're not like thinking of creative things you know what I mean you're just you're working
(06:14) the work um but when it comes to like writing or or making presentations or communication of some sort it's more I try and optimize around how can I maximize over a week how much Flow State I can be in so I can just get the most total quality output so it's not about rules it's more like which of these things has the highest likelihood of getting me the most what's up Kristoff in one podcast you said that your most feared decision in life was to quit your job when you were 22 or 23 my question is what advice would you give to your
(06:45) younger self if you could in that exact situation when you have nothing to lose it also makes it the best time to make highis decisions because you have a disproportionate upside not quitting if you want to do something else like if you have this desire to do something else is like not taking a stranger up on a free lottery ticket on the street if they give you a free lottery ticket and you lose you're back to not having anything if you win then your life changes forever and so I think a lot of people place a disproportionate amount
(07:18) of weight on the opinions of other people who are going to judge them in the short term because quitting your job is short-term pain for long-term fulfillment if that's what if that's what you want to pursue because the short-term pain comes from the Judgment of others and likely a back you know back step in income but long term you're working on the thing that you want to be working on now if you like your job and you know what I mean then that probably doesn't apply to those people but like if you're in that situation it's really
(07:41) a long-term short-term sacrifice which a lot of people aren't able to make the second question let's think that my audience uh don't know anything about Laya except that she's your partner okay but I think she's she has exceptional knowledge and she she's a really good personality if you could only tell one story about her that makes a complete picture about her what would it what would it be so Lea had quit her job to join me to start gym launch this is when we were doing turnarounds so we're flying around the country so she quit
(08:09) her job after knowing me for only a month and then started basically living with me in motel rooms she had built up a book of business so she was actually giving up something that she had spent 2 years building to pursue this thing with me and we were new like we had just started dating about 6 months into that I told her that I needed a break and the she actually asked me she was like it sounds like like you don't really want me to be here do you want me to leave and I was like yes that would be great I had just lost all the money from the
(08:35) partner I had this location that I had to either shut shut down and had no cash to do it and I had to service all these contracts I didn't have the money to service and I also had like three other businesses that I was trying to run at the same time I had a caropractor agency I had my gyms I had Jim launch the turnaround business I had a dental agency all of those with different partners and I was the one who did Marketing sales for all of it and so I was just so spread thin and so she I needed to generate money uh to basically
(09:02) pay the bills of the gym that I couldn't pay that the money had just gone out the door for right after me saying I don't think we should be together she had to leave like the next day to go to Hawaii to launch a gym for this guy that she's no longer dating that she quit everything to leave tough situation that nine out of 10 not even n 99 out of 100 girls would have just said no they would have been like I'm just going to go back home and you know try and get all my clients back but she didn't do that so she flew out to Hawaii I didn't have
(09:27) enough money to give her like a nice place and so um I had her split an Airbnb with Five Guys Five dudes and Lila not ideal and so she worked out of the Airbnb and well realistic she worked out of the gym most of the time and did the biggest launch that we'd ever done and so like when my world was CR crumbling around me and I really needed her to come through she stood tall and she did it in a time that I probably didn't deserve that level of loyalty cuz I hadn't shown her any and so she did that and then I made enough
(09:56) money from her launching that gym that I could pay off all the bills the gym that I was going under that I just lost all the money on uh to basically come out breaking even um so that we could actually go back all in on gym launch and get rid of the other companies W man I think I haven't heard this story before what what went through through your mind I I can't really believe this and understand it well when she did that I wanted to be with her she had extended me loyalty that I had not given her there was probably a few defining
(10:26) moments in our relationship that was the first big one thank you very much for sharing this the next one is kind of basic question but I'm really curious about the answer what was your biggest takeaway of writing 100 million offers and also 100 million leads the offer is a strategic question that influences all aspects of the business and is also a mental exercise that people can feel like they're making progress on their offer a lot faster leads is a lot more about activity and implementation and so people can get ideas from like the lead
(10:54) magnet chapter but then you have to start reaching out to people posting content or running ads to start getting leads in the door right and so there's a little bit bigger of a hurdle with leads than there is offers but it's also the the main driver of business is letting people know about your stuff and so I think that many people will mentally masturbate to the idea of making these amazing offers but I think foral people make money by actually letting people know about their stuff which is leads what went through went through your mind
(11:21) when when you rewrote it for the 18th or 19th time so unless I can work once and have something provide value on an ongoing basis which is a High leverage activity um then it makes no sense so I think most people shouldn't write books because the amount of work it takes to make a great book that actually lasts itself T of time is extremely difficult I think I I uh read a blog post where they said uh how to write a blogbuster blog post and there was a chart where they said if you put in like 100 hours to write only one blog post there maybe
(11:51) will be a million views but if you put like 50 hours there maybe will be just 10,000 views it's exactly that there's diminishing marginal return but an increase an exponential increase in absolute returns you know the gold the gold medal Sprinter in the Olympics versus the silver medalist like from a business context the person who's at the gold medalist might have worked 10 times more right to get this much more out but what's the difference in absolute of gold versus silver everything just being this much better people are like well I
(12:23) don't want to work 50 more hours to be this much better but being this much better might make you the best at that whatever the blog post is or that business or that solution and the amount of winner takes all the economy has shifted towards people want the lowest risk solution and so if you have the best solution then it is the lowest risk thing to buy and so to be number one versus number two 80% of the economics sometimes 90% of the economics go to number one and so it makes absolute sense to work 10 times harder even
(12:53) though you might only be this much better from a marginal perspective on the chart of rankings that might make you 10 times higher some context we have like a book summary application where we give also exercises and tips to implement the book what's your average take on on books and uh I mean book summaries is it good did you use them before I don't read many book summaries uh mostly because you rely on the person who's doing the summarizing to find what they think is the most valuable thing for you right because a lot of times
(13:23) what I find if I read a book The the Nuggets that I find are not the main Concepts it's actually the details if you don't know anything about a topic then the summaries are great to give you a lattice work a framework to understand the rest of the information that you're going to consume but once you have a basic understanding it's in the edges which is where you can expand your knowledge right and so there's there's not a lot of shortcuts to getting really good at something now a bit of selfish question but I'm really curious about
(13:45) your thinking yeah yeah okay so you remember you had a video where you scaled a no strip business to 50 million in six minutes could you do this with a book summary up basically do a breakdown of a book sum so it's an application yeah it's a it's a subscription based application got it what's the price point uh $10 okay what's what's turn I think 15 to 20% monthly or yearly monthly monthly got it um so you have to fix that first at the end of the day everything's going to be caed to LTV so like if there was one single metric that
(14:15) I'm going to look at a business it's cact LTV ratio so how much it cost me to get somebody and how much do I make from them over the lifetime until that metric is better than the competition so like blinkist right I think that's a one that's like that I would have to look at their LTV what are the things that they're doing that like why am I why are going people going to come to me versus them right so either I have to be more niche in my selection of books so that I'll have a wider selection for a narrower audience like competing against
(14:41) Amazon is very tough but if you if you if you Niche down into a specific topic then you can actually have a wider selection because blink is is just going to take the the best sellers right for every every category because that's going to be the the most people and they're VC backed and they're funded and they can acquire customers at a loss for a long period of time acquire market share and unless that's the game you're trying to play then you have to play it different which is I want to I want to be really specific about the Avatar that
(15:03) I want to go after and so that's where you do a little bit of research ahead of time and say okay is there an underserved Market that might actually a have a big reading preference so like sales people is one of the most common professions on planet Earth from a personality perspective how many sales guys read all the time I don't know I would have to I would have to look into that and so you might be like okay well sales guys aren't the guy but maybe HR Specialists read a ton okay well if they read a ton and there's like blinkist
(15:26) might have one book on HR but I could put hundred different things that are related to that or one degree separated and then I can create the illusion of a wider selection of topics but around a narrower a narrower Avatar or concept right I would start there and then over time you can expand if you if you want to and just reach you know you go adjacent you go to finance or you go to whatever like this is me just spitballing again like I did the no strip thing from the the economics perspective you have to get LTV to the
(15:51) point where like your turn should be under 3% in order to make this really work once it's under 3% monthly yeah monthly I mean ideally you want to maintain 80% annually at least if you want this thing to be a big thing all of my attention would be only focused on that like until you fix that there's no point in acquiring customers cuz they're just going to fall out the back end like there's literally no point CU then you're also getting lots of people in that will then say that that thing sucks you know what I mean I'm not saying it
(16:18) sucks but I'm just saying like they're they're a friend of theirs is going to say hey I signed up for this thing they're going to be like oh I tried I didn't like it and then they're like oh okay maybe I won't I won't stick on it I want to be so quiet about what I'm building until all my metrics are right and then then I want to blow the the doors off but most people want to keep hitting these income goals rather than looking at the the metrics of the business that are actually going to drive the long-term goal cuz like anyone
(16:37) can Market their way to 100,000 or a million a month even with an app like this if you blow enough money enough people find out about you can do it but then you can only maintain it as long as you're spending that much money the moment you your your spend drops your income drops and that's not a business that I want to be a part of our uh USB is that we are doing we are we are in Hungary and we are doing it in Hungarian and there is no other application in Hung okay that's great if we scale to maybe Poland we would do it in Polish
(17:04) and not in English and that's a USP I like that and I mean then at that point I would just look at I I try to model as closely as I possibly can the number one player in the US from a ux perspective from the selection of titles all that kind of stuff and then I would and I would see if my metrics change if I do that if not then it's like there's some assumption that I'm basing this business off of that's not right in the Danny Miranda podcast I think you talked about skills versus meta skills could you expand these maybe uh a meta
(17:32) skill is a skill that helps you acquire more skills learning how to read is a meta skill like learn like learning how to learn is a meta skill at at the with the broadest brush stroke all the way chunked up learning to learn well quickly and retain information and be able to implement it is is a skill you give a 100 people a course right that's free the difference between the people who are going to be successful and not successful are the ones who already have sufficient meta skills to be able to then use the information and implement
(17:57) it like at at one polar extreme you've got got somebody who's completely incompetent right who like you have to teach them how to turn on a computer and On The Other Extreme I can say go build me a company and the person can do it so this person can translate a directive into each of the sub buckets and knows how to do that and so it's really like your success percentage basically is predetermined by how low you break down the skill requirements for someone to be successful so like the reason that I write the Books at the grade level that
(18:24) I do isn't so that people who are experts don't get value from it it's so that it makes it even easier for experts and it makes it attainable for people who don't know so I can get 70% of people who read the book to get leads versus 10% of people to get leads if I just cut out some of the steps and made assumptions about their skill level the last 10 or 20% the people who experts are still going to benefit from I'm just also going to include turn on your computer here's how you do that and from the software perspective with what
(18:53) you're doing that's also how you get a way larger percentage of your clients to activate typically we make assumptions because we as assume that every customer is just like us and so they have the same meta skills as us and they have the same interpretation or perception of the world and the ux and so that that assumption isn't true like all you have to do is and I'm sure you've done this like you look at people scrolling on your app and you see the heat maps and you're like why are they clicking that button because they have different
(19:15) skills and experiences that they're bringing to the table and so then we just continue to accommodate it break it down to the level that you could show it to a three-year-old and they would immediately know how to use it like the fact that babies learn how to use iPods is an indication of how how simple they have made it to humans to use and that's why they have such Mass adoption how would you teach someone how to learn we already know how to learn it's just that most people don't know how to teach everybody learns stuff all the time
(19:40) right if I if you touch a stove and it's hot and it's and it and it burns you you learn not to do it again like learning is is natural like we all learn but people who want to teach a specific behavior don't know how to do it and so it really just comes down to three things which is what do I reward what do I punish and what do I extinguish right so reward is give a carrot right after someone does something punishes you you know you zap them or you smack them after they do something or extinguishes you do nothing right so if your wife
(20:06) walks in and she got her her nails painted neon orange and you don't like it you might not want to punish her because that's probably going to have negative ramifications in the rest of your life but you might extinguish it so you might not say anything about the nails or you might say something different she's like do you like my nails I might say something back like I'm I'm happy that you got what you want what we're doing is what Behavior are we training and so if you think about learn teaching as training I think it's a much
(20:29) more useful word to think through because at the end of the day you have only taught someone if their behavior changes in the same context as in if I want you to say these words when the phone rings if I say cool we're going to put you through this training and then the phone rings and then you don't say the words you have not learned and I have not taught you and so it's how many times can I simulate this experience the stimulus the context so that I can have them do the behavior I want within the context that's going to trigger it and
(21:00) then reward them immediately and that's how you have a feedback loop that trains people to do something so that is why the streaks in the application and the gamification and those stuff how would you restructure the education system if you could oh yeah sorry for this question no you're good you're good I would focus almost exclusively on meta skills teaching people how to learn step one and then teaching people the things that are the next level underneath which is learning how to write learning how to read learning how to speak learning how
(21:27) to do math like those are the those are the building blocks of everything else that follows and in the school of the school of Alex or the school of Heros everyone passes only when you learn there are only 100% and you continue to do it until you learn I like the arbitrary division of grades along age is ridiculous to me and I think if there were a lot more clarity around the goal which is like until you can read 10 pages out loud without making a mistake you do not move on if you can do that in a day fantastic if you can if it takes
(21:57) you a year okay I don't judge you on that it's just how long will it take you to learn the skill so a good buddy of mine Dr cashy taught an autistic kid how to read he couldn't stay still reading uh for more than one word at a time and then he would like have fits or whatever and so he came to train the child on how to read with a bag of Skittles and so when the kid would read a word he would give them a Skittle when he would read more words in a row than he ever had like a record he would give him two Skittles so he rewarded the behavior and
(22:27) then he had big bonus rewards when when he would a unlock a new level and so he kept doing that and within one afternoon he had him reading a full page what is the behavior that I want to reward how can I reward more of it now none of it was punishing he didn't smack him when he messed up when he read less he still gave him one to reward him for the activity and then when he read more he gave him extra reward as the kid becomes less full on Skittles and he's like you know sugar he like doesn't want any Skittles anymore the Skittles become a
(22:51) proxy for approval and they work just the same how do you know that when to when to punish when to reward or when to extinguish we try very hard to almost exclusively reward because punishment changes Behavior faster reward changes Behavior Behavior longer it just takes longer to work right like if if someone you know calls me Alex and I don't like that and I slap them and I say never call me that again I might change their behavior really quickly if I leave the room and someone else says walks in they might say I was talking to Alex because
(23:24) I'm not there to punish them and so punishment only works as long as the the source of punishment is there and the person doesn't get accustomed to the punishment because punishment itself becomes desensitized over time and so to effectively punish someone if you want to consistently punish then you have to increase the intensity and variety of punishment over time because otherwise people get desensitized to it if you're always mean and yell at all of your employees eventually they stop carrying so you have to increase the level of
(23:48) your threats right you then have to say I'm going to fire you I'm going to kill you right you have to make these threats increase because you create the you increase the intensity and the variety of how you claim to punish them reward you can reward long enough that you can then extend the gaps between reward to eventually you don't need a reward anymore and people will continue to do the activity because they have always done it so it's the exact uh example with Dr cashi and the guy yeah I would imagine if he was doing this over and
(24:15) over again he proved the point and I don't he's not like a full-time reading teacher the concept is that he would read and then maybe the next time he comes in he gives a mosquito every other time he reads and the next time I be every third time and the next time I be only when he when he hits a new record if I can get the kid to read long enough that he actually starts to like the story then the story starts rewarding it of itself and then I can move away and then the kid reads without me and so fundamentally that's what you try to do
(24:41) when you train any activity is that most people who are experts at anything get rewarded from the activity itself because once you develop a level of Mastery in the skill you enjoy it because you're good at it so we hope I hope we will meet again and maybe speak longer thank you very much D I appreciate you Kristoff thank you so much thank you for inviting your community and Hope your community got value from the event um and hopefully they use the books and and grow the economy and hungry and uh and all get
(25:05) you know way way better at whatever it is they're doing you are incredibly committed to education and self-improvement how do you select what you will pursue for Education there's so many possible topics uh so what process do you go through to select uh what you're going to be educating yourself on and how do you also select potentially someone to educate you on on that topic we do everything off the theory of constraints at acis.
(25:32) com which is basically that a system will grow until it's constrainted until it's limit so it's kind of like the idea of the the weakest link right so it's it's finding what the weakest link in the chain is or the constraint of the system is so that we can DEC constraint it and then grow to the next natural constraint it's a very simplistic look but it's extremely effective because it just cuts down all the noise into like if I had to pick one thing that is the big limitation of this business what would it be and so then we
(25:52) just get laser laser focused on solving that one problem solve that problem and then we move on to the next constraint and if we solve that problem and the business doesn't grow well then we pick the wrong constraint and so sometimes the constraint is your ability to judge what the constraint is which is why you know wisdom is one of the hardest things to earn which comes from experience right is that you're able to you know recognize patterns um and so for me right now uh to answer the the other part of the question I'm focused on um
(26:15) learning about brand stuff right now so brand is my big topic that I've been diving really deep on brand and media and I'll probably write a book on brand just from the findings that I have because I don't think there's many good books on brand cuz you can I could read you 20 different different definitions of brand and branding and they all sound like cocky and so coming up with an operationalized version of what that means so that it can actually be useful and I I I try to learn the stuff so that I can use it and then whatever I learn I
(26:40) just you know pass it Forward because branding for me despite being now quote known for this or like an organic content guy I've only been doing this two years like this is brand new to me like I you know I have way more experience on the paid ad side that's what I did the last decade and I you know people got to see a tiny taste of that when I was launching the book but that's that's the big thing is finding out what the constraint of the business is and if you need to chunk all the way up it's if you want to grow a business
(27:03) you have to sell more clients or make them worth more or decrease risk those are the those are the things that are going to grow the value of a company and so just simply asking the question like why do we not have 10 times more customers or why are we not making 10 times more money and then figuring out what the answer to that question is often times is the constraint just because you're saying hey I'm I'm currently educating myself on on branding and that's fresh for you what would you say is like a major takeway
(27:29) in terms of education for the topic of branding that you're just like I wish I would have maybe known this when I started to try to learn about this two years ago this is like a Pandora's Box if I start talking about it it might be like 10 minutes so I I can I can rip on it but like Buckle in the audience so if we look at the origins of what a brand is right where do Brands come from Brand comes when you brand cattle right that was the original use of a brand and so why would you brand cattle because you want to change the behavior of people
(27:58) who look at the cattle so if you have a cattle that doesn't have a brand and the cattle that does the people who are looking at it will behave differently if the cat the cow doesn't have a brand I might take the cow for myself or I might kill it or I might eat it I might do whatever but if the cow has a brand on it and I know the guy I might return the cow to him right so it changes what I do all right that's an important point so the point of a brand is to change or elicit a desired behavior in the widest percentage of your target audience all
(28:23) right now how do you do that you do that by making associations between something they don't know your brand in the beginning with something that they do know that is positive and rewarding if that's what you want right and so the index it's a 4x4 uh box of what brand really is you have the uh the the direction so you've got away from and towards and then you've got strength so very high and very low so you know if you have a really weak thing that's away from it's like I kind of don't like this thing you know slow Wi-Fi you know like
(28:53) whatever like bad brand on the flip side you might have a political party which depending on the audience might be super strong and away from or towards now Taylor Swift for example would be someone that I would say has a very strong brand and towards there's not a lot of people who really hate Taylor Swift um and a lot of people who really love Taylor Swift right so it's positive and it's strong right somebody like Ray Romano if you heard that you know or like Tim Allen from the old sitcom days might be someone who is positive but
(29:20) weak a lot of people know who he is am I going to show up to his event probably not the idea is that in order to build a brand we simply pair things that people know with things that they don't know the things they don't know is our logo our tagline our company with things that they do know and think are positive if you were to think about the brand as a bouquet of flowers it's like having many flowers in a bouquet and so if I were to break the bouquet and spread all the flowers there is no bouquet but simply by gathering
(29:49) them together by making associations I create something new and that bundle of associations is the brand now if I were to break one of the flowers or make it rotten it would affect the appearance of the entire brand and so that's why if you make a single mistake a Dylan mulany move for Bud Light you can affect the entire brand if I get a DUI or somebody you know gets you know accused of doing some sort of terrible heinous act right it affects the entire brand R Kelly bad brand now right despite all the positive
(30:18) the one broken rose or the one rotten flower affects the entire bouquet we have to be very deliberate about what associations we want to make with our own brand so that we can continue to positively associate ourselves and the point of the brand is that we get a desired action or behavior from a specific audience the idea of growing the brand a lot of times is that you sacrifice some audience for other audiences so like when I was starting making content I did it in my closet right and there were some hardcore
(30:46) people in the OG mosy media days that are like I appreciate you that were like man I missed the closet videos right now I might have lost some of those people when we started making a little bit more polished videos Etc some people not all right I traded so I traded losing some audience to gain more when you making a brand move you're basically always making a bet that you will gain more of your desired audience than you lose by making a change and so you can approximate or slowly move a brand over time by making more associations in One
(31:17) Direction and fewer associations in the other and so that's how you can move a brand over time Bud Light made a wrong bet they thought and maybe this is just a corporate group think right that if they made an associate d m that they were going to get more people to buy their beer that was I mean fundamentally that's the only reason you would do it as a company right you believe that longterm you're get more people to buy your beer the problem was that wasn't true now the interesting thing is that there probably are people who were a big
(31:43) fan of that move it's just that there were more people who weren't they were far away right there were more people who were not a fan of that move and so that became an away from Association and so that is what I am trying to encapsulate and put together um into how to brand uh because now that I feel like I understand it a little bit I see it as in my opinion you know it's kind of like Neo in The Matrix when he's talking to Morpheus and he says so you telling me that I can dodge bullets Morpheus says well when you're ready you won't have to
(32:13) and so we learn all these tactics about sales and marketing and show up rates and cro hacks and all this [ __ ] but if you have a brand if you see the Matrix everyone shows up to your calls no one has price objections everyone is excited and ver their friends it just takes longer to make associations because fundamentally all branding is is teaching you were teaching someone to do something you want them to behave a certain way and you have this red red card and when you see red it means stop that's all we're doing so green lights
(32:45) have strong associ strong Brands they're positive everyone loves green lights right like it's a simple thing just no one owns it but green lights are a great positive Association it's a great brand right and so that's that's the idea of what I'm what I'm kind of diving more into and I see it as the ultimate sheat code for business it just takes a long time to do and most people aren't patient you're telling me I can dodge business problems I'm telling you that once you have a brand they become irrelevant you talk about deleting
(33:13) problems as your favorite way of solving them yes uh how do you decide what's deletable versus what's not because I can imagine the uh the person who really loves that strategy doing nothing and just deleting all problems so how do you prioritize a problem worth solving versus a problem that is deletable well it's just percentage likelihood of impact chunking all the way up to like will this cost me number of sales like sales velocity will this decrease the lifetime value of customers and will this increase or decrease the likel that
(33:45) that whatever I'm doing right now continues to occur so we're trying to value a company right we look at what's the sales velocity how many customers they sell what's the lifetime value of Customer because then you can extrapolate what their run rate is going to be at at scale at Max unless we change something and then you that by risk which is How likely is it that there's going to be an outside event that's going to change this thing from continuing to occur this box of making money How likely is that they will it
(34:08) will continue to grow or at least stay the same and so if I have a problem I have to be able to track it back to one of those three things and if it doesn't really track one of those three things or there's another problem that has a much higher likelihood impact in terms of it's higher likely and it has a greater effect size then I'm going to prioritize that it's just that often times if someone's like man I really think we should change the colors on the site I would just say like what's the likelihood like I have been notorious
(34:31) for having ugly as [ __ ] sites my entire career and you can make branding make associations and I think there's there's an argument there but what's the likelihood that it's going to affect how many companies do deal with us it hasn't up to this point and so is it a constraint of the business no is it something that I could improve absolutely there's also a hundred other things I could improve I could also send more emails which I don't do like there's lots of things I could do but what are the few things or the one thing
(34:55) that matters most which then ladds back up to what is the train of the business if I look at the highest pric competitor in my market and I one up them and then they one up me potentially like is there ever a point in which we just say like we're priced premium enough or do we always have to go for the top like how do you make the determination of Premium there's basically four positions in the market you have luxury all the way at the top which is technically a velin good which basic which means uh when I increase the price demand goes up and
(35:24) that's because there's an association with the price that makes it more valuable so the fact that everyone knows how expensive it is affects the value that I get that I get from it the fact that everyone knows the Rolex is 100 Grand the one that I'm wearing whatever then I actually it makes the Rolex more valuable so it becomes a virtuous cycle which is why lvmh is one of the most valuable companies in the world then you have premium which is basically the above average so it's there you have to pair utility with the premium in luxury
(35:52) the pre the the extra price tag is the value whereas with premium like BMW is premium they're not luxury they're a little bit better at a lot of stuff and so you pay a premium because it is a little bit they use a better materials it breaks less whatever right and so then you have your you know your mid your your run-of-the-mill your commoditized space which sucks and then you have your lowcost leaders which they make their entire business on how can I drive uh efficiencies and operations at all levels of the business so that I can
(36:21) be the lowest priced uh person in the marketplace right and still make a profit to to route to your question of like when is enough enough the key indicator for me and most of this like the the quote higher ticket world you're not luxury goods the fact that it's expensive is not the reason that people want to buy it right it's so it's actually technically a premium I'm more extreme about the price to Value discrepancy than anything else and a lot of people get into trouble because they raise the price so much that it is it's
(36:50) just an excess of the value they provide and so then they actually create a negative experience like if Chipotle were $50 people would probably not like Chipotle even though the product is really good but at $50 I don't know and so the reason your is so viral you know what I mean is like the price to value discrepency is so good that they tell their friends right and so that's where this kind of marriage of how can I just shortcircuit people's brains from value perspective which is what I what I try to do with the books and the courses so
(37:17) that it becomes viral on its own and then my cost du Aire customers is zero and so then everything after that is just gravy are the four variables when you're using this is you've got the price the value at the top which is what they get right the price is what they pay you've got your cost of goods to deliver and then you have your profit left over and so it's playing with those four variables so that you can maximize the the amount of absolute profit that the company makes pricing High has become shorthand and where I think
(37:51) people get a lot of benefit from the offers book is that when you price higher you automatically weed out shitty customers and I I think many times that is the real reason that a lot of people's businesses grow from that price now obviously there's more profit there's you have access things that you can that you can deliver on um but a lot of people don't actually take that excess money to create a better experience they do a gotcha and then they never get anything from that customer again and so that's the wrong
(38:16) way to use it but if I had to think like okay what are the reasons that you know a company might be successful that does charge premium is that they actually reinvest the the the premium price into a superior product and they are very clear about the Avatar that they go after and what the quantitative requirements are that are black and white that they know from looking at their best customers their top 20 top 5% of customers and then saying we're only going to cater to these customers in the future because the likely that we can give them a great
(38:43) outcome is higher and then that can create you know you can Merit or earn the premium that you have because you have data that supports that if you are this type of person we can get you this type of result what does the ideal experience with an accounting firm look like to you and I asked because one of the things that stuck with me um is you said you've never done your own books like you've always considered that something that was delegatable important to delegate you've also referenced bringing I believe accountants in-house
(39:11) kind of going back and forth between Outsource and inous so what does that ideal relationship look like to you now and maybe what did that ideal relationship look like when you were going through your first you know seven figure and eight figure company a lot of Professional Services should look at Wi-Fi for inspiration you're like what does that even mean you don't you don't want to like clap when the Wi-Fi is working you just notice when it doesn't and so you just want it to be in the background you just want it
(39:37) to work right so a lot of companies are like that like there's a lot of services that people think they need to like over you know communicate stuff on like I just want the financials to be accurate and I want them to be timely that's it and I want things broken down in a way that allows me to make business decisions and that's where like I think the the the top tier of accountants transform into fractional CFO and CFO kind of materials where they actually help you use this data to make informed decisions about the business is there a
(40:05) way that I can translate what we do into how it would affect a business owner's life so I'll tell you a little story because I think this might be really re this will be really relevant for you guys so one of our portfolio companies um has had a ton of growth three years they went from one location to I think we're at 38 locations now right all self-funded off cash flow all right so really really tremendous growth uh in 3 years and and it's compounding so it's growing faster and faster and when we were at about 30 locations we were stuck
(40:34) at 30 locations for like two quarters and so I got on the phone with the CEO and he was like dude I just I just feel like I don't know how many locations I can open based on cash flow and cuz they had net receivables were a little bit extended things like that right I I like shook the screen for a second it was Zoom call um I was like I need you to freeze frame this feeling you have right now I was like okay I was like think about this feeling you have I was like what you are feeling is finance as the constraint of your business you do not
(41:02) have a finance function that is operationalized enough like you do not like you are underdeveloped in the finance function you have a bookkeeper who's not that good as soon as he like I could see it just clicked I was like that is the constraint of the business until we get the finance function in you're going to just be operating blind and then once you know we have this much cash flow we can open two locations a month or three locations a month then you can be more aggressive with everything else because you're confident
(41:24) that you're not bankrupting the company accidentally on your own if I were an accounting firm I would try and pinpoint the problems and relate them to how it's going to affect growth in the business like how it is the constraint so that you can talk in the language that a business owner is going to understand like they just how many I'll bet you like if I could see everyone's hands how many people in your audience all the business owner does is go to the right go to the bottom and say so we made more money this
(41:51) month great and so I think adding that level of strategy of like by the way I think this is a little fat compared to other companies that we're looking at this is a little bit under compared to other companies we're looking at and this might be an area of opportunity little things like that that actually add value to the business if I were somebody who is in charge of account I'd like to get this answer in less than 60 seconds because I have I know we got to go and I want to be respectful of your time this has been
(42:17) incredibly informative how much of a skill should you develop or how much should you educate yourself before hiring for it so for example like do I need to be a Salesman manager before hiring for Sales Management what you what you hit at is one of the hardest parts of business you need to make an informed decision without context which is why being an entrepreneur you end up becoming a jack of all trades so that you can have enough context to make at least an informed decision and so I'm going to steal a playbook out of oops
(42:47) wrong shoulder there we go out of lela's book here and I'll give you my tactic around this which is you want to interview for people who are sales managers and you don't want to hire anyone for a little bit which sounds tough but what you want to do is you basically want to interview for information now if you meet a a a gold star that's amazing but you want to talk to people and if you know more about it than they do they should be teaching you and once you talk to 10 20 people they're basically like expert interviews for
(43:14) what it should look like and so then you get a very good idea of what the role should look like after listening to people and you'll get an understanding of the level of nuance and I'll give you this one little tidbit that is super powerful when it comes to judging skill the quality and quantity of data that someone chooses to collect around their particular department is almost directly proportional to their skill and so for example I have lots of marketers who are like I'm an amaz my product's amazing and I say cool tell me your metrics are
(43:44) I like what's time to Value right what are the key activation points like what's churn right like just some of these metrics and they're like well dude our refund rate's really low right but I'm like okay I was like well what about the marketing side they're like well cpms are this this is our clickthrough rate this is our you know this is our conversion on the page this is our percentage the schedule this is our percentage the show this is a percentage open rate this is percentage C like they go through all this stuff and I'm like
(44:05) right so I can see very clearly that you're a better marketer than you are at product and so simply getting an idea of the quality and quantity of the data that someone collects around their department will get like when we hired our director of people it was the first time that I had someone actually tell me metrics I'd never heard of and I was like she's the lady she's the G my community loves you and so we are here and I literally got like 150 questions I had to narrow it down to five or six it was so hard you mentioned something in
(44:36) the100 million offer that to hit your first 100K you don't need a lot you just need an offer to sell and that's exactly what we did uh but right now we are hitting a bottleneck and our biggest bottleneck is operations and you know I want to know how exactly you got out of gym launch operation because we have a very similar business model for you know service providers for what service providers mostly agencies and digital Consultants with lead generation and sales the way we do it is with a one-on-one Consulting and in a group
(45:04) coaching format so coaching models in general tend to be very difficult to scale because the recent people come to you is for expertise in order to get other people to provide that expertise then you have to create lots of experts who then eventually walk off and start the business on your behalf and take your customers with them I would say like there's a couple different approaches so the first is that there's the law firm and the McKenzie kind of Consulting model there's a a track to become a partner in the business and
(45:29) then that's kind of the whole business structure so there's a way a way to share in the profits they do make lots of money but the owners of those end up having to delute themselves out not that there's anything wrong with that you can make lots of money doing it but that is that is a a version of the model the other way is to productize the basically get narrower on the solution that you're providing and productize it to the greatest degree possible so that anyone could do it even if they have no knowledge of it in terms of like the
(45:52) implementation of the thing that is more the direction that we went uh with gym launch cuz we had a very specific we don't even we didn't even work with all gyms just to show how narrow we were with it we worked with only micro gym owners we have now expanded to health clubs as well the five or six years that I was doing it before we sold we were only micro gims and so just to show like how incredibly narrow that was someone had to have at least 30 members assigned lease one employee and be running this type of model for them to be a customer
(46:19) and then if they fit all those things we could generate a lot of Revenue using our playbooks I could have somebody who had no gym industry no expertise whatsoever and still said say send this email say these words here's 10 recordings of people doing this exact same thing this is the expected value and so that's like from the delivery perspective now operating the business overall comes from talent and being able to find people who are just as smarter smarter than you and people say that but like when you actually meet somebody
(46:44) who's smarter than you and then they admire an aspect of what you've done so that they start to work for you that's where you really start to have the magic happen What are some of the things that agency owners should avoid doing if they every want to scale any your experience okay so what things should an agency owner avoid when they're trying to scale yep yep I mean the same things that any business owner would want to avoid when they're scaling agencies tend to fall into the you know they they tend to fall
(47:09) into the bucket of trying to be everything to everyone so maintaining the discipline to be very focused about the problem that you're solving and who you're solving it for and I think that solves 90% of the problems from a strategic perspective for any small business owner including an agency the second piece is that if you're in a service based business the quality of your talent is going to be directly proportional to your growth because you're you're basically selling people fractionalized people that's what
(47:33) service businesses are right you're selling some level of training that you're able to give and having more efficiency than an individual business owner would have like the the classic you know small business owner leaden agency that charges $2,000 a month the idea is that if they were to hire somebody full-time to run these ads it would cost them5 or $6,000 a month but you have copywriters designers and media buyers and page designers who all work a fraction of their time for this one business and they can get it more
(48:00) efficiently and you can still do it at good margins right like that's fundamentally what service businesses are and so the quality of that talent and the culture that you have at the business to attract and keep that Talent um are the kind of the key or The crucial pieces of the success of the model you mentioned something in the book where you mentioned the agency model where you hire an agency to learn the stuff and you internalize it and then when you have stopped learning you replace an agency but me ing agency
(48:27) models agency businesses how to become irreplaceable in your perspective how should one go there should we start with one business then upsell the next and upsell the next and upsell the next offer creating the irresistible offer isn't necessarily about having a zillion products it's more about explaining and communicating the many small things that you have to do anyways and so rather than saying like I'm going to generate leads for you that's like one outcome but there's many things that have to happen along the way you have to create
(48:52) landing pages you have to write copy you have to you have to have followup sequences you have to work the leads you have to have scheduling you have to you know you have to split test you have to make new creative like there's lots of things that have to happen in order to just get the single result and it's just making sure that we're delineating those things because an unbeknownst or an ignorant uh business owner I say ignorant in the technical sense like they just don't know um would have no idea what you're doing you're like yeah
(49:12) just go get me leads it's like well it's much easier said than done and if I was doing it from an outbound perspective might be like well I have to warm up domains I have to you know spin up different accounts I have to split test different email openers I have to like you have to explain all the steps and they're like wow there's a lot more work that goes into this now I can I can appropriately value this price tag that you ascribe to whatever the service is so that's piece one in order to be Irreplaceable often times you'd have to
(49:33) go after significantly bigger customers if you're an agency for Fortune 1,000 for Fortune 500 companies it would be so costly for them to spin up at scale the level of talent that's required to do like programmatic media buys across 100 different Platforms in different countries and then the likelihood that they want to leave or do this on their own is significantly lower the idea that any service provider is going to become truly replaceable like any business can do anything on their own and I would prefer to put myself out of business and
(50:01) do it in a way that aligns my customers with me than have a model that I know is is basically has a timer for obsolescence not everybody works with Fortune 500 companies right sometimes many people uh they might work with you know small and medium businesses they help them let's say you become a marketing agency for chiropractors in New York you become so good at that in general people won't leave you because you're just good at that particular service and the thing is the small business owners are really tough because
(50:28) they're the problem like they're super erratic they're super volatile their cash flow is Lumpy they don't know where their next paycheck is going to come from and to no fault of your own they can cancel because they just can't make payroll that month look at the biggest agencies that exist ogal V you have vayer you know is up there now who do they service massive companies why because the quality of the customers are higher and so they know that when they sign a contract they actually stick with the contract we all know that if you
(50:49) have a small business owner who signs a 12mon agreement for agency Services he's good for 3 months the biggest model that I've seen for small business owners for from a marketing perspective um was an agency that was running $300 a month $300 a month price point because they had figured out and like there's a key here is that like those business owners are so price sensitive it's not whether you can sell them it's whether you can keep them on their worst month the price isn't based on the value that you can
(51:13) deliver on the best month but how much you can keep on the worst month because that's where the turn comes in the best model that I saw uh was doing SEO for small business owners and they had completely automated every aspect of it um it was basically just a Playbook and I think it generated reviews and maybe a couple phone calls a month but at a $300 month price point if they got one or two phone calls a month it was worth it so the bar to get over to to ascribe value and especially on something that I call
(51:39) like a nuisance business where it's like I know I should be maintaining my reputation I know I should be doing some of this stuff okay for $200 or $300 a month I don't feel guilty about not doing it because this is being handled we in a Consulting model right what happens is some clients actually do the work and they get results and some clients they need a lot of follow-ups and they need a lot of accountability from you how do you maintain that like I know I'm getting very nitty-gritty into this but I'm I'm
(52:03) good with nitty-gritty you talk to basically one of the core problems of all B2B businesses which is that you end up taking over the person's entire business until eventually they're like yeah if you could just send me a check every month and you do you run the business that would be awesome that's why being very disciplined about problem definition from the services that you provide number one and here's the one that everyone messes up who you pick it's not like even if you work with chiropractors right as that as that
(52:24) example you don't necessarily even want to work with all Chiro tractors you look at the customers that you have right now that are the best customers like the top 20% or the top 10% you say okay what characteristics do these people have that other people don't have in my client list and that's both from the soft pers the hard perspective what are the quantitative differences they have a certain size business they're over a certain amount a month they have a number of locations they have a certain amount of employees number of customers
(52:47) like you just get all that data on them and then also what was the experience that they went through when working with me and was it different than some of my other customers because one of the things that happens often times is that the first few customers you get become really sticky and then you start scaling and then you have this front revolving door but you still have your core business of these people that you had in the beginning right so why is that because these people got more help from you and actually got delivered more
(53:10) value and then you basically tried to scale without scaling the value that you delivered to the original customers right and so if you're at whatever 15,000 a month and you've got five customers and they're all like having a great experience and you keep signing people on they keep leaving it's like okay well instead of me trying to sell five this month why don't I just sell one and do a great job and then not lose them and like that's the key to compounding in a service business once you pay down the IGN Bas pay down the inefficiencies
(53:33) of them not knowing what to do yet and being very specific about who you serve and who you don't like we didn't work with personal trainers cycling Studios and like yoga studios 100% could use our model we didn't work with them because the founders tended to be psychologically different their adherence was super low because they just come from a totally different worldview than the guys who are more Fitness weight loss transformation focused even though at the end of the day it's just a member MIP with a back
(53:57) room where people work out but mindset wise they had a very hard time um kind of adopting a different model even though monetarily it totally made sense which means you need to have discipline to say no dude this is so hard to say no to this new upcoming business because you know they can help them but they just don't fit your criteria 100% dude I have 13 companies I get 1,800 a day who reach out whoa right so you have to say no it feels weird to like say no because a lot of the time I get specifically that's why most people stay
(54:28) poor they can't say no and what happens is you go for the short-term money and you sacrifice the long-term money because then you just get in this operational Rat Race and then you scale up your your costs to meet the fact that you took on all these customers that you shouldn't have taken on to begin with and then you have to pay them every single month so then you have to keep on taking on customers that you shouldn't have taken on to begin with and you get in this vicious cycle that you can't get out of until you downsize you take two
(54:47) steps back five steps back fix your ego and then say I'm only working with these customers because ethically I know that these are the ones that I have the highest likely to success with everyone else I have mediocre success and I can say it's their fault I can say it's my fault it doesn't really matter all that I know is that the likelihood that they achieve what I think they should achieve is low period so I'm not going to sell them aren't you afraid that the T will go smaller like of course you can build
(55:09) a niche an inch inch wide and a mile deep there's 30 million small businesses you don't need to service them you like there's there's 50,000 gyms that fit the model that we have now if you want to build A10 billion company then yeah you're going to have to go after a bigger problem but if you want to build a nine fig company you can do that in almost any industry so you mentioned that when you started out you started with the first five customer framework that was awesome and then you just grew with referrals so this question came
(55:34) from a fitness consultant herself and she said that with the competition that the fitness Market is how do you stand out honestly it's just being authentic 99% of the fitness Market just looks at what other influencers doing and say I'll just I'll copy that and I'll do stuff like that but then you just do a worse version of what somebody's already doing zooming all the way out fitness like there's no secret work out more stop eating shitty you'll look better over a longer time Horizon like that's what it is right there's going to be a
(56:00) subset of an audience that is like you genuinely and they want to get their they could get Fitness information from Alex but if I'm a you know a 45-year-old Indian mother I'm probably not going to be her source for Fitness information even if I see the identical stuff as another 45-year-old uh Indian mother now if that 45-year-old Indian mother looks at my fitness content and tries to make content like mine it's going to seem weird you can stick out by actually being yourself I know it sounds trite but the real like this is real there's
(56:26) so many unique aspects of someone's life and the things they're interested in compared to other people that if you just lean into those differences there those unique as the things that you're actually into that are weird right Rogan's into aliens and mushrooms and comedy and fighting who would have told him like you should be Joe Rogan and you're going to have people who like some aspects and then the super fans will be people who overlap on two or three of the interests that you have if you picked my brand it be like dessert
(56:56) working out philosophy Business Marketing sales they're different they people who follow me because they only like the business and money stuff there people who follow me because they only like the philosophy stuff there people who follow me because they just think the desserts and calav stuff is funny like it just depends on what someone's going to come in for but if you're just you then you can stick with it for the long term and that's what's going to build over time and make you quote stand out because there is only one version of
(57:19) you that's lived your life so just live it publicly thanks a lot man I think we are at the end of our 10 year thank you very much for being uh here and keep writing great books I hope I hope you make so much money from the book um and just and crush it because at the end of the day there's more problems than any one person can solve and I hope we build businesses to solve them so explain to me how the franchise works yeah so we have a lot of clients that want to work with us and we have a lot of closers that want to work with us and Yan and I
(57:45) we just can't manage everything ourselves it's just too many people we had two options option number one is Place managers to replace us right and then give like two to three accounts client accounts to each manager so they can manage them obviously and we can scale that way the problem with that was that managers only get paid so much and they only care so much about the business itself right but when it comes to Partners they get 50% cut they get exactly what we are getting 50/50 the franchise thing is interesting because I
(58:15) feel like you would be able to achieve that simply with a profit share rather than getting investment and equity and all like the because if if speed is the goal then you can basically do the makeshift in terms cuz like they're I'm assuming many of them aren planning on selling right and so the only reason the equity would be valuable is if they're going to sell it sometime in the future and buying quote more locations isn't really a thing either I would imagine that just like it'd be a lot faster to just contract you know basically put put
(58:39) legal language around getting a profit share in the structure you know the cut that you have like many companies have scaled sales orgs you know what I mean like Insurance brokerages are just massive sales orgs like real estate agents are massive sales orgs and so um they don't necessarily have Equity you know what I mean Equity deals because those can just get litigious and there's lawyers and just take I'm sure you guys have already this like it just takes more time and I feel like there might be like you could probably remove a couple
(59:01) of the components to get the same behavior which is ultimately what you're trying to do is get people who act like owners so that's just that's me just shooting right off the cuff of just looking at it so that's kind of why we kind of came up with the franchise model to put like a nice barrier there so it's for people who like have the experience in the space of running an agency or like scaling managing High tick sales teams but now you're getting like the infrastructure that we've kind of built over the past four years I mean you
(59:24) could still do all that without the without the franchise agreement but what problem are you solving why are you not bigger it's a management problem just in general with bringing on more partners and doing it faster and doing it more in a more organized way so what you said it does make sense because that would remove some friction and it would allow us to bring more people without risking you know the the equity in any way I mean based on the model you have you guys can Own 100% of the you know like the franchise or but even if you if it
(59:51) was just like you know the the main Co you can still have stream because you have the software so tracking becomes the issue but since you already have that infrastructure built the ability to just make sure that they get overrides now if you want to put you know a $10,000 Buy in or something just because you feel like that increases commitment levels I mean that's fine um but if you look at uh like a Chick-fil-A for example are you familiar with the their model yeah right and so that you know each location probably cost I actually
(1:00:16) don't know the buildout cost but I would imagine it costs at least a million probably one and a half to build a location for chickfly and The Operators put $10,000 in and so it's more of a symbolic gesture than it is like them you know contributing Capital to whatever the thing is but they actually don't own equity in the business so they get a 50/50 profit share after a royalty that goes to holdco just looking at what they've been able to build it seems that that that structure works without the equity um in in terms of eliciting the
(1:00:43) behavior that you guys are going for but from everything that you said even right at the beginning you were like well uh we needed something that was more scalable because obviously we had lots of people there's many people who have scaled businesses with lots of people and so it sounds like it's actually a talent deficit like you need to hire somebody uh or bring someone who's a high level operator who has scaled a sales-driven org what's what's Revenue right now uh revenue for the phone sales organization well every month is
(1:01:06) different around like four million right now per month is that gmv so like gross gross sales volume and then you're getting whatever 20 25% on that yeah so you'd be looking at a at somebody who's scaled a sales work from you know 10 million to 100 million and who's really opts heavy so you'd want somebody who looks like who's very uh very leadership driven not a systems person wrong that's not the right person you're looking for somebody who's who you admire take this away I mean it you need an adult right it doesn't that's not a function of age
(1:01:33) just saying you need someone who has experience doing this uh because if I were looking at like if I were going to go buy in right to phone sales the first thing I would do is hire an operator because right now all the things that you've described have been people issues so if I'm operating on the theory of constraint which is what we do i' would say okay well then people issues seem to be the main problem for this business so I'm going to hire somebody who has experience in this particular domain in a sales org who has gone from X to Z the
(1:01:57) million-dollar question where do you find such people well you guys are sales guys right so it's outbound outbound is the easiest thing to do uh you could also run ads but the best people already have jobs uh and I mean you guys know this from from your business right and so it would be it would be Outreach Outreach is the is the easiest thing to do go to LinkedIn and Linkedin has so many tools now like search for people who meet these you know these three or four job titles um probably like a like a senior vice president or VP of sales
(1:02:27) uh sales director might be a little too low but probably a VP of sales uh or VP of sales Ops something like that uh like you'll have to play with the title it is kind of like an ad in advertising like you have to play to figure out when you get the right avatars on the phone uh but as soon as you get it to click then you're like okay these are the types of people I want and then you talk to as many as you can and the limit stest that I have for highle talent is that I should be learning from them on the phone call so if I feel like I have to
(1:02:52) teach them stuff they're not the right person like if they're teaching me things which is also great because then you can keep taking notes and after 20 or 30 phone calls you're like okay I have a very good idea of what excellent looks like and I can make a more educated decision on the type of person that I want but that person who's very operational should be a people- driven leader especially in this type of work for the second part of this call um we would like to just bring our partners too and uh just ask some sales question
(1:03:18) in general and learn from you you know with our model do you believe that we should utilize group selling methods like webinar seminars events that way we can compress the time frame we make money or just focus on one toone sales I think it depends on on the product as being so usually products above $30,000 and that's why we're focusing on like one to one model right now I think you can do so the way that I like building uh sales ORS is having repeated sales materials and then individualized so like repeated sales materials are
(1:03:47) going to be like the vsls the webinars things like that but you're not you're not closing on those webinars you're just qualifying and setting and so I want sales guys to be doing as little information spewing as humanly possible and really being able to start the call with so you're ready to buy and then yes or no and then work your way so you have 60 Minutes to close rather than okay great now like Discovery like let me talk to you about how we might be able to help you because if you because then sales guys get really tired of saying
(1:04:12) the exact same pitch then they sounded like robots then they get zoned out because they're saying something they're not listening and so the talk ratios get way off um and so I prefer having as much of the standardized information sharing being done before the call so that the closer time can be maximized to closing rather than just sh like teaching but I wouldn't be trying to pitch 30k stuff directly to a payment page I'd probably be pitching that to you know qualifier set calls yeah that's how we're uh we're doing it right now
(1:04:40) but we've seen some other people they have like live webinars you know and they have the sales guys on the live webinars and even though they're selling super high ticket offers they try to like do that communication information St of the call like just through the chat and then once they show level of Interest then to get them on the call well they're using the webinar as the set correct at the end of the day there's a certain amount of information that someone needs to have or certain amount of like exposure that they have
(1:05:05) to have to a brand or a product for them to you know make a buying decision and so that can be a long set and then a short close it can be a set webinar close it can be a long webinar then a close like there's just a certain amount of selling you know the runway for the plane has to be a certain length doesn't really matter where you slice it it just has like this is amount that the majority of people need to have before making a purchasing decision now some people people might need less and that's okay cuz they probably got it beforehand
(1:05:29) from other things that they've consumed so if you want to say okay how do I sell well I want to increase the likelihood that some that the the highest percentage of people buy then I want to create an experience that the highest percentage people get all of the information that they need prior to the closing conversation and so if you do a webinar as a big set thing I mean to me that's the same I mean that's all the same like if you run ads to webinar ads to vssl then they go to auler or you know if you have a live call team where
(1:05:53) you have a number that becomes the CTA and then the call teams answering calls in real time operationally I wouldn't I wouldn't upend my entire business because of just a slightly different way of doing it because I I think it's more happy to Glad um as long as your throughput is good and you're you know like you're making money and you're growing right now I would I don't know if that would be the constraint of the business so like I think the stuff we were talking about earlier like that seems more of the constraint than kind
(1:06:14) of the the the individual tactics you know in in the example you gave what's your method for building trust and credibility on a sales call um in like the fastest way possible like what method what approach you often take for that well I mean brand matters more than anything uh like right off the bat and the the you know the the vast majority of like the the hard closing tactics and hard sales tactics have to exist in lie of not having a brand right it's like we have to make up all this hard stuff uh it's kind of like in The Matrix when he
(1:06:45) like uh when you're good enough you won't have to dodge bullets or like you're saying I can dodge bullets it's like well when you're ready you won't have to so like the brand is when you're ready you won't have to but if you don't have that which is the big thing that you should have but if you don't have that then it's the same things that you would normally do you're going to try and find common ground be relatable uh try like a lot of it just comes down to how well do you understand the Avatar right so I think a lot of sales teams
(1:07:08) under under prepare by under understanding the Avatar the Prospect and over educate on the product like if I understand what a 45-year-old woman's suffering from I can basically do the same sales call and at the end of the call say I can pitch therapy I could pitch I could pitch weight loss I could pitch a gym membership I could pitch you know I could pick cleaning services it doesn't really matter because if I understand the Avatar really well I'll be able to speak to her pains and what you said is true like brand is extremely
(1:07:33) powerful and with the clients that we take on for our agency do you recommend that we go for people of very strong Brands and take that approach like that's that should always be the Focus right like where go for the brand and from there yeah strong brand strong product for sure fair question though yeah relatability Common Ground what's been the number one reason you seen show up rates increase or decrease uh it's it's 100 golden BB's no silver bullets so so when we when we go into a company we have a something called a lead
(1:07:58) nurture checklist and so it's just like 17 things that we do and each one of them adds like 2 to 5% and so that's how we can get something from like 30 40% show rates to 85% sh rates it's just doing a lot of little things so I I would not look for like the one trick it's just like okay how quickly are we responding how how much information do we provide them beforehand are we providing a personalized video like can we give them a gift card for showing up that they can share a coffee with us like just how many different things can
(1:08:23) we add in to increase the likelihood that they sh can we can we create an open loop between the set and the close that they're going to get information that they are they got their in their their interest peaked is there a way that we can say that we're going to show them that we're going to do a certain amount of work on their behalf then we're going to give them the deliverable on the next call right so they have a huge incentive they have huge curiosity so that they would want to show up like this is particularly true an insurance
(1:08:43) product so like we have an insurance company and so like we create personalized insurance plans it's like okay well how do we get more people to show up but we don't want to send them the insurance plan that we're going to make them before the call we just say we'll explain it to you on the call yeah we Implement a lot of those tactics as well probably there's some stuff that you're doing that we currently don't have at the moment as well I don't know if it makes sense to share on this call but you said there's kind of like 17
(1:09:03) things is AOS maybe like send it to us no so um oh no sorry man all right honestly it really depends on what the business is if we're looking at an insurance business versus a weight loss business like it's more applying a principle across but that being said the big one that's that's probably missing like it's usually the big obvious thing which is we can always do the hundreds of little tactics but you're trying to dodge bullets rather than like winning before you start which is like why why do so few people trust you like that's the big
(1:09:33) that's the big like I see the Matrix and then everything else becomes irrelevant so for acis.com our show rate on calls is nearly 100% so if we call some if we say hey we'd like to find out more about your business today is Tuesday our next opening is Thursday of next week so 9 days from now show rate still 100% because of brand we actually don't need to do any of those tactics now we have those tactics so that we can help the the companies that don't have those level of Brands but like you want to Stack the deck you want to answer the
(1:10:02) question why does no one trust me and solve that otherwise you're always going to deal with these issues like do the fundamentals for sure but the big the big things that'll matter most is who you're choosing as your customers so Vista you guys heard of Vista private Equity so they're the biggest they're the biggest software private Equity they've got a gazillion dollars whatever the way that they look at a business is that they do a customer analysis and so they look for the 8020 right they look for the 20% of customers that are worth
(1:10:25) more more than everyone else and they then do a customer analysis say what do these 20% have that the other 80% don't and then they exclusively look for customers that are that 20% and then they say no to everyone else and so then what happens is if the sales velocity remains unchanged they 5x the business so sometimes you'll make more money just by saying no so you can have the capacity to say yes to the few guys that matter more and if you're not getting more of those people then solving that problem rather than saying like how do I
(1:10:51) keep getting how do I how do I polish a turd instead of going from that perspective just saying like maybe I just should not try to polish turds because it's still a turd right and like how do I get the people who are much better companies to be attracted to my business and if you have a customer list that people aspire to be like then you'll get more and more people like that's where that's like kind of The Branding side for you guys which is how can I associate with better quality Brands so that other better quality
(1:11:16) Brands realize that what we do is legit you can try and optimize the [ __ ] out of something but like usually it's the big obvious stuff and we don't look at the big obvious stuff because they're actually harder problems to solve and they take longer but it's where the most value is unlocked what's the ideal frequency and the topics of coaching calls that would increase the overall performance of Setters and closers so I would say it's less about the topics of the calls and more about what you're training repeatedly and what you're
(1:11:39) rewarding so sales is one of those really interesting businesses or like you know departments that you can see very clearly like you guys have probably seen different sales teams and they have very different cultures and so it'd be like what are the cultures that create the highest performance in our experience you know you can go on all on either extreme you can have a very punishment driven culture culture which is very individualistic or you can have a very team driven culture which is typically reward based what you want to
(1:12:00) reward is adherence to the script not closing like that's a huge shift for most sales teams if you reward adherence to the script then what happens is you get everyone to follow the script now if they aren't closing then you need to change the script but it's much easier to change the script once you've taught adherence than it is to have a bunch of Lone wolves who do anything they can to close the deal which then impacts your brand so like a really simple you know tactic we did at one of our chains was we just said cool we'll give them five
(1:12:25) bucks if they follow the script whether they close the now mind you the the tickets are smaller right it's just higher higher volume we'll give them five bucks if they follow the script and if they close or they don't close they get paid either way you know what's interesting the thing they're most curious about when they send their managers is do I get the five bucks for the adherence even though they make three times more on the close so we still we still give them benefits for closing but they want to know whether
(1:12:46) they got the approval of the manager because the $5 actually matters less than the approval from the manager saying you did a good job the $5 is more of a token that makes a lot of sense and if you can imagine cuz everybody here is sold before if you got on a call and you knew that you could get paid no matter what just for following the process it takes some of the pressure off like think about like you hopped in the car like I'm just going to make sure that I get my bone no matter what on on the adherence but guess what happens when
(1:13:07) everybody hears to the script you [ __ ] close more there you go because sales is one of the biggest issues where you have false positives where someone goes Rogue and then closes and basically gets reinforced for doing the wrong thing and then they start doing the thing that they did that one time that worked and then it doesn't work over and over again so they change their behavior they learn the wrong thing right and so then you have to course correct right that's why sales like it's all about adherence and then then we can be really
(1:13:34) strategic about really making sure the script is beautiful and crisp and concise uh and we just and we just drill the team on adherence the big topic I want to address is how to sell emerging Tech you don't sell emerging Tech you it's it's selling the plane flight versus the vacation if I could tell you that your financials would be absolutely accurate and updated in real time would you want that how much would you be willing to pay compared to what you currently pay a lot more great what if I said I could do it for less than what
(1:13:58) you're currently paying are you interested great this is what I need the fact that I'm using AI is irrelevant you just sell the outcome and then you not really no one cares AI is great for YouTube clickbait but for for sales it's irrelevant that was like one of the main talking wanted to get across what else you want to do for the next 16 you must be getting a ton of businesses since you some a lot of AI businesses that are coming across your disc right now at acquisition.
(1:14:20) comom what are the things that's making sort of jumping out at you and what are the sort of commonalities between things that make you go oh well that that seems to have some kind of staying power uh the vast majority of AI businesses that I look at are are dog [ __ ] and so they're either they're not real AI which is 99% of them they're basically just built on chat PT which is fine there's nothing wrong with that but I'm just like let's not claim that we're creating AGI on the other hand it's it's people who have no business Acumen and so
(1:14:45) they're like it's totally different like the the normal laws of business don't apply it's like they have always applied and they will always apply because they're just how business works right those are the the vast majority of people that I see in that I do think that AI implementation for Main Street is an enormous opportunity so aiying if you will and I I don't think I think your first conclusion is Right which is being the custom guy is tough you know what I mean it's just it's it's all things to all people which is nothing to
(1:15:12) know on if I'm talking to the audience now if you guys want to get into this world what you want to do is look at an industry or an avatar that you understand well and so one of the things that like why combinator and some of these great like you know legendary investors look at is how much time a Founder has suffered and lived through a problem I can talk about breathing cuz I've had two nose surgeries I've been falling asleep on my hand since I was in eighth grade so that I could breathe so like I've lived with the problem for a
(1:15:37) long time and I've tried many different types of solutions so I have tons of Industry knowledge if I were to start a company like that if you have a job right now or have had any type of job you've worked in a business that's a great Baseline of background knowledge that's difficult to just jump like even if you were a server at a restaurant for 2 years you still will probably know more about restaurants than 99% of people who aren't in the restaurant industry like I don't know anything about how restaurants work cuz I've just
(1:16:02) never really worked in one you could probably be aware of because you now also have this understanding of what AI can do to think okay there's a hundred problems in a restaurant is there one very specific problem that I can solve well and is very similar between restaurants CU as soon as you get the point A to point B you can create the clear value prop and you can message around that getting extremely specific which is I think what you were saying that you give the advice to is super smart and it makes the problem set
(1:16:27) really narrow to solve so you can become an expert that's a an inch wide and a mile deep the exact same thing the reason that most people don't do that when they're starting out is because you don't have enough demand you have so few leads that come to you that you're like well I I mean [ __ ] I need to pay rent this month and I only got four leads this month and all four are completely different but I need the money and so I get it redeploy that cash into getting really concentrated on your marketing which is what offers and leads is all
(1:16:52) about so that you can find that specific Avatar that you can over and over again repeat which is also why referrals are so strong because if you do a good job they will send you other people just like them the the question is is yes I can pick a niche to do this AI automation I can build AI Solutions and a sort of targeted one but what is the opportunity that I should Target within the niche and that comes down to either a as you said industry experience that you already have or sort of B what we've said is finding some sort of partner
(1:17:17) within the industry so we say you can either try to pay them for the time as a consultant or you can just message enough people and say hey look I'm looking to bring the kind of solutions to the industry would you be willing on working working on this with me I need a little bit of your specific knowledge but in exchange I'll create this thing and you can refer you can basically have first STS on sharing it to your network and you can make some money that way so yeah I definitely wouldn't do it as a Consulting relationship the the thing
(1:17:40) that you're going to be selling is the product and so having a consultant who's the one who's in charge of the primary value that you're driving is not a good idea and so you'd want somebody who's long-term incentivized to continually improve the product continue to innovate the product see the things that are coming around the corner to keep it up to date make it better make it stronger Etc it really just comes down to how to have a normal Business Partnership so all the normal rules of business apply and this person has some specific
(1:18:05) knowledge you don't have and you should ideally have specific knowledge they don't have they should be asking the question like why do I partner with the people in your community if I'm an AI developer right if you're trying to figure out which of the problems to solve in an industry it's just value created times ease of implementation that's the equation which if you chunk it up it's number of potential customers times gross profit per customer if I have six different problems I could potentially solve which one has way more
(1:18:27) people who have it which one's easier to do which one unlocks the most value one thing that we're starting to see as as us ourselves actually run and build one of these these AI automation agencies now ai development company as well is that by building a a development team that is capable what is is your take and your experience with how important that development resource is I mean it's sure your event you must know working with developers can be a complete plane but having them in housee and having a really good team to rely on as you shoot
(1:18:51) for those big opportunities can be key I mean what's your experience being like this and how important do you think that development resources when you're going for those bigger plays very okay I mean we were thinking the same thing so I was glad to know you agree on that it's the product like if you're in a service business the quality of the people that you use to provide the service is the product and so those people usually want to be compensated well because if they are really good then the places that they're coming from
(1:19:18) will want to pay more to keep them and so you have to give them a great place to work and a financial incentive or some upside that they get exposed to that they wouldn't otherwise like you want them to feel like owners and the best way to do that is for them to actually be owners if you're trying to get on The Cutting Edge of Technology then actually having the people who are good at that is the business well it is a great resource to have a really killer marketing toam under your belt but the the development side of things I I tend
(1:19:44) to find at least in our experience has been a harder thing for us to to create hard because you don't know it like it's easier for you to do the marketing stuff cuz you're good at it so you know if someone's full of [ __ ] on the interview you just don't know if anyone's full of [ __ ] on the interview because you have no context the most important hire which is why I say this is you need a technical co-founder you need somebody who has a real stake in making sure that the people are coming in are actually good not that you're checking a box and
(1:20:05) saying hey I have 14 people on my development team anybody in the in the true high-tech world knows that one amazing developer is more valuable than 100 B developers this is the hardest part of business is hiring people who are really good at something without knowing the in-depth knowledge and that's where like leveraging somebody who might not want to work for you that you do think is brilliant to at least interview or double check on how good they are um is really valuable that's where like building a network becomes
(1:20:30) important and getting even some tests like of aptitude for them to take so that you can at least get some sort of Baseline but it's all going to be about how skilled that person is cuz ideally if they were as good as you are at marketing then you guys would probably have a really successful business we've been fortunate enough to to find that find that magical sort of technical co-founder so um we're starting to get them really well compensated both getting in equity as well so we are off to the RAC and that's completely changed
(1:20:56) our business I can't even stress for for anyone of you in here that that key hire is just a complete ganger I'm sure you've had it Alex in your businesses where you've just found that right person and it just completely changes things all right appreciate you guys thank you and appreciate the community thank you guys for showing up hopefully the book serves you guys well how do you feel like in general do you think like the you think you brought as much value as you promised I hope so I try to answer the questions to the best of my
(1:21:19) ability and provide value to the so

Transcript:
(00:00) I've spent over $500,000 on my own business education and in every single course Mastermind coaching program Workshop I've become the number one student they had and then eventually surpass the person who taught it if you're in the game of Entrepreneurship the game of business you have to grow in order to get better and in order to grow you need to learn and if you're going to learn you might as well do it the right way and win I had someone say this um recently to me they're like you know how do you know what programs to buy how do
(00:28) you know what workshops to go to how do you know what courses to listen to or what channels to watch in order to learn right and they're like how do you know that it's going to work and I think that's the question that always gets asked is like how do you know it's going to work and I think that fundamentally asking that question shows that it won't work because it is never going to be the thing that works you are going to be the thing that makes it work and so when I look back at my history as a student of
(00:59) and continue to be a student but student of the game of business the I have yet to have a negative Roi on any purchase that I've made whether it's tutoring courses workshops and to be fair I've bought from from from bad people I've brought from some scumbags I've bought from Bad Teachers but I have absolutely awide every single purchase that I've made and so whenever I hear someone say like I bought something in it and it didn't work um it kind of grinds my gears and I think I've had it and heard it enough times in the last month or so
(01:28) that I wanted to make this podcast about it and so this is this is what I want to kind of zoom out on is that I want to give you a top- down approach in terms of levels of competence and then a bottom up approach from a skills perspective and I think if you combine both of these things together you will make a lot more money and you will be more successful at the things that you try to learn and so if you're like trying to learn how to make Tik Tok ads to start a second you know acquisition channel for your business then this
(01:52) would apply to you if you're if you're a customer of an agency then this will apply to you if you're trying to be a student and just get in the game then this will apply you and so the first thing is understanding the levels of competence and so at the top the best and the highest level of competence is something that I will call positive active all right so you've got you've got the inclination and you've got active or passive and so there's five levels all right so the top is and and and the characteristics of somebody who
(02:19) has this belief set is that no one has proven that it cannot be done and they ask other people to prove to them why they can't do it and they think I will be the best student that this person has ever had no matter what no matter how incompetent of a teacher they are I will make it happen I will win because that's who I am not who they are basically the idea that we make our success dependent on the quality of the teacher puts the power in their hands rather than ours and so on the flip side of this the reason that basically any single program
(02:55) in the world will still be able to get positive reviews of some sort is that no matter what some percentage of real winners will always go into everything you just look at the public school system like more or less a dog [ __ ] system but there are still winners that come out of it and it's not because the quality of the teachers it's because of the mindset of winners because winners will win and so the highest level of this this example of like Elon where he's like breaking down to physics he's like if you can't show me that it's
(03:20) physically impossible based on the laws of physics that we know that it is possible I'm going to go do it it's the same concept as R Roger banister running the first 4minute mile like no no one had done it before and he's like well physically it's not impossible it's not breaking the laws of physics for me to run a 4-minute mile and so that is positive active now underneath of that you've got the second class of competence which I would consider positive passive this is all the people who ran the 4-minute mile after Roger
(03:49) banister they're the people who say okay he did it so I can do it and to be clear this is still good there's still winners absolutely that can do that and when I look at the people that I've worked with customers employees anything I can identify and these are honestly these are your these are your a minus players like they're like okay he did it I can do it and honestly that's a great perspective like it's not impossible I just need to do the same stuff they did and that's awesome that's the that's the replicate before you iterate they're
(04:17) like I'm going to just do what they did and get what they got and that's an awesome perspective now there's three more levels to this and as we go down some of you will start nodding your heads as either like you are this person or you know someone who's this person the third level of competence here is what I'll call neutral passive and so this is somebody who just says well it's worked for other people let's see if it works for me so it no longer goes from I will like prove to me why I can't make it work level one level two okay someone
(04:48) has made it work therefore I can make it work two let's see if it works you're passively accepting whatever happenings and you're just open now this is where the majority of people are this is where most people just sit they just live their life passively letting things quote happen to them and they're sometimes mediocre customers for for for an agency or a vendor they're mediocre customers for you this is the person who goes into the gym and is like we'll see if your program works for me like I'm you know we'll see if it works now
(05:19) underneath of that you've got level four all right this now we're going down this is it might work for other people but it probably won't work for me this is negative passive so they're still in the passive seat but they're negatively inclined this is the person who half asses and I'll give you a story about this that happened recently so we had a business owner came out I was a salon owner okay so a salon hair salon owner and the guy said hey I used your gift card campaign and it didn't work and I was like all right bro like so I just
(05:52) went through it I was like did you get a referral from all the people did you write the name down of he's like well uh I didn't do I mean I asked them and I told them that they had to use the card on other people but they came back in trying to use the card for themselves I was like well that's not the play he's like well I told them that and I was like well obviously you didn't tell them well enough because that's not the play so and the thing is I just let's just stop I was like do you want me to take accountability for the fact that the
(06:19) gift card players worked for so many businesses and just not yours I was like do you want me to just say it's my fault I was like would that make you feel better and he was like well no I was like that's what you coming for you want me to say that it's my fault I was like you didn't do it you didn't do it right so you just did something else and yeah that something else didn't work because that's not what the program is that's not how the gift card play works if you don't know what I'm talking about it's on my YouTube video it's a whole play
(06:46) and So eventually it got up to be like okay I just didn't do it I was like cool guess what now you can do it again and you can do it right because you know what you messed up you had to let them know it's for somebody else and you had to get the referral and you had to get the three-way introduction otherwise they're going to trying and use it on themselves not bringing people in and you're just giving away services for a discount that sucks don't want to do that he's like okay fine and so we had a little moment and he got over it okay
(07:09) but that's negative passive that's like it might work but it probably won't work for me hey and by the theme if you want to be the best student ever out of all of mosy nation I have two books uh they actually audio books that are for free that I have here uh on this podcast starting at 579 it's my $100 million offers and $100 million leads they have sold over a million copies 26,000 F store views on Amazon if you like hard copies but if you actually follow the steps I've got courses on the site that are also free acquisition. comom trining
(07:36) if you just follow the steps prove why it will work for you and it will now here's the fifth level this is the bottom of the barrel all right this is the this is your one-star customers this is uh this is this is the customer you sign on who just genuinely sucks at everything and they take an active role all right so this is negative active I can prove that this will work for everyone but me I have bad luck nothing works out for me in the end I am the special snowflake that nothing works for my my body is different calories don't
(08:10) affect me I could starve to death and I am immune to death because I could not eat for years and my body would still hold on to Fat because I am special and so what's interesting about this is some of you guys may be laughing about this right now but some of you are this person but you just might not be this person in business you might be this person with your weight but you're not this way in business you might be this way in your marriage but you're not that way in business or you are that way in business and you're not in your marriage
(08:37) you're like oh but you know what oh this this way of communicating it's not going to work for us not in our relationship but I'll prove it I'll I'll go to your [ __ ] sessions I'll follow your little framework for communicating with my wife or my husband and I'll prove to you that it won't work because we're so special that nothing works for us you want to prove it and what's interesting about this is that because underpins a whole set of beliefs behind this that your identity is attached to so it's so much
(09:06) harder to say listen I've been fat my whole life and and and it's my fault it's so much easier to just not have it be that way it's so much easier to be like you know I've always struggled with with women our our you know our marriage has kind of been on the Rock but that's kind of how it's always been that way right and so we it's so much more difficult to accept that all of that pain and suffering that you've been through is 100% your fault and so instead it's easier to just try and actively prove that it won't work now
(09:35) there's some good there's some interesting stuff about number five so I actually find number five people very very interesting because they in my opinion have the highest potential to jump from five all the way to one and I've had so many experiences in my life this is the one star becomes the five star this is the the person that all of a sudden like something switches and the thing is they go from negative active they have the active they're trying to prove it but they're proving the wrong thing they're trying prove it wrong but
(10:01) all of a sudden sometimes if you can get it to swap they just try to prove it right and then they become absolute [ __ ] animals and so I'll tell you a story so there was a gym owner uh at gym launch and he was he was definitely one of these number fives right he was like it's not like my Gym's in a different Market the people the people here are different my weight loss leads are different than everyone else's weight loss leads my Market's different my zip code's different the corner that my gym is on is different but all of a sudden
(10:31) he'd been on enough calls and I probably ranted at him or something on on some on some live call and um he was like you basically just called me a [ __ ] and I was like yeah probably one one way or another and so he said I just decided what if what if it did work and what if I took the same energy that I'm that I'm doing to try and prove myself right and try and prove this system works and what if I just did everything as though I as though it was going to work and I assumed it was going to work and so he did that and he ended up becoming one of
(11:06) the top facilities out of the thousands that we had and then we ended up hiring him because he completely outsourced his gym made it profitable made it make more money using the setup that we had and the interesting part here and this is what's crazy same system same gift card play Same advertising same gym model different approach different level of competence showed up and executed an entirely different way I'll give you a different example I had a lady this was one of my first probably 50 customers at my gym her name was Autumn so autumn
(11:38) came in and she had the nothing works for me I have a special thyroid you know whatever uh you know if calories I could starve myself forever and I'd still live I defy the laws of physics and and uh after like two three four weeks all the people that she' started with started losing weight and of course now normally in that level five she'd be like well that's of course of course that's what way cuz I'm different than them I'm special I get my identity from being special and I just was like listen I was like do you want to be right and fat or
(12:09) do you want to or do you want to do you want to get skinny I was like which one matters more to you being right or being thin I was like I just had I had had a sit on with her and I was like just be real with me if being right is more important to you I was like then then you can be right I was like but which one's more important to you being right being thin and she was like I want to be thin and I was like then [ __ ] do this and so she did and of course she lost a bunch of weight and then she became one of my top clients and then she started
(12:35) referring everyone and the thing is is that when you see a level five turn into a level one you're like oh my God and the thing is they become absolute ambassadors brand champions for you because you help them get over that and so I say this from a business owner perspective because don't lose hope on those people sometimes you just have to say do you want to be right or do you want this outcome I'm cool either way but you're the one who has to live with it and so she decided that she wanted to be thin which is awesome and so it's kind
(13:05) of one of those it's kind of like uh it's interesting that in like NE so Matrix and Star Wars probably two of my favorite um kind of universes of of of movies um but like Morpheus and Yoda sit in very similar positions in terms of the guide for the for the main character and so there's a there's a point in the dojo where Morpheus looks at Neo and he says stop trying to hit me and hit me and so the the point there is that when you it's basically the difference between going through the motions acting as if versus actually trying to to
(13:37) succeed there's trying to do the things that looks like success versus actually trying to win so replace stop trying to hit me and hit me with stop trying to win and win stop trying to make ads work and make ads work stop trying to hire the sales guy and hire the sales guy right and so it's the idea that like a no fail situation where there there's absolutely somebody this is like the the founder says no one can sell like I can sell yeah no [ __ ] there's people who sell way better than you right you just haven't found them yet okay that means
(14:06) that it's possible so what are you complaining about you just need to go do more stop trying to make your marketing work and make your marketing work stop trying to prove yourself right that you're special and win it's the same reason that Yoda says there is no try there's only fail or do and not do and so it's the same concept because the reason that try is such an Insidious concept is because it allows the possibility of failure it basically says that there is a way that this won't work but if you fundamentally believe that if
(14:40) like even at level two if someone else can do it so can I then there is zero possibility of failure because if they can do it I will do it and obviously the level above that is even though no one has done it it is not impossible and therefore I will and so that's the that's the top top down approach that I would approach I said there's two levels of this in terms of of thinking through becoming the best student is that where are you on that on that pyramid are you level one are you level two level three level
(15:10) four and are you in different places in different domains are you some way in your Fitness life or some way in your marriage or spouse life or some way in your in your business life and notice how you approach it differently and then look at the one that you're most successful CU you're probably going to be better hopefully better at one of those domains than the other and think about the thought process you have when you approach it and use try and think about using that set of beliefs and systems on the one that you fail at the
(15:36) most and that has been helpful for me now the question that I always like to ask because obviously been I've been in the education world and I like education a lot is why why do we have unequal outcomes why is it that you've got a 100 people who start and you've got one guy who murders it one guy who tanks and then you've got all these people in between and so the this is the bottom-up approach in terms of thinking about this is the number of skills someone has going into an education process program whatever
(16:12) predicts their success so let me explain so if you and this this happens all the time this is the I went through three different things and then I did this thing and then it finally worked but what you didn't know is that you were building this bridge towards an outcome and the first thing you did gave you the first five bricks and the second thing you did give you the second five bricks and the third thing you'd give the next five bricks and then the last thing you did just gave you the one last brick you needed to finish the bridge across from
(16:37) where you are to wherever you wanted to go but the thing is is that we attribute all of the success to the last brick just because it was the most recent not because it was the most important it's the same thing as like it's kind of weird in the world of like education and business education it's like oh man I I you know I used to think this guy was good now I now I learn from this guy but it's like saying yeah my kindergarten teacher taught me uh simple Edition and then my algebra teacher wow he really taught me that guy who taught me you
(17:04) know simple Edition is an idiot it's like no he taught you what you needed to get to where you're at now because skills and education build on themselves and so you were able to be successful with the algebra teacher because you had the simple arithmetic teacher beforehand and so we have this weird thing where you get to an advanced level and you think that the person who taught you the basics was somehow wrong they were just at a different part in your process in the stage and building the bridge and so the reason that that that some people
(17:33) are successful and you are the last brick if you're a business owner for that particular business is that they were able to assemble all those skills at a time now the more skills someone comes in with and also the more meta skills that someone comes in with the more likely they are to be successful and the reason for that is the vager the instructions can be and so for example someone can come to me and say hey Alex can you build a nose strip company for me and I would say sure because I have that skill set to build I have all of
(18:02) them right like I know how to Market I know how to sell I know how to get product I know how to do Logistics all that stuff they can just say that vague of instructions and I can go do it because I have that skill right now that stack of skills rather The Meta skills you have allow you to bridge the gap where things are vague and the vast majority of Education basically has to meet people at some level because if you truly start at zero then it has to be like here's how a computer works here is how a phone works here is how you use
(18:26) the internet right and of course most things that you do in education aren't at that level they're higher up than that but the thing is is that you might be a level four of Education here but a level one at one of the steps and then all of a sudden it quote doesn't work for you but it's because you actually are have a remedial level of education on that step and that's where having the meta met meta skill of like I mean as simple as this is like shoot 30% of people can't read good like they're just they're not even they're not even
(18:55) literate and so so of course it's going to they're going to have a harder time trying to learn anything because they can't even have the ability to learn right and so I think about this and so if something has fed for you in the past rather than blaming the thing blaming the fact that you did not have sufficient skills to make it work and even in the most counter example where something's Absol like just absolute dog [ __ ] because it does happen right I think you can still learn what not to do some of us had phenomenal
(19:25) examples of what not to do in a marriage from our parents some of us had exceptional examples of how not to parent from our parents we've had exceptional examples of how not to boss from our bosses we've had exceptional examples of how not to deliver a product from a business and so sometimes it's using inversion thinking of like okay what are all the things that made this horrible and then do the exact opposite of that and I think that that's why you can always Roi every single experience you have because there you can always
(19:57) either benefit from it or benefit from the inverse of it and I think both like if you have if you have such a terrible experience as you're like new and innovative ways to ruin my experience wow I didn't even know this existed well if I can do the inverse of that then that still will give me the benefit of of learning from this experience I still as much as they wanted to make me fail I still got better like I still will win and so I'll I'll I'll I'll wrap this with with a scene that I like a lot from Invictus which is
(20:29) a movie from 2006 it's Morgan Freeman and and Matt Damon and uh Morgan Freeman's Nelson Mandela and Matt Damon's like the head of the rugby team and it's right during the apartheid when it's the whole racism is that it's you know Max or whatever and um and he says I'll I'll read you the quote he says how's your ankle is it healed it's one of the first questions he asked he's like I heard that your your ankle you know was hurt um you know is it healed he asked that the head guy and he said the truth is Sir this is Matt Damon
(20:55) responding he said the truth is Sir you never played 100% and Mandela responds as in sports as in life and I like that a lot I remember hearing it being like whoa that like for whatever reason it just hit me when when when I heard that because we have so many times where we blame the conditions for the lack of success but the reality is that the Champions create success regardless of the conditions and so they don't look at the education system they don't look at the thing that the teacher gave they don't look at what the vendor provided
(21:27) and think well I'm going to prove that they were bad so that I can be right they just win no matter what and so I think it's like kind of like Tom Brady of like okay well he can go to a different team and still go to the championship still change the conditions because he forces the winning to occur and that's why like that is the like that is the quintessential thing that like if you look at your team if you're a business own you're like who on my team is a level one who's a level two who's a level three who's a level four
(21:57) who's a level five who wants to just like prove that my thing's not going to work who's just like we'll see if it works who's like I think this can work other people have done it we can do it too and who's like we will be the first to do it because there's no reason we can't and I think it's a great way to to measure and assess your team I think it's a great way for you to measure and assess yourself and apply it between different domains and so I think if as I think about these things for my for myself um I think the the biggest thing
(22:25) that I've been fortunate with um is I I I hate the idea of someone making me worse and I hate the idea of quote not getting better from something I invest time and money into and so I've always had the desire to be the number one person in anything that I ever try and learn and so it's like even if this guy's mediocre I'm going to be the best student he's ever had no matter what which has come to bite me in the ass because every single person I've ever bought something from has claimed that they're the reason for my success but
(22:53) the thing is is that all I'm just going to get real nasty with you I've been more successful than every one of their customers and them so like [ __ ] you um and so I've always taken it from the approach of replicate before you iterate so I don't try and get fancy so this is I'm shifting gear set out because I just got a little little passionate about this but like I I will do everything they said to the tea to replicate what they've done so if I want to learn something from them they have been able to do it and I will do
(23:29) exactly what they did and then I can get the same result and then once I've replicated it then I'm like all right here's seven ways I can do this better than them and then I will iterate but I think one of the other issues that happens is people try to iterate before they replicate and the thing is is unless you unless you've learned to replicate you don't know why it worked to begin with and so you have to retrace the steps you have to pick up the breadcrumbs and be like okay that's we did this because there's that hole there
(23:52) okay we did this because there's that problem there okay got it got now I have a good lay of the land now with the other skills that I have that the person who taught me doesn't have I will make this better and that's how I think you can stair step your way learn from as many people as you can and when you learn by your from your third teacher you can pull from your first and second teacher to try and make what you learn from the third teacher better but the thing is is that in any of these paths you just have to start learning and be
(24:17) willing to know that no matter what happens as long as you execute you will learn either what to do or what not to do but you learn either way and I think that gives you a no fail situation as a student because it means you become an inevitability like I will win whether it's with you the next guy the guy after that I will win I will figure this out because there's no way that this is impossible there's no reason that Facebook ads can work for other people's businesses not mine there's no reason that doing a direct mail campaign if I
(24:46) can get it into the right business owner's hands that I cannot find a way to monetize that there's no way that somebody else can be have a have a billion dollar roofing company and I have a roofing company that's only do a million dollars a year I need to change Industries if they can do it I can do it there's a way and I just don't know how yet but that's a me problem not a universe problem and the thing that everyone keeps messing up about this is that they're trying to think that like they're proving the system right or
(25:15) they're proving their teacher right or proving the guru right but you're not doing any of that you're proving to yourself yet again that you can win no matter what and I think that's the big difference because some people like don't want to win because they want to prove that the teacher's bad it's like that's that's like drinking poison and hoping the other person dies it's one of the dumbest things I can possibly imagine like you want to sacrifice your outcome your success because you want to show that someone else is bad like the
(25:42) best way to show that someone else is bad is to beat them and then just keep winning and move on with your life and get them to shrink into irrelevance as you grow into your potential

(00:00) how do I maintain being a husband that is present with my wife while also consistently grinding to achieve my goals you don't Welcome to our special end of year Q&A couples Edition you guys have questions and we may or may not have good answers to them enjoy what do you do for dates expensive restaurants chill at home Etc I think we go to expensive restaurants sometimes and sometimes we chill at home and just like watch movies and do nothing I will say that our need for dates is proportionate for how much we're working so if we are
(00:27) working a lot we will need to take dates if we are not working a 10 we kind of have enough time with one another intermittently that I feel like our need for like carving out time goes down a lot for me I delineate date night versus going out to eat because for context we go out to eat pretty much every night of the week and so what makes it special if you go out all the time like is it the fanciness of the restaurant not really because we do a lot of business dinners and things like that and so we go out to
(00:48) like five star restaurants probably three nights a week we go to Jimmy John's more nights well now we go to Jimmy John's too Chick-fil-A Chick-fil-A Chipotle Chipotle we don't Chipotle plac wish chipot it would be nice oh my God anyways anyway stomach let's not get into that my point was that the difference between going out for a business dinner and going out on a date is that I dress up and by dress up it means I don't wear this and so that's the yeah I shower I put deodorant on and I don't wear a hat we go incognito mode yeah no one can
(01:19) recognize me that's actually in my opinion the the main delineation between going out to eat for work or whatever versus when we go out and actually like do a date that's the main difference if we do a at home version of that it's like we're going to watch a movie together that we both feel like watching like Twilight like Twilight I'm Team Jacob we were both Team Jacob Cameron is the next question oh I wasn't going in order oh you're just picking got it okay picking the she like it's like ice cream at home she'll
(01:46) pick out all the chunks all the good ones and then she'll just leave me like vanilla I feel like when we have like 17 pins of ice cream that's acceptable I feel like it's never I just buy another pint you don't you just leave it like a like a used corpse that just got like all of its organs taken out of it it's true how do I maintain being a husband that is present with my wife while also consistently grinding to achieve my goals easy you don't you just sacrifice yourself as a husband so you can achieve your goals to give an actual realistic
(02:11) answer to the husband who asked that question no one works effectively 24 hours a day it's about doing effective work not just sitting in front of the computer pretending to be productive and I say pretending not that this person is but like I would be pretending to be productive Pro productively procrastinating like if you know that your work output drops prit of time and I usually know what type of work I'm doing so for me I'm editing I know how many paragraphs I can edit per unit of time or how many pages I can type or how
(02:34) many slides I can make in a presentation so if you have work that you are comfortable knowing what your rate of progress is if I start seeing that drop a lot I usually call it because then my quality of work also go down cu the next then I have to fix all the stuff anyways so the tldr is when your output goes down sub that with a higher Roi thing so it's like if I have 16 hours of awake time per day if I do 15 hours of work and 1 hour of marriage time I'll get a really high Roi on that first hour of of marriage time and so like optimizing
(03:01) around life is like the ROI I get from that 1 hour is worth dropping the last hour of work and so I think I try and think about it like that is like what's my minimum effective dose um for each goal and usually you can still heavily index on achieving your goals because it usually takes more time than your marriage does and then have the time when you do need to rest and recharge to be dedicated to your spouse and I think it's also like Seasons you know like when you're writing a book I think in the very beginning when you did the
(03:27) first bout where I realized like oh we're not going to have a lot of time with each other it took me a minute to like accept that we but all are going to go through Seasons like that in our lives and the bigger your goals are one I think the more understanding you need to be as a partner for that person because the bigger the vision they have for their lives the more that you're going to have to recognize that that requires sacrifice and bouts you having those big goals for yourself was the first time in a relationship that I had
(03:52) a man who had bigger goals for himself than I even had for myself which I was grateful for and I'm grateful because I felt like the relationship at many times I had in the past was just distracting from my goals whereas it should Propel you faster to your goals because you support each other in a way that creates an environment where it's easier for each of you to hit your goals than harder and I think a lot of people make it harder for their spouse to hit their goals than easier there's always going to be times where we're going to give
(04:14) each other leftovers and it is what it is but I think what we're really good at doing is we communicate about it and it remains an open dialogue versus like complaining to other people or being passive aggressive like it doesn't turn into that ever and I think a lot of spouses have unrealistic goals for one another and what they what that means for me is that like you have to accept the tradeoff for the thing that you want most and so if you want a spouse who's super goal oriented and super ambitious the trade-off the price tag for that is
(04:42) that they're going to work more and their schedule's not going to be as flexible they're not going to be able to go drop of a hat get away you know weekends and vacations and stuff if that's the season they're in and so I just think it's unfair of either spouse to have dual desires of things that conflict and so you just have to in my opinion pick the one that matters more to you I think we have just changed our expectations over time so that they actually meet reality and so if this individual is upset or feels like
(05:14) expectations what he quote should be doing as a husband or is not what he's currently doing he either needs to change the expectations of what he needs to do to be a good husband or he needs to accept that this is actually the new new normal for whatever season he's in next question this one's for you was there ever a time where you felt you shouldn't or couldn't be working together I think the only only time that I ever even questioned us working together was the one fight we got into basically we had a large disagreement on
(05:37) where to take the business and what decision to make with our software business I think we like locked ourselves in a room for like 2 days because we realized we completely disagreed Alex steamrolled me and I let him but I in a way realized from that experience that I allowed him to take full responsibility for the outcome by not using better skills of influence to try and get him to see my point instead I was just very frustrated I gave up and I was like screw it whatever we'll do it your way what I don't have to do at that
(06:06) point is take responsibility for an outcome every time that you you kind of do that in a conversation what it really was doing was like this is a really scary decision and now I'll just let Alex take responsibility for the outcome one of the things that Lea's improved a lot on is um I used to be like sell me on it like I want to believe you but I'm not sold like sell me on it she would just say like this is what we need to do even though there was like a mountain of a hundred things behind it she would just say the end of the problem of the
(06:31) math problem but it was like show your work I don't get how you went from here to here and I just I didn't see the dots connecting people see us now and they're like you guys have a really good partnership but I mean it took years of work oh my God and communication it was really hard in the for the first few years yeah we've only had one real big argument in our careers and it was about business it was even about like relationship stuff do you train or do Fitness Together if not why not I don't think I'm a good training
(06:56) partner historically I don't train well with many people like I like having a trainer to yell at me you also don't like that trainer who's yelling at you to be your spouse correct and that's how Alex trains people so instead of him yelling at me and me doing the exercise I just go why are you yelling at me stop yelling at me actually I think now if we train together it would be completely different to be fair I actually just like going to the gym listening to music and not talking to anybody yeah so we go to the gym at the same time and we don't
(07:22) work out together it work worked fine we love the car ride there and the car ride back Yeah we actually yeah we we enjoy the car ride when did you know she was the one that was fit for you as your spouse and her the same to you I was waiting for you to say how' you know I was the one you looked at me creepily and I was like that's that's how I knew she looked at me like I was gets me going like a piece of meat no I mean I had I had a handful of moments big moment number one was when you went to Hawaii and Soldier ass off when we
(07:46) weren't together so we we split for like 30 days so she could do a launch I just had a head-on collision DUI my mother was in the hospital I just split with two different business partners in the last 30 days I just lost all my money like it was it was all all of this happened in like a 60-day period honestly it was just cuz she stood tall when everything else was crumbling around me and I didn't I didn't deserve the Loyalty that she chose to show me you stood tall and like basically followed through with my commitments
(08:12) even though you didn't owe me anything cuz I basically made the agreement to the gym own that we'd launch it but like we broke up she could have just left and gone home like that she could have done that and she didn't when I lost everything the second time uh Lila was like I would sleep with you under a bridge if it came to that I was like I like you but like I respect that if you don't find me respectable at this moment cuz I have nothing she was like I'm in and so that was I mean honestly those are probably two big
(08:36) moments for me yeah we had all the heart in the beginning of our relationship like all the hard stuff was before we got married what about you um never asked that yeah what were your moments one of them was after you got the DUI and real winner no I mean and then I was like what's he going to do next you just completely turn [ __ ] around when you see someone there in like their darkest moments like what are they going to do and he just just went right through it and picked his [ __ ] up and was like I'm not going
(09:03) to [ __ ] indulge myself in that and I respected that a lot and I would say the second time is when maybe 9 10 months in the relationship and I felt like I wonder if he's ever going to like let me in and we were at your one of your old gyms and somebody was saying something and then you looked to me and you said well I'd really like your opinion and I was like and in that moment I was like I think he's making an effort to be more collaborative and then he did and then you like fat like very quickly accelerated in terms of like your team
(09:32) work no I respected your opinion if there was ever something that we built a relationship on the Bedrock has been respect not love I think feeling in love can come and go but at least for me respect is more unchanging well yeah I think all feelings are fleeting and respect is like when I look on paper at this person and their character and I admire this person's character there are going to be moments when people are in a relationship or they're like [ __ ] this person you [ __ ] so annoying whatever everyone has those moments everyone has
(09:59) those thoughts but when someone has like really outstanding character and they're a respectable person it's much easier in this moment to be like I'm proud to be married to this person and you know you're not going to be feeling super romantic most of your life like you're going to be you know working at your job you're going to be with friends you're going to be out you're going to be running errands you're going to be stressed you're going to be dealing with life [ __ ] you're be with family you're going to have kids like all these things
(10:21) and so it's like in all of those moments outside of like the fairy tale 60 Minutes every two weeks you get like how do you feel about that person do you ever have communication issues if not what do you do to communicate so well oo little assumption there if yes how do you resolve them I think that we're fairly good at recognizing when we're not communicating well and we usually try a different method of communicating we step away for a second often times we step away and then we write to each other yep that's probably the biggest
(10:46) go-to y because it gives us time to look at our thoughts before we say them to each other number one hack we text when we're angry which is actually like seems like opposite no it's not yeah that's not how it is we're not like Angry texting each other no it's like let me clearly think out what I'm trying to say and then I say it and then I like reread it and I read hers I'm like okay she's saying this you know and we just it creates more space between the communication so you can think about your response and so for us I think it's
(11:11) just decreased the emotionality that we resolve things with I do think that one of the keys besides the text thing is that we we physically change environments so it's like if you're a tiff in the kitchen if she goes to the living room and I go to my office and we text it's like we both physically changed environments we kind of left the scene it just diffuses a lot I would also say that you know we are busy and so often times we need to go do something and then we just come back to it later and half the time we're like
(11:35) yeah let's just [ __ ] forget about it like we're like it's not even like we were just both whatever in the moment it doesn't matter you were tired I was hungry yeah and I think one thing that we do well is we're willing to just like let [ __ ] go what are the non-negotiables in your relationship if any that's a good question yeah it's funny cuz I think we talked about them more around when we got married and now they're just facts agreements agreements yeah actually they were the negotiables they were like what are the things that we
(11:57) both mutually agree to and if we want to change change one of these agreements we both need to agree on it otherwise we stick with what our commitment was this will be quote unhealthy in the marriage world but um I actually told Lila I was like the business comes before our marriage that was the first three years of our marriage I know if I would say that's a great advice for many no I'm I'm just being I'm being candid yeah yeah so people get divorced because of money issues the business makes money and feeds us so feed the business the
(12:22) business will feed us and that was kind of my reasoning then we were both miserable at like threeyear point and L and I sat on the bench one day outside of our house and we were like I don't like this and she was like I don't like this either and we were both like I wouldn't want to continue this way and she I know going into that conversation was afraid like well what if Alex just like this is what he likes and this is what he thinks normal and honestly if I had said like I love this this is great I think Lea would have been like this
(12:44) doesn't work for me and then that would have been it and the F if it had been the same way with Ila I probably would have been like it won't work for me and so you know we tweaked the how how we were going to work and so we said well if we're miserable we won't stick with the business so we were like let's make our marriage first and if we're happy then the business will win or not but at least we won't be miserable and so when we flipped it it actually tremendously improved Our Lives I think we like I I joked about it I was like I think we 3x
(13:09) our marriage this year when we made that change and she was like only an entrepreneur would say that but yeah we definitely tripled that year when we got married we both looked at like the highest success marriages are people who have low expectations and high commitment I'm going to expect that you are going to not change and not only that you might get worse and right and I'm still committing to this provided you you know don't change your values and what you want to do things like that like the big the big core things in
(13:35) order to have a relationship where two autonomous people can be together you have to give each other that space to just be experiment do what you want to do find yourself at times change adjust you know what I mean not freaking out about things not being to your expectations or to your desires it just lowers the pressure in conversations like the reason a lot of people split up during like engagements is because whenever you have conversations you're like wait you didn't pick up your socks does that mean that you're never going
(14:02) to pick up your socks for the rest of my life and for the rest of my life I'm going to see socks on the floor like they just catastrophize and so I think just being like huh I don't like this okay we're busy right now when we have time I'll bring it up like it's not going to end anything and if I forget by the next time we talk then it's probably not that big of a deal yeah and the flip side is if everything is super so easy like you just like let everything roll off it's like usually just not confronting [ __ ] cuz no one no two
(14:26) people are perfect together like there's just always like there people you have tons of different things and Communications and things like that we both know that both of us have these things that are were huge strengths for us and so then we each get to deal with each other's like downsides of those strengths you know which you know one for me is like super high activity high output driven can get a [ __ ] ton of [ __ ] done I also care so much about so many things that I I tend to stress more over stuff yeah and I'm super super
(14:53) distracted for the most part I can seem aloof and disinterested in a lot of small stuff which I think a different a different spouse might interpret that as Alex doesn't care about me I think Lea's just never done that it's just been like oh Alex just doesn't care about any of this stuff and that's not a reflection of his care for me it's just he just doesn't care he doesn't it's not even he doesn't care he just doesn't think about I always appreciate it was that L never tried to change me I think we seek each
(15:16) other's opinion on things because we respect each other's opinion not because we need the approval yeah here's one that you'll love how do you decide what to do when you wake up and start your deck try to get like the most important things done early I mean I usually work on the exact same thing for a very long time I spent a long time thinking about what one thing I'm going to do and then once I decide that that's the thing that makes the most sense from the most angles that'll give me the most leverage then that's what I do and then that's
(15:40) like my first six hours of every day and I've been doing that that habit of like the first six hours of every day is dedicated to the thing that matters most I've been doing for since I started working so I mean like a decade plus some people it's like late at night so I think it really just depends on who you are but for me I'm a first thing in the morning guys could either of you have achieved the success you have without one another yeah I think we could have I think it would have been harder and I think it would have taken longer and
(16:01) it's interesting cuz I think right now if I knew what I know now I could redo it and I think if you knew what you knew now you could redo it but to know what we know now I don't know how long it would have taken me to realize how important operations were culture people I would like I don't know like it would have been I was a hard cell seriously I was a hard cell yeah like I was a hard cell it it was very rare that I had somebody that I respected so much and who was so persistent for such a long time and had so much evidence behind
(16:30) them that eventually I realized that the way that I saw business in the world was not entirely true like there was more to the picture and so I think like knowing what I know now yes how would I have known what I know now I don't know finding the right business partner is difficult and so to say that you'll have the same amount of success I think at some point yes and you will find eventually a partner but like it is that's one of the hardest things I mean we see it in acquisition.
(16:56) comom when people apply all the time like often times the business business is not where it could be because the partnership is not right and that is just more often than not you can count on one hand the amount of good partners you have in your life you look at Charlie Munger and Warren Buffett like they found each other and we're like great this works we don't need anyone else we're just going to keep doing this and so like could Laya have found someone else absolutely could I find someone like Laya absolutely how long would have taken I
(17:16) don't know could I do it on my own absolutely not we had so much in common that we were like I don't know if we should date or be friends or whatever but like let's are we related yeah are we related you could be my sister what is your version of quality time with your partner as business owners what do you do when your partner wants to work and you want to spend time away from work for a bit wondering because my partner and I own companies and work a lot of the time I think that something that we've learned and I I at least I
(17:40) can speak for myself I have learned is that you can want something and also not get it and that is okay and there are many times in a relationship where maybe I'm because we tend to trade off Seasons where Alex has a really intense work season next season's Lea's really intense work season so we don't match up much and so so I might want to go do something with Alex for the entire day and also realize that I'm not going to get what I want and I've I've recognized with myself like in my young 20s like wanting something and being mad that you
(18:10) can't have it is a very childlike stance to take but we're adults so I can want that and accept that I'm not going to get it and do something else instead if there's a season where I have a day that's free and Alex doesn't I go do other things I make plans for myself I entertain myself I can still do things I like doing even though I prefer to do them with him I can accept that he's not in that season and the last thing I ever want to do is deter him from his goals and the things that make him happy and fulfilled at the end of the day and so I
(18:38) think it's understanding that you can want something and not get it and it's not a problem because there are many seasons where that's just life I want to emphasize lela's point which is that because we work in the same business we are almost always in a different season now sometimes we're both in a busy season but we're almost always one of us is and so I think we've just grown accustomed to the fact and we've shifted our expectations around what the other person must or should do in our relationship in order to be satisfied
(19:05) desire comes from a place of lack and so when you don't always get to see your spouse when you want to or get to spend time with them when you want to when you do it feels it's that much more fun it's that much more exciting it's that much more that you cherish it and I know for us as we've gotten bigger goals and we have more Demand on both of our plates and we're probably both in a really busy season right now the time that we do get together like even this last weekend we spent like an together and it was like
(19:30) just chilling together doing nothing it was like the highlight of my whole week and it felt better than it may have if that were like an everyday thing cuz then You' probably just get sick of each other I think it was Esther Perell wrote meeting in captivity which Lea read the book and then just told me what was in it but she said she said that you need to create space to be missed and I just love that B Nation what's up you guys are amazing we are Beyond grateful we don't feel like we deserve it but we are
(19:55) appreciative of all the support you guys have had over the last year and uh we can't wait to spend the next year with you keeping one of zero 2024

Transcript:
(00:00) my wife and i have built six multi-eight-figure companies in the last five years our current portfolio does about 85 million a year we run acquisition.com and i was interviewed recently for a segment on a two-hour long podcast and the segment that i want to show you is a really cool clip that we just talked about what it was like to literally build these companies together being married and the balance between work life and marriage all right so um like i said enjoy and i'll see you guys on the other side i mean a lot of people
(00:23) used to get on me about like you need more work-life balance like blah blah blah and it's just like i just like you have one life and they are your terms and no one else's terms and we optimize typically for the things that we enjoy doing and like if you have more stimulus from working than you do from not working then like work and then if you feel like at some point you have traded off something that you don't want to trade off for then you can adjust that's what i've always felt i enjoy working like what was it my mom so
(00:50) we have like a wedding to go to on the day after my birthday yeah so we were talking about you know we have to fly up on my birthday she's like oh we could do this on your birthday this is like no i just want to work she's like no but it's your birthday you shouldn't have to work and i was like i want to work yeah that's all i want to do i just want to work even uh santa monica my birthday i was like the only thing i want to do today is work that was it just wanted to work i mean everybody wants to they're like man do something
(01:14) do do something you love and you'll never work another day in your life but like it's just because everyone has this really poor definition of work but like if if you have accomplished that which obviously you have you're just living yeah and like what you do in life so i'll i'll rewind something really quickly which is like 2021 i did nothing i owned all the companies pounded out a lot of cash flow and i did nothing and it was a very miserable year for me because i tried to spend the money that i was making and i couldn't like it was just
(01:44) not even really a possibility and so like i got into a place of like why why am i even doing this like what's the point like i'll never even be able to spend this money that i have like why have i been doing all this stuff and in starting acquisition.com we're at least making that the sole focus now again and being able to build all the infrastructure you know hire the teams and all the stuff that we're doing on that side of the business like i have so much joy getting back into the game because i feel like i've been kind of
(02:06) like in a super high leverage position for like an extended period of time that i exited the business because i thought that was what the next natural step was supposed to be which is like you go from ceo to owning it as shareholder or board of directors whatever and that is very much what happened but i realized that for me at least it's like i work to create options not to not work and so a lot of people like they work really hard to not have to work later it's like no no it's like i work to have the option
(02:29) to work and so i can choose to work and that choice is the freedom that i have and so like if i'm choosing with the optionality that i have to work then that is exactly what i want to do just being on the other side of it of like going to the like there's literally no way i can spend this money for the rest of my life mountaintop like the only thing that i wanted to do was the thing that got me here which is like i love working and so it's the thing that i find meaningful and i think that maybe you shift direction in terms of like
(02:52) maybe some of the stuff that you create like maybe there's some things that you create that are for youtube versus like for gram and i just think that it just slowly optimizes to only doing things for gram which a lot of times still ends up being that but like you get there backwards yeah it's like if you made it purely for you then you might be able to make a video after that that's like i walked 300 miles and i didn't film anything and this is what i learned like that would probably be a really valuable video because you probably would have
(03:16) some interesting insights like i didn't film either of the grant cardone videos and then just made videos about the calls of like my takeaways and they were still really great videos interesting okay so my only thought to that is like you are in a very unique position because you run this business with your wife and and stuff like that and i think that marriage plays a big part in my life yeah and i think marriage is a compromise and so my my wife doesn't like it when i work as much and her i guess her her like love
(03:48) language is what quality time or whatever and i think graham his girlfriend macy is similar and i think that there's a compromise there where yes graham if all he wants to do is work that's great and he can work and work and work but i think that marriage a successful marriage is truly a compromise and if if it turns out that you know like like you're really good i have like so many thoughts right now yeah it's stimulating conversation and i think yeah and i think everybody's in a unique position because you know
(04:19) definitely like there's you you could say well you know i'm gonna grind away now so that you know i i don't have to work in the future we could spend time together or you can kind of balance and live in the now and live in the future but i think everybody's kind of in a unique position but i think that that part of your life is is is always going to be a compromise to some sort of extent so i think it's a belief that you choose to define it that way yeah i'm okay yeah i'm okay compromise is a belief statement like that's not a
(04:44) statement of fact that is a belief and so like i don't believe that marriage is compromised tell us your experience with that because i have uh because i'm sure we all have different experiences mine in the beginning was that i did find that there was a compromise because macy came from the mindset like you know five or six pm comes around uh you're done with work yeah and you're free and my mind works 24 7.
(05:04) uh i tried that and i woke up really early i'd wake up at like 5 a.m so i could be done by 5 p.m and the night and i that worked for actually quite a while because i actually found it was so productive in those morning hours that i could be done by five and be like oh wow this is great but over a long time trying to figure out like a like a balance i found myself i wasn't myself like i i was really i felt anxious i was just like uptight i was um like about what part like no because because i couldn't work during the hours
(05:32) that i wanted to work like sometimes just you just have this there's days where it's just like no no i'm so focused and i got it like you have that concentration you just have to continue and so having that freedom for me if i don't have that i just wasn't myself and i was miserable yeah what i'm going to say and i i have very strong views um and they are not common um but i also think that i don't want to live a common life and so that i cannot have common views so just like as a as a big disclaimer to that like i've only seen
(05:59) two dynamics that work in relationships over like an extended period of time one is kind of the like we're in it together and the other is like the you know cheerleader and quarterback cheering you on but the thing is is like i can tell i can speak a lot to the you know we're in the game together um for me i know personally like i had two very long relationships that were two liter dynamics and to me i could not imagine living life that way having now lived what i live now because like there's a certain amount of shared
(06:26) respect that you never get with somebody who does not know what it's like to be in the battlefield or in the arena and if i'm like i need to work for the next three days and like write five book chapters like there's not a discussion it's like of course do your thing there's no like there's no like i can't believe you're like uh and to the flip side in the cheerleader dynamic a cheerleader who's really rooting for the team doesn't ask the quarterback to come out when the game's on the line and so i think that a lot of
(06:50) people are running in what they consider to be cheerleader dynamics but they are inverted dynamics they're actually sabotaging the game i think that it's like in that dynamic it's harder in my opinion to do the cheerleader quarterback because you have to have a very aligned mission and goals of like the relationship it's easier to do that in the dynamic that you're working together because it's so clearly stated with the mission the goals of like this is where i want to go and this is how i want to get there and like you want to
(07:12) come with me and then you're very much operating on this shared sense of reality and it also becomes difficult for entrepreneurs in my opinion now like i mean i'm sure you've seen plenty people get divorces that they get older and whatnot is that like if you're like all right this will be interesting so typically when people become attracted so esther perel if you've heard of her she's really interesting like relationship person she's like one of the top ted talks on it there's i think it's called mating captivity is her book
(07:35) but in the beginning you have kind of this mystery because you don't know each other and that's what creates like the excitement right and as you get to know each other over time you swing like from uh mystery to familiarity right you get a little bit more security get to know each other better and it feels like more and more amazing and so what you do is you just keep trying to do that right but what's up happening is you over correct and then you become siblings and then it's like ah well that's not good and so it's not a problem to be solved
(07:57) but a a dichotomy to be managed right in terms of like how much space do you create versus how much familiarity what happens when people like entrepreneurs specifically like have their business and they have the wife they spend more time in the beginning and all of a sudden they don't spend as much time together and then they grow apart because they're also exposed to different stimuli right and so you adapt to the stimuli that you have then you grow apart on the flip side if you're in my scenario where we're like doing the same thing together
(08:21) the downside of this one these couples make five times more money than any of the other versions that i just said but the uh you can become too familiar and then you just become siblings so for us we actually create more space so it's like we try to work on separate sides of the house we don't attend the same meetings so like at the end of the day we can sit down at dinner like how was your day and you can tell me something rather than me saying like oh i was there i know right yeah and so the happiest couples are actually couples
(08:44) that have oh both have careers that are not necessarily together so on average these couples are the ones that because they have a shared goal in terms of this is what we want to do they have shared values in terms of how they want to get there and they respect one another and they respect each other's goals and then they walk kind of in parallel so you've got the like i'm working the entrepreneur and you've got the stay-at-home wife there's many times everyone's seen that one go wrong there's the like we're both working
(09:06) together in it where so these people have to uh correct for trying to create more familiarity these ones have to create more space so you have the space to be missed and then these ones tend to be in the middle already and so they just kind of like have to keep walking and so for me it was actually just interesting seeing the the different dynamics and like how we had to correct in the beginning like we were wait we spent all day every day together and the business was small so it was like she was there and i was here and we worked
(09:29) out together and we ate together and we did that for like two years and i was like you know maybe i'll sit on different meetings than you yeah but like seeing the level of like commitment and loyalty that you get from that and i don't know so i want a little bit of a tangent there but i i have strong beliefs around around that and i think that you don't have to compromise anything if you don't want to

The #1 Reason Young People Stay Poor - YouTube
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-wnnwCqGeNc

Transcript:
(00:00) 20 year olds stay poor because they start trying to earn rather than trying to learn they did a survey of high school seniors 52 believe that they will be a millionaire by 25. it's delusion you can try and roll the dice and have a one in a thousand shot of being a millionaire in 90 days or I can guarantee that you'll be a millionaire in a decade which would you prefer and so I want to give you a quick example of two guys about the same age that took two very different directions in life one of them went to another guy
(00:31) who was a little bit older tried to learn the basics of editing video use the Buddy to get a job interview and he'd learned enough that he could get a job offer this particular company had a huge Suite of other people who significantly more advanced creative director who's done multiple big brands that he had the ability to learn from he gets a sixty thousand dollar offer which is a solid amount of money for editing with basically no experience who then rather than accept the job he asked for three thousand dollars more because what
(00:58) he thought he had to do was earn rather than learn the business is obviously not going to do that what this guy does is he starts trying to negotiate back and forth Wheels and Deals and then eventually gets a job to be the lead head honcho of video editing at some small business that has no other mentors there's no other people ahead of him he took the right hook in his career 12 weeks after getting into it and now they are the ones who are trying to extract as much from him rather than coming into a business where he's the small man on
(01:27) the totem pole and he can learn from everyone else which would maximize for his long-term net worth when you're early on you learn this much and you think you know everything and it's something called the dunning-kruger effect the more you learn in a specific skill the more you realize you don't know other guy same idea wanted to make money but had zero skills because he's 17 years old of course you would have no skills he decided because he talked to a mentor who's older than him and said hey I think you have a proclivity for sales
(01:53) I think you'd be good at he said whatever the minimum quota is that they tell you to do an activity double it this was a sales role and so he was required to do 100 calls a day he did 200 calls a day why because he's not a skill so he has to do twice the work in order to get the same output as somebody who's more experienced the mentor also said go and spend as much time as you possibly can with the number one guy listen to everything he does and watch what he does that's what he did and then he proved himself as number one on that
(02:16) bottom team then he got promoted he's the youngest guy there worked as well what he realized was that no one was going to give him respect based on his age Stacks his way up stacked his way up then became one of the top closers in the company where many people were experts at sales and he was able to learn from them because he was hungry and he did extra hours now at this point in his career he could right now probably start a million dollar your business or he could reinvest and so he got another opportunity to work at a
(02:42) much more prestigious company where he'll get even bigger and better experience and guess what he's going to get paid less than he was making at his current job why would he do it because he's smart not thinking short if you go for the earning early you stop the learning and the moment you stop the learning is when you decide and you tell the universe that I have made enough this is enough for me start at the bottom and learn every skill along the way Kobe Bryant was famous for doing this where he would do two practices a day my
(03:10) name is Kobe Bryant 17 years old Fridays and Saturdays I would go in my rec room with my basketball and basically dribble myself to sleep I think that that was the best thing that could ever happen to me because during those lonely hours in the rap room I discovered the hunger the motivation and the desire to be the best possible basketball player that I could be and he thought if everybody else does one practice today if I do two a day I will get better faster and in the beginning the difference is not that
(03:36) noticeable but after five years and then 10 years he becomes unbeatable whether you're trying to get into law or you're trying to get into accounting or you're trying to get into sales or you're trying to get into marketing whatever the core activity that you do making videos making ads writing sales Pages actually doing sales calls whatever it is if you do two times or four times the volume you will get better faster and pay down your ignorance debt at a faster rate that compounds he has compounded the number of hours in the trenches
(04:02) learning the thing respect is always earned and the Younger You are the more you have to earn it and you can either resent the world for not giving you respect that you do not deserve or you can go get it hustle across age gender culture is always respected it's one of the universal currencies respect but the problem is that people want the respect before they do the hospital what the killers look like in their 20s who become the killers in their 30s don't look like the kid with the lambo on the watch what they look like is hungry as
(04:32) [ __ ] to learn and work if you can humble yourself and you realize the dunning-kruger effect exists that you think you know more than you do when you start because you don't know anything that's why Socrates said The more I know the more I realize I know nothing one of the smartest wisest people in the world says he knew nothing I'm gonna flip to my employer hat for a second if someone comes in if they're in the earnings season I will work you because I know that this is the only exchange if you come in and I know
(04:57) you're in a learning season then we will be so generous with how much we can give and reinvest in you the exchange when you're coming in and I have to pay you above to get you to come here means that I have to extract more value from you than I pay you that's the fundamental of business but if you come in with a learning hat on then that business owner understands that maybe in five years you're not going to be there they can be like cool how can I assist you in your career what skill sets do you feel like you lack I can pair you with people in
(05:20) the company who are further ahead in you and help you get mentorship within our company and you learn for free and not only that I'm going to pay you to learn so the most important thing you have to realize when you're in your 20s is what season you are in you have to stop comparing yourself to people who are earning more than you because it means that what they're doing is often shortchanging their long-term earning for short-term earning there is a time for the earning but the moment that you decide to make that Red Hook it's going
(05:44) to be hard to come back because you're going to earn more and you decide that from here on out you can't really learn much from people ahead of you because they're not going to give to you the same way you would if you were in their business your ability to provide value will compound with time especially as you start pairing skills if you think about Jay-Z in the beginning of his career the first thing he did was he learned how to rap it's JT's a bad thing your time after bigger the right Master bigger than that Jay-Z rap so you can say y'all
(06:12) support line and then he started learning how to promote another skill significantly more money and then after that figured out how to do a record label and distribute even more money and then after that he figured out how to recruit other artists and get them sound on his label even more money and so what happens is that he still needs these early skill sets even though he didn't monetize them hard there he monetized them big later skills will compound if you have one plus one plus one it doesn't equal three when it comes to
(06:38) skills if you are good at math cool if you learn bookkeeping a little bit more if you learn how to become an accountant even more if you start understanding taxes and insurance all of a sudden you're a CFO now if you start understanding M A and mergers entity structures all of a sudden you're not only a CFO you are a Rainmaker you're somebody you can bring in deals execute deals Etc the earning potential difference between somebody who's an accountant and a Rainmaker is tens of millions of dollars per year so one of
(07:03) my heroes Warren Buffett he finished top of his class at Columbia business school somebody finished his top of their class at Columbia can get a job paying very well in most places but guess what he did he asked Ben Graham to let him work at his investment firm for free Ben Graham was one of the goats of investing at the time when Warren Buffett was just a kid coming out of college a chance to study under him it shaped my professional life and guess what Ben Graham said to him when he asked him to work for him he said you're overpriced
(07:32) Ben Graham knew just as Warren Buffett knew that even though he was working for free it was going to cost Ben Graham Moore to deliver all of the skills and all of the things that he would need to be successful than the monetary compensation but because Warren Buffett is smart he realized that he was in a season of learning and not earning it he was willing to invest as one of the greatest investors of all time in the thing that was most important and valuable to him at the time himself and he did it for free
(07:59) I'm gonna flip this real quick and tell you a little bit on my own story people know this I finished Magnum [ __ ] Laude in three years at Vanderbilt I could earn a decent amount of money at most places graduating like that I then took a consulting job that was paid less than most of my other people were because I could work directly with the CEO and so I was going to learn more I then gave up on the Consulting career to do Fitness the first move I made is I asked 40 different gym owners if I could work for
(08:24) them for free mind you I was a magna [ __ ] laude graduate vice president of the powerlifting team I was president of the fraternity came from a Consulting background like I had a lot of skills but I realized that I was going to be getting more out of the exchange than the person who I was working for and so I asked to work for free he started to employ me and he eventually started paying me minimum wage I would have to swallow my pride in order to take that job but it was one of the best investments I ever made and rather than
(08:50) compare myself to the people who were earning more than me and I'm gonna be real with you I did and it hurt but if you learn from one of the best in the industry if anything you should be paying them and the fact that they will accept you at any price is worth it every time it would be like me going to Elon Musk and saying I'll be your assistant he offers me a hundred thousand dollars a year Alex I would like to offer you one hundred thousand dollars per year to be my assistant and me being like I'll come for 200.
(09:14) actually you're stupid never mind think about how stupid that is that's the decision 20 year olds make every day I'm hoping that MOSI Nation you aren't like that you're willing to make the long-term trade because when you have this track record this stack of undeniable proof that you are who you say you are you have done what you say you've done you don't need to pretend you don't need to front because you have the experience and then people will respect you because of what you have done not what you say

My Full Body Workout (with Chris Williamson) - YouTube

Transcript:
(00:00) what's the theory behind starting a second C second at Big Cat of course how could I how could I [Music] [Applause] forget I have started with calvs for more than 10 years now uh straight and the reason for that is because calvs are my weakest body part uh in terms of like proportions isn't this nice it's something it's meant for two it is kind of cute system it is kind of cute yeah that's great so I actually train my body in reverse order of weakness wouldn't advise it like my reverse order of my like worst body part to best body part
(00:40) okay if you go ground up legs Wise It's like your calves are nice and warm and then I do hamstrings next yep and so our knee joint's going to be like nice and loed up so that when I actually do a leg move I feel pretty good when I put them first and then I doubled the amount of volume and I did them in every workout rather than like two times a week um that's when my Cal started to really grow I think that there's something definitely underrated about starting a session with a real low investment movement it's like no one's ever going to say no to another set of car phrases
(01:12) I really don't want to train today yeah well stand on the edge of this thing you're actually converting me you're actually converting me I mean like I've been doing this for 20 years so like like i' I've done iterations I've been doing this for 10 like I haven't I haven't changed it cuz it's like it's right I've had say that you do just one body part each session M and just consistently get volume in is that still the same 100% I don't think that many people have the same approach to training that Alex does not many people begin their workout with like a 100 repetitions on Cs and
(01:48) not many people do the exact same routine every single session full body have you ever ever had any temptation to do a different training modality uh functional thing in Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu thing CrossFit thing nope no design none I did my my experimentation way earlier like when I was in my like 20s I was like I'll try CrossFit it I did all body weight for 6 months I did only swimming you know what I mean um I did only CLE Bells I did that per year I didn't know anything so I started from absolute ignorance and so I would read these
(02:23) sales letters for like kettle bells and I'd be like oh kettle bells are what I need to do and then I'd read a new ebook about like how body weight training was like the new thing and I would just do body weight stuff and then I'd read about isometrics is actually where you can get the most strength and I would do that and so I I did all sorts of programs and methodologies uh for a while before I kind of like actually learned the few things that matter I wanted Max Muscle uh least headache I train full body every day so like body composition Wise It's the best
(02:55) for me I can do supet so I don't have to do cardio oh and you gain the most muscle so like why would I want anything that's not the most muscle yep and that works for me good but hamstrings after this will feel great yeah cuz your calvs always get involved in hamstrings so it's like prefatigue the calvs and then it'll only be hamstrings yes pref faue calvs and hams and it'll only be quads right yep very nice ham chop you want to do seated or lying we'll do seated chop no I would always if I was ever doing
(03:33) seated hamstring curls I would always superet them with uh like extensions always because for me I'm like why wouldn't I why wouldn't I why wouldn't you well why wouldn't I cuz then I'll be out of breath but I thought that the super sets I thought super sets were cardio if I was trying to get in better shape today's not cardio day in between sets is is is camera time understood and when camera's not here it's rest time why Lean Forward you'll see so lock it down as much as hard as you can on your knees like extra there you go so lean forward and put your
(04:15) chest up see the stretch now leaning forward even more yeah arch your arch your chest more so the stretch of your hamstring to catch you there you go it stretches the out of it like this and then also keeps tension the whole time on your hamstring yep so you don't have any rest whereas if you're back here right you're now yeah yep it's way pumpy that way but this made this like got my hamstring so much better than leaning back yep Big Stretch big squeeze Big Stretch big squeeze multiple gym memberships within the same city so good because you get
(04:52) sick of training in one place or you're in a different vibe kind of the same as the working thing at the desk change your environment yeah so if I need to prep for a guest I go to Gold South Central it's nice and quiet no one ever hassles me if you want to get session in with the boys there's a spit and swust indoor outdoor thing that's really cool and then if we want to do some functional classes on it got a gym really [Music] good good man o ymy YY if you really want to with yourself Point your toes forward now try it oh
(05:35) that's awful oh cuz it shows you how much your cap gets involved yeah you flex your cap can't use it yeah it's crazy how many variants there can be of one movement where you think I'm totally locked in but then if I go here and then if I go here but then if I don't go here totally different yeah crazy it's actually a cool mechanical drop set that way so you start with your toes out yep and then you basically go neutral EAS yep yep yep but I usually just go limp feet so like not this way which still helps you
(06:09) y this way like which takes it all out I just go neutral dangly dangly feet dangly feet I've always preferred training with a partner I think especially after a long time in the gym a decade and a bit you end up just running out of juice I just don't have all that much motivation when I'm on my own I'll go in and I'll go through the motions but if I'm going to push myself even remotely hard I need someone else there or else you end up scrolling Doom scrolling on your phone or getting distracted by emails or
(06:40) something what yeah [Music] boy it's funny cuz people in the gym are going to think we're Fitness influencers but we're not all of these videos have got nothing to do with the Fitness in fact the fitness is just a break from recording content yeah shouldn't they be in better shape why aren't they bigger I ask myself that every day why isn't he wearing a supplement company's apparel what's he acquiring yeah what is he acquiring isn't he acquired any muscle yeah why you acquire some gains bro it's like ideally you want to walk it like right above your kneecap yes and then it stabilizes the joint
(07:36) come on dude yep all right that's it for me that cool that cool this is one of those machines where three plates could be impossible or three plates could be absolutely nothing yeah it'll be between those two extremes that's my promise oh feel can you try and touch your hamstring to your butt now there's a little bit of rainy SL I think he's a little puffed up K we tell you about this so I'm trying to make puffy a thing yeah yeah I'm all puffed up oh my legs are all puffed right now o how many vest Brands did you need to
(08:34) go through before you decided on the one that every acquisition doc thing is printed on you mean this uh particular vests yeah tank top okay yeah yeah yeah um probably 30 or 40 okay yeah what were the most common problems that you encountered with other vests if you get 10 mediums and they fit different there's not consistency there it's one two they shrink differently where am I here here and then that out yeah this turns out and then hands here different ones shrink at different uh sizes when you wash yep um some of them were like too thin up top or too
(09:11) thick up top yep some of them would Bunch so it kind of like float like this above the actual softness of the of the shirt cuz sometimes it's just like it just feels like paper so I look for like softness oh too thick I guess yeah and then some of them don't stretch at all so I need a little bit like elastic in it so it shows all the good hides all the bad you know what I'm saying um those are the big I actually have a list on my phone for like all the things I was rating them on but those are off the
(09:39) top of my head good I'm still not done my shoe test I'm on like shoe number probably 50 and what is it that you uh a lot shoes are the toughest by far you think it has to be able to get me into a nice establishment yep I have to be able to work out in it yep it has to be able to get wet cuz I don't want to have like a different shoe when I'm traveling that gets wet y my feet Can't Sweat in it and they can't smell over time yeah that's hard and you don't wear socks I don't wear socks yeah that's difficult I mean that's a high B just that just that is a
(10:09) high B yep yep and I be able to work out with him like doing calf raises and also like and I have to be able to walk in them with no like blisters anywhere yep and I walk an hour every day are you puffy puffy I'm very puffy okay good would you be able to get into a nice establishment in in those trainers do you think yeah the only thing I've ever seen at the nicest places is no sandals it's just too many Rich guys where yeah normal you of the red sneaker effect right what uh there was a study done at a conference
(10:42) with businessmen and they tried to quantify the objective metrics of how smart somebody dressed and there was an inverse correlation between the smartness of dress and the net worth or the job title that this person had so it's the people who had dressed down the most that had the most wealth checks out counter signaling is a hell of a drug man I mean usually I try and rest as little as I can between sets that's the strange thing about training with a partner even though you have to wait for someone else to finish that set yeah you you rest less you rest less because you've got uh
(11:23) cuz you're not on your pH timer and the timer is the other person's set I'm about 50/50 uh in terms of whether I train with people or not uh there are seasons where I like find somebody that like we have a times that work out for a season and I work out with them and then there's times when my schedule's kind of crazy and I just get workouts when I can um I would say that I far prefer working out with other people whenever I can just because I I train harder I train longer I do more sets I probably do better form um and I
(11:51) and I I just in general work out harder and longer when I have other people around me yes like Optimal two to one yeah I would say that that's probably not and that's exactly what it is it's two two parts rest for one part lifting I would say there's two different types of training sessions so there's like a training session where you're like going in there to die and remove your own soul and look at it like deep into its own eyes and then put it back into yourself um and then there's training sessions
(12:14) where it's like I would say a more social training session uh and to me that was like a more social training session so I still got a workout in but like I wasn't dying if you want sneaky cardio 90 minutes of pickle B is 1,000 calories it's insane and you don't even think you're just like you're just chasing a ball you're not doing cardio you're chasing a ball a, calories on a concept 2 ski or or something miserable yeah my dear hell so that goes to what Trevor was talking about where the people who are the quote most disciplined aren't actually more
(12:48) disciplined they figure out something to do in the meantime so it's like you did the same cardio as the guy on the ski he gets off he's like I'm so disciplined and to you it didn't feel like discip yeah like the opposite right so I think like their in lines are pretty big find # find your pickle ball find your pickle ball and then get puffy on it I I don't stop trying to make puffy a thing Puffy's not going to be a thing oh it's going to be huge big puff Chris and I have a good Dynamic um on the podcast
(13:19) and off the podcast I think we um very bro talk uh so it we keep it light which is nice because you know life can be really serious all the time and it's it's ironic because he has a podcast on like wisdom and deep philosophical things and it'd be really easy to take yourself seriously and I'm glad that he doesn't and uh and he can talk with me what say you think we'll do one more just in case you know the rule if you have to ask if you have if you have another set left you got a do another set what if you more more ear you want me to see there yeah because
(14:01) the machine Mak go up yeah so if your feet are too much well and up that's going to push you up so like you go more wide just like this and more wide you're going to be more a to fill all this part made for all right that's what we're doing little bit more high and more white too this the corner yeah all right here yeah o all that doctor yeah all right open this yeah yes yeah I see one [Music] more yep [Music] yep hey why you got to listen to Pros baby the greatest hack of all time whether it's bodybuilding or business is getting
(15:03) with people who are far ahead of you um I mean almost all of the periods of my life where I had huge changes or improvements in my physique was when I had people who were better than me giving me Insight because the thing is it's like you can learn a certain amount but like if someone has a decade of experience on something and then they can just immediately spot like even if you're a video editor someone like oh dude you missed this you like they they have more context to give you advice um and it's invaluable which is why I've I've tried to buy any experience I can
(15:33) from anybody who's willing to sell it to me I'd rather get the lesson without the scar all right let's shoulders yeah there nice seated yes oh yeah the uh post quad stretch for Max pump brutal my quads are on fire right now what's the keys here any oh so do this right before we start your shoulders like forward not back forward so you where do you want to have them sit as far out as you can yep got you okay nice most be a smaller metor and rear ads so I pretty much just exclusively train medial and rear not even train front not my deficiency not my
(16:22) constraint not my [Music] problem [Music] come on yep so I would like to enter into your shoe rotation Van's old school comfy Kush but I think them today I think they fail on smell yeah and I think that they fail on getting wet it depends on how wet wet From Below fine wet from above not good so they have a new one that came out that has cork bottom and it's mesh on top so it's meshy like this oh I've seen them they're called like the move I was wearing them today underneath the table I didn't no I didn't notice good so far they they haven't failed any tests but these are better to work out in got you slip on
(17:14) slip off if you've got a shoe horn shoehorn no you're red pill on shoe horn no come on you ever have to fight to put your shoes on these are stretchy but what about the vans that was a downside for them I wasn't a Fanon and you bypassed that's expanded your choice it has landscape by having a shoe on I usually only do slip on slip off how much do you value the skin on the back of your thumb probably quite highly I would imagine extremely high yeah arguably the highest skin most valuable skin really oh yeah really think about ah lots of people in America are circumcised AR they I
(17:48) forget yeah I'm probably the only person in this building with a four skin that's C we'll cut that one from the re just like he got see what it did there question for you yes who's your favorite person to interview who's the F your favorite interviewer interviewers Rogan the guy is so good it's all about people from the outside will see someone that's got a very successful platform but his use of cadence and silence in a conversation is unbelievable I thought I've worked very hard at this done 600 episodes I get to S sit down with this guy and it's like being a a black belt and going no I
(18:32) get to roll with the seventh Dan let's see how good he actually is and you're like what the was that very very very impressive like super impressive interviewer that's cool terms of people to interview one person that I love consistently is Rory suland oh okayy he's so fun super easy very knowledgeable very knowledgeable um something about seeing a guy double fisting Vapes throughout the entire episode one of which is on a rope around his neck so he'll have one on a rope around his neck so it's never more than
(19:01) a foot and a half from his mouth at any one time and uh Stills legendary how's this feel shorer wise good yeah that's good it's a a quite a weak angle like you know if you were here you'd be way way way stronger but it feels like it's that kind of um given that you've done 3,500 hours yeah of writing yeah what are the main principles that you rely on to remove friction from the writing process what are the water desk setup time like well not everything and in terms of like the writing got it um I mean I I pretty much
(19:44) just write the same time every day which is when I wake up and then I write till noon and that's basically the only thing I don't do anything else yep but you're using I saw you use nicotine today during the podcast I did that all time though so that's not equal opportunity very good je it's task independent yeah yeah so I guess the lesson from that nicotine a global reward what's that it's a global reward you can do you can use it to reward anything something tells me that you and Rory are aligned on this come
(20:17) [Music] on oh cheeky little drop set go on then yeah cheeky little drop set oh there it is get those so the rule is sit down and write that's the rule it's not even a rule that's just like when I do it no but that's your strategy your strategy is sit down and write I'll say this my strategy is do the thing that's most important first okay and for now it's writing and then it'll be something else later yep so that that's my I would say the macro calendar is the bigger thing I don't take meetings until noon or 1 and
(20:54) then that first slot gets switched out with whatever the priority is yep understood do you take a break during writing during that 6- hour block to have like a shake yep half the time I do it while I'm writing half the time I take a break if I need it yep okay but not long 15 minutes interesting was it more difficult before you were in the editing phase in that there's a maximum number of ideas per minute that you can put out onto paper so you have to kind of sit and think what I'm actually trying to do or say here I say it's more
(21:24) phases so it was more like figuring out what I'm going to say first that's what the longest then was writing it which took which was the easiest yep and then basically taking what I wrote cutting out half of it filling in the other half cutting half of it again filling in the next half cut it just basically just continue to just compact compact compact compact the book's probably 270 pages but it got compressed from 1 th000 plus yep and just like the rule is always like if we read two sentences is and if we only read one of them it still meant
(22:01) the same thing one of them is not required and we just do that over and over and over again yep so that my hope is that the whole book is literally tweet after tweet after tweet for 300 Pages you read the almanak of Nal rabant yeah yeah kind of like that right very dense High signal to noise this one's going to be a bear cuz it's basically like eight books in one which sounds ridiculous to say but like it shows how to do warm Outreach cold Outreach post content run ads hire agencies hire hire recruit train train
(22:32) manage employees build uh affiliate programs build referral systems in one book and so like each one of those 25 to 30 pages was probably like a 150 page relevant book yes that just got squeezed until there was nothing left we could cut and it's like if you read this you will know how to set up Affiliates if you read this you know how to set up a referral system if you read this you know how to get your first five clients for more rage outs if you read this you know how to post content to get customers was there anything that you had to write that you didn't know um yeah all the time I have
(23:04) like my best ideas of like this it's usually I start with anecdote of like this is what we did this is what worked well and then that's what Trevor and I will beat up until we're like what are the principles behind a good referral system and then one doesn't and then we'll try and break it and be like all right was the one that worked that didn't have those things and we just that process is what takes the longest yep because we want it to be valid yep and that's the hard part yes cuz it's very like every marketer has their
(23:28) system in their head and they write it down and they send it but you can immediately break it which is why it's not valid which is why it doesn't get shared why it doesn't become Canon so the goal was like if I can make something that no one can disprove then they become Canon and people can use it so first one was offers yep second one's leads leads third one is fourth one is I have a couple ideas but for now the next book cool there'll be more yep all right um last set one more all right if you have to ask all right we'll do um
(23:58) we'll do a double drop okay so go 10 10 10 cool all right yeah I think that was what I was trying to get at today with that bridge between the philosophy and the applicability yeah and that because in the world of business a great philosophy that doesn't make money doesn't matter doesn't matter yeah the validity of the model is how much money you make correct right which means that a beautifully sounding theory that isn't effective in the real world is pointless ah so everything that you're talking about has being stress
(24:35) tested well we just start with what worked and then we try and figure out what makes it work always yeah so it's like Affiliates we're like how much do we pay them on what Cadence and do we have tears and what do they have to do to earn the tears yep how do we activate them how do we get them to keep marketing [Music] so this will just bother all the fitness people but I try and do as many perfect reps as I can and then I try and do as many imperfect reps as I can and people are like isn't that going
(25:18) to only strengthen a certain range how I see it is I fatigue all the stuff that I can at max range and then I keep going until I fatigue the stuff I can do partial range so just for me it kills it more and I get more volume in per set I'm definitely not an expert but for me once I'm here this is the end of my delt as I feel it everything above that for me is trap and I get these crazy pains in my neck so I have a nice stop sign CU I feel a shooting pain but for me I can just do this and know that that's the
(25:48) end of my delt and so that's the range I train but plenty of people disagree with me and they're probably rip and smarter I think it was I think this was like when I was training classes at Huntington Beach this was a hot song so I heard it like 40 times a day I'm sure when you were clubbing there's just songs like umbrella correct right correct given that I listen mostly to either like British rap or metal neither of which get played in nightclubs all that much I knew the words to every single song that was in the top 40 for a decade and a half what of metal all
(26:29) sorts dude Bring Me The Horizon what about hard or dad metal what hard or dad metal Dad no not Dad metal give me a break this one arm yeah one arm yep I trying to lean my hip out so you get a bigger stretch you'll see are you on under yeah I'm under under here here here yeah and then just wedge yourself yeah you know you asked me earlier about do I remember this name of the song that was playing yeah I don't know the name of any song Like lyrics for sure it's kind of a crazy claim I don't know the name of any song I'll say it this way like me recognizing a song by name is very hard for me and I listen to
(27:16) that for what do you think that says about you I have very bad audio memory my wife will attest to that wouldn't it be great if you have absolutely great audio memory and forgetting all of these song names it's just one long troll really bought in keep saying forgets the name of Rihanna the only song that I know the full lyrics to was one that I had to write out in seventh grade they were trying to teach poetry and they're basically saying look songs are poems like you know whatever and so I remember the eve6 song that I wrote down and that was it and there was like
(27:53) you had to find similes and metaphors like in the in the thing wow that's it this the only one I know the lyrics though cuz I I could read it funny come [Music] on there you [Music] go I actually think that this bag is a very good physical representation of your life philosophy I think it's incredibly transactional it's like just does the thing even if it's not what it was designed for it actually does it better than something else might do it again just stinks of horoi doesn't it absolutely reeks of horoi um zero
(28:54) Aesthetics uh very functional uh odd it completely disregards convention how many things did you go through before you tried this oh plenty yeah different types of bags different types of setup rolly bag and you settled on that a workman's bag yeah also lasts forever but it still had a bunch of issues with it so I ended up modifying a bunch uh to the bag like cutting things off and like moving stuff around um but what I have now is the best you know gym bag that I know of and uh it kills yeah midback smokes
(29:34) it oh uh other things that I've had to learn since I've been in America biscuit uh isn't a biscuit no not a thing biscuits a cookie for dogs biscuit is like a scone that goes on the side of beef yeah at Cracker Barrel yeah piece of bread yeah Fu a piece of bread chips or it's a dog biscuit in which case it's a treat for a dog fine yeah chips me like thick french fries yeah they're not no very difficult assimilating into this new culture has been incredibly difficult for me and I spent Fourth of July here which was emotionally quite a
(30:12) tough day yeah anyone comment uh I wore a t-shirt that said uh happy treas and day ungrateful colonists yeah yeah um was it and then people were like winers right history do you see any backtack world war Champs no that's funny yep [Music] yep oh yeah oh that smokes is one of the problems of training with Alex somebody who has a very dialed in gym routine that for him he doesn't train his chest doesn't train his chest because he says his chest doesn't need to grow anymore some of us don't have that problem might have been nice to done some chest today but look and I'm in his
(31:08) town for the back titties the back titties it's a big back back puff big back puff oh stop trying to make puff happen Puffy's going to be huge stay puffy all right make sure that chap sticks nice and secure in case something traumatic happens during these Bice that's the that's my sunstream that oh see interesting yeah and here look you see the pocket for it on the side oh no meant for it it's meant to be all right so I just move them forward like 2 in and then you get the full stretch yeah it's just significantly harder and you get a mean Pump am I doing it
(32:05) right doesn't give a he's busy it's like I'm busy being bigger than busy being massive am I doing it Sor come on here yeah yeah right there tight did before you go fight up woo spicy very spicy that's right kale who's bigger am I bigger am I bigger I don't know I don't think I get my leg up they have good legs Bo just because
(33:14) normally you have more water on the L Body theer more what you have more water the theer don't [Laughter] do all right so how do you how do you not stay egotistical if people bigger than you I feel like that's like a perfect microcosm of what we're talking about yep corre correct [Music] correct come on just catches up come on come on oh yeah 20 lbs never felt so heavy it oh yeah humbling oh yeah it's just not heavy enough at that cuz like you can do adult raise with 20 so like this angle it's like not that
(34:24) bad there you go back more there it is money reps okay yep must be nice like I live for the day when fashion has developed enough for guys that I just need to wear a single piece of material in the gym I I hardcore considered it overalls cuz then it would like eliminate so many things from my life I mean if you if you had I kill the only thing so I'd have to find what do you call the uh the girl version of that a romper yeah it' have to be a jean Romper cuz I want the short version I
(35:35) don't want the I get hot I give a go Lea would probably Revolt but I would continue anyways because she's more attracted to the fact and I what she thinks that's a really interesting point it's an interesting point that something that your wife would prefer you doing is less attractive than you not doing the thing that she would prefer you doing because of what it means to her yes correct correct just preaching the gospel here of personal of personal uh personal brand what we call it personal identity there you go PR brand
(36:10) of authenticity it's like the inverse of the test you know like test so  test was this thing that came up during pick aarts history that girls would like give you a a challenge of some kind or I bet you're not actually that strong in the gym or I bet you don't actually have that job I bet you don't drive whatever the whatever the thing and that was a test yeah and it was uh the same way that some female frogs will uh fight with males to test their strength before they actually decide to sleep with them okay and uh would be like I'm ready this feels
(36:43) like the reverse of that this is like she's she's testing you but the actual outcome that's optimal for attraction is you you reject her you reject the test entirely yeah you punk the game yeah cuz I feel like I was thinking I was like what would I say if some girl was like you really don't make what you say you make I'd be like okay I just like be like I'm sure you have somewhere I probably wouldn't even say that I would just say okay and keep talking to whoever I was talking come on dud I just love these reps they just feel so
(37:17) good come [Music] on oh yeah there it is big squeeze the largest squeeze dude I'm getting puppy I can feel it my arms are puffed I'm like 3/4 puffed not full puffed this is a public service announcement Alex stop trying to make puffy a thing it's never going to be a thing and it makes me uncomfortable every time that I hear you say it can't even push back back against it you're like what are you pushing back against I'm like well pushing back against you're saying that word what word yeah the p word yeah don't say the p
(38:08) word there you go all right let's put these back we'll do some tryceratops so fun fact I tweaked the out of my tricep like two months ago and then rather than take off I just went to the lowest weight I could on this machine because this is the machine I tweaked it on and then I've just been adding 10 lbs every week and now I I'm like back and it doesn't hurt it's the best way I know how to rebap keep moving but keep moving light just basically keep dropping the weight until it does like whatever the thing you hurt it on it's kind of like with
(38:53) gymnast they tell him to get right back on the pommer horse if you fall off so you don't like get up in the head about it so I hurt myself on this machine and then I dropped it down to like the lowest thing I do that didn't hurt and then I just add it back rather than being like Oh I'm going take like two months off or whatever I just came right back and did the lowest weight I could without it hurting so you like this it's a little lad at the top from that that boy is a little yeah I just try to maximize whatever the my angle of the like when to squeeze this it's not
(39:24) like cuz obviously you could do this yeah but it'd be weird in my opion yeah yeah it's more like how can I keep this angle as as acute as possible and then get it a lot of stuff on like warm-ups is not like super definitive it's like stretching there's like Bodies of Evidence on both sides that like doesn't help prevent injury blah blah blah so like I think it's more about warming core temperature rather than like each specific movement so that's why I do CS first cuz I get warm another reason I do CS first the Bulgarian Olympic team never warmed up they went straight to
(40:04) squats now it's more Testament to the fact that they pick the right people who wouldn't get injured training that way correct than it is a measure that that training is effective so here's something that's interesting a question that I had for you that's more about how you guys work with acquisition.
(40:22) there's a very common strategy that people use when it comes to growing a business that's in that kind of region yeah which is is bring somebody on board and then apply ungodly amounts of pressure to the founder just lean on the founder like and the presumption is that they're either going to crush under the pressure and if they manage to stick about the business by design has made three years of growth in one year what do you think about that approach I think it's actually dictated by the returns they promis limited partners more so than it's basically like we have to deliver these returns in 5 years the only way for that to happen
(40:55) with a VC model which is usually the ones that do that are that they have to spray and prey on 50 Investments knowing that one's going 100x and cover the whole portfolio in terms of returns and they can afford to have lots of losses so what's different with what you're doing we don't really think any of them are going to think any of them are 100x but it's not the model we don't we're not like a tech primary investor like we're much more what I would call everyday businesses like mortgage sales photography shops you know what I mean just normal businesses Insurance like that and uh for us I would rather
(41:27) have all of our businesses triple over 5 years get same or better returns than those guys do and not burn 49 relationships both work financially it's just also like how you want to live life and we are also like we're growth Partners but a lot of businesses don't require a win or take all model like Facebook one guy was going to get the whole social network so you have to do it that way but like mortgage sales one guy doesn't like there's no advantage to you're not going to take the mortgage sales Market you'll just keep gnawing away at it and there's
(42:02) a lot of businesses that if they didn't have that forced pressure would otherwise be good businesses even if they don't have an enormous Tam they can still generate really good returns not 100x returns but you could get a 10x and I'd rather take a 10x when I can get it than force a 100x and lose a 10x you know in the process given that you do full body every day do you cycle different exercises across the week not a fun do you do them across periods I train the same body parts every day y we did hip thing today if I'm feeling it I'll do that for a little
(42:37) bit if I'm not feeling it one day i' do a different leg exercise I just don't have a lot of rules but my point being that given that you want a well-rounded physique yeah for instance if you were to continue to do this you're never actually going to yeah I use like when I do back my break Alice gets hit yep and I will without trying overtime cycle things in and if I ever identify that I have a weakness like a clear visual weakness then that moves up in the workout like I'll I'll really prioritize otherwise I'm also kind of at like the point in my care like I'm not really going to gain any
(43:13) more muscle so it's just like I stimulate that keeps what I've got try not to hurt myself do that hopefully until I die that's my perspective how's your dad built physically uh like me but doesn't have like yeah yeah muscle muscle but you think you had a good genetic base yeah I think um so I was I heard about this from Greg Knuckles big big lifting guy some people who are who are naturally like big and muscular have low potential for growth but have a high Baseline yep some guys have huge growth potential but are tiny dudes genetically
(43:50) so people see people they're like dude that guy's a house like if he actually lifted but they're completely separate jeans interesting stay puffy

Transcript:
(00:00) like why does life need to be meaningful it doesn't I mean a lot of Olympians have huge depression after they get a gold because now what like of course if doesn't make you happy you suck at it on the dayto day like what is that that make you feel happy well right off the bat I don't optimize for subjective well-being I do that more for the audience I that's never been a goal of mine um I think when I was 19 or 20 I said happiness and I've pretty much stuck with that um there's two two concepts I'll I'll
(00:29) I'll bring up on this so one is people who want to be happy treat it like I want to eat so good I'm never hungry again or I want to sleep so well I never need to sleep again but I think happiness is is much more like that than it is this this achievement thing that you like check a box off it doesn't really work that way secondly I think that all the people that I know who obsess about happiness are the least happy people outwardly sure but they're the ones who are like committing suicide I I worry about that because that it's a goal that
(01:08) by having it as a goal it automatically sits outside of you which means there's space between you and the goal which means you're not actually happy my goal is to be happy which means you aren't right now so I have made meaning which is ironic because I don't find things inherently meaningful but I have F I have found meaningful work as I deem meaningful um to be the thing that I derive the most Joy from and so I have it broken down to a more tactical level which is what days have I enjoyed and looked back on and been proud of myself for that day and over
(01:49) probably a three or four year period I just looked at the good days and the bad days and I looked at what the good days had in common and looked at what the bad days had in common I've just over time minimized the things that happen on the bad days and maximized the things happen on the good days even even to Big Investments like I am much happier when I work out like rather not even much happier when to workout when I look back on my day this was a good day almost always has a workout in it and usually with people I like and so workouts take
(02:18) probably longer for me than most people because I'm not the uh I'm in and out in 45 minutes and I you know you know did my my morning routine and I can do send out 40 emails from whatever it's every everyone's different but for me I work out for like two hours it's because I like to and so I do it and I do it with people that I like and so I'm willing to invest the time because like what's the point anyways like why make all the money to what enjoy it like I enjoy doing that so I do that every day um I
(02:49) like writing so I write for you know four to six hours a day um and those probably the two biggest activities that I do and if I can write with somebody that I like then I I do something I like with people I like and I think that that's probably been the the S the single simplest formula is doing things you like with people you like and trying to maximize as much time as I can on the on that bucket and then everything else I try and minimize is overhead or Outsource most people are like why am I not happy they also see a problem with them not happy they have it as an expectation of the world and the universe that they should be happy right
(03:23) and to the same degree people have an expectation that life should be should be meaningful like why does life need to be meaningful why does the universe need to make you happy it doesn't you can choose that but it's just like not a requirement and so they think there's something wrong with it when in reality like you're alive and you might procreate you might not but like that's the only reason that you're here right oh man there you go broke my wedding ring it's a sign name I don't know silicon it's like my third one I break him every like two
(03:55) years as a side note this is incredible oh cool really good oh okay whatever you took take that again on smells like commitment I I so like if I if I boil it down like happiness is is fleeting because you get hungry again you get sleepy again um meaning you can only really tell at the end like did I do something that that contributed but on the day-to-day perspective I can know that what I'm doing is useful and if what you're doing is not useful then I think that that's harder and I also think I also think think that men and women are different here so we use like H happy I hate the
(04:34) term in general but like I think men and women want different things out of life and I think we we bucket them together it's also the same degree like why um therapy with men um doesn't work necessarily the same we have to have a different approach like people think men need more love and I just don't think that's true I think we want more respect and like you get respect from being useful and so I I I make that the goal like no one casts aside a man who is useful and being useful is an attractive trait like if you see someone who's really good at something it's hard like for you like women like that is a it's a
(05:16) contributing member of society they do stuff like that help other people we want them here like you get status from that and so that means that skill Mastery in a very real way can help you attract the meate you want which is why I indexed a ton of my life around getting better at stuff so like and also from a stress perspective people are like I remember I see sometimes these podcasts from from successful entrepreneurs and and they're like man I'm still worried I could lose it all tomorrow I don't have that like
(05:49) I'm genuinely not afraid of losing it all tomorrow because I have lost it before and I got it back and the thing it's like if you have a like if you were lucky cuz there are guys who get lucky and if you are lucky then absolutely should be worried about it because if you do lose it you don't know how to get it back but if you have skills then like I know that I can go to any business and help grow it like it and that's valuable that's useful and so even reframing the word value as usefulness is probably
(06:14) also an easier way to do it for people to kind of like comprehend but I think if you make that the goal it also takes it away from you so the reason I hate so there's a I would say a friend is um well I have a friend who who's who's single and struggles because he's not happy successful but not happy and so he obsesses on happiness and I was like do you know that when you obsess on happiness all you do is think about you all day it's all you're doing you're just thinking about you all day and like how
(06:51) useless and so the nice thing with being useful is that in order to be useful you have to be useful to other people like no one can be useful on their own you have to be useful to other people so there's a service element but there's also a self-improvement element which is to be useful to other people you need to improve yourself and so that's why I think being useful is has been probably my day-to-day goal of what I need to do and that serve me well um not saying anyone should or should they can do whatever they want but for me that's helped me it for sure offers Clarity they've done brain scans people with
(07:24) depression and the areas of the brain that are responsible for like self-reflection and rumination are like overly active yeah they think about themselves too much um I mean this is Tony Robbins quote he said if you stay in your head you're dead um and because it Rhymes it's true and so but the uh but for real though like when I when I was 19 the reason I said  happiness was like I realized that I was in this cycle this Loop of trying to like everything you analyze of like does this make me happy does this pizza make me happy does this class make me happy I mean I quit Premed because I
(07:55) thought biology didn't make me happy now I'm very glad that I did cuz I like business lot more now but like that was the reason I did it I studied really hard I did well but I was like this doesn't make me happy like of course it doesn't make you happy you suck at it you're you're learning something you're going to suck for a very long time it's only when all these skills go together that you'll be good at something and you'll actually be useful to Society of course you learning the  chromosomes doesn't do anything
(08:18) but it's because of what it shows shows a school that you're willing to put up with so that you might be useful to society in the particular skill set um and so yeah I think being useful is far better goal and this is this is me just shouting out specifically to men um if you could just just try it try try this on for a month if you're if you're happy do whatever the you well really just do what everyone either way but if what you're working isn't working for you or what you're doing isn't working for you um I would I would try this on for size one say that you're
(08:50) going to stop trying to be happy just give up on it just like just stop thinking about it like I'm not you know what I'm actually okay with being unhappy I'm fine with it I'm I'm still here like it doesn't mean anything okay and so then you can take action despite your lack of happiness and think okay how can I be useful to other people and I think if you do that you'll actually start focusing on the tasks and on people outside of yourself and you'll be amazed at how much better you feel overall and what happened to me when I went into my happiness thing is
(09:24) that I stopped thinking about happiness altogether and then like years later I was like you know what CU I was so used cuz like I wanted to label myself that way and be okay with it people would ask me like hey XYZ I'd be like Oh I'm not a happy person I would just like say that up front that way I didn't have to and I remember catching myself um probably like 5 years later and I was like huh I say that I was like but I actually really do like my life a lot so I stopped saying I'm not a happy person cuz like I actually kind of do like my life um but I feel like I only got to
(09:55) liking my life by being willing to not like what I was doing for a long period of time it's like also what time frame are you thinking about totally like most of the things that feel good for you are what is it feel good or bad for you in the long run but also like things that feel bad are probably good in the long run I actually um I I only disagree because it's so vague cuz like I think people just only think of the things that quote feel good but there's tons of things that feel good that are not bad for you like sex
(10:21) feels good it's not bad for you you know like it's just we immediately jump to like cigarettes booze you know whatever but it's really anything in excess is bad for you like if so much sex that you don't go to work you don't eat it's bad for you you know what I mean if you like even cigarettes like if you have one cigarette or week doesn't do anything for you probably you smoke more than that just walking outside you know what I mean for a week in terms of just you know CO2 from Cars so it's it's always
(10:48) you know it's always in the dose yeah is the is maybe the usefulness of that people want a binary when it's really Continuum what do you mean by that people say oh I like it therefore they want a simple rule but like life has way more continuums than binaries like good and bad like first off Define good Define bad second off like like like it or not how much you know to what degree how often like what is good like whatever I mean a really fun one is that I think um so Dr cashy and I've talked about this but like there was this whole thing on drinking a glass of wine every day reserve a trol is one of the key ingredients it's like
(11:24) anti-cancer fighting whatever um but if you look at like centenarians people live over 100 a disproportionate amount of them smoke and so I find that interesting because I think that genetically means that that person probably has some sort of protection against lung based carcinogens which then means they get all the benefits of cigarettes and none of the downsides and so they're able to basically benefit from all the stress reducing components of nicotine and smoking but then just don't get cancer
(11:54) and so I would argue that like drinking a glass of wine every night has less to do with the reservatrol and more more to do with the stress reduction on a continuous basis so anyways so like the BL like the Blue Zone research right like where those people live MH there that's that's diet stuff more so more diet stuff yeah it's more diet stuff where do people smoke a lot everywhere but [Laughter] here yeah we started it spread it everywhere else and then said it wasn't cool anymore and everyone else is like what the China's like yo we still
(12:27) smoke nicotine men make good times I have a question for you do you feel like you have a better descriptor of the subjective experience you're having when you're in quote unquote like the Flow State like when you're writing sure you wouldn't say you're happy but I know you I know you like writing yeah yeah I enjoy writing well I think I think one thing is is the idea of learning how to enjoy a challenge so I think like I think a lot of people can get there quickly like a lot of people play video games because Okay so video
(12:59) games are designed to increase in difficulty proportional to people's willingness to um basically they extend inter interment reinforcement so your first level is always easy and they extend it a little bit more they extend a little more and eventually believe it or not you'll have learned the behavior such that they can push it out so far they never need to reward you again which is why people stay in abusive relationships like in the beginning it's good oh I up oh everything's good again and then I up more and then it's good again and then I up more and then it's good again and then eventually it's never good again but but
(13:30) they got reinforced on enough um spaces each time that they stay in it and so I think the difference between a video game and life is that that interval isn't set and so you're not necessarily going to have a quick win at level one because it's more like you basically get none until you're at level like 20 and then all of a sudden it all comes and so that's I think that's the difficult part and so I think being willing I think athletes do particularly well um like college athletes do really well transitioning because they've learned a meta skill which is that you're going to suck for a long time at something before
(14:08) you become a master at it and most people don't have the ability don't have any experience mastering anything in life early on and so they have to learn how to work and so I think um I think learning to work is the most useful thing that you can do I mean I think for me I love finding input output equations that like success of some kind so it's like if you're giving public speaking I'm going to give this example because it's perfect so um Caleb who's on my team um had said right you know years ago when we met uh like I'm not I don't
(14:42) really like public speaking I don't like presenting I don't like any of that stuff I was like cool and I think he said some the degree of like I don't like it or I'm bad at it whatever and he did a presentation for the team and it was good um and then uh he had a bunch of things that he wanted to do better on the next one now uh between those time periods I had done the book launch and so he had seen me prepare for my presentation and so I did it a 100 times over 30 days so I did it three times a day before I gave the book launch and you know when there was 500,000 people or whatever that were at
(15:17) the launch um when we had 500,000 people registered for the launch and I was about to step on stage um the team that was doing it all said we've done we do this every day and I've never seen anyone so like relaxed and it wasn't a front it was because I had done it so many times and so fast forward Cale had another presentation he had to give and this time he prepared three times as long so he did instead of 10 hours of prep he did 30 hours of prep and instead of having 80 slides he had 330 slides and the presentation went way better and he
(15:54) noted that he wasn't nervous at all going into the second presentation compared to the first presentation and so he messaged me afterward said I shoot um it wasn't that I was bad at speaking I was just lazy and I think that a lot of people mistakenly think they're bad at things they haven't even learned how to try and I do think learning how to try is also domain specific and so like Caleb's an exceptional video editor and media uh strategist and and great with building the team and those skills but those had been skills that he knew how to work
(16:33) hard at but this was a completely different skill and so it's like writing like I have a lot of entrepreneur friends who who are writing books now now they don't know that I come from background of writing I got a full writing scholarship uh to toughs University which is a good school um I got a personal letter from their writing seller like we love all your stuff we want you to be here I ended up going to VB but like I was the vice editor of the newspaper I was an Editor in Chief of literary magazine when I was in high
(16:56) school like I like writing and so I know what hard what hard work looks like in writing which is just editing and editing and editing and editing which is basically like doing the speech again and doing the speech again and doing the speech again and it's the same as ping pong which is 500 backhands 500 forehands it's it's just it's just repetition right um and so right now if you're doing work or you feel like you're not as good at something you have to figure out what the input output equation is you have to figure out like
(17:26) what's the thing that I have to do a lot of because every skills like this is that there's a period where you have to do a lot of something and if you don't know what it is then you're not going to get better sales is like I have to do 100 calls a day I have to do you know I have to do 10 10 conversations a day whatever it is you do that every single day and you do that for a year you get pretty good um and so you have to learn what that input output equation is so that you can push as if it's me I
(17:51) once I know it then I just Jam as much input as I possibly can into that thing and then that's where the whole the whole quote that you know went viral was um confidence doesn't come from shouting affirmations in the Mirror by having a stack of undeniable proof that you are who you say you are outw workk yourself doubt and so like you become Confident by giving yourself the stack of evidence the hundred times I went over the presentation I felt confident going into that because I had a stack of proof that I'd already done it perfectly the last 20 times in a row that I'd done it so why would 21 be
(18:27) different and if you've had a thousand sales calls on your thousand first if people are watching they're like man you sound so confident you're like it's just how it is it's not like I'm confident I just know I know what's going to happen next and so I prefer to think about it as like do it so many times you get bored of doing it and like that's when you'll look confident to everyone on the outside because you'll have no emotional affect to the outcome because you'll have recognized the patterns so many times that there's nothing that's going to surprise you and I think that most
(18:57) people just don't know how how to work that hard like there is no way that anyone will know how hard I've worked on the books like just imagine that there's a reason that they're all you know alltime bestsellers for each of the categories they're in and still they're like it's cuz you're following it's like no you know why I know that look at every other person who has a following and their books don't sell even though they have a big following they launch it and then they stop selling why because the book sucked they had a ghost writer they voiced it in whatever and they they
(19:25) make their whatever 5 million bucks or whatever it is they publish the second edit instead of the yeah I mean they they like they literally they they think the book is finished when it has reached the number of pages that creates a book like I can write a book in two weeks if I was just trying to write a certain number of pages but like I've I've usually written five times the amount of pages as what actually comes out in the final draft and I've Rewritten end to end the whole thing not once or twice but like 10 times end to end but you know what happens when you
(19:58) do that you get really good at knowing what is what is important what isn't and you also give yourself way more outside life exposures that trigger new thoughts over that period of time that remind you of things that can make it better and so it's kind of like a um like when you paint it's like it's like putting coats of paint and letting it dry and so I kind of see editing drafts as like another coat of paint and then you think you're like you know what I just saw that like I was I was walk I went to a new area today and I saw this new new yellow I wonder if I could throw
(20:28) that in if you had immediately shipped it you wouldn't have had the opportunity to see the yellow thing because time didn't transpire during the creation of the thing and so I think there's a reason that books that take 10 years to write look and read like they took 10 years to write there's just a depth to the Quality do you then now to bring this back kind of to like the happiness or whatever we I find happiness in figuring out what my input output equation is and doing it as much as humanly possible do you then engineer your environment to reinforce yourself to do more inputs absolutely how do you
(20:58) do that you want to make it easy EAS as possible to work as hard as you can and so everything that is not that input output equation is interference and so like relationships like I mean I said this before but everything that you are not willing to sacrifice to be the best the person who's best in the world is willing to and already has sacrificed and so I'm not saying good or bad do whatever you want but if you want to be number one and a lot of people say I want to be the best it's like Nate don't you want to be better and you can be really good you can be really good
(21:32) and not sacrifice plenty of things but if you want to be the best then you just have to assume that the best person in the world has the genetic predisposition has all the environmental environmental cues aligned with their ultimate goal and is willing to give up everything that is not achieving that goal and if you're not in that boat then you're not going to be the best people just like saying because makes it feel good but it's false um and so in terms of aligning the environment if you know the input out
(22:02) equation so for me it's writing right now is the season that I'm in because writing kind of is the is the pillar of everything else we do content wise internal Communications the books everything comes from me taking time to write because I'm I organize my thoughts better that way and i' because I've become skilled at writing so it's the best way it's the most succinct way that I can communicate and so um there's a reason that the first 6 hours of my day when I'm freshest most well rested I have no meetings and I have only one thing that I do which is right there's nothing else
(22:40) and so if you know what the input out equation is find the time the four to six hours a day every day that you can do that and then allow nothing to interfere with it and that's it like nothing interferes with it and if you do that for 5 Years it'll be really good and you'll be useful and you'll feel good about it because the thing is at a certain point the work itself becomes reinforcing like when editors edit and then they make a change and then and The Story Goes or the video goes the way they want it to it's like boom that was reinforcing and if I like work really hard on a paragraph and I could just shrink it to
(23:15) one sentence I'm like yeah and that might take that literally might take two hours to just keep beating it down until I get it to like the one most distinct thing um but that's satisfying and so the beginning you suck and you do the Reps so that you learn the skills so that eventually you do the work itself because the work itself is rewarding but that takes time to get to yeah it's like you are at this point writing the third book and it's like my fourth book overall yes and and getting those sentences is the is the win the little win which also makes it easier
(23:46) because then you're not waiting for the 6,000 am wonder if you could talk a little bit to that well yeah I mean in the beginning you start the the start the journey because you have this big ultimate payoff you want to have but that's way too far out to actually wait like you have to be an exceptional person who's who's been reinforced in the past for waiting for a very long period of time that's why I say the athletes thing is kind of interesting because they've had to wait a long period of time and so they have to practice for a long period before they get the thing um but typically they get
(24:12) enough reinforcers early on that that the act itself becomes reinforcing and that's that's that's what Mastery is is you transition from having some sort of external motivator to external I believe all motivators are external but from the work itself being intrinsically rewarding versus having it carrot of some kind that's been artificially put there like status or an award or number one or a ranking um and Masters can Masters enjoy the work more than novices do so it's actually easier for Masters do you find ironically that hard
(24:53) work has felt less hard these days or is it still hard work because you're pushing it it's still hard it's different in terms of the hard the I would say the hard thing that I have now is that my level of quality the standard that I have is only mine like I know that I could probably put out the first draft and it would probably be a bestseller it's just that I would know that it could have been better and that would eat me alive and so the hard part is still maintain so it's actually the hard part for me now is that I maintain my standard as the number one standard that I optimize for and if the world so
(25:30) chooses to also like it great but it also divorces me somewhat from the outcome because if it were just about getting the bestselling book then I would publish it on the first shot because at this point I do have enough skill that probably would be a bestseller on its own but I also think there's a difference between being a bestseller for a season and being best seller for a 100 years and so I'm trying to write these books to be best sellers when I'm dead so they're still useful how do you know when you've met that far like how do you know when a sentence is like when there's nothing
(26:01) else I can do to it to make it better and you sleep on it and then you wake up the next day you look at it again there's nothing else I can do to it to make it better same thing for the presentation there's nothing else I can do to make this better I can't practice it more because even at a certain point when you if you get past a certain point of practicing you start you start knowing it almost too well that you start cutting corn because you're like it it gets too natural like I actually I borderline over prepared for the gmats um I like peaked I CU I I I took
(26:29) tests every week and my math score sorry my English score peaked before my math score did so my math score peaked at the test but my English score I had done it so many times you're like shoot and I've done you you recognize so many patterns that you're like man which pattern is this one cuz like I'm so good at all of them I have to remember like it it it um you Peak right and so there is a point you where it's not even diminishing returns you actually start getting worse um at least in my opinion or at least in
(26:55) my experience and so uh if you if you if you regress something down to its simplest form and then I just cut the sentence in half I lose material I lose stuff that would that needs to be there and so you get it as simple as possible but no simple uh you talked about if someone comes to you and you're like what would you do if you had six more hours on that you FP back on oh yeah yeah so a really a really fun thought exercise for somebody who just like all of this is like wow that's so much work I'm not really prepared for that well I'll walk you through what it looks like in a
(27:26) micro example so if the video editor comes to me and says hey do you like this clip and I say yeah I do like the clip if you had another two hours to work on it what would you do and they're like well if I had another two hours I'd do this this and this I'm like okay go do that come back they come back and I'm like do you think it's better and they say yeah they show it to me I'm like it is better okay now if you had another two hours what would you do they're like well I do this this and this I'm like okay cool they go they come back same
(27:49) conversation like okay if you had a week what would you do well then they're like well shoot I would I'd probably scrap this whole style overall and I make a totally new framework for how I'd approach the video um and I'd want to come at it from this angle altogether it would just take you know a lot more work but I think it would still make a better outcome it's like okay so that idea just do it on five years and so everybody just wants to get it done rather than get it right and getting it right is where all the money is I bet you asked yourself like what would
(28:30) you do if you had 50 years to work on acquisition 100% I do have 50 years and I do what I'm doing yeah and not not trying to chase the quick reinforcement so that sure well it's the quick external Loop but I mean like at a certain point you you start you start to develop Master even around pursuing goals so like I have I've had enough past like this is book three from the $1 million series every month I get thousands of reviews and DMS and people who say their lives change from the first two books the hard part was book one when I have none of that for a year and a half but once that one's out leads I'm like
(29:12) well I'm getting reinforcement every day from my writing and so I write and so now I have two books worth of that and once the third book's there'll be three books worth of that so maintaining that gets easier and easier just cuz I have regular enforcement for writing not not necessarily this book but writing in general and so that then means I can I can generalize past good experiences onto how I act and work now that's why like you become you become an expert at pursuing goals because you have pursued goals in the past I just use writing as an example but I've pursued goals in the past and
(29:49) sticking it out has had big payoffs and so when I feel like I'm sticking it out again I'm reminded of the past times I've stuck it out and it's been worth it the hard part is for the people who haven't stuck anything out because they've never they've never seen it work and so the first one's always the hard one it's like you just have to have faith on some level you just have to  believe that it'll work out and the the thing that carries you over the bridge in the short term is that you are getting better and if you can just focus on that then even if the the crowd
(30:17) doesn't cheer when you give your presentation or you don't sell books or whatever it is you'll know and so it's funny because I look back at the presentation that I gave five years ago and I really am embarrassed but I'm not embarrassed at the effort I put in then because the effort I put in then I really did think it was really good I just didn't know what good could be because I also gave myself 20 hours rather than 200 hours and so if I only had 20 hours maybe that is the best I can do and maybe today that's still the best I could do I just give myself way more time but the problem with giving
(30:49) yourself way more time once you see how much good good can be is that you realize how few projects you can do right which is why you just have to be that's why like the biggest guys in biggest business Titans in the world talk so much about Focus because it's not it's not that like focus is the thing it's just that it takes so much time to do something right that you can't do more than one thing so it might be almost part of that like if I know we keep saying the word happiness but like happiness equation to have less things that you're trying to
(31:18) optimize for in in your set of things that you're working on your life if you want to be exceptional at something it means you have to put a lot of input into it and you can't be exceptional at very many things because of how many inputs you have and how limited they are so if time is an input we all have the same amount of time and if it takes a huge amount of that time to get good at one thing then if you take that as the Assumption we're basing this on then there's just not many things you can get very good at and so then it takes some level of selection to be like what thing
(31:43) do I want to get good at how does the one of zero brand fit into this and how did you conceptualize well the one of zero brand is very much aligned with this um I should have my nose strip on I took it off this morning um you just pasted it on um the whole idea was you know it's so funny I saw I saw the background of my gym it said um that picture that I posted of like one of my first video content uh yeah it said it said the back of the wall I made this I made this quote up that I painted it you can see
(32:16) how ugly the paint is in the back wall it says um strength doesn't come from what strength doesn't come from doing doing what you think you can but doing what you think you can't is what I think it says which I don't agree with the word strength it should be growth but anyways I like the idea and so I think that one of zero is very much like that which is you know one of one is doing something that only you can do one of zero is doing something that you've never done before and that ideally no one else could do and so it's an amount
(32:50) of work that most people just don't comprehend and it's really hard to even describe it because like I can say I spent 6 hours a day for 18 months on this one project and people will nod their heads but spend six hours on one thing once and then then do it 500 times and then like you'll start to see like the soul crushing amount of effort that it takes to stick with it um now I've been able to extend how long I work on projects because just like the abusive husband thing or the abusive spouse thing like in the beginning you can have a short project you get a win I can work a little longer
(33:27) the next time I can work a little longer longer the next time books really good books are one of the hardest projects to do because you get almost zero reinforcement it's very punishing for most of the time um until quote the end but the process itself there is some some sort of joy in being the type of person who is able to endure that because I I have I have a lot of entrepreneur friends who are like oh I just finished my book I'm going to write a book just like you did I was like no you won't no you won't cuz you know they're
(33:57) not willing to put in no they like it worked well for him I'll do that too his book was so good I'll write one too doesn't work that way they've never even written anything so they're starting at like where I was when I was 15 and I would say the same aggree it's probably like people who look at Mr Beast now are like oh I'll just go make a YouTube videos like he started with 13 and he's been spending more than six hours a day trying to make videos since then and so there's just like so much depth of knowledge that you can get that
(34:28) just takes time but the thing is is from the happiness perspective I find a lot of joy and excellence and I think that work well done provides dividends forever so if we were to think about like subjective well-being or like purpose or meaning or utility or usefulness any of those whatever one you want to optimize for like I am proud of the first book I wrote I'm proud of the second book I wrote I'm proud of the third book I wrote and I'm proud of the book that I'm writing right now and when I look back on them every time
(35:00) I see them and I see people benefit from them I get a reward for a one-time input even though it was a year for the rest of my life I will get rewarded for that effort and so it just encourages me more and more to do things the right way and I think people who build exceptional products think about products the same way which is like it has to be right it just has to it's the it's it's all the 100 details it's not the big idea it's the 100 details that make the difference between like the Mr Beast videos versus other people who try to be like Mr Beast
(35:34) it's the 100 details that make his videos better yeah it's not like one caption yeah it's not just the thumbnail right like it's not that it's a hundred things I've heard you uh say the word Joy a couple times and um I'm wondering if you have a distinction between happiness and joy and if that's a helpful thing to explain um I see Joy a lot as just being present in the moment because I think you can joyfully mourn like if someone's you know died I think you can there's there's you can find Joy um in in a Morning Experience if you're
(36:05) consoling someone else how is that I think it's just being present and being okay with experiencing life so I I mean I that's how I see Joy now I haven't defined it and I'll probably spend more time defining the words but um I just see it as being present like I am I experience Joy when I am present like I'm enjoying those I feel very present right now as soon as you give up the goal of happiness or even meaning then it stops being this thing that's outside of you and so it allows you to be present in the moment and do what you want to do or do what you need
(36:43) to do and so if you always have this thing that you're measuring against one there's always a Delta between where you are and where it is but I think often times it'll optimize for the wrong path and I think happiness for most people is pleasure seeking so it they call it happiness but it's really Hedonism and most I don't like to appeal to religion but in terms of old ideologies most people have found and I'm sure there is some science that I don't know um that people who pursue hedonistic Lifestyles tend to be the most empty um and the least fulfilled and so I think people have just swapped
(37:26) the word happy or hen Hedonism for happiness and they think they wouldn't want to say that but if you look at the actual activities they're pursuing they're almost purely pleasure seeking what makes an activity only pleasure seeking for something that will build long-term good well I think it's just time time scale it's short-term longterm like something that most pleasure-based activities are um their pleasure now at the sacrifice of goal or something later to be fair I don't think there's anything wrong with that I'm just saying like know what we're optimizing for is that why that um that line that I
(38:07) think we talked about once of uh desire is a contract yourself yeah so um there was this big philosophy website and then Naval quoted that site um and it was a desire is a contract we make with ourselves to be unhappy until we get what we want um and I mean I fundamentally agree whenever you want something it means you don't have it and you basically create deprivation within yourself to motivate Behavior so if you see motivation is the equal opposite of deprivation like you're horniest when you haven't for a while you are
(38:45) hungriest when you haven't eaten for a while you're you have a huge motivation to sleep when you're exhausted right and so if we want something we create deprivation within ourselves to motivate ourselves to get it but by creating deprivation we basically create um now he calls it unhappiness but I don't know if I necessarily agree with that as the I think we just we create deprivation because would you still say there is a gap between what you have and what you want sure yeah like you want something that you don't have but I mean I think um the the way
(39:23) to skirt that is in is wanting a challenge and so if you just genuinely want to fight bigger and bigger bosses then the fact that you get the gold at the end becomes like if anything the gold at the end is like irrelevant you just want to find the next boss and most of the Champions that are out there that I've seen you'll have the Michael Jordans the I mean a lot of Olympians have huge depression after they get a gold because now what and so it really and I think you can see how people how people react to Victory tells
(40:00) you what motivated them or rather what they were deprived of so if the goal was to be exceptional then that person hits the gold see as sees it as a foregone conclusion and is just excited to move on to the next thing if they made their entire life about getting the gold then they have no idea what to do because they were married to the outcome not the process and again I I think that you can win either way I absolutely think you can win either way but it definitely changes how long you can play yeah it's like for the right thing that Gap actually becomes uh
(40:37) an enjoyable process intrinsically well it's not it's not even the Gap it's just that if you want the challenge then you basically create goals to create challenges you don't create goals to achieve goals you you set new goal post just so that you can have the the trial and so like someone's like what happens when you hit a billion I was like I'll make it 10 and when I 10 I'll hit 100 like it like it it doesn't matter cuz I'll die and I'll give it all away anyways it's relevant but it's just like I want to I want to be better and the only way to be better is
(41:07) to do the work that I know I should do and so that way every day I'm doing the work and at least for me that has worked do whatever you want that has worked for me because I feel like some people talk about that like moving the goalpost things and the negative of like oh people reach one thing and then but I guess if you take it from the frame of these are just more challenges that I'll enjoy from then it's not a problem with the go I don't think it's a problem I mean if you beat level one boss then what you you the game moves
(41:36) you up you play harder monsters and then you try and beat level two boss it's it's it's this whole fallacy around being done it's this whole idea that we can finish we can work so hard we never have to work again we can so good we never have to again we can eat so big we never have to eat again we can sleep so well we never have to sleep again it's just a fallacy it's not true and people lose their lives trying to find that one meal or that one or that one you know uh sleep or that one goal that'll satisfy them for good and it never does I think a story that would really
(42:09) contextualize this for the audience is like that period when you were getting ready to sell gym launch that you just sound like you felt a little lower oh yeah so I um so when I was selling gym launch there was basically a year where I couldn't really work um mostly because if I worked in the business then it would look like I was a key man to the business and if I and I didn't know if we were going to sell so I didn't want to start another company so I basically just had to like subsist I could even start new Endeavors
(42:34) or initiatives within the company so I just had to do nothing basically and so for me it was the most depressed I've been if you look at some of the videos during that that time period a lot of them are me being pretty sad and being like what the is life about but it's just that for me um like you know again I'm not religious but I do find it interesting that the first thing God gave adam in the Bible before giving him a wife was giving a job work tend to the Garden before he gave him a wife and I find that really interesting I don't like religious religion aside um we're built to work
(43:13) and so for me especially I'm built to work and so if I'm working I'm good and like the the days that I enjoy the most are the days that I work the longest and so I just try and remove everything that stops me from doing that you said something about hell the other day or heaven heaven the idea of Heaven potentially being kind of like a hell like not not anything oh it sounds horrible well I mean if the idea like I think most people Envision most people Envision heaven like the one meal that's going to be so
(43:43) good they're never going to eat again they're going to be so elated to just be singing with the angels it's like yeah but play it out like then what like okay got it we sang with the angels at from 9 to 10 and then from you know then I had the Feast you know what I mean from 10 to 11 but I got to keep my my idealized body my my I don't know Christian needs for idealized body glorified um physical form I got to keep that the whole time it's like okay well now it's noon now what do I do well dogs are all there cuz all dogs go to heaven
(44:14) great good to know but if your wife dies and it's like you have three wives up there you're like but I mean technically we were at different time so it's like what do how do we do with that whatever God's figured it out but um again I think it's just this fallacy of work life balance like I think Heaven is literally just an extrapolation of work life balance as a concept which is I will just be able to do life and no work but the first thing God does in the Bible is give someone work and so I think so many people would be helped out if they just stopped labeling it as a bad thing and started seeing it
(44:49) as the way to get what they want and then eventually to make it the thing they want because the and this is like a little bit of an app sha idea so it takes a little bit more processing part to conceptualize this but there's goals and then there's working to hit the goals and then there's the idea of love the process but there's the UN the subscript of so that you can hit the goal but in my opinion it's just work not so that you can it's just work and it's like what do you mean it means like working is the goal like
(45:31) working as hard as you can and learning how hard you can work and how well you can work and how right you can make things and how well you can do them like pushing that expanding my capacity to work not so that I can like expanding my capacity work so that I can work more like if you can do that then you have the self-fulfilling Loop and then you also become completely divorced from the outcomes which ironic Al when you do work that way you do have outsized outcomes compared to everybody else but you do it because you work so  hard because you're addicted to working and you like that game and the
(46:07) goals just happen as a consequence but I don't even like saying the goals just happen as a consequence because it still gives the idea to The Listener or The Watcher right now that that's the point and it's not because even if your goal is to be the richest man in the world okay let's say that's your goal for how long every richest man in the world is Rich for the richest man in the world for they touch the top and then boom something changes the economy whatever it is and then another richest man of
(46:30) the world comes up like who was the richest man 20 years ago actually 30 years ago a bunch of Japanese guys and then Japan's economy crashed no one even knows their guys names and so it's like making the goal even as audacious as those guys goals were right and let's say you're number two but even let's say you're number one for how long and so that's why I I think that the work is the goal not so that you can just the work is the goal and learning how hard you can work and being proud of yourself for how much harder you work today than you did yesterday you have a tweet that like
(47:09) perfectly ties us together you hit the goals that you said you wanted to to be happy a long time ago yeah is that kind of what you mean here um actually well it's it's um you've already hit goals that you said would make you happy and I might have put years ago or something like that in there but it's just fun like years ago you set goals that today you've hit and you said you would be happy and yet you're not and so it's because the concept of setting these goals presumed like the ultimate unhappiness equation is uh if I get X
(47:46) I'll be happy right like we all know that one um because that's the the the guarantee of it not not happening because it automatically the entirety of your existence is outside of yourself and then the moment you hit it then what you set another one then it's outside of yourself right um and so if if the goal doesn't change your entire life then you can basically be achieving it every day if the goal is to work as hard as you can every day you can work as hard as you can you can be in the state that you're Desiring if the goal is the
(48:17) state yeah the goal is the state of being that you have when you work exceptionally hard when you do hard work worth doing and you know if you left in the tank and I love I think this is Jesse iler says this but I I I really love it there's a handful of like saying that I've gotten from other owners that I really love I'll give you three right now I'm side questing but just deal with it one is um Michael Dell says play nice but win I just love that the second one is uh Andy forel has 100 to zero which I really really like which is basically like society when
(48:52) you're up you know in football let's say you're up 30 to nothing and it's halftime society says put in your put in your backups put in your third strings like take it easy and play and he's like no that 100 to zero step on their throat and kill everyone and I like that from a from a perspective of of like don't let off the gas like just because they lost doesn't mean that you now have to dilute yourself to lower yourself to their standard and so it's like yeah so what if like it takes this much to win I don't
(49:29) care if it takes this much to win I want to be here because if if you then change how you play because everybody else isn't as good you lower yourself you don't raise them up that Society trying to make it appear as though people are better than they are and I I'm a big fan of like they should know they lost 100 to zero they should know how much room they have to improve and also to the same degree I should know how much further ahead I am um and the goal shouldn't even be to win mhm I'm going to keep playing the
(49:59) way I play if we happen to finish at 100 to Z we happen to finish at 100 to Z but I'm not going to let off because that's who I am um and the third one was uh Jesse ller has this thing where he has with his kids which I really like was um after they do a marathon because he's really big in Endurance Sports and so his kids are too and so whenever they finish a lot of them pulled up a zero which I really like and it means nothing left in the tank he said I just want you I don't care if you win he's like I just
(50:28) want you to have nothing left and I I think about that as like the goal so the goal is to have nothing left and I think that on the micro level and on the macro level like if every day like my favorite days are the days that I get into bed and I'm exhausted but proud of the work that I've done I've have nothing left I've left it all on the field and so like that's the goal the other stuff Society chooses to measure Me by but when I measured myself that way it distracted me and I didn't enjoy my life um but just living that day as
(51:01) many times in a row as I can until I die is my plan and at the end on the macro they want to hold this up and be like I got nothing left I'm used up but until then I will continue to try and be useful and so that I like I like all three of those statements and they to me kind of embody a lot of the the values of one of zero which is not just doing only what you can do but doing things that you didn't you could yet let's say someone wants to take this Frame of infinite games but but their thing isn't work like you have
(51:33) someone like Mother Teresa who's like I just want to dude i' love exate this yeah yeah so okay so Alex what if my goal isn't work the goal is always work it's just what you're working on and so whether you're like I want to have the best marriage then cool it takes work if the goal is to have the best kids then parenting is that not it's work if the goal is to have the best physique it's work if the goal is to have the best career it's work if the goal is to just be the ultimate version of you it's work in all those Arenas and being
(52:03) mindful of what you want to optimize for um in terms of how many hours you want to allocate to each and so like most people live lives I mean I'm going to use Rogan's quote from somebody else but of quiet desperation because they're hoping to find a way around work but work is the way it's the only way because everything else if it didn't require work then you'd already have it breathing doesn't really require work most people do it there's plenty of things that we just don't think about because we have them
(52:50) automatically and so everything that you don't automatically have you have to expend effort to get and so everyone just wants a way to get things without working which I understand don't get me wrong but the thing is is that I remember actually this is a weird thought so I remember when I was graduating college I had this um there was like it was like a billion dollar uh Powerball like I it was like you know one of when it kind of goes over a billion dollars and um I bought a Powerball ticket with my girlfri just as like a like a fun joke not like I didn't I was like hoping to win and what's
(53:25) weird is that I remember remember as the drawing was happening I I actually had this huge fear that I win because if I would win then it would mean that I would never get a shot to prove myself that I that I could have done it because literally from that point on if you win nothing you do matters like I could never prove that I had any metal whatsoever like everyone would always say it was cuz you went the Powerball D and I think the big reason that I didn't become a physician was because my dad has a successful practice and I knew that if I became a physician
(54:01) it didn't matter how good of a physician I was it would always be because people would say it was because of him now that was then I cared a lot about what people saying I probably still do um less though but still on some degree um but that was and so just to give I guess the audience an insight into like how I think about things if it's valuable for you like if you are afraid of winning the lottery because it won't give you a chance to prove to yourself who you want to be or who you want to become then I think
(54:32) you're on the right path I love the inverse of that which is that everything that's right now which is heart is the opposite of the lottery is the biggest blessing yeah and if we were to take this in the equal op perspective of if winning the lottery is the ultimate way to not win because you never get the opportunity to prove yourself not necessarily prove to other people but prove to yourself and so maybe said differently the reason the the Powerball ter me it's like I wouldn't be able to prove to me independent of what other people said but like I would never know if I could
(55:01) do it because I had a billion dollars behind me and so every hardship that you encounter if you reframe it as the story that you will someday tell to yourself of the person that you have become based on the dragons you've slain and the obstacles you've overcome then I think that makes those obstacles a unique opportunity for self-improvement because we can be grateful for these things I think um I think Joo has a has a whole bit on this where whenever something bad happens he says good and I think it's a great trained response because if something bad
(55:42) happens my train response isn't good it's I will tell the story someday and so I think if you have that frame then everything serves you because if something good happens cool if something that happens it'll be a story that I will someday tell because it assumes that you will live through it and it assumes that you will eventually figure it out and so then you can't lose as long as you don't quit if you're cool talking about this are these some of the conversations you have with your wiser self yeah I haven't actually had a
(56:17) ton of Solomon conversations recently because I haven't had a lot of um so because of the wonderful therapist that Solomon is I I don't have to stick to a schedule and so I would say that like there are times yeah so so there's a lot of research that suggests that we are better at giving advice than we are adhering to it and so they've done like as simple example is they gave two whitewash scenarios of somebody and told the reader to give advice to the person who's in the whitewash scenarios the thing is is that the person in the whitewash scenarios was them and they don't adhere to the
(56:49) advice adhere to the advice that they give and so they did this to just demonstrate that people one don't listen to to their own advice and two that the advice that people give tends to be better than what they do and they postulate that the reason for that is because you be you can be uh non-emotional and detached giving advice to somebody else you can be more rational about the advice whereas when you're in it you have more emotions you make less rational decisions and so extrapolating that out for me I have a lot of relatively complex business dealings that happen on a regular basis
(57:22) most of my stressors anxieties come from decisions that I have to to make with incomplete information and so if I were to have a therapist I would probably spend a huge amount of time trying to catch them up on all the relative information and then I would hope that they somehow have the business Acumen to help me navigate these decisions which they probably wouldn't and then even if they did I would have to hope that their incentive was aligned with mine which theirs as billable hours not me making
(57:51) that most money and so there's just a lot of problems I think with the traditional model and so at least for me and so I was like okay well how can I get somebody who has completely aligned incentives who has all the same information as me um who can give me good advice and so the person who meets all of those qualifications is future may and it's like well yeah wouldn't it be nice to talk to that person well what's interesting is if you if you if you switch your hat around and you're like okay I'm I'm now future me I'm going to
(58:21) give advice to younger May um it's a wild ride but the dialogue is super powerful because you don't sugar coat it for you and you don't need to waste time prefacing and say like hey take this away like you don't have to get you just be like it's such direct communication um and the advice that I would get is often advice that I give and I give really good business advice only I only say that measured based on the company's growth that we have um and so taking that advice oftentimes I too need to be more patient
(58:56) often times I too need to keep doing what has been working oftentimes I too need to wait until we have enough day to make the next call um and I have to give time time and so now some therapist could say this to me and I'd be like what the do you know how's your business going right obviously not that well you're talking to me for an hourly rate whatever not that there's anything wrong with that but I'm just saying that their goals for business and their level of aptitude for business is probably not the same as mine and so it'd be really hard for me to even put it weight on
(59:27) their opinion but future me is much smarter and wiser than I am of course and so I do weigh their decisions and so the other piece is that I don't have to have a generic it's 60 Minutes like why does why does a therapy session need to be 60 Minutes it should be as long as it needs to be or as short as it needs to be to solve the problem and so I've had times that it's been 7even minutes I've had times when it's been 90 I've had times when it's uh three times in one week and I've had times where I don't I don't have to have a quote session with
(59:54) Solomon for a month and so it's usually when I'm at big decision points where I have more frequent communication to try and like figure out an issue or a problem but once once I'm kind of on a path I usually stay on that Groove for basically as long as I can and so um over the last two years I had a lot more big directional decisions that I needed to make with kind of the media stuff that we do and then also the investments in acquisition doccom but a lot of the early thesis that we had we have enough data now that I could make decisions on
(1:00:27) them and I have made decisions on them and so now it's just about sticking to the plan so what did that process look like you have a like Google doc and then you Alterna yeah I just literally pull up a Google doc I set a date so that I have all my conversations in one Doc and um I just hit enter so it's just me him me him he asks a question I answer like um and it sounds silly to do this but do it once and you'll realize that it's it's weird it it work works for me at least have you Lo ever looked back on like what was the first you remember the first time you did y I do I do I do we
(1:01:04) had a we had an unfortunate event that uh that that had happened that had not gone the way that IID wanted it to and um I describe these types of scenarios as you're a you're a rare baseball card collector and you have an incredibly rare card um like super super valuable and then your 2-year-old when you're away gets in into the box and destroys it what do you do do you hit the kid they don't even know like what do you do you get upset at your wife like what do you do you just got to take it there's no there's
(1:01:41) no there's no action you just take it and so I had I had one of those incidences from a business perspective um and so I just talked to Solomon about it and he was like you just take it he's like and you get to tell that story someday about the skin that you have and the things you've gone through and then the next hard time something happens you'll be able to compare to that and be like well wasn't as bad as that right and then you take measure take measures to prevent the next card do the best you
(1:02:14) can yeah but even when I thought about that because in that particular situation it was like okay what information you know should I have had or um this is actually a really common one this happens in investing but like um people were like I shouldn't have made that investment or I should have bought Bitcoin in 2013 well should you have because the thing is is that if you have that decision-making framework then it means that you would have invested in a hundred other things at that same time period which means that you might like that decision-making calculus probably would have led you to ruin more
(1:02:46) than the one time that it worked and so in order for me to learn from the experience I have to think about what what do I change about my decision-making framework to prevent something like that happening in the future and if there wasn't anything that could really happen in the decision-making framework then sometimes you just get kicked in the nuts sometimes your kid just takes the Babe Ruth thing and Treads it and there's nothing you can do about it yeah and to Loop it back a little bit it's like if the goal was for you to enjoy the process of you know even acquiring that card in the first place
(1:03:22) the card collection yeah yeah the collection isn't really the go M yeah I mean you're going to die doesn't matter but yeah I mean I I'm the same way because I I collect gym equipment like I love gym equipment and I'll give it different example um I had a house in Austin and we had this big really nice infinity pool that had like this nice view and somebody came over and was like Hey be honest with me how many times do you even use this pool and I was like I use it five times a day and he was like what and I was like every time I walk past it I look at it and I
(1:03:53) like it it's just like somebody saying like Alex why don't you do more functional training with your body I was like my function is to look jacked I use it every second of every day what are you talking about and so it's like and this is probably a good kind of decision fallacy to look at because a lot of people will criticize your decisions because they use their way of valuing the decision and assume it's the same way you value a decision and so to the gym equipment thing I have a lot of gym equipment and I enjoy spending time in my gym like I
(1:04:29) like walking in there I like everything the way it is I like the pieces I remember how I got them I remember the workouts I've done on them I'm reminded of the people I did those sessions with when I did a brutal whatever and so it's just a really positive they're all basically totems of positive reinforcements so kind of like the card collection like people go through their card collection people go through their car collection because it reminds them of all the positive things that have happened um more so than they
(1:04:56) collect it because they want to sell it someday like I'm not going to sell the gym equipment why would I I like it I use it but I think I think it follows along the same thing as like um I enjoy obsessing about it I enjoy getting everything right I enjoy the pieces I enjoy the layout and like I spend way too much time on it if I only was optimizing for money which I'm not I mean it's a component but it's not the only thing I actually love hearing you talk about journalism because I think it's like an interesting look you know
(1:05:20) anytime you hear someone talk about something they love it's like a really great Insight what do you like like I hear you talk about strength curves yeah I feel like we'll do that with the equipment because it'll make more sense there yeah yeah but I think I think the I think at least for me like everybody I think most people I'll say this way regardless of culture all cultures respect excellence and Excellence comes from Nuance of understanding and so people look at bodybuilders for example and they see them one stage and they're like oh my God that's so gross and it's because they don't have
(1:05:56) any level of appreciation for the many things that go into that not just the effort but even from a product perspective they're like wow look at how look at his delts compared to his biceps look at where his muscle bellies tie in look at um look at his lat but look how small he was able to keep his waist while also building such a big back look at his vascularity compared to somebody else who might be more you know grainy whatever and so they usually even have the language to describe what they're seeing and so it's like me trying different wines it just tastes like wine you know what I mean but for a
(1:06:33) kosur they actually get to enjoy wine so much more because they have so many more ways to enjoy it like Eskimos have seven words for snow and we only have one because they have more experience with snow so they have a deeper understanding of it and so I think most people respect excellence and Excellence only comes from depth it comes from exposing yourself to the same thing for many many many many periods of time so that you can pick up those little nuances of you know what actually if I move my my my wrist this way when I do this one I get that little bit at the end and if I if I
(1:07:04) change my my chair angle I actually get this other really cool piece and you know what if I put my thing on my you know if I put my dumbbells on my legs first before I put them over my head I actually get a different you know stimulus or whatever it is um and like that just comes from reps which is why there's a really great I mean in the iron game there's a great culture of passing down these little nuan es and that's kind of like all apprenticeships even though it's not a work for a job well I guess for the top bodybuilders it is but for most people it's not a job but there's a there's a craft to it
(1:07:37) and I think just being a student of the Craft um is the goal you think we've lost some of that craftsmanship yeah [Laughter] 100% yeah I mean I mean we've it's just the crafts have changed you know I mean like developer wasn't a craft you know before um I mean shoot making media wasn't a craft uh you know quote being an influencer making content wasn't a craft like these are all crafts there's just new crafts that replaced old crafts um but Excellence is always respected across cultures and across times like if we go into the future and there's some new thing that I've ever heard of but I find out that this guy's exceptional at it I
(1:08:12) will respect him for the effort and so like chunked down one or chunked up one um I believe that effort is the universal currency of respect and so this is also for the guys who are out there um who want to be more respected you will always get respect for work Chinese Mexican black white asian gay straight whatever you work your ass off people will respect you for it now the problem comes when you think you're working your ass off but you really aren't working that hard and that's where the disconnect is it's be like I work so hard but it's kind of like the um like the 10 hours of prep for a
(1:08:53) presentation versus 30 it's like you think you're working hard until you see what hard looks like and then you're like I wasn't even working nearly as hard but I see that as encouraging because it means that so many people have so much underutilized potential because they just haven't even learned how to work I remember when I did my um I did a legal internship in France so I had to do translating legal documents from French to English um horrible honestly just terrible work and um uh yeah I was because I thought because people were like you're good at writing you're persuasive you should be a lawyer and I was like sure I'll try that so I
(1:09:25) went to a called ARA um and I did I did my summer internship there my junior year and there was this uh partner at the basically the it was corporate law but it was equivalent of a partner um who was there and she walked by my office and she like I think she might have talked to me one other time like just to like welcome me to the office and this was the only other time she ever spoke to me and so she uh she like did one of these like PE peaked her head into my hole or whatever they where they kept me to like translate documents and uh she was like you know how's it coming
(1:10:01) or whatever and I was like I was like man I was like I'm just I'm just working really hard on this and just trying to was like just I'm just working really hard and she just like looked at me and she just laughed and I was like what the what and she was like you don't even know how to work and I I just remember thinking that and then and then she just walked away and um and I I I went to the guy who was like two years above me I was like I was basically trying you know you'd get his job as like the lowest level I was like
(1:10:34) his peon right and I was like what the  and uh he's like yeah like she like they work so many more hours than we do and like have so much higher Stakes than we do he's like you're just translating documents dude like if you get something wrong it's on them not on you and I remember thinking about that because like I thought I was working really hard but they had to go review everything to make sure I didn't mess up and especially in a in a in a job like law where you usually have billable hours like you literally in order to get paid you have
(1:11:11) to spend time like it's just like it just it's just so clearly connected that those people just kill themselves in terms of the amount of work that they they put out and now that I'm at my at my position now I 100% C gr like I didn't know how to work like I was like the idea that I could work like she was like you don't even know how to work yet and um and it was only later that I had a different guy was like you'll learn when you get older they're like it just T it takes time to learn the skill of effort and so I really genuinely believe
(1:11:46) that succeeding isn't hard learning how to try is hard once you learn how to try if you just try at anything compared to other people you'll win because everyone the bar is so low to win nowadays even like and I I'll give the you know the objective stats for guys it's like if you're the average guy you're $1,000 in debt you're overweight and like that's the average and so like if you're just not in debt and not overweight you're already above average like that's it like that's the that's the bar it's just because no one knows how to try and no one knows how to like suck for a little bit and you only
(1:12:24) have to suck for a little bit once because then you learn that sucking for a little bit has a payoff and then you can just extrapolate that you know over and over again but you just have to make it through the first one but no one's willing to do that cuz they care so much about what everyone else thinks and they feel like they should immediately be good because that's what social media tells them when you're working there's kind of like billable hours and not it's like there's work that actually counts and there's work that's kind of just like work and the ability to distinguish between that probably matters a lot
(1:12:49) M um I mean I measur myself on output based on how much of the work that I do is correct and done and so I can usually see if my rate of work has slowed down um because I've been doing this for a long enough period of time that I can tell when my you know if I'm making slides for a presentation that it's like my rate of work starts to really drop or my quality of work starts to drop or from writing my quality or my speed starts to drop so like I know when that happens sometimes it takes longer to get there sometimes it takes less time um I think that does take some time I think
(1:13:20) in the beginning though you should expect junk work as in like junk volume where this is a hard one but you have to get over it is that while you're still learning it let's say you reached your point of Maximum like production at you know hour five and then you still have like another five hours of work I would say do the extra hours of work because you won't know what that limit is until you get there and if the next five hours will work when you come back the next day you look at it with fresh eyes and
(1:13:45) you say like this isn't good enough I wouldn't see it as a loss I would see that your ability to see that it wasn't good enough you would only be able to do if you had already done the 5 hours of junk work and that still got you further ahead than if you hadn't done it at all and so even if I delete everything I still have everything in my head so like for example we've made videos before where we'll do the entire video and at the very end we're like I feel like we could just do that one again and make it better and then we do it again and it is
(1:14:14) way better so it's not the first video was a waste it was the first video set up the second video or the first and second set up the third and so Leeds had 19 drafts like the 18th set up the 19 18 and it's not that the first 18 were waste it was just that they were steps and so it's just that I mean I'll go biblical on you again um but uh I can't remember the proverb but it says uh in all work there is profit uh which I like the more rhetorical way of saying like uh the work works on you more than you work on it which is that you always benefit from
(1:14:49) work in all work there is profit in all work there is benefit and because like the five hours extra that you do editing and then you realize the next day it's not that that wasn't profitable for you it's not that you didn't benefit from it you benefited from it and then once you benefit from it that comes back out again and the work benefits and so I used to say this when I was um growing business earlier I said either the business grows or I grow or both but like one of them is happening because if the business is growing great I might not be growing at all maybe I am but the business is growing for sure the business stops
(1:15:26) growing it's getting hard so I start growing and then once I grow enough the business starts growing again and so like growth is always happening it's just where you're measuring it right so let's say someone's been following this video it's like step one they they broke the belief that they need to be happy it's useful you know step two find intrinsic value in in the process of improving step three but how like for you was it going into environments where you learned you saw people being useful you saw people working how could someone do that if they're young and everything comes down to F figuring out what the
(1:16:00) input output equation is if you don't know the input output equation of getting good at your skill you will be lost until you find it and so like if you want to be a good coder it's $10,000 of coding if you want to be a good editor it's $10,000 editing you want to be a good salesman it's $10,000 hours on the phone if you want to be like it just is and so for me as soon as I figure that out then I just want to start chipping away at it as fast as I can and so if it's like I can do 10,000 hours over 10 years or I can do it over four years you know it's funny because people see a 200,000 hour work year but there's like
(1:16:29) there's so many more hours than that like it's ridiculous there's so many more hours than 2,000 hours like there's 104 days of the year that are weekends and if you add in federal holidays and two weeks of paid vacation you have 129 days a year out of 365 and of the of the remaining days that you quote work you work eight of the 24 so like there's so many more hours that you can that you can do stuff and get better than people give themselves credit for and so it's just about see I was like I was I'm used to add my little
(1:17:07) tick for where my ring is um find the input output equation and then dump as much as you possibly can into the input side and get rid of everything that interferes with it which also means the people in your life who interfere with you doing the input out of equation um the environmental cues so as in like if you like I work in as as closely as I can in no windows no sound that's how I work I don't want any distraction some people work better with whatever I have a hard time believing that maybe they enjoy working more I doubt they work
(1:17:42) better some people are like I listen to music when I work there's just a ton of research that shows that that's just like empirically you work less well like you just don't now uh instrumental that doesn't have words words maybe but like you're using horsepower listening to words period and so I want all horsepower like even if you're bouncing on your chair like you're using brain power and so I want to use nothing I want to use 100% of my power on the task at hand and that's it and and that means that if I have also stressors outside of my life people who
(1:18:13) are bothering me not just like you know people literally interrupting me but just problems it's like I want to resolve those so that I can put all my attention here because if I'm trying to type it I'm thinking about you know this snafu I had with somebody deal with the snafu and then you'll be able to work more clearly what if someone doesn't know what they want to apply the input into yet like they don't know that it's writing they don't know that it's yeah um I think that it would behoove you so like everything's so okay it's the fallacy of the perfect
(1:18:53) pick so people think when they're starting out one that they should find something they're passionate about um two that the first thing they pick is the last thing they're going to do for the rest of their life and I think both of those are false so we'll start with the first one so the fallacy of finding your purpose or finding your passion excuse me is that you're going to love something so much that you immediately fall in love with it some people do the vast majority don't and real real I liked Fitness but as soon as I started my gym which I thought was quote pursuing my passion my life stopped being about
(1:19:27) Fitness it was about business and then I had to learn that and I sucked at it and so like even the idea that I'm just going to do my passion isn't even the reality of quote doing your passion because doing my passion became work and I started hiring trainers and getting systematizing onboarding and getting them trained up so they wouldn't suck on the floor because I had to do other things and all of a sudden I made my quote passion into work as other people Define work um and so you create passion you don't find it um
(1:20:02) and you create it by being willing to suck for a very long period of time until you get good and then when you get good at stuff you tend to like it one the second fallacy was that you whatever you is the perfect pick is that you're going to pick the perfect thing the first time life is long people change career directories more now than ever before and so I prefer the process of approximation which is can I just get directional and then iterate and so it's like okay do you like words or do you like numbers people are like I like
(1:20:39) numbers okay all these careers probably not for you great one directional change all right and then within there it's like okay do I Like Money numbers or do I like data numbers or do I like computer numbers it's like okay I like data numbers great so now now we're already in like a zillion career paths in this direction but the thing is is that if you then start getting good at becoming a data analyst for an oil company and then you decide that you want to Pivot into into media buying there's going to be a lot of generalizable skills there because it was all about data and you did have to learn a lot of stuff and what I will say
(1:21:18) is that you get these unique carryovers that only you will have and so so Steve Jobs tells a story about how he took calligraphy right and it seemed useless at the time and then fast forward when they had the Mac they started having different fonts and they only have different fonts because Steve Jobs that one time took calligraphy and so the lessons you learn on the first thing you do don't become apparent sometimes until the third fourth or fifth thing you do but that third fourth or fifth thing you do the fact that you did that first thing gives you unique Advantage compared to everyone else who didn't and so following the tried andr
(1:21:53) path there's nothing wrong with that but there's also nothing wrong with learning like there is never a downside to learning more skills period because you are able to create more unique solutions to problems that you get presented with in the future because of things you've done in the past and so I'm sure that like right now there's not a lot of really jacked investors there AR but I'll bet you that there are things that I have taken from my bodybuilding and powerlifting past that I can see more uniquely than some
(1:22:25) of them can and I know more about Fitness industry Investments than probably they do both from a consumer and from an owner I know like I still get calls from many many like multi-billion dollar portfolio owners they're like hey we're about to invest in this chain of gyms what do you think and I've swayed multi-billions of dollars of decisions being like I think they're a dog I think they're going to go down and here's why and they're like  we didn't see that in the data I'm like yeah but if you were in you'd know that and so but I wouldn't if I was just another data analyst they'd never call
(1:22:53) me and so the idea of the perfect pit perfect pick is just a fallacy so pick a direction it's just closer or further this is closer okay cool getting warm think think about getting warm getting hot rather than this is it and so then you can start approximating and the work that you did on a warm before it gets hot isn't wasted because you have a new lens that other people who just went straight there won't have even if it takes you longer because again life's super long Andrew churn and Peggy churn who started Express they're they're Deca billionaires now they started their first location at 40 years ago but he's
(1:23:32) 75 now so he wasn't like young he was 35 start first location first right like and they're richer than most people are or will ever be and so like if it takes you 10 years or 20 years um it's fine but I'll also bet you that they now I have to learn this from them but I'll bet you they did things before panda press that had nothing to do with running Chinese chicken shops right but those skills still translated over I was a Management Consultant at space cyber and intelligence for the military before starting a gym how does that translate
(1:24:09) well I learned a Consulting process and the learning of Consulting process is learning how to solve problems and so I use that with my gyms because the Consulting process you go to experts and you ask them what they do so I started interviewing all these gym owners because they were willing to talk about their gyms and I would drive out there every weekend because I had time and I would just spend time with the gym and I'd be like how do you onboard people what do your contracts look like what terms do you use how do you do with cancellations how do you do with turn
(1:24:32) how do you do with the cin cards and I would ask all of them and every once in a while some be like oh I do that that's good I'll take that one down I'll steal that from me and I would just do that over and over and over again but I got that from Consulting other gym owners didn't apply Consulting for him because they weren't Consultants first so if I had maybe started straight into gym ownership right out of college rather than taking two years to be a consultant I might not have gone as far so like
(1:24:54) what felt like a complete waste of time when I was in it which it did might have been the thing that made me succeed in the next thing and so even if you're in it right now the only thing that I can say is that you want to try as hard as you can and get as many skills as you can in that field even if you don't think you're going to use it later and I'll wrap this with this um if you guys haven't seen it it's it's a worthwhile movie it's something called um Slum Dog Millionaire so the premise of the movie is this kid in the slums in India um it basically just tells his
(1:25:22) story of just like trials and tribulations he just says bad luck after bad luck after bad luck the whole movie and then by chance at the end of the movie he gets on their equivalent of uh Who Wants To Be A Millionaire and so I think it's like 12 questions or something it's 12 or 20 I don't remember questions that they ask and by Chance the haphazard crazy bad situations that this guy is in his whole life amount to him winning and and answering each of the questions correctly and so a lot of times we just
(1:25:59) need to expand the time Rison and realize that we might be playing our own Slum Dog Millionaire movie it's just that we're in like the third we're we're learning the answer to the third question right now even though we're just getting kicked in the nuts and so I think if you have that frame and remember that the worst thing that can ever happen is that you die and you're going to die no matter what it lowers the stakes a little bit dude D Man

Transcript:
(00:00) a hundred billion company this is a pretty exciting time for entrepreneurship you're at that point in your stage like this gets important the cost of failure of starting a business today is by far the lowest has ever been business advice to Harley 10 years ago you got one thing you can tell welcome everybody to the game I got a special episode for you guys today as you know I do not have many guests on my podcast I don't like sharing the spotlight um so if somebody's going to be on they've got to be really really
(00:29) special and have true expertise uh to give and I think uh the person that I have with me today or that will be joining us today definitely meets that in Spades and so Harley is uh a god amongst men a legend in in the making and uh runs a a small company you may not have heard of it uh Shopify uh which right now is a publicly traded company it's worth right now I think it was 80 billion uh if I'm not mistaken harly correct me there closer to closer to 100 billion but yeah that was 20 billion off you you just ramed it down by 2020 billion which for someone like me like you know this is like I
(01:08) don't come from this world this is you know I'm I'm a tourist here uh that's a lot of money so a hundred billion doll company so that's uh so 10 10 figures is a billion 11 12 a 12 fig company there you go um and just uh the only thing that Rivals the the business success that he has is just the humility uh that he brings to it he was willing to hop on a call with me uh before this and uh we hit it off and uh I was like I just I know my audience would love to talk to you uh and and just kind of hear your
(01:40) perspective of Entrepreneurship and you have such an interesting story that I think will relate to so many people in my audience from the people who are just trying to figure out what they want to do uh to make money all the way to you know right now 20% of my audience is uh you know winning entrepreneurs with you know large companies and and so forth so we definitely have the gamut from an entrepreneurship perspective kind of beginning middle and end and um yeah so thank you so much for taking the time to join us today it's a great honor to be
(02:06) here Alex thank you so much I'm a big fan of the Pod and I think what you're doing is making Business and Entrepreneurship um I mean very similar to the Mion Chava you're making it more accessible and I think that is the coolest thing in the world this idea that business was out of touch for most people both financially from a capital perspective or because of knowledge and insight and experience I think those days are long over and I think we were going through an entrepreneurial Renaissance right now and I think people like you and and your your community uh
(02:34) is leading the way on in that front well I appreciate it and I mean everything that we do is um just for everybody on the Pod is I know Harley and I agree on this um is to just try and break down as many barriers between where people are and where they want to be right A lot of people have this vision for their lives they want and there are things that get in their way some of them are between your ears some of them are between your hands and keyboard and so Shopify has taken a lot of that between hands and keyboard out of the way to decrease the
(02:58) friction of actually getting a product launch get it online actually get customers you can do it from anywhere in the world which is uh again something that 30 years ago just wasn't really a thing and now everyone can have access to this Stu so um I'm gonna go I'm gonna kind of break this uh po into three kind of sections Loosely uh so first kind of Chunk I want to talk about looking back and I think that'll that'll relate to a lot of people who are listening or watching right now kind of like Zero to
(03:24) Hero like what what got you to hear and all the things that that that come with that uh Second chunk will go over what's hero to to superhero right like what is what's the for what's forward look like what's the future look what do you see um and I'll dive into some more you know specific details around that stuff and then at the very end we'll go kind of like final nuggets and wrapping it up of of like forward and backwards what are kind of like the principles and truths that um that you would try and pass on to the people who are listening cool it
(03:51) let's do it all right that's our road map so I know a little bit about the story but my audience doesn't um so you have this really unique thing of being employee W and customer one can you walk us through like just the beginning of shop like even the decision to jump into Shopify what what the risks that were associated with that what was life prior to that and then like what what were the this the the factors that got you into that um step one because I think that's where a lot of people are right now yeah uh so I was born in Montreal I was born in Canada uh I moved to South Florida
(04:24) with my parents and my sisters when I was very young uh I was always entrepreneurial my parents did not have a lot of money um but my father to his credit uh my dad's an immigrant he came to Canada from Hungary in the revolution my grandparents are Holocaust Survivors I mean we are you know we were we were poor immigrants um and although my dad never had much money to give me because I always had these little silly business ideas when I was a kid what my dad did for me which was very valuable was even
(04:51) like when I was like 10 years old every silly business idea that I had he would validate it by actually making me these business cards that would say the name of the business and my name on it and I'm now a dad I have two daughters Bailey and Zoe who are five and seven and now that I think about parenting and stuff I'm I'm like I think a lot more about that that story and those stories of my father making those business cards because at the time it didn't seem that profound and in hindsite now as you know a father myself I realized these small things that we do for our kids have this
(05:21) massive impact and so even though these businesses were all very silly you know uh trading like trading cards and lemonade stands and eventually a DJ business when I was 13 years old I was always an entrepreneurial kid and partially was because I thought entrepreneurship was this fun activity like I I wasn't really into sports playing them or watching them uh I wasn't really into video games I was kind of into like this idea of like you know selling something and that was always fun for me uh moved to South
(05:46) Florida went uh finished high school there and moved back to Canada when I was 17 in 2001 to go to Mill University uh Migel is in Montreal where where I live now I went to Miguel because it was cheap my parents didn't have much money and so because because I was born in Canada I kind of got this like instate tuition thing unfortunately very quickly uh once I moved to uh to Montreal to sort of Migel my dad got into some trouble and our family lost everything and once again I sort of you know pulled out this tool that I'd been tinkering with throughout my life called
(06:18) entrepreneurship um to to make some money I started t-shirt business when I was at Miguel made t-shirts for a bunch of universities across Canada like the promotional t-shirts you got the first day of school fro Frost or orientation uh stuff and I loved it it was great I wasn't necessarily passionate about t-shirts but I love this sort of idea of of of been a being able to support myself and and help my my family I was really can i h on this real quick because I think absolutely jump in anywhere you want yeah the the point that Harley just made I just want to
(06:48) underline which is that the first business he had one I don't think that you thought this was going to be the business I will have for the rest of my life this is my dream this is my vision you were trying to make money right that's all is um and I think a lot of uh people who are aspiring are trying to find this like perfect puzzle piece that's going to fit all of these things it's going to be my passion it's can be fulfilling it can be the next Amazon when a lot of times I think it's a big fallacy because the first business just gives you a little bit of like to show you what the next
(07:17) step to take is because you learn a bunch of stuff from that first business that's right and so I just want to just take the pause for the audience that everyone's like I got to find the perfect thing when promo shirts for freshman and sophomores it glamorous right it's it's it's not glamorous and in fact the only unfair advantage that I had was that I was selling T-shirts to a customer who was who I also was part of that demographic meaning like I was selling T-shirts to the student council treasurer or procurement office so they can give them out to students and I myself was a student and so the pitch
(07:49) that I made was that one I very low overhead because it's just me I was I was the CEO and the janitor I was I was printing t-shirts myself uh so one I'm going to be cheaper two I'm going to care a lot because I really need this to work and three I'm going to make t-shirts for people like me and so I I kind of know what your students want because I myself and one of your students um just to go step back because I you said was super interesting so I sort of skipped over this but when I was 13 years old the the business that really got start like started me an entrepreneurship a real business was
(08:18) again I was 13 so uh you know uh I wouldn't put too much you know uh Credence on the fact that it was a real business but it was a real thing was I wanted to be a DJ I was I'm Jewish I went to a lot of bar mitzvah when I was 13 years old and I thought the DJs were the coolest people in the world they were sort of magicians in my mind they would take a group of people that were sitting down eating some rubber chicken dinner in some Hotel ballroom and like three minutes later using their voice and using lighting and and music there' be a conga line I just thought they were just they were like magicians I called
(08:50) around a bunch of DJ companies to ask them if they would hire me and of course they said no because I was 13 had no experience and and didn't know how to DJ um but because I had this sort of you know like silly confidence that that these business cards had provided for me I had this idea to start my own DJ company and hire myself so that was sort of when this idea of Entrepreneurship as a tool to solve problems was sort of cemented in my in my very you know immature young brain and then when I needed to make money again at 17 I was
(09:20) an undergrad in college I once again I didn't even think about you know I should go get a job somewhere immediately my thought was all right I got to start another business to make some money here so it began I I began to form this what what is now effectively my I think it's shopify's Mission it's also my personal mission which is an entrepreneurship is this incredibly powerful tool because it's Democratic and it allows anyone and anybody around to start something with very little and doesn't matter who you are what your last name is and and who your parents are my parents were nobody's it matters
(09:50) how much value you add and so I ran this t-shir business all throughout college and developed a really good set of mentors along the way people that I sort of met and some people were lawyers and others were these random entrepreneurs and you know Dove Charney from American Apparel now he's sort of I guess disgraced but at the time he was a very big deal uh starting American Apparel he was another Jewish entrepreneur from Montreal and I met these people along the way and one of those Entre one of those mentors convinced me uh to when I finished college to go to law school not
(10:21) to become a lawyer but rather to become a better entrepreneur almost like finishing school for entrepreneurship and I was uh incredibly impressionable I was 21 when I was finishing College again I had a little bit of money from the t-shirts but not much and he said look I'm going to teach law next year at the University of Ottawa which is the capital of Canada why don't you come to Ottawa go to go to law school here I'll be in town I can sort of help you navigate the city um and and you'll go to law school not with the mandate to to to get called to the bar or ever
(10:50) litigate or practice law but rather as a way to accumulate more skills that will be very valuable as you think about scaling a business longer term and so was 2005 moved to Ottawa no friends no family there um and by this point entrepreneurship was a part of my you my identity and so like I always did when I moved to a new place I I asked where the entrepreneurs hung out and very very fortunately very luckily I was directed to a coffee shop and I was told that there's a group of entrepreneurs that hung out at this coffee shop every Friday evening and they called themselves the young entrepreneurs Club
(11:25) the YC and um I started showing up there every Friday and meeting these young entrepreneurs and one of those entrepreneurs was This brilliant programmer uh named Toby who had just moved to Canada I think couple about a year earlier from Germany and he moved to Canada because he met a girl and he wanted to go be close to that girl her name is as all people move for that reason very good very good reason love is always a good reason to move somewhere uh and Toby had moved to Canada from Germany didn't have papers to work and so he was told that even as
(11:54) a new immigrant he could start a business and being in Canada where it's very cold a lot of snow he loves snowboarding he decided he wanted to build a snowboard shop on the internet in 2005 there were two ways to sell a product on the Internet the first way was to sell through a Marketplace at the time like eBay was really the more the most prominent one uh Amazon I don't think at the time alive for third-party sellers it was still a first-party Marketplace so You' eBay and you had a bunch of these sort of very nichy
(12:23) marketplaces but eBay being the big one so you could sell on a Marketplace or you would pay a company like IBM they had websphere or Oracle or at or um or sap all these big Enterprise companies had some sort of e-commerce functionality for very large Enterprises for like Walmart yeah uh and and that would be like a couple million bucks and Toby did not like the idea of of renting customers from a Marketplace and he did not like the idea of well he didn't have a million dollars to spend on on Enterprise software so that was impossible so he wrote this piece of
(12:54) software um using Ruby on Rails where he was a sort of core developer of Ruby on Rails nearly days with dhh and a bunch of really interesting people and he wrote this piece of ser to sell his snowboards and that's around the time where I met him he was like just you selling these snowboards and it was it was a really neat little business he was making real money and around that and and and again I was I'm in law school now and so I'd ask him if I can use um the software uh to sell my own my own products which in my case would be t-shirts and by that point he had already sort of figured out that the snowboard business was a good idea but
(13:26) the software that he had written uh to sell these snowboards was a great great idea and uh and and shortly thereafter I ended up uh building a store on Shopify this is 2006 at the time and I became one of the first people to use what would become uh at the time it was called jaded pixel it wasn't actually called Shopify originally um and I would be one of the first people to use the software and I built this I I ran this t-shirt business as direct to Consumer licensed t-shirt business all throughout uh law school and um and that was sort of my first entry into into Shopify
(13:57) meeting Toby and then when I finished uh finished La grad school um I called Toby and said look like I love entrepreneurship it's it's everything I I think it's it's the greatest thing for me it's my passion my hobby I wanted I want to increase the surface area for more people and honestly what I experien building a beautiful scalable store sitting in my tax law class on Shopify um I think more people should experience that and um and I joined him about a year later in in 2009 or so uh and I was like the first engineer to join the
(14:30) company uh and uh and it was amazing it was one of the greatest I mean I just it was I have really fond memories of those very early days but that's uh long answer short a question of how I got the Shopify no this is perfect because that's this is a great pause point because there I was writing down some notes just for the audience um and then I want to definitely we're going to go from like okay you're now in Shopify and what are trials and tribulations because of course I'm sure going from that to 100 billion was probably just straight line very smooth sailing you haven't had
(14:59) any issue um and I'm sure everyone will be glad to hear that very short story but we'll get to that one um but just everyone who's listening number one um the first business that Harley started was just for money and it wasn't just some magical thing that was going to be perfect he did what he had to do and he learned a ton of skills that really valuable along the way second thing is that uh and I want to emphasize this is people a lot of times are like man I don't know what to sell or what business should I start and I think the easiest
(15:24) one to use is just solve your own problem scratch your own edch totally like almost every business I've had well every every really good business I've had has come from that which is like like I mean even the the the furthest one we have now because not comom a family office and I wish I had had this available to me when I was scaling up our companies like somebody who'd already been there sold multiple times and like had a vested interest Etc um but scratching your own itch um also I want to highlight some people kind of get segmented in one thing or the other like you did a physical products business but earlier you done a DJ thing
(15:52) even though it was not you know you made money so you made a profit and so like in my mind like self-employed whatever like it was a service based business so you had a service business and you also had a physical product bus so you were flexible in terms of how you were willing to make money and I wasn I was agnostic to what I was selling I mean to your point you know I I I think one of the easiest ways to figure out what to sell you you know you said scratch your own itch another way to do it is simply just to like tell a bunch of people that
(16:16) you're thinking of starting a business and just leave it out in The Ether the reason that I started selling T-shirts to universities was as I told people that my dad wasn't around anymore mom had no money I needed to make some money I need to start a business the more people people I I spoke to about that a lot of the ideas that I got were dumb but but more and more people started telling me hey what about this hey what about that most of the things that they mentioned were not great ideas but then
(16:40) someone randomly his name is Jamie once told told me remember this like day perfectly clear he said hey just so you know Migel spends $25,000 a semester on uh on t-shirts on printed Li on printed promotional t-shirts it turned out he was wrong these universities spent a quarter million dollars be way harder than that right but because I was putting it out there this thing that I was looking sort of business a bunch of people sort of became almost like um my my my idea generation machine and so this whole idea that like I know there's there's a lot out there about like don't tell
(17:14) people your goals and and and and keep things to yourself I I call I think do things and tell people is super important even at the early stages of starting these things well I'm a big I mean my second book $100 million leads uh advertising is the process of making known and so if no one knows about your stuff no one can buy it they must first know about it in order to buy it and so if you just think about it from a first principal's perspective ain't no customers if they don't know uh so first way to do that so
(17:41) two things that I also want to highlight so you talked about two different types of people that you surround yourself with one was mentors so just for everyone in my audience we're talking people ahead right and then the other thing was the community of peers right he had the coffee shop where you met Toby who ultimately you know got got you into this thing again by chance but both of those thing increase your luck surface area the amount of different potential opportunities for exposing opportunity well yeah and so um I just
(18:04) want to highlight that because a lot of people feel like entrepreneurship is lonely and it can be but to a degree it is a choice right and if you can't physically move environments uh you can do it online now and that wasn't available back then but now we've got online communities we've got school we've got you know all these things where people can connect um and when I say School SK o.
(18:23) com school um people can actually connect and meet one another all right now uh the last one is resourcefulness and this kind of ties well to kind of the next the next chapter of this journey which is that like you did all this stuff like you Toby wrote code so that he could so he could sell his snowboards right like it's there's just there's a there's this whole like everything of course our whole mission is to make things easier make things more accessible to people but on some level like it's the fact that it becomes difficult is what makes the goal worthwhile right and if if everyone could do it then one would do
(18:59) it and then it would no longer be worthy right everyone can tie their shoes everyone can get dressed and so no one's like congratulations there's this whole um I think Chris Rock's kit where he's like what do you want a cookie he's like man I ain't never been prison he's like you ain't supposed to go to jail right and he goes this whole thing and so right now like the fact that it's difficult is just another barrier that somebody you might have to compete with will have to go over and so it gives yourself a little stripe that you can um show yourself about who you really are
(19:24) all right also remember remember this if you kind to think about like if you kind of um go back to I don't know go back 200 years and you think about starting a business um the one thing that besides Capital to get started and knowledge and understanding and Technology to help you do it forget all that stuff for a second one of the big risks of starting a business historically was that the cost of failure could affect your life in a very adverse way meaning um when my grandfather came to North America from Eastern Europe he started an egg business he had a little egg stall at at
(19:55) at a local farmers market which actually still stands today my uncle currently run runs it um but he had to take a loan out on his home in order to afford the the fee and the the cost of actually renting this particular stall if this did not work the result of that would be no food on the table no roof over their head and that is that is effectively how businesses were built so that people with more Capital were able to take more risks people that had more Capital were able to invest more uh people that had more Capital were able to have you know
(20:27) be able to mitigate the cost of failure well one thing that has changed dramatically and I would say today like literally right now Alex you and I are talking about this the cost of failure of starting a business today is by far the lowest it's ever been whether you use a product like Shopify or use whatever you decide to do the cost of failure is effectively $39 if it works you scale it um literally like three feet from me I have um was a gift um from Ben Francis who's the founder of gym shark and it's a Christmas gift he
(20:58) gave a holiday gift he gave me it's the original screen print from the original jimm shark uh the first t-shirt he made it was it was Ben's been a big part of my life and I've been I think a big part of his life and so his gift was the original screen that created the first t-shirt uh for Jim shark when Ben started it was 2012 out of his dorm room if it would have gone if it would have failed he would have gone back to class I mean he was literally also delivering pizzas I think for Pizza Hut at the time if I get that right or some some pizza company but if it worked he would go on
(21:29) to build a multi-billion dollar company called gym shark so think about that the upside and that was 2012 that was like you know 12 years ago the upside today of starting a business is effectively infinite growth if you do it well and you're smart and you're adding Great Value the down side is a couple less cups of coffee or a couple less Starbucks uh for that week that is remarkable and I think that um I mean if there's anything that like there's one underlying Point here it's the um it's risky adusted return right is that
(22:00) everyone here now can get endless shots on go right now because of how accessible entrepreneurship is you basically just keep taking lottery tickets and if you lose then you just buy another scratch off right and you try it again and so you still have the upside except the thing is is it's not rigged for you to lose like there actually is a lot of people who want you to win and there's an entire economy around you um well not just that right now what that's created is nearly a quarter 25% of us consumers in 2024 are considering starting a business that's
(22:29) the highest I believe it's ever been number two is since 2021 there's been 15.5 million new business applications in the US an 85% increase from 2004 to 2021 the White House put out a bunch of stats on this recently I mean that is the reason that it's happening is not just because technolog is getting better and not just because of great podcast like like and content like you're putting out there it's because people are realizing that entrepreneurship may be the vehicle for them to actually find their life's work make their life better
(22:59) create Independence like do the thing that they love most this is a pretty exciting time for entrepreneurship and I think the cost of failure thing is a big part of it so now you're employee number one non non-developer employee number one you've you've used the product you fell in love with it and this is now aligned with your calling so walk me through kind of the the stages of growth and I'll if you can give kind of like internal external so this is what was happening externally Maybe Revenue levels customer levels
(23:29) things like that and then mirrored what does that look like internally so I'm shifting a little bit towards my my business owners right now all right so now we're talking like okay we've got the business we're we're generating Revenue are is it cash flow positive do they have investor like how how what's yeah just give me the the scoop so we were bootstrapped um we had um a very very small angel investor um in early on which um his name is John um he's he's now a multi-billionaire I believe um and so is his wife uh separately because she also put some
(24:00) money in but it was a very small amount of money we were bootstrap we were profitable um and we we when I joined we didn't have a CFO we didn't have a CMO I mean part of what I viewed my role as and anyone who's listening who was joining a very early stage company uh as a non-engineer like the person not running you know writing code um or or Building Product the the role that I wanted to that I felt I should play and that I I think I did play was this Swiss army knife let me figure out everything and
(24:31) anything that is going to be valuable to the people that are writing code and whether that's commercialization or sales or support or I mean literally figuring out like where we're going to like work at of like like figure negotiating the lease uh for it or um figuring out you know what are we who are we paying for I think we were paying Rackspace at the time like negotiating a Rackspace contract I think at the time we only had one payment integration which was the PayPal negotiating the PayPal rev share in those very early days this sort of Swiss army knife type
(25:00) model I think was really really important because I mean the the you can be the greatest salesperson or marketer in the world if you have a great product matched with a great ability to sell and commercialize that's where this thing gets really interesting and I deeply believe that Shopify even back you know in 2010 had this incredible product Leaps and Bounds uh better than all the competition the competition at the time was like Yahoo stores or a couple other like that but very very few competitors
(25:30) and so this idea of being a Swiss army knife was important and that's what I did I you know if there was an opportunity for me to tell the story publicly um to a local newspaper in in Ottawa Canada I would take that opportunity if there was an opportunity for me to help someone get a job done internally I would take that opportunity but that Swiss army knife was that that sort of model of that was very very help helpful and as part of that um I think I earned the trust of of Toby in particular but but also you know the other engineers because I was just there
(26:00) to add value that's it in fact um i' I'd actually been called to the bar and so I think my like I was I was also the company's lawyer and again I I've been out of law school for all of 10 months I think at that point but whatever I could do I was going to do that and it was only a couple years later we we raised our series a about a year later I think it was a $7 million uh investment from besser who L it um on a $25 million I think post um and then and that's really when we began to realize that okay there is a real there there that this company could be something remarkable large
(26:35) scalable and we can really make it dent on at the time it was really we were focused on smbs and e-commerce only very different than today where we do business of all sizes and Retail everywhere but it was smbs and and and it was it was e-commerce only and it was only until you know after our series B and C that we began really figuring out like okay what what are each other's superpowers and and this idea of rather than all of us become these sort of well-rounded objects these sort of riverstones what if we all were very
(27:05) precise on the thing that we think we could be the best in the world at and spend our time level did you start doing that so if we're walking through this because right now probably around probably like around series b or series C we began we hired a CFO we hired a CMO we hired a had of sales it was around that time where we felt we were well capitalized I think our our series B was about 100100 million valuation uh this is like 2013 or so around that time don't uh have no mean yeah I'm not sure a lot less than than $100 million
(27:37) many employees were around then just I'm just trying to give uh probably uh probably 50 to 100 at that point okay yeah yeah okay got it so like small midsize got it okay cool um and and a lot of what we were trying to do then is like find you know find at least a lot how I spend my time was find new channels so this idea that okay we can only sell so many people on Shopify but there's this ma massive EOS system of web agencies and Freelancers and developers who are in Oklahoma and are in you know uh places like South America
(28:07) and they're in Singapore and they're in Vancouver and they're in you know New Mexico and what if we actually created something whereby if someone walked in to their agency to their business and said I need an online store what could we do to actually make it so that they would say by default great we'll build it on Shopify that's sort of on the referral side on the product side another thing that was really um that we created around that time was the shopy app store which I believe today is one of the largest ecosystems of thirdparty developers on the planet I mean if you
(28:39) are building an app for Commerce today the best most effective goom Market strategy is to put in the shopy app store because you have millions of of customers free applications that that now seems you know polished and and a really healthy kind of flywheel of an ecosystem but originally the reason that the app stores really set up was all these different Merchants were coming to us and they all had a very unique and and a very particular business and so we really focused on let's make Shopify core offering what most people need most of the time checkout payments inventory
(29:11) marketing anal analytics let's make that like world class but everything that is very specific to a particular Merchants business let's invite third parties from all over the world to build apps on top of it which meant that no matter what the particular needs of your business might be you would find 100% product Market fit using Shopify because of this op ecosystem and we didn't have to build everything ourself which would have been impossible and so some of these things now in hindsight seem like wow shop ecosystem is really cool and the App Store is is is is is humming but
(29:42) originally it was done because we couldn't build every feature oursel nor nor should we so what what were some of the like absolute key decisions or like business principles that you learned kind of scaling through this um focus was really important not being everything to everyone I mean today you know um like last week was was the national retail federation's Big Show literally like the most important conference in Enterprise retail um and I I sit on the board now of NRF with like the likes of the CEO of of you know Brian from Target and John from Walmart
(30:13) and like you know these amazing people like that that run effectively all all of retail uh in all over the world and so now we're really obviously you know getting some of the biggest retailers who Shopify but there was absolutely no way we were even considering that in those days because fundamentally we wanted to win our particular Market which was smbs in in English-speaking countries uh they wanted to sell on the internet and so one thing that was really valuable was like Focus don't sort of and a lot of our competitors by the way ended up going out of business because they kind
(30:45) of ran up Market way too soon and they left the entire base of smbs um available um they didn't like the idea that smbs you know some churn and not every business succeeds and we thought well what if we just slightly increased the Chan of success and mitigated the risk if every single person thinking about starting a business like in the in the shower in the morning then did so with Shopify even though not all will succeed as long as the ones that do stay with us indefinitely they will offset the cost of ones that leave and so one was really making sure we were very very focused the second thing that was really
(31:20) important to us I think was that the product was super simple and you know now companies like I don't know Mar or or Mattel or Staples or you know uh uh glossier uh Alo yoga view all these amazing Brands all you Shopify skims like and what's neat even today about Shopify is that the complexity of the product almost reveals itself over time rather than simply being inated with every single feature and functionality Shopify can be used by someone just setting up a store at their mom's kitchen table it also can be used by Trina who runs figs which is a publicly
(31:57) traded company uh they make uniform scrubs uniform scrubs uh hospital scrubs and and the fact that the same codebase can make those things was something that was always important keep it really really simple and credit to Toby and his sort of vision around product because that's really what he he drilled in all of us was that the product has to be incredibly simple so first is focus second is Simplicity and the third one was we really tried to run a really tight business meaning we knew what our sort of CA to LTV ratio is so cost to customer acquisition on one side versus
(32:30) lifetime value and as long I don't know if if you're I want to make sure I Define all the acronyms um my okay okay so we knew what our cact LTV ratio was and once we got it above one effectively it meant that okay now it's time to go raise money because the more dollars we put on the left side the more dollar 80s or whatever the ratio was we got on on on the right side and so by being meticulous and thoughtful about that um I think it was really helpful maybe the last thing I'll say which seems a little bit soft but it's important to say we were really really like patient meaning
(33:01) we want like even today we want to build a 100-year business we're now about 20 years into it we had 80 years left to go but even then when we were you know five eight 10 years in we still thought about this like really long-term business focused which meant that we were not willing to pull forward future profits at a discount like pretty much most of our competitors I think were doing at that point so what were what were some of the key growth kind of levers that you were able to pull throughout this process that like really accelerated
(33:33) like if you had to name the three biggest things in the first 10 years of Shopify that like man if we hadn't done this we wouldn't have been able to get to the next level I mean I think the App Store the ecosystem is really important both on making sure the product had a prod had 100% product Market fit um and also in the referral so I think that was really important because it meant that we had a we had effectively uh a distributed Salesforce that wasn't on our payroll and just something small on that that really matters I remember at the time the Apple iOS store had uh an
(34:04) 8020 rev share split so if you built something um on um on app excuse me it had a 7030 revshare split so you buil something on Apple you as a developer keep 70% 30% goes to Apple and I remember when we were talking about our rev share for our app store we actually said 8020 not that we were competing with the Apple the iOS store I mean we were we were a small little nothing company in Canada but this idea that we would be more generous than the incumbents might be was very important and the truth is the additional 10 10 points didn't really change it for us
(34:37) but it just meant that when you built on Shopify you deeply understood that you were going to get a very fair and a generous rev share split that was one I think the second one uh we we really hammered hard was this thing called um the build of business competition it was like our big aha moment uh and it was you know we we had an article in New York Times about it but it started in a very kind of simple way um we had met Tim Ferris I think in 2009 or so and he became an adviser and Tim is now a very
(35:08) good friend to both my me and Toby And and we've done his pod he's a great guy but Tim looked at Shopify and said great product you guys are missing something most people even though your product is great easy to use and you're making entrepreneurship more accessible most people have a risk adversion to some entrepreneurship for one of two reasons either too expensive or they don't know how to use it and he had this idea that we should create a competition whereby someone would start a brand new business on Shopify um like Jan one and
(35:37) six months later the store with the highest sales would win I think we said $110,000 and then Tim said it's got to be 100,000 we did not have $100,000 to give out that way but our Hope was that by the time the competition ended we would actually have that type of money and we launched the the the first build of business competition uh in 201 10 um and it got us you know I think the article in the New York Times I have to go check but I'm sure your listeners will keep me honest here but I think it's like a startup starts their own
(36:06) startup competition like launches their own startup comp it was because it was kind of a silly thing that we ourselves were starting competition the winner that year was a company called dodo case that made these beautiful um uh beautiful leather iPad cases it was the year the iPad was coming out and so that was one of those ways where if you sort of read sort of the Jeffrey Moore uh I think it's Jeffrey Moore cross in the chasm book where he talks about you know technology adoption Cycles go from early adopters to mainstream it felt like the
(36:32) build the business competition helped us cross the chasm from early adopters to the mainstream and and over over I think we did the build the business competition for like five years after that and ultimately the stores were getting like Jim shark won one year uh and and like some Nick swear won one year like these big companies ended up winning uh but so we couldn't give out 100,000 anymore so we had to come with these new ideas like how do we incentivize the creation new businesses and we did things like the winner would spend a week with Richard Branson on Necker Island and the winner would go and spend like go have lunch with Seth
(37:04) Goden and so we created this really cool stuff but I would say that's probably the second sort of Vector in terms of growth we found a way for us to cross the gasm I just want I'll pause right there we I'm a huge fan of the the build of business competition and oh you know about it oh cool yeah yeah yeah super super well acquainted with it oh that's so bring it up yeah that that was I mean that like that was something that was really really important maybe the third thing that I think was probably um really valuable was we began to look at
(37:32) what are the other things like what is the relationship that our product has in the lives of people that use it and the relationship started to look like when someone said they were going to work in the morning what they meant was they were opening up their Shi admin on their laptop or on their on their desktop so if we were becoming the center of like their day-to-day work where they added products and fulfilled orders and added new SKS and and ran marketing campaigns um what else can we do to be valuable to be helpful there one thing that most
(38:01) people don't realize today uh which is the case I'll bring it back in a second is that if you were to pretend today that Shopify was a single retailer like if you were to aggregate all our stores just in the us alone we would be the second largest online retailer in America after Amazon okay why is it important because if you were the second largest online retailer in America and you go to negotiate rates with payment gateways and shipping companies and Banks and all these different types of andary Services the economy of scale that you have is so massive well even in
(38:34) the early days back going back I know say 2013 2014 or so as we were thinking about adding new features new functionality we call Merchant Solutions we began to think about in that way whereby could we go and negotiate the best rates from from the payment gateways as if we were the second largest retailer we weren't second we were the 20th at that point or the 30 at that point but we were able to get economies of scale because of the aggregated size of our merch merch base and instead of keeping those economies to scale for ourselves we gave them
(39:02) directly to the merchants we took a little bit of margin because we want to make money but we gave so using Shopify you know to buy a domain using Shopify to uh to figure out who's going to process your credit card payments uh in your Merchant Gateway it became much better to you to do it through us than do it on your own and over time that has turned into things like Shopify payments and Shopify capital and Shopify shipping all these big parts of our business today were built on this philosophy that we have an unfair Advantage because these economies of
(39:32) scale and if we give it to Merchants it means that Shopify plays an even larger role in their lives so the three big growth strategies the first one is you had referral Partners so you made it easy for other people to basically work on the platform and promote your platform because if if you're a web agency and people want to store then if you make it easy for them and maybe they get some sort of financial incentive to and they got they got a REV share for it yeah we gave them a REV share I think at the time in perpetuity like 20% of
(39:56) whatever we took they got which is awesome which for an agency is a as you probably know like recurring cash flow is is King yeah and it's on and what's interesting about it is it's on a business right so it's not like uh so basically as long as the as long as the quote customer continues to sell stuff you get a REV share basically Forever on the business which is a great long-term I mean it's it's an incentivizing offer so and also these these agencies are not going to build their own e-commerce stack right so they needed someone might as well use Shopify
(40:26) and I bring this up because a lot of business owners that I have you know they're like how do I how do I grow right and so that's why I wanted to really zero in on some of these growth strategies so one is you had referral Partners you brought in you you were generous with them uh to the app developers and to the web stores they got 20% of the of the of your cut awesome uh the second one was you you had a really sexy competition um and so I I talk about this in terms of like making offers to to an audience it's like how can we make it so good people feel stupid saying no right like and so
(40:52) for I would say that obviously it worked I mean I've heard about it we modeled it at school.com I just made the largest investment I've made um into a platform so we saw that and so we have the school games and so we really looked at a lot of the stuff that you guys did there um try to make it fun and um but the the key point is that you made it fun you made it competitive you got you got customers to compete against one another but they're all winning um and the major and this was one point I still wanted to ask so is it um was the New York Times the only promotion that you did for that
(41:24) or was there other things that you did or like was it all word of M like how did at at this point like uh when we started this like Tim was just sort of coming out the 4our work week I think was in its second edition but he had this massive audience and part of the cool part part of the the the the Beauty and the value of working with Tim was not just to gave us a great idea we're like great Tim now you got to help us tell the world about it also so if we would have gone to Tim with this idea I don't know if he would have said yes but the fact that it was like Tim's we got
(41:51) Tim to generate an idea for us it was his idea he felt personally invested in in fact he's I I've heard him say this on his on his own show where he'll say like you know he's one of the co-founders of the build of business competition I love that because we created a a real vested interest in him to actually make this a success and it wasn't just New York Times I mean there was a lot of Articles written about it but it also it gave us a narrative a thing that we were able to go around and talk about it was difficult for me to go around and talk about I'm a like you know I'm sh's chap Storyteller it's it's
(42:23) it's it was difficult for me to go around and talk about like software Ruby on Rails or the Simplicity of e-commerce but it wasn't as difficult for me to go around and say hey we created this thing we think we think everyone has you know Nike convince the world that if you have a body you're an athlete like mind mind blown so so brilliant we were trying to go around and convince the world if you have ambition you could be an entrepreneur and so I had now this new beautiful asset piece of ammunition that I was able to go around to media and to the to anyone that would listen to me to
(42:53) blogs to celebrities and say there's a thing here we'd love you to talk about like oh that's kind of cool that was really helpful and so for the business owners at home um one big one obviously was Tim got involved and so if you're like how do I promote my business finding a brand Champion or finding somebody who I mean there's if you've seen um I think is it is it air that movie that's uh it tells the story of U Jordan's like yeah so like sometimes you need to find like if you like if you have an audience awesome then you already know what you're doing but if you don't have an audience you're more of a product person and you're like
(43:26) shoot how do I get this to the World sometimes finding your Michael Jordan and in this instance like Tim was probably the Michael Jordan for that era for that for entrepreneurship definitely right for entrepreneurship at that time um and so being willing to and I'm sure that Tim had a good deal with Shopify for you know I'm sure that there was a deal with him that worked out for sure that he's profited a lot from um and so sometimes you just got to be really generous like the Michael Jordan deals first if its kind it was who was It was kind of crazy the the the founder you
(43:54) know the Phil was like I don't know this like should I really go all in on this person and sometimes you got to make bets right and obviously this bet paid off the Michael Jordan bet paid off and so you come up with something really sexy and then you find somebody who's the perfect fit for it and then you put it together right and so just as like and there's always a perfect fit right there's always someone out there there's someone who if if if if you're if you have a product physical product or space of software digital product there is
(44:18) someone out there that has purchased from you even if you're a small business who probably has some sort of Leverage meaning they have an audience they have a community they have a big newsletter big following they know a bunch of people if they have bought your product organically and they have a connection to you organically you asking them Point Blank hey I have this crazy idea you seem to like my my my tea um and I would love to feature you in a promotion would you be interested that is very different than cold calling them and saying hi I'm Harley from this Tea Company uh from
(44:50) Firebelly tea and I'd love you to be a spokesperson like I think the days by the way especially go back like to come to present day for a second the days of Brad Pit Hawking Colgate or or toothpaste are over nobody wants these artificial um connections or sponsorships when you look at what Jimmy Mr Beast has done with Feasta BS or Emma Chamberlain with coffee or you see what Kim cardashian is doing with with skims because these are all on Shopify I have a very deep understanding of these businesses these are authentic real
(45:21) products that were built curated organized by these incredible celebrities who care so deeply about the product like so the the days of artificial sponsorship pay to play thing I think are over and I think I think what we did with build a business was almost like showcase that hey Tim's for some reason interested in our business hey Tim how do you think we can grow our business oh that's a good idea we'll do the competition but by the way we need your help for this competition and it's it was really meta
(45:51) and I I I just really want to hit on this because this is what a lot of a lot of businesses need growth right they've got a product they're like how do I let people know about it and obviously you can you can run ads or if you already have an audience then you already know that stuff but if you're like well shoot how do I do it Scrappy right and so like making an incentive that gives people a big reason to say yes right finding a brand Champion that already has distribution can can be the unlock because all of that acquisition is really just based on the negotiation you have with that one person and if they can bring a lot like every you have the
(46:22) opportunity to make a true win-win and obviously Shopify want and Tim want and the main one all of the people who built stores were the real winners here um and I'll bet you some of the winners on the stores also did the exact same strategy that shop was also doing and so you've got a tea company and they find Mrs T on I don't know on Instagram who just loves tries te's all day it's like if she really did like the product then she would be a spokesperson and so just finding that out okay cool and then the third one you said um and I want to zero in on this was it was the econ so you
(46:52) said growth strategies and you talked more about the economies of scale was that just that because that seems a little bit more product focus and I'm I'm game for that I just want to make sure that I I yeah I think on that one I mean it's product focused but it's also just simply like business focus my my ability to go and negotiate with a large payment Gateway every year got easier and easier why because I was coming to them as a much larger Merchant now if you just take a very simple uh you know a very simple example 10 individual
(47:19) Merchants go to negotiate with the payment Gateway on their own they're all going to get some rates but if I do it in aggregate with all 10 my rates are going to be much much better and I can literally give those 10 Merchants the exact same rates you know less maybe you know a couple basis points that I want to keep for myself from a profitability perspective that kept getting bigger it doesn't mean by the we can talk about you know shop you know like our our whole shipping thing because we divested
(47:43) Shopify shipping uh what's called sfn Shopify fil Network a couple months ago B A year ago at this point because there are sometimes we have got into areas that were not main quests we sort of call them side quests that maybe we shouldn't have done on our own in fact in the case of shipping we found another company called flexport um whose main quest is an endtoend Logistics platform which is what we were trying to build oursel and rather than build it oursel we're like you just do it and that we can talk a bit about the value of what what some companies are very very good
(48:12) at partnership I think shop is one of those companies if you look at what we've done with a firm for buy out pay later or Global e around crossb payments we've really we pride ourselves to being a company that is a really good company to partner with which is very unique in Tech which is sort of all kind of friend of Mees yeah and I wanna and I I'm gonna I'm gonna bring this to the the brick-and mortar chiropractor like so just just down to to home base um those relationships don't need to be these massive Billion Dollar Deals obviously they work at scale but you know I think
(48:44) about I think okay so if I'm a caor what are all the things that um anybody who's my customer also gets they might go to the gym they might like smoothies they might like uh yoga right they might other things that are and I think okay well what if I go to each of those businesses and say hey with every smoothie just put a coupon you can slap it on there for a free adjustment so they're going to get a free adjustment and a smooth like you're going to enhance the value proposition that you have to your customers at no cost to you but then I get free leads and so it they
(49:16) get a win and then I get free customers or at least a free shot at a customer yeah and so these Partnerships and and you know this has been a huge core to every business that I've built is I mean I think I've built almost the same amount of revenue from Partnerships and affiliate relationships um as I have just from act you know direct sales and generating them ourselves because you are known as like I mean you know you and I know each other sort of from the community our our own communities like you were known as being a good partner meaning you leave enough on the table so your partners can make money from it you
(49:44) know uh doctors actually do this really really well on their own referral side meaning if you go to see a doctor and that doctor can help you great they they'll they'll they'll work on you if they can't they'll recommend someone else if you what I've noticed is that a lot of them recom like it's almost like a a closed loop circuit where Dr a if they can help you always recommends Dr B who always recommends Dr C and and Dr C always recommends Dr a and sort of this I think if you're a chiropractor for example you if you sort of vend diagram out meaning you look at your customer
(50:15) base and you ask them you know where do you go where do you work out what clothing do you do you like to wear what where do you go to get your smoothies for example you probably have your own version of that but also the people hanging out in the Smoothie Bar are also asking the Smoothie person hey do you want any good chiropractors and the yoga instructor is also saying hey I think you need a chiropractor as well and so creating your own version of an affiliate program even if it's not called an affiliate program it's sort of your own creation of it actually is
(50:41) incredibly effective and if you overd deliver meaning every time the chiropractor recommends the yoga instructor uh the you know the yoga instructor's client comes back and says man that yoga instructor you recommended is amazing you should send more clients to that yoga instructor and so there is an opportunity to sort of overd deliver to create even more leverage in this sort of closed ecosystem of reciprocity and I'm going to give everyone three quick tips on this number one if you're going to create one of these relationships give them customers first
(51:10) if you give them customers first they're way more like send them five people and then make the call be like hey by the way I thought maybe it'd make sense if we did some now they're going to want more of what you J just gave them and they're going to be happy to talk second one is in terms of generosity like if you know what your cost to acquire a customer is you should be willing to give at least that for referral two a referral partner because like you either pay Zuck right or you just pay another small business owner and I can almost promise you that a referral from a
(51:34) partner is going to be worth more in LTV so you still get a a better LTV to C ratio by going to a stronger Channel with like a referral partner um and one little thing that uh lela's really good at this and she has just drilled it into me over time which has been helpful for Partnerships is she says never count the other guy's money yeah and so just because you're making someone else a ton of money like it has nothing like if you take out how much that person makes and you just look at your side of the table make the deal make sense for you if they make a killing awesome they're going to
(52:03) be an amazing partner right and so I just want to underline that for because some of the mistakes I made early on is I wanted I saw how much I would make but I've lost deals because I got too greedy trying to say well he's gonna make even more than me and I would encourage you not to think that way because if everyone grows such it's such an amazing reminder so I don't I don't watch sports I don't really play sports so my Sunday project this is a little bit weird and nerdy but I I I have this project it's called Big Shot it's an archive that I'm
(52:27) creating of the greatest stories of the greatest Jewish entrepreneurs of the last half century and so I'm meeting these people most of them are in their 80s and 90s and I sit down with them and I record it I put it on YouTube it's not a big podcast just it's mostly a personal project but it's fascinating and i' I've sat down with people like Izzy sharp who's the founder of the Four Seasons hotel or um a guy named Larry Silverstein who's the owner of the World Trade Center these were poor kids I mean these people grew up with nothing zero
(52:53) um or Fran Weisler who's the queen of Broadway these are very poor people that grew up and and and eventually created you know they're billionaires and they've created Empires um when you ask them at 90 years old and so I think Izzy sharp from the Four Seasons Hotel is 95 years old when you ask these people tell me one or two things that I don't know I'm I turned 40 this year so Izzy tell me something I don't know that I should at my age almost to the I've done about 12 of these interviews so far with these like older you know icons and legends on Titans almost all of them to a te say
(53:27) make your partners really really rich now the reason I I bring this up now is because these are people in their 90 in their 90s who they got nothing you know they're not trying to have Swagger they're not trying to like Flex they're so on and the reason I love interview them is because they're so transparent but to a te every single one of them from these Titans of industry and real estate to the the the the queen of Broadway has always made their Partners incredibly rich and that is not something that is intuitive but it's
(53:57) something that I think like is is legitimate I I I love I love this entire line of thinking because um I mean it goes down to the just more of abundance mindset most of the people that I know they were wealthiest in the world just don't see business as a zero some game yeah right it's just like everyone actually can win whereas in a lot of games it isn't it isn't structured that way uh whereas like even just the the build a business competition you mentioned earlier like sure there was one winner but do you think that number two to number 100 in
(54:29) on the list was like oh man I'm so bummed that I only got to 100 that's the craziest part number two number and number 100 are have built million-dollar brands also right and that's this idea of like positive some thinking I think is so important I know there's like you know like I'm an optimist I know you were you were also Alex but one thing that I think people Miss is often when you go to raise money for those of you that are looking to raise money one criticism you often get from investors is this concept of Tam total addressed Market how big is your market and if effectively what they're trying to say
(54:58) is that if you look at your Market it's a pie and your Tam is effectively the pie and your your your market share is the slice of the pie I think that's very flawed thinking and I think if we would have done that at Shopify we would not be a hundred billion dollar company our version was not let's take a piece of the pie rather let's grow the pie itself and so um we'll get to the IPO in a second but we took our company public in 2015 May 2015 on the New York Stock Exchange it was a billion doll company at that point so um but you know um 1%
(55:27) of the market cap that is today at the time um every when you before you go public you won this road show we did 93 meetings all over the us and you're meeting these investors and you're meeting These funds and you want them to invest in these big funds that have trillions of dollars under management and this idea of Tam would come up over and over again and I needed to have an answer for what the Tam was and I remember it off by heart it was there were 46 million retail smbs on the planet I think at the time we had 100
(55:56) under three 200,000 of them so big big growth opportunity ironically if you sort of you know we're now n years past the IPO if you look at Shopify today a lot of our customers are not uh just SBS we have very large companies we're also well beyond e-commmerce we have tons of merchants us us for point of sale physical retail we have t we have a capital business a payments business there was no way for them to actually to for me to give an answer around Tam in terms of like foreshadowing what we would become and so I love this idea that you're talking which is like positive some thinking and optimism
(56:31) where share share the wealth of other people around you because rather than sort of thinking of the pi as sort of this finite space think about the pi as infinite and encourage more people to participate that's how you build these like generational hundred-year multi-billion dollar companies I talked to a fund manager um the other day and he was uh and he is a public a public fund and he was he was saying you know one of the things that I really like is that I've got 10,000 people praying that I win every night is that great yeah I think Zig Ziggler said something to the degree of
(57:03) like you can have whatever you want in life as long as you have other people get what they want first um and I I just I just really really believe that because I've so I actually feel like I've actually put some numbers to this but I think that from an entrepreneurship perspective it's about on Tenth and what I mean by that is like you get to keep about one tenth of the wealth that you generate for other people and so I've just seen that from like the number of entrepreneurs that I look at like how much the market cap
(57:28) like not market caps the U like total revenue that's run through their platforms versus how much their Equity stake is and what it's valued at like the amount of times that I've seen that equation done where like it's 10x like you have to make 10 times the amount of money for other people as you'll be able to make um it's just been really cool and I think framing it that way is like how do I make everyone else a ton of money like everyone loves doing business with someone who makes them money and then
(57:52) they like and then they will want you to keep keep doing business with them so 20 our 2023 numbers are not out yet Q4 earnings are coming out soon so can't talk about that but I'll tell you last year in 2022 shopify's Revenue was but $5.
(58:11) 6 billion under six billion our Merchants the people that use Shopify made almost $200 billion doll in in gmv and revenue and sales that is I mean that is amazing I'm very proud of that I love the fact that our Merchants made 200 and we made 5 point something like that is the that the reciprocity that I think is important we I also love the fact that our our ecosystem Partners made more than6 billion last year that matters because it means for 2023 they're going to come back and work with us again and so I wanna I this is a really good line of thinking for I think a lot of the people in the audience so one is we we've got this big theme of reciprocity and what are what are some of the other because I'm I'm skipping
(58:48) one ahead but I think I think I think it's worth it so what are some of the you asked you put this question which is what are some of the things I don't know what should which is actually a question that I ask people too so I I like that you asked that question what are some of the other things that came up from those conversations or just things that you would share um as some of the big breakthroughs and like really ones that you were like I really thought this and I was dead wrong and I see this now and
(59:10) it changed everything um all right let me go uh a little personal for a second because I I think um these conversations don't really add as much value unless you can sort of take off the facade yeah um I have I turned 40 two months ago my wife turned 40 a month ago so we've like been doing a lot of like reflection on our life and and you know we're grateful and we love what we do we're doing our life's work and all that but one of the things that I really believe on a personal level is more true to me now
(59:36) than ever is this idea that vulnerability is actually this incredible superpower and my life has gotten dramatically better when I became a lot more vulnerable and I'll give you a quick example um I became I was I was the chief operating officer of Shopify between pretty much 2015 or so and 2020 so post IPO until sort of the pandemic and I loved being shop coo um it was a big role I had thousands of thousands of reports and most like pretty much all the non-engineering organizations you know rolled up to me and I I thought that was cool I thought that was really fun and and and I felt
(1:00:14) good about that but I I wasn't I wasn't happy um I didn't feel necessarily that I was the best coo in the world um but there was no way in hell I was ever going to raise man and say this is not the right role for me this is not what's going to keep me at Shopify for a long time and it was only until I had a really good chat with Toby and I was like look I was like um like there is someone who's better at this role than I am I'm certain of it and turns out it's Cass who's our current COO uh he was initially he was running product for
(1:00:42) payments for us our money product but he's now he he loves being the COO and running operations the way that I love storytelling and I never would have had this new sort of this next gear of of my career at Shopify had I not had a little bit of like just gotten over my own my own my own crap to say this is really not for me and I think this idea of of vulnerability showing weaknesses being this like weird bravado insecurity thing I think the more you show vulnerability the more you ask for help the better things become and I recognize that it's
(1:01:17) easier for someone like me to show vulnerability at my stage than it would have been for me to show 10 years ago um but I actually I I'm as I get older I I believe that lesson less that I actually believe it any stage being really honest with yourself and being honest with the people around you about what you want to do what you love doing what you're really good at like this idea of I've mentioned the term life's work a couple times there's a great Japanese term which is Icky guy which is effectively like what do you love what does the
(1:01:41) world need what can what can you get paid for that idea of of finding your thing at at a stage in life which where you're not 95 like is sharp in Four Seasons but you're 40 like like like I am or you're 50 or 60 or 30 I think is a great gift and I think you're able to find your thing a lot easier when you simply are a lot more um vulnerable about that and and more more than ever I I really look at that today as as as a real strength that's the first the second thing I would say is even uh Shopify is you know we have I don't know eight or nine thousand people at the company Shopify is very much a Founder
(1:02:19) Le company but also the people that work at Shopify have this incredible Founders mentality they act like an owner with every expense that they spend um the Speed and Agility they use um they reject like best practices quote unquote they reject processes that don't make don't make sense don't make don't make it faster and not just that we encourage that if you look at the most like some of the biggest areas of Shopify They're ran by founders of companies that we've Acquired and they've stayed at Shopify
(1:02:51) long past the earnout dates because we've created this sort of crafters and founders Paradise at this company in in many ways it is like this this incredible like um Collective of Founders and and and entrepreneurs and I think that you can do that at any stage of company but if you but if you're not careful it goes away really quickly and there are very few companies at our size today that feels like a founder-led entrepreneurial everyone calls themselves the largest startup like it's it's almost you know it's such a common thing to say but it's it's most of them are not like that and I think
(1:03:27) one thing that you can do as the founder of your company is instill this Founders this Founders mindset or founder mentality and you can keep it there if you work at it and I think the results are almost always unequivocally better what do you do tactically in order to keep that so a couple things are very simple in most companies of our size the way to to get a promotion is to go into management there's one track it is and it's it it always leads to a manager type role um we don't do that there are other tracks that Shopify there is a manager track there's also an individual contributor track or we call the crafter track there
(1:04:03) are these other tracks that allow you to stay at our company for a long time and if your craft is engineering or it's product or it's sales or it's storytelling and it's it's sort of brand building we are absolutely in fact not even okay with it we are going to be super happy if your mandate for your career is to get really really good at being the world's best marketer or the world's best sales rep or the world's best whatever um so one is we've created these different tracks at Shopify and we've create which is sort of you know like the way I like to is like Shi is
(1:04:38) really a crafter's paradise that's one the second thing that is really important is we also encourage like real disagreement we invite people to actively disagree when something just doesn't feel right um now if like if we've made the decision we've beat it up you know dis you know disagree and commit sometimes has to happen also but instilling a place where like you encourage open debate is really I I think super important I I I think most companies talk about transparency and they talk but it's it's it's total  you do any tactics to encourage
(1:05:11) that I I just I I always get into the weeds but like yeah the track makes a ton of sense like that was like for me you know with with with our companies like I will I will that'll probably be my number one takeaway from just my tactical takeaway is like interest having individual contributor tracks because one of the big issues that a lot like when you have a star media buyer right in a company that guy usually doesn't want to then manage media bu like he's us like that person and why do you want that person to like you want that star media buyer to be a media buyer and what if that star media buyer
(1:05:42) is a seven and actually wants to become a nine or a 10 at some point now all of a sudden you have like the world's greatest media buyer so one thing is I think you do have to have a conversation with people um no matter what size your company is like what track are you on are you in a manager like there are some people who are just so great at management you want them to manage teams they just they're really good at that stuff but I think having a conversation say what track are you on really really matters the second thing I think that's
(1:06:06) also uh that's also really important is um I know every company want likes to talk about things like you know transparency and and open communication um we write a letter to our board um every quarter we share that letter with the board the whole company we and it's not redacted it's exactly the letter that even at our size that we share with the board we share with the entire company a small now not every letter is going to be this holy mind-blowing you know uh piece of content they're always really interesting um but
(1:06:36) sometimes you know it's more like making sure the trains are are are on time and stuff like that but what it does do over time is it it really brings everyone into the same page of like hey the things we're telling the board we're also telling you that there isn't these like two different versions of The Narrative of the company and um I think that's something that is is it's it seems simple uh but it's really really impactful especially if you do it really consistently I'll give a I'll give I'll give the listeners a tactic that we have done for this which is um we actually run open book financials in all of our
(1:07:07) companies and so when we do quarterly it's like here's where we made money here's where this like we spent money and it didn't work out well and so that's helped for everyone feeling like they're on the same page that we're not hiding anything and if things are going really well they can see it and if something doesn't go as well like some of the decisions that that happened downline we're like well that was suffering and I guess this this does make sense that we decided to divest in this kind of endeavor that we were doing and I know I love suie but I get it you know like even even if people aren't
(1:07:37) like stoked about it like they get it um so I was just I love this is great by the way um and so acting like an owner you you operationalize that um by creating individual uh contributor tracks and by having manag tracks really so people can be honest about what they're really good at and the one tidbit I'll give for people who actually aren't owners or just like uh entrepreneurs sorry uh employees in businesses is no one can fault you once you own your flaws like if you're like hey I really suck at project management
(1:08:09) and if you say that upfront then people are like they don't they don't talk behind your back about it they'll just talk to your face about it because it's not a secret you're like I know I suck at project management and so the more it's like Eminem's whole thing is like if he claimed every single deficiency and flaw that he had no one could say anything back to him in rap battles and even though you know hopefully Corporate America is a little bit nicer than a rap battle maybe it isn't um yeah I it may
(1:08:31) not always be but I think you're right about that I think also the thing that what what happens is when you say to someone look I don't want to be Riverstone I don't want to be well-rounded I want to be really really pointy at at this thing and that means that these other things around me I'm going to hire or I'm going to find teams who are really good at those other things now you're beginning to actually put yourself in a position where if you're not like the world's greatest I don't know writer for example um but
(1:08:55) you're really good at like coming up with like you know great slogans or you're not the world's great ad you know you're not great at writing ad copy but you're a great media buyer now if you say look I'm not good at ad copy but I'm I'm so good at finding opportunities for for great exposure if you say you're not good at that that means it invites someone who may be really good at copy to come and be your like your your your your your buddy your best your you know your best friend at work that stuff really really matters and I I think um I I think that stuff really is really
(1:09:24) great the only other thing I will say is this um I know a lot of companies talk about Mission and Northstar one thing that we are very clear on even from from from day one till now is um we are a merchant obsessed and what does that mean when given any decision whereby we have to pick one of two things we always ask ourselves what is better for merchants now by the way that is different than let's say Amazon for example who is very famously consumer obsessed they don't like that's what they care about they're very clear about that when you work at Amazon if there's like 100,00 people work there they are consumer obsessed by creating this this
(1:09:58) very simple heuristic of which allows you to say given two opportunities both seem pretty good how do you actually evaluate it well what's the one that's best for the merchant that means that thousands of people work at Shopify on a daily basis are making independent decisions that all roll up to that centralized Mission which is we are Merchant obsessed we care first and foremost about the millions of of business owners that use Shopify and again it sounds obvious but most companies totally toally mess us up and
(1:10:27) where the the vision emission stuff gets really important just for everyone who's listening is like once you get to about a 100 employees that's where you're you're usually two to three levels away like if you're the founder you're two to three levels away from people who are getting hired you're starting to hire people you don't even know their names like this is where this really becomes important because decentralized decision- making is the only way you can continue to scale and you need people to make decisions that would be in align with align alignment with you like you can't be in every room to make every
(1:10:50) decision and so that's where Mission and values create decision making Frameworks that people can use as litmus tests of okay what would Toby do right now well I know that Toby says Merchants are North Star and Merchants would not like this then we don't do it right even though we'd make a little bit more they don't like it and that's what correct I just want to highlight that because a lot of the people I mean obviously we take businesses on um smaller than Shopify that we invested but like we'll we'll go through this exercise of leadership because usually when they're at you know between 10 to $30 million a
(1:11:22) year this is when this gets really important to get to 100 million year in revenue and so forth and so like if you're at that point in your stage like this gets important I also think something you're sort of you're sort of skating or flirting with a little bit which which has to be said is I think that there is this strange thing that as you grow so you mentioned 100 people there's actually a real thing it's called it's called dunbar's number it's 150 people right and dunbar's number basically goes back to like the days of like when we're all living in tribes that basically a tribe size should never
(1:11:50) go beyond 150 there's some sort of science around humans can only really remember 150 people at any one particular particular time I went through the 150 Mark a long time ago at Shopify it does change and there's no question about it but the one thing that often happens when you cross that 100 Mark or 150 150 person Mark is you begin to do this whole like um you know macromanagement you sort of get out of the weeds and actually I think this whole narrative that micromanagement is bad is total horseshit I actually think that the best leaders I know whether
(1:12:21) they're running like trillion dollar companies uh because I know some of those or 100 billion dollar companies or million dooll companies the best leaders I know are in the Weeds on the things that matter most and even you know I'm preparing now for my earnings call which in two weeks like I'm In The Weeds on this like we have an IR team who could prepare all this no I want to actually go through every single word in the script in the press release in the narrative I want to go like word for word on my own before anyone even takes a look at it because it matters so much and if that's my craft that's what I'm
(1:12:53) supposed to be responsible for then I'm going to be in the weeds that I think there's like this this Corporate America you know bashing of micromanagement and I I think I I I think some micromanagement is actually really positive and needed we agree and um we have a little saying for this internally which is win in the weeds yeah like that's like that's where you're GNA go Toe to Toe with somebody's like you're going to win in the weeds like that's how you do it and I like like I feel the same way if some cor you know some some president of some other company of our size uh is not in the Weeds on on on
(1:13:23) earnings on on press on part Partnerships I'm going to run circles around them because I am in the weeds because you have the the visceral knowledge of like the stuff that really makes it and one of the things that also helps with this is that if you in the weeds when something goes wrong you know why it went wrong and you can make a pivot where if your two levels removed you don't know why it didn't work and then your decision making of what to do next then relies on secondhand and it gets really really messy after that you make really dumb moves um okay so we
(1:13:48) have reciprocity is one of the big driving things we have uh vulnerability and then the downstream impacts of how you've kind of implemented that Within Shopify with the individual tracks um and encouraging open disagreement among people and giving everyone kind of a North star so everyone's aligned with how we're are like what Frameworks are we going to disagree around like it's not whether we're doing customer or we're doing Merchant the disagreement is going to be which of these best serves the merchant if we're going to disagree correct right so um I want to zoom out
(1:14:18) and so I said we're going to look back and I think we took a little bit of of final nugget stuff and moved it Forward which I loved anyways so if we're looking forward right um you sit in this really unique perch that I mean maybe 10 people on Earth sit on that you sit on top of this mountain of data and you kind of see around the corner and so what's kind of what's what's what's what's coming right what are you what are you thinking about for Shopify um and just kind of the marketplace overall for retail entrepreneurs or even just uh entrepreneurs in general look we talked
(1:14:47) a little bit about the sort of idea that the cost of failure is trending toward zero it's never going to be zero because ultimately like it's sort of ASM toop because ultimately like the you have an opportunity cost like you could be doing something else um so it's never going to be zero but it's getting close to it I think a couple things around the entrepreneurship thing one is I think entrepreneurship now more than ever before is default Global I think this idea that we've imported um physical geographies and borders of countries in from the physical world
(1:15:17) into the digital world is really silly I don't think I mean you know you see a lot of great Brands behind me that I'm very close with I put up uh you know from kth to Supreme uh to Mom spaghetti which is M&M's company to Firebelly which is my little tea side hustle um uh master and dynamic headphones these are some of the companies that I love that I'm connected to none of them have Geographic limitations that's just not how they operate I get it it's more complicated sometimes to sell although frankly we have a product called Shopify
(1:15:46) markets and markets Pro which makes everything really easy there um but I I don't want to this isn't a shop pit just I think one like your total addressable Market when you're getting started is anyone on the planet who wants to buy your particular product first second of all is I think the idea um if you listen to any of the earnings calls from these big um big retailers one of the terms you often hear is this concept of Channel conflict which is a very simple thing it's online is doing well but it's
(1:16:17) hurting offline Instagram Commerce is doing well but it's hurting my online store I I when I think about the brands that I admire the most across millions of stores on Shopify none of them none of them use the term Channel conflict why because they are Channel agnostic what they care about is serving their customer in the way that their customer loves to be served or wants to be served which is very different than pretty much you know the history of retail where if you wanted to buy bread you went to the baker uh in the Town Square you want to
(1:16:48) buy shoes you went to The Cobbler down the streets in the 80s I I'm a you know I'm an 80s kid um when I went to go buy a video game I'd have to line up at the store at this hour doors open wait in line use this credit card no not that credit card use this one that whole thing was the concept of the retailer dictating the process of purchase to the consumer is over and the reason that you're seeing you know things like shopay for example become so popular is because seamless simple easy convenient checkout is what every consumer wants and so modern retailers today one are graphically agnostic two our Channel
(1:17:28) agnostic they sell across every channel the reason why you see us do things like we there's a there's a Spotify channel for Shopify so if you're an artist most most merchants on Shopify are not artists but if you're an artist and you have your Eminem for example and you have a great popular artist profile uh and fan base on Spotify now you can sell your merch directly from your artist profile Pat and Spotify won't be important to most people but our if we want to qualify and re-qualify to be the retail operating system for these millions of stores our responsibility is
(1:18:00) every surface area on the planet digital physical anywhere in between that a transaction could happen we have to make that easy so that's probably the second thing I think that's happening retail and then the third thing that I think is is kind of like a an interesting thing um is that I think business is becoming it all siiz is personal and you do this very well Alex maybe better than anyone but you know your own personal brand and your business's brand they're not separate anymore um a couple uh a little while ago I saw very uh very high-end
(1:18:34) brand their online store was down um I'll say it was Versace Versace went down I think eight months ago when I tweeted I said Versace like let me help you out um and it end up leading to some of the Versace Brands coming on to Shopify at that point was I the presid of Shopify was I Harley the entrepreneur was I Harley the like human like it I think this idea that that you know work life balance or work life Harmony the separate I think it's I think it's over I think people I think we as entrepreneurs and aspiring entrepreneurs in 2024 we have to sort of incorporate
(1:19:06) all these things into our backpack our businesses our personal life like you know you talk about uh you talk about your wife Lea right all all the time about being part of like you you sort of mix in between total addressable market and talking about your wife I do the same thing like Lindsay my wife is a huge part of my life and when I go home I talk about work and I was talk about our kids and I like I think this there's sort of this wonderful harmonious situation now where we don't like we're not separating these things we're not waiting to retire to live our life I think more and more you're able to kind
(1:19:36) of like have a personal brand but it's also your business's brand and you're also an extension of the company but you're also your own person and I actually think that's a wonderful new thing that new phenomenon um that is very different than our parents and grandparents and great-grandparents had yeah and they don't really get it as I right I mean Mr Beast is he a YouTuber or is he a or is he a confectionary genius with his chalk who cares he's this amazing guy he's a great entrepreneur and he makes content and he makes chocolate and he makes burgers and he makes cool videos and he's a cool
(1:20:08) dude and like who cares how you sort of categorize these people um and that's the reason why actually back to what we said at the beginning authenticity is going to rule here and if you are if you are full of people are going to figure that out very quickly and they're not going to buy from you and they're not going to want to participate in your journey but if you're not full of and you invite people along into your journey and you you talk about your kids and your spouse and your business people cheer for you and it goes back to what I think you said you know uh earlier is is um that that that quote about you know
(1:20:38) you want as many people cheering for you as possible and your journey forgot the exact quote but if something like that and um because I I like defining terms a lot it's like one of my hobbies but defining it from a behavioral perspective so a lot of people are like well what is being authentic or like I want to be authentic like how do you do that um the best definition that I that I have that's working is um behaving as if you could not be punished and so oftentimes like we censor ourselves for fear of punishment we like the many
(1:21:06) things that we don't say or don't do because we're afraid someone's going to say something or someone's going to do something reaction and so basically if you're in an empty room you have almost no no potential for punishment right and so it's how you act as if you could not be punished is how you are authentically um and so we talk about this concept of like you the niche so it's like what isan he likes he likes he likes aliens he likes you know weird government stuff he likes uh fighting he likes comedy he likes biohacking he likes taking crazy drugs like he likes all sorts of stuff
(1:21:38) and so if you're to say hey I want to start this podcast where I talk about aliens fighting comedy like all like people be like you're crazy but it's Joe Rogan and so it also creates a one-on-one category that only you can really occupy and so I I I genuinely do believe this um that everyone is kind of unique um in terms of their distinct interest and kind of like if they were a chart like how H how the point of their Rock is in one directions versus a 100 other ones and so I do think there is a thumb print there that that is unique to
(1:22:07) the individual where people do become rounded Stones is because they pull back on their pointy bits and so then they do look more uniform and so people look uniform but aren't in reality and so looking at these three big things in terms of what's coming around the corner in Commerce and kind of like where the best brands are indexing number one is that they see everyone as a potential customer around the world not not not not just their local area just even people who speak their language uh second was that they don't really care where the customer comes from like if more people know about your stuff and
(1:22:34) you put it in more places more people will buy it and as long as you treat them well you'll make more sales and you get more rep repeat customers and then the third one is creating allow basically allowing yourself to be you publicly and being more okay with the association that's going to happen inevitably with you starting a company because if you really believe in the product it's going to be in mesed in your identity like it's going to be part of who you are and rather than caging these things out or boxing them just leaning into the fact that like you're you and you own this thing and I think
(1:23:04) that what we were saying earlier with kind of Tim Ferris and these brand Champions like those other people can contribute their thumbprints to your product as well well if you're authentic then other people that are kind of like you like you know I I I I like to I like to be exothermic like I like to take I'm very high energy always have been um I like to add energy to other people and other other situations and rooms and convers and so I'm just to like I want to be exothermic and so everything that
(1:23:30) I do I want to like I want to be the exothermic person what that means is people see me being exothermic mean you and I sort of connected like you and I are kind of social media friends like I was being exothermic and you were being exothermic we're like hey let's be exic together that's how you and I that's why we are talking right now because I try to be authentically me on the internet and you try to be authentically you and the internet and so we connected and like immed like yeah we kind of like each other that you get tons of people
(1:23:54) coming at you asking to do stuff together and immediately you're like ah something is off here and and I I I feel the same way sometimes when people come to me and they say like I want to connect I want to do a deal with you um when you are exothermic and if you are or when you are authentic you actually invite other people that are similarly authentic in your way into your lives and you create these amazing communities and friendships and relationships and it's it's really fun but you know I mean it's it's a great sort of place to wrap up I think which is like there is a deep
(1:24:23) optimism I think around the entrepreneurial community and for those of you that are listening whether you're an entrepreneur or aspiring entrepreneur one of the best parts of Entrepreneurship is that all of us not all actually not all most of us didn't sort of start with like some sort of like we didn't start on third base most of us started at the beginning and we've been building ourselves and so when we see other people building on their own whether they're chiropractors or they're Tech entrepreneurs or they're lawyers or accountants or they someone who's creating you know I love my Ember mug I
(1:24:52) love the guys at Ember they make these great coffee mugs at St hot whatever they are I am rooting for them and they're rooting for me and that actually that sort of wonderful like ecosystem reciproc you go back to that that makes entrepreneurship a little bit less lonely and also the greatest tool for humans to find their own version of success whatever your version of success is make a lot of money uh put food on your table be creative whatever that version is entrepreneurship is this amazing vehicle and today it's more accessible than it's ever been and
(1:25:22) there's it's tough not to be optimistic about that last question business advice to Harley 10 years ago you've got one thing you can tell him um I think a lot of you know a lot of people don't know where to start we kind of talked this a little bit earlier when we talked about t-shirts but just find a problem that that you feel yourself and just solve it um yeah like it's hard to imagine how to scale and how big it could become don't even worry about that but like if there's a hobby like you know um one of my best friends
(1:25:53) is really in is is his name is David seagull he's founder of David's te this big tea Empire he sold the company 2016 and he was trying to figure out what to do and all along the way David was like coming over to my house and we hanging out a lot and he's obsessed with tea um I was like dude like you have a thing it's tea why aren't you build another Tea Company and so that's where Firebelly came from and I love this idea that like you know the thing that you're searching for is probably right in front of you and I I know some people say that you know you shouldn't commercialize
(1:26:21) your hobbies but I'm not sure I'm not really sure I believe that like if you have this amazing hobby this amazing interest this amazing pain point you feel a lot that's exactly what you should be working on that's the first thing the second thing I think is like you know um I'm this is my 15th year at shopice I'm 40 years old so more than a third of my life has been spent at this incredible company and I if if people if Toby and the board will have me I'll stay there as long as I possibly can but finding someone who um like from a
(1:26:49) partnership perspective um someone you work with closely I think a lot of people will start companies and businesses with people that are just like them people that they would have been friends with in high school think it's fun and I get it um and you know Firebelly for example Dave and I are both kind of similar with our little te thing um but actually I think some of the most impressive things I've ever seen built were built by people that probably would not have been friends in high school again going back
(1:27:15) to this idea of like of pointy objects they're pointy in their own way but their points are not the same and by combining their points they kind of create this like Avengers thing which on their own they'd be doing cool stuff but like you know doing it all together uh means they can build hundred billion dollar company um so those would be some of the things I I would say maybe the only other thing is like you know one just going back to like life life and work alt together I one of the most important uh decisions all of us can make is finding an incredible incredible
(1:27:44) partner um spouse wife husband boyfriend girlfriend whatever um I think people underestimate how important that is and I think I I often refer to to Lindsay uh at our 40th birthday I said you know Lindsay is my superpower um that I have this incredible part and and I I I think we all not all but I I I know a lot of people that take for granted um how important that particular decision is uh I I think finding a wonderful life partner for you uh whoever you are um is just probably the most important decision you're ever going to make and I think we all some people think about it very thoughtfully others sort of do it
(1:28:21) half-hazard and I think that's a mistake 71 correlation with your subjective well-being hell yeah so is that true are you making that up no no that's 7 correlation with subjective wellbeing the strength and relationship with your significant other um with that I feel like it's a great uh stopping point thank you so much for giving your time like just just this is so fun I hope it was valuable to your to your community and your listeners I'm I'm a huge fan I'm part of your community and uh I I Tred to bring as much insight and and
(1:28:49) thoughtfulness as I possibly could um it's it's an honor Alex for me to be uh talking to you for I don't know the last 90 minutes it's beyond mutual and on just behalf of you know MOS Nation thank you so much appreciate you

(00:00) I'm going to start a $10 million trash collecting business so if you want to start a business this video is for you we're going to turn this trash Into Cash the first thing you need to do is get customers and the easiest way to do that is to talk to people you already know and the easiest way to do that is to pull up your phone look in your contacts and find one let's call Caleb yo hey what's up man are you at that wedding I am yeah well quick question for you this may seem out of the blue is anyone taking out your trash
(00:30) oh [ __ ] no it's probably just sitting there smelling awful do you know anybody else who might be at the wedding who's also not taking out their trash probably but what are you talking about like I know this is out of blue I'll explain why so right now I'm starting my little Trash cleaning business I want to help five or 10 people and just do my service for free I'll do everything and if it is good if you're open to leave me a review it mean the world to me and if it sucks I hope you tell me so I can make it better dude that would be perfect and I'm a ger F I [ __ ] hate touching
(01:00) well I'll tell you what why don't I do it for free you're you're helping me out if it's good and you like the service I can talk to you about you know what it would look like afterwards in like two weeks that work that sounds incredible yeah thank you and uh the other folks that you know do you think you do a three-way text intro with me yeah absolutely thanks for supporting me man I really appreciate it so that is number one of four different ways that one person can let other people know about their stuff there are eight ways in total but today we're only going to talk about four of them and they are called unsurprisingly the core 4 welcome to
(01:32) Money Center where we break down this week's money-making activities here we've got a strapping men in what appears to be a tuxedo tank top we're going to watch this game footage are you at that wedding interesting first question I'm guessing this is a personalized tidbit that he found out from the social medias doing a little pre-research or pre-search this may seem out of the blue is anyone taking out your trash woo and right for the right for the jugular all right let's see what was just happening all right so we acknowledged what they said they were going to the wedding the compliment was
(02:04) that oh that's nice now could he have gone for a better compliment for sure I'd give that a four out of 10 on the compliment scale now what he didn't do was tie to a positive character trait that would have been bonus points now what does he do next he asks another question and leads the conversation whatever Direction he wants to go in this instance talking about trash anytime someone is doing something that you want to do for them they spend the same resource which is time and so all you have to do whether you're traving Fitness Services cleaning services trash taking out Services IT services whatever
(02:34) it is you say hey how's all this stuff going they say great and you say how do you have time to insert the thing that you're trying to sell and everyone's like man I wish I had more time and you said oh boy I just happen to be a time salesman and I can give you some back all right let's go back into this game footage it looks like he's following a script which makes it less impressive or does it he's actually following a script because if you don't know what you're doing just stick with the script rpt I think that's what he's actually reading do you think he can read do you know
(03:04) anybody else who might be at the wedding who's awesome he already assumed the clothes on this one and he's going for more do you know anybody who is looking to dream outcome not have the trash during the wedding as a quick tidbit this is an outline it's not going to be perfect and honestly when you do 20 or 30 or 50 of these you'll start to find your own Rhythm these are the big things if we're thinking about these as Milestones it's like hey I'm not asking them I'm asking if they know anybody now in this particular instance the guy was like man I he clearly exhibited the issue but if you've been like no I
(03:35) actually do have somebody who's taking care of the trash or whatever couple directions you could go there it' be like awesome are they doing it for free and then they would say no and be like well I will and then boom you could get the business or you just say hey do you know anybody who is it's a very easy transition so you're not asking them for business you're not soliciting you're asking if they knowbody and so then you give them the reason why because I'm taking on five case studies now case studies is a word that I didn't use in this but if you said hey I'm taking on five trials or five people for free and
(03:59) I'm just trying get some testimonials some reviews okay let's go back to the uh the game footage and if it sucks I hope you tell me so I can make it better and we just outlined both outcome scenarios in the explanation which is either I'm good and you leave me a review which is my ask or I suck and you just tell me so either you get feedback or you get a review and it works great and the nice thing is you can make money three different ways from somebody for free cuz everybody in the stands is like he going to make money give them away stuff for free your time is valuable
(04:27) your time isn't valuable because if it were valuable you'd be making money and if you're not making money right now guess what value says zero this gives you practice and feedback from friendlies which is a great way to start category one is that they will get the free service and be like this was awesome keep doing it and I'll pay you they literally just become customers option two is they then say hey I don't want to do this but I'll leave you a review so then you get a review version three of them making you money is that
(04:52) they just send you a friend even if it's not them and they could do all of those things somebody could leave your a review send you a friend and become a customer but they could do any of those things individually and if you want Secret Door Number Four they could also say you know what you weren't good I don't want to send you a friend and I don't want to be a customer but I'll tell you what you could do better and that also makes you money in the long term why don't I do it for free you're you're helping me out and see notice the frame you're helping me out letting me
(05:17) do this for free it's not hey you owe me one because I'm doing this for free for you wrong frame of mind if you come in at that you're going to be a weirdo and everyone's going to sense it cuz you're going to have this weird resentment WS people because you're like I can't believe I'm giving the stuff away for free they should be thanking me no they shouldn't cuz you have no reputation and you have no track record cuz if you did you wouldn't have to give it away for free but you are because you haven't
(05:40) done it yet and that's okay I'll and notice he's still reading from this this screen so he might not even have a brain brains are optional in this that's how simple this is when you ask people who know you the other folks that you know do you think you do a three-way text intro with me ooh snuck it back in so remember earlier he said hey do you know anybody he said yeah I do know some people he remembered and said hey why don't we do a three-way not the way you're thinking I see you but how do we do a three-way intro and the reason you do that is because if you say hey can
(06:09) you make the intro to me they have to remember but if you say right now hey do a three-way text while I'm here there's two things happen one is that you get the lead and here's the second sneaky thing that happens is that because you actually have an intro of a third party in the message group the person who's getting intro is way less rude overall I think I think 4 and A2 out of 10 maybe a 4.
(06:34) 6 and I'm mostly giving that because of the hair and the tuxedo tank regardless this goes to show you that you don't need to have a brain you can follow half of a script and you can still get a customer by talking to people who you know and asking them if they know anybody and just like that you can start your trash cleaning business because there are four ways you can make money from free people they become customers they leave you a review who get you a customer they send you a friend or they give you feedback that could make you better so that you can eventually actually be worth what you want to charge but there are two limitations Let's Walk This Way first
(06:58) limitation is that you only have so much time you're going to be calling people you're going to reach out to people and trying to get them to try your services or your products of some sort you can only do that so many hours of the day cuz it's just you limitation number two is that you only know so many people you add up your email list your contacts in your phone your followers on social media across every platform that you're on if you're on platforms you might have a thousand people who know you well if you did a 100 of those a day in 10 days
(07:23) you would have reached out to everybody now that doesn't mean that you shouldn't reach out to them again you should but at that point you start to run into some friction so we just got our first customers from warm Outreach as in talking to people we know oneon-one now we're going to transition to getting our first customers from posting free content let there be light is it on cool want to know the best way to get your husband to take the trash out two things number one instead of saying hey honey
(07:48) will you take the trash out you say hey would you mind taking the trash out hey would you be opposed to taking the trash out would it be a huge inconvenience for you to take the trash out if you say it like that instead of of a yes based question it's a no based question cuz they're like no it wouldn't be a huge inconvenience I wouldn't mind at all and then they take it for you because people are more likely to say no to things then yes but you get them to say yes by saying no the other way to make sure
(08:11) they keep doing it is that after your husband or your spouse does it that you reward them for doing it and that's where you say thanks so much that meant so much to me it's like you're my hero any of those types of things make it more likely that someone's going to do it again now if you don't want to use any of these persuasion tactics just call 1800 Alex TR and I'll do it for you and you can say you got it for your husband as a gift because he means so much to you trash is gross to everyone but me but if you're one of those people there's three ways that you can actually
(08:40) not have to touch your trash way number one use a bag you take the bag just like a pooper scooper you take your hand and then you can go over the whole thing and then you dump it way number two is you use tools like these go down touch your trash and there you go hands free and way number three is you can call 1800 Alex trash because I love the smell of trash and I will do it for you and you are helping somebody who actually has barely any way to smell and so I wear these because I can't smell that good and so this is a natural line of work for me because I get to do something that doesn't bother me at all
(09:16) and bothers other people here's how making free content Works do you make free valuable stuff for your audience so much so that they say give us more give us more could either be more free value or paying you money for the services that you offer now let's actually break this down in Real Time with these videos want to know the best way to get your husband to take the trash out what was that that was part one of content which is hook now notice how many seconds is that 3 seconds in the first 3 seconds are the most important 3 seconds in the content video two things number one so
(09:47) notice I have a two-step framework that I then introduce in the beginning give step one give what it is then give an explanation of why it works and then I move on to step two and repeat the cycle and so that that is a retaining cycle which you can either use lists steps or stories or combinations of all three to keep the audience engaged and right now I'm going through list steps and stories making this now let's keep watching this one and see where this guy takes it just call 1800 Alex trash and I'll do it for you and you can say you got it for your
(10:18) husband as a gift because he means so much to you and so the idea with the reward is that you want someone to share the last piece so it's either something that subverts the audience meaning something that they laugh at or think is funny or it's some sort of action that you're going to have them take now ideally here this is funny enough that someone would send it to their friends now let's look at number two and break this one down together trash is gross to everyone but me so trash is gross to everyone but me is a weird but probably effective hook because curiosity people
(10:46) like why is this person talking about this and the thing with content is you're going to make many many many things and sometimes you would be surprised by what works and what doesn't so often times you can start with a crazy topic or you can start with a crazy question or or just a fact or a statement that people might find jarring any of those things might catch someone's attention so that they keep watching way number one use a bag and so each of these is an open loop so I'm opening the loop and then I close it with what the thing is but you're still like well what's number two and what's
(11:15) number three and the idea is that you retain them so that they watch it and way number three is you can call 1800 Alex trash because I love the smell of trash there you go fun little wrap up on the video we've got a hook we've got some retention tactic which has a a step for a story and then some sort of reward or call to action at the end and just like that we have made two pieces of content following the hook retain reward framework that you can use for any type of business now Pro tip on this if I were to start a local trash business I
(11:43) would say there's one of two directions I would take my content in general you could also inter splice them one is actually talking to Consumers and saying here here's some tips about trash you probably didn't know about things that can make their life better independent of using my services or you could make content targeted at people who you would want to work work at your trash company so it might be targeted more around what a Salesman job or a trash collecting job might look like so that you can attract more Talent either of those strategies
(12:08) work and you could probably do both together cuz you would eventually just be known as the trash kick all right I'm going to give you a couple quick tips that have worked well for me on making content number one people need to be reminded more than need to be taught so a lot of times we have this idea that I've said this thing one time in content therefore I should never say it again because I would be repeating myself but it's arrogant to assume that 100% of your audience 100% of the time consumes
(12:31) 100% of your content and also that if they consume something one time they wouldn't want to consume it again Andor a version that's just slightly different from the original you'll probably see tweet reels from me that also appear in video format for me that also make their way into captions and full posts on the exact same concept and then I also talk about them in podcast think about yourself who do you follow you probably know the themes of stuff that they're talking about on on a regular basis and you follow them because you want to be reminded I've watched comedians do the
(13:03) same bit over and over again because I think it's hilarious and so it works the same way with your own content if people like something make more of it another one is that in the content that I just showed you I made a call to action at the end you could obviously not make a call to action at the end at all you could just make the content and cut it and then that would be perfectly fine and you could just expect that people would make comments they would like it or sometimes DM you anyways just cuz they want to find out more I think that that one actually would work because I
(13:30) made the third weight kind of funny and the cool thing is is that anybody who likes or engages or comments on your posts are leads because you can then message them a lead is a person you can contact and an engage lead is someone who shown interest in the stuff that you have we create content so that we can get people to engage so that we can then say hey I saw that you engaged with my thing that gives you a reason to reach out to them without seeming like a scumbag and so like that is how you can generate leads for free using content I'm going to give you a frame shift that
(13:58) helped me a lot in the beginning when you're making content looking at the number of views can be depressing because then you think man I suck no one likes me but I started to imagine whatever the number of views was as the size of a room I was talking in and so if I was willing to do a lunch and learn for my trash business with 15 people in it I was stoked and so the idea that 17 people watch my video is a full room it's a classroom and so the idea that I could do that and reach them for free just reframing it and not
(14:29) comparing it to what a million clip view is but just saying what does 17 people look like wow that was worth it and if you can keep that perspective it becomes way less discouraging and everyone starts at this one big magical number it's not bad it's not you suck it's not that you're late everyone starts here and you build from there and so that is how we got our customers from our second different way to advertise posting free content now we'll transition to reaching out to strangers oneon-one to get our next
(15:05) [Music] customers hello hey how's it going pretty good reason I'm knocking on your door is because I helped the Johnson's your neighbor take out their trash and they sent me over here to ask you if you have somebody who takes care of your trash for you I do not well would you be opposed to me doing it for for you no no actually that sounds incredible all right well fantastic so if you have any trash right now I can just grab it yeah I'd be good with it yeah all right fantastic cuz I can take that out to my truck and then I'll get the rest of your stuff I do not want to touch it honestly
(15:42) so like that would be very helpful thank you hello hey how's it going good reason I'm here because I took out the Johnson's trash it's what I do for a living and I was curious if you have somebody who taks out your trash I do yeah yeah well are they as awesome and smiley as me I guess not do they also do it for free for this month no because I'll do both of those the extra Smiley stuff is on me if it's actually free yeah yeah it's free for the first month and after that it goes at 29 bucks a month okay yeah yeah let's do it okay fantastic
(16:22) well if you got a bag I'll grab what I have and then I'll bring them out to the truck and I'll come back with my cleaning supplies yeah let's do it all right hey how's it going hello hello I take out the Johnson's trash and they wanted me to take out your trash so guess what just happened I got to know and guess how much poorer I am 0% poor and so you know what yeses can change your life but you can have as as many NOS as you want and nothing else changes and so all we do is we roll the dice again d D dum dum dum dum and we're back
(17:01) for the cold Outreach breakdown it is you reaching out one1 to strangers and you can do that via email phone call direct message SMS voicemail or knocking on someone's door like I demonstrated now let's break down these puppies one by one this was the nice guy reason I'm knocking on your door so right before we get into this there's a lot of setup here so number one I have trash over my shoulder the reason for that is because I'm already visually demonstrating what I do and it's especially I'm dressed in work clothes you might think is this person here to fix something I have
(17:33) curiosity working on my side cuz he might have a peephole or look through the window before answering the door which most people do so before even getting the knock in the door I'm trying to look a certain way so that it increases the likelihood that they open the door now the second thing is that I've got a huge secret weapon that most people don't do so the reason I talked earlier about giving away free stuff is that once you do give one person free stuff what do you think you should do with that free person you should leverage it to the greatest degree
(17:57) possible to make as much money as you possibly can for giving away something for free because if I can get 10 more sales from the one person I gave for free by name dropping them or by using them as an intro or a segue into a sales pitch that's worth giving away the service for one person and so in this example the Johnson which is the neighbor I could give one person in an entire neighborhood free service and then go to every other door and say hey I work with the Johnson's which then creates trust and they're like okay this is legit and then I can bridge in so
(18:28) right now do that in the first couple seconds cuz I want to disarm them so they don't act rudely to me if someone knows that you know someone they know they will act much more polite to you and be far more likely to give you more time to make whatever presentation you want to make and they sent me over here to ask you if you have somebody who takes care of your trash notice the question that I'm asking after proceeding it with I help the Johnson's out I ask the individual does he have somebody who's doing this particular service cuz I'm not saying hey do you want me to take your trash out for you
(18:59) I'm asking if they have someone who's doing it because then I'm leading them on a path that I have an answer on both sides it's a yes no question that I have 100% response that's good on either scenario I do not so this one is an easy one cuz they're like I don't have anybody who does this particular service and believe it or not as crazy as it sounds it's actually even better sometimes that they do have someone because that means they already are willing to pay for the service so by the way if someone already has or pays for
(19:25) something they're more likely to buy from you not less would you be a opposed to me doing it for you and so that's a no-based question so rather than saying hey do you want me to do it I'm saying would you be opposed to or to be a great inconvenience to you Etc where it's an easier yes by saying no than a pure yes- based question for all the yes based salesmen myself included I've closed plenty of sales I'm just saying you ready to start open to go on Monday let's get started whatever it doesn't mean it doesn't work it just means that
(19:49) in general when you ask a huge population a slightly higher percentage will say yes to a no question no no actually that sounds incredible great we got the yes and we move on now as a side note here once you get the yes shut the [ __ ] up and go everything you say after the point they said yes is increasing the likelihood that they changed their mind and so as soon as you get the yes it means that you've said everything is sufficient and everything after that point increases the risk that they reverse their answer you got what you
(20:14) needed get to the [ __ ] truck get your [ __ ] move back there and then get it done now let's go through the scenario of I do have somebody already and I was curious if you have somebody who taks out your trash I do yeah yeah same question she's asking if they have the provider or not now he says yes here do they also do it for free for this month so I now have to have an alternative scenario that I can plant like an alternative offer also as an aside in a life scenario you want to sound like someone they know and people they know don't say hi the reason that I'm calling
(20:46) is if you were on a call script you'd say hey is this Jason pause and they'll be like yeah be like hey this is Alex pause and then and then they're like where the [ __ ] do I know Alex from now here I ask I'm like hey how's it going I'm not saying hey my name's Alex and I'm here to take your trash out and I want to like breathe are they as awesome and smiley as me I'm a big Rapport guy I like cracking jokes at all times in sales now that takes a little bit more skill but it disarms people and people are way less likely to be rude to somebody who's just being incredibly positive upbeat and sunny and so you can be as ridiculous saying well
(21:25) do they give you free Smiles it's such a pattern up that people are like what the what is this guy saying they're not going to be like [ __ ] you they're going to be like you know what I no they don't give me free Smiles they be like well they should be cuz with a house like this I mean how much trash you must be creating a ton of trash and that makes my job better I love trash right like I could say that kind of stuff and they're like God this guy's insane but like at least he's funny and so I could
(21:48) literally have the exact same service and just CU they like me better they'll give me the business but I pair that with what I say here is are they giving it to you for free no no no they're not guess what that makes me better than the guy that they have right now and so then it's like cool he did me a favor on this he's like so it's just free forever and it's like no it's not free forever but I can Cod to my truck come back and be like yep just to be clear like it's going to be free for this month so the next three pickups or four pickups are on the house and that's just a way to earn your trust earn your business and
(22:16) hopefully give you some free Smiles on the house and then after that it just goes at 29 bucks a month great you have your IDE on you cuz I'd ask for that he'd go get his wallet he'd come back with his ID so they come with their ID you write down the information say cool can I trade you for the card you want to use you hold on to it until they give you the card then you swap cards you write down the credit card information so that they don't mess up the number because if they write it down they might change a number so it doesn't go through
(22:38) so you write the card information say awesome let me get your autograph boom number three the one that everyone's afraid of I take out the Johnson's trash and they wanted me to take out your trash I will tell you this if you ever do door to door which is the most aggressive of the sales like the hardest one to do in my opinion you will earn respect forever from everyone everyone knows what it takes to be a door to door salesman it's like you have to have thick skin and you got to learn how to talk to people if you look at Jeff basos you look at Bill Gates you look at Mark Cuban you look at Warren
(23:09) Buffett you look at some of the most successful people in the world they started in a door to-door face tof face toe-to-toe selling environment where they got to get rejected you have to learn how to sell as a base skill and it doesn't mean that you have to make money from selling but you have to learn the skill because you're going to have to sell your wife you're going to have to sell your kids you're going to have to sell your employees you're going to have to sell your investors you're going to have to sell customers and so learning how to get rejected and moving on with
(23:31) your life and realizing that nose are just coins that you toss in the machine where you roll before you get your win you can just remember that that you're putting it together Brick by Brick the success that you want built on nose then you get to where you want to go faster and just don't take it seriously that guy's having a bad day has nothing to do with me I'm just asking if he wants to take his trash out hey in case this disclaimer wasn't obvious this is a studio setting and we did it this way so that we could have perfect illustrations
(23:53) of each scenario real life is hardly that clean some people answer the door with a gun but this just gives you an idea of just how to literally take the first step knock on the door talk to the stranger ask the girl out do the thing and not be afraid of getting no because no is the price of yes so cold Outreach presents three problems that we will need to solve together problem number one is that you don't have their contact information number two is that even if I did contact them what do I say which comes down to a script and an offer and
(24:23) the third thing I've got the contacts I know what to say what my offer is but I'm not getting enough replies number one if we're trying to solve how do you contact someone you have to build a list so you build a list in three ways number one is that you build it with software just Google software for list insert whatever your avatar name is for plumbers for home services for whatever you pay a monthly fee you export a list that meets your criteria the second way you do it is you go to Brokers Brokers
(24:47) are people who own lists and they sell those lists to multiple people and so you go to Mr list broker you say hey this is a list that I'm looking for how many you got and they'll say I've got 177,000 contacts that means these criteria you say awesome how much and then you do a little negoti negoti and then option number three is you use the old elbow grease method which is that you assemble the list yourself now assembling the list yourself is in my opinion the most valuable way to do it because it's going to be a virgin list in the first two scenarios other businesses are also going to that software also going to those Brokers and
(25:16) so those leads might be tired of getting hit up it still works the long-term in my opinion best way to do this is to find the leads yourself and you do that through looking at Yelp Google Maps databases that exist online for free and you basically scrape them yourself you can also go to Facebook groups Reddit forums things like that where people are already assembled together all of these things are ways that you can build lists and the list should just have the way that you can contact them the second is you're like what do I say well I have the script inside of $100 million leads you can do that now the second part is
(25:46) bfv you're like what's bfv bfv is big fast value you'll notice that what I said with him was I had a free offer ready in my back pocket so I could disarm him if you're talking to strangers they're not going to be as friendly as the people who know you they're not going to be as polite and so you have to be even better with them with an amazing offer I'm saying something that is superior to what other people are charging for you'll be able to win more business and it's actually one of the biggest Force multipliers especially on cold Outreach to get people to say yes because they don't trust you so you have to give them a big
(26:16) incentive to do it anyways the third is I'm not getting enough replies and you solve that with one thing volume volume of reach out being willing to accept NOS 100 no a th NOS to get to your yes and we do that through Automation and through collaboration so you get other people to do more volume with you and you also do technology to automate different portions of reach outs because believe it or not every part of this process of building the list uh getting your you know phone system set up if you're doing cold calling if you're setting up accounts to do cold DMS all
(26:50) of these things are automatable to a great degree and so get good at Tech because it will give you huge leverage on the amount of replies that you will get back for the effort you put in and so method number four is one of the biggest baddest methods because it is the fastest and also the most risky to do but if you know how to do it well you can get bags of this this is money a bag of money so we just knocked on doors of complete strangers to get our first customers doing cold Outreach and now we'll
(27:20) transition to our fourth and final of the core 4 running paid ads are you backed up in trash you smell that smell is that what your Sunday night smells like when your trash is built up from the whole week does the smell of your trash drive you bananas because that time is over now what's that you missed your child's practice again you didn't get to watch your favorite show again you only have so many minutes in the day why would you spend it taking out your trash Alex did you take the trash out I'm watching the
(27:53) game on my phone ever feel like like that you don't have to anymore what's that you love trash as much as I do no impossible no one loves trash more than me and so why would you rob me of the opportunity to clean your trash up for you is this you every trash day a I missed it no if this is what your Monday looks like or whatever your trash day is the day after you miss it then you know exactly what I'm talking about and so having seen house after house after house busy professionals working home forgetting to take their
(28:30) trash out running after the truck to try and get it only to realize that they have to smell their trash for another week or until the next pickup day it's terrible and so I decided to make a business just to solve that problem and so we do three things better than everybody else number one is that we will never miss a pickup day ever we guarantee that because if we ever do we will give you three free months if we miss even one pickup day because we're so reliable at it number two is that we will always be on on time and so you're not like when are they going to pick it
(29:00) up I know it's out there so your trash isn't just sitting on front of your door for a day while you wait for us to pick it up we say that we're going to be there at 7:00 we're going to be there at 7:00 and the third thing is is that you will only hear two statements from our team yes sir no sir yes ma'am no ma'am that's it it's surfaced with a smile if that sounds interesting click the link or call 1800 Alex trash dum dum dum dum dum dum we are here running paid ads today the fourth of the core 4 talking
(29:25) to people who don't know you one to many this is how running paid ADS works there's lots of free value in someone's Newsfeed whether it's their television that they're watching or they're looking at the Instagram or the Tik Tok and then there's a PID ad that goes in between the value that they're receiving and then these are the strangers which you pay the platform to gain access to now when we run a paid ad there's really three parts to it you've got the hook you've got the meat of the video which
(29:48) is just like retain by the way if you're like hook retain reward it's like very similar the only difference is at the very end we're just going to make a call to action right whereas in a piece of content you might not do that and just have some sort of funny moment or something that makes it more sharable that's the main difference between the two and so the way that I've made ads cuz I've made ads for a long time the bulk of my material net worth has been made running paid advertising so I have a decent amount of experience doing it so let's watch together are you backed
(30:11) up in trash right off the bat we do have the hook which is a question it's a yes based question are you backed up now I have three visual cues here to create curiosity and create a call out and filtering mechanism man with glove trash slightly in the background so this just looks weird and so I'm going to get someone to maybe give me a half a second of their attention if this is what your Monday looks like so what I just did was present the problem you'll notice that all three of these things is simply honing in on who I want to respond because when you're with ads the reach
(30:41) is guaranteed you're spending money to reach eyeballs you want to make sure the ad communicates that this is for this specific type of person so they respond you'll notice there's different ways that you can start an ad with a call out all right so the call out usually goes before the hook the call out is you're trying to say to this specific Avatar this is for you you can do visual call call outs or you can do auditory call outs visual call out is something can see with their eyes that says this is for me an auditory call out is me saying Las Vegas homeowners this is who I'm
(31:06) talking to which is the best hook is saying this is for you and then you put your real hook which is the question or the lead to the ad forgetting to take their trash out running after the truck to try and get it these are all just paint points people who are busy at work they don't have time they're coming back home they're forgetting their trash day only to realize that they have to smell their trash for another week or until the next pickup day pain they have to smell their trash because they forgot about it and it's sitting there the whole point here is we're agitating the
(31:29) pain we're bringing up like oh yeah this is important I really do need to fix this this is something that I hate having to deal with and so we do three things better than everybody else so notice I'm then introducing three things all right so when I was selling fitness programs I sold Fitness Nutrition accountability trying to come up with three things for whatever the core service helps people know that you're about to tell them what it is so that opens the loop so they're more likely to listen and then it just gives them a way to organize the information so they can know the benefits and I've just found three works great number one is that
(31:57) that we will never miss a pickup day ever and so I present the probably the biggest pain point that they have because that's what I intro the clip with I put my guarantee right in the middle sometimes you can put the guarantee at the end sometimes you put the guarantee at the beginning so you can move the guarantee around it felt like it matched most with this pain point and saying not only that just to go above and beyond I'm going to deliver this really fast value crazy amazing offer so if we miss one day we're going to give you 3 months free now all you
(32:19) got to do is make sure that you don't do that and if you have a business then why would you miss it but it sounds insane number two is that we will always be on time all right the other issue is like what other pain points are there it's like well even if you know that what day that someone's coming there do you want to have trash poed up in front of your house it's another pain point so the deeper you know your avatar and the deeper you know the pain points that they're experiencing around whatever the problem is the more detailed you can be in description of the pain and so copy
(32:43) and advertising is about the details the smell of the trash the chasing after it the having it pile up in front of your house the smell when Neighbors come in not just like you smelling it but like have you ever had somebody else come in cuz that affects status so there's different ways that you can attack the same same problem the first one I say might not be the one that they feel like they suffer from so I want to say multiple things so that one of them hits a pain point and they're like wow this does affect me and the third thing is is
(33:07) that you will only hear two statements from our team yes sir yes ma'am what's the next paino is they probably have a lot of low-skilled laborers who pick up trash who are not that friendly and don't have a lot of Rapport and so for me to just Elevate our service to everybody else to say yes sir no sir yes ma'am no ma'am because in today's day and age no one treats anyone with respect and so my company would be about that because respect would be a paino for these types of individuals and now we transition to CTA which is the call to action so that we actually get them to do something from this app if that
(33:37) sounds interesting click the link or call 1800 Alex trash and that is one example of the app you can have one or two or three kind of meaty portions of it where you hit on the pain a couple different ways maybe talk about the benefits in a couple different ways but you can have way more hooks because the hook is going to be the most important part of this ad because 80% of people are going to decide not to watch your ad in the first 3 seconds so that's the part you test the most if you can get them to buy the ad in the first 3 seconds you have bought yourself more
(34:07) time to consume the rest of it is this you every trash day so it's a yes based question in front of two visual call outs that look like somebody you is a homeowner who is trash that would be the hook you smell that smell is that what your Sunday night smells like yes based question with a very weird intro that might catch people's attention does the smell of your trash drive you bananas so that is a yes based question with humor and like if I wanted to attract doctors I wouldn't dress this way and I wouldn't be in the setting so
(34:37) the setting and the Avatar of the person in the ad will do more to attract the right types of people than anything else if you want to track more women put women in the ads and if you're like man I'm a guy and surprisingly all of my clients are men it's probably because you're in the ads so if you want to have twice the reach have two or three or four different people in the ads that you have it's one of the easiest ways to double or triple your business or lead flow what's that you missed your child's practice again didn't get to watch your
(35:05) favorite show again all right so here's two yes based questions that those are both pain yes based questions if they say yes I have been missing these things then I connect that to trash I'm bridging it to the trash problem it's really a problem of not having time I'm just choosing to put that towards trash what's that you love trash as much as I do so just like that we've got a hook and a lot of there's visual action at the beginning of this to break the attention of the normal news feed that someone might be experiencing or the TV that they're watching Alex did you take the trash out I'm watching the game on
(35:34) my phone so that is a relatable moment that every man has had when they get asked to take out the trashes you're just doing something else that you'd rather do besides take the trash out and so each of these hooks can lead right into that original first video I sent you just cut off the first 5 seconds and then you use this and then it Clips right to there's three things that we do better than everybody else and then we go right into it and that's how you make pay adts and that gives us the fourth way that you can get customers in the core for for trash business or any other business you want to start and when we
(36:04) put them all together it looks like this boms [Applause] [Music] away so it'll be a montage of you throwing trash bags over your shoulder dumping it into the big recepticle you're going to be spraying the money gun everywhere cuz you've turned so much trash Into Cash we'll edit this down for YouTube we'll make it for the podcast we'll post on Tik Tok shorts everything what do you think I think that idea is garbage

(00:00) the hardest respect to earn is one's own over the years my wife and i created acquisition.com which portfolio of companies does about 85 million a year i get questions all the time in terms of like how do you create these businesses how do you sell stuff how do you live your life all of those kinds of things and i was talking to a good friend who'd come back into my life briefly we actually started at the same time together there was a there was a period of time that he did significantly better than me just from a
(00:25) financial perspective and then i ended up passing him and we met back up a few years later and he was a little bit down and the conversation that we had was really enlightening for me and the conversations we've had since and so i wanted to share that with you the main purpose for this video as i'm getting to it is to underline how do you actually do the stuff that creates the wealth the empire the status all that stuff and i think that this is where people get really tripped up the reason i say that is there's kind of three elements to the
(00:55) the goal right so you have the external result that you're looking for which might be make more money get a six pack whatever you've got the processes behaviors activity that result in that goal right being achieved which would be like doing the work the third aspect is being the type of person who does those things so basically identifying with those types of behaviors or being the type of person who does those types of activities which then creates the reward right i think james clear talks about this in his book atomic habits but
(01:24) there's a lot of behavioral psychologists who've touched on this point and you probably have heard be do have at some point in your personal development journey and if you haven't welcome to the game and so one of the things and this is what i wanted to give to you in this in this video is a keystone habit that has served me very well and it's only been in retrospect explaining it to someone else that i kind of had more clarity on it which is why i'm sharing it with you when i have something that i want that i do not have
(01:50) so i have a desire which means i've made a contract with myself to be unhappy until i get what i want right and so i have this thing that i want externally and i think i've had enough experience with this to know that simply writing down the goal means nothing and so i think this is contrary to common belief or practice which is like people write down their goals are more likely to succeed sure i mean having a direction is more likely to achieve than than not having a direction so i'm not going to disagree with that but here's an
(02:13) interesting statement that may hit you which is that winners and losers have the same goals right everybody olympics has the same goal everybody who's in business has the same goal right they want to increase how much money they're making you sell more products get more customers etc so the goals are actually not that unique and so the fact that we're writing them down sure it's a first step because we have to have a direction in terms of what are we trying to accomplish sure but i think that what you'll see that is different
(02:36) because if you look at two people with the same goals and one person achieves them the other person hasn't then it can't be having the goal that is the main driver of success right right and so then you get you know you dive a step underneath that and you look at what are the behaviors that created that goal and now we get much closer to the things that are actually driving the progress what gets more interesting at least to me is if we know the activities that are going to generate the result we want so maybe it's we want to get more customers
(03:01) which means we need to advertise more and i use advertised by the definition of what the word actually means which is to make known and so if we do activities that make our products and services known like doing more private communications which would be one-on-one reach outs one-on-one cold calls 101 dms one-on-one emails etc prospecting or one-to-many so public communication which should be uh you know broadcasting across different platforms for media right so you have radio you could have an email list you could have um actually
(03:26) that would be an example of a high version of scale of the original so i apologize there but like making posts on social media things that are public forum where people can find out about it right if you do more of those things more people find out and that would be the activity that's associated with getting more customers right but the thing is is that people will know what that activity is right they will know that inherently they should be doing more of it and yet they don't and so that is kind of the purpose that i
(03:49) wanted to drill down in this short video today is why not and what is the way that we can try and correct that or fix that i wanted to give you the simplest single hack that i have used inadvertently and seen a tremendous amount of success that is asking myself the question what would a person who does this type of thing do in this instance the one that i'll tell you that i've repeated a lot to myself over the years probably over the last five or ten years has been the repeated chorus of what would a wise man do i think it's
(04:20) because i did not consider myself to be very wise and i acted many ways that were unwise earlier on in my life and i still continue to do so uh but i try to do less of it right and i think that and i'll borrow this again from james clear's book your identity is much more of a weighing system actually this is not from this book but like it's much more of a voting system where you you cast votes in either direction based on your activities of what type of person you want to become and i think the simplest distillation of that concept is
(04:49) simply asking the question what would this type of person do if you can use that as the refrain that you come back to over and over again the chorus of your day that gets repeated over and over again i think it's much easier than trying to remember the 50-point checklist of all the activities that you need to do to achieve the goal and the the friend that came back in my life um where we were having this conversation i just distilled it down to like what would a billionaire do and so when we're confronted with these
(05:16) crossroads right you wake up in the morning and you're like i don't know what i should start it's like what would a billionaire do and so basically what you can do is have a certain refrain or chorus that you ask yourself what would this type of person do and that type of person when you ask that question is who you will eventually become as you continue to cast votes that reinforce the stories that we tell ourselves about who we are and those are the things that create long-lasting deep change and what's more about this is
(05:41) that these changes when they become internal when they become ingrained in our behavior they become effortless but it takes time and so i think that the mental cue that i have given myself inadvertently over the years i don't have a lot of choruses that i refrain to or that i come back to over and over again and so i tweeted about one and it got shared a zillion times but is what would someone 10 times smarter than me do in this situation right and a different way of saying that is what would a billionaire do and and word in
(06:10) whatever way that resonates with you but i think rather than having that big checklist you can put just a little post-it on your computer or wherever you work that's a reminder to yourself that this is the type of person i want to become and in order to become this type of person i need to do these things because those actions will reinforce the thoughts that i say about myself because the whole concept behind affirmations that i do not like right which is i am a you know i'm a lion i'm a tiger i'm a whatever right just saying them doesn't
(06:39) make them true unless you're a crazy person and most of us are not crazy i think right there's plenty of crazy if you don't get me wrong but if you're probably watching this channel you're probably at least semi-same right if we have you know this degree of sanity that's on our side then what we have to do is create something else which is evidence we have to give ourselves evidence that we are this type of person in order to become that but how do you have evidence that you are going to be this person when you
(07:02) have none well it starts with activity it starts with doing the stuff and as an added correlator depending on the goal that you have it might be what would a person with a six pack do what would a pro champion bodybuilder do what would an amazing husband do or what would the best husband in the world do and so you can use this framework of asking the question of what your ideal self would do in any given circumstance to apply to a vast number of scenarios so rather than trying to fix for the habit fixed for the being and then the
(07:28) habits will take care of themselves in accordance with the type of person that you have stated you wish to become and so then the goals we have become becoming the person we want to be once we know who we want to become then that can direct the types of activities that will be in accordance with that and the reason i like this better too is that if we're trying to reinforce an identity or an identity trait about ourselves this is a really good habit i think that i've picked up over the years but breaking down the etymology of words
(07:56) is really really cool and i think really teaches us a lot about the words we say and words matter a lot because they are the things that encapsulate thoughts a classic one which is like i didn't really like the word philosopher because i thought it sounded really fluffy when i found out the etymology behind the word which is filet which is to love or to like and then sophos which is knowledge or wisdom it's lover of wisdom and i was like well shoot i am a lover of wisdom and so now i actually have a very positive association with the word
(08:22) and to the same degree identity um comes from like uh i don't remember the actual latin word but entity is being right like just beingness and it's in and of itself and identical which is repeated so repeated beingness is what your identity is so your actions what you do literally becomes who you are which means that we can actively change who we are by changing what we do but it is a reinforcing secular path of like i am this type of person and therefore i do these things and because they do these types of things i am this type of person
(08:50) right and so it's the chicken or the egg but at some point we need to take action in order to do that and so i think the simple and easiest cue that we can use to change who we are to change character traits that we find undesirable is to simply ask ourselves when we're confronted with the decision what would this type of person do and then act in accordance to that and i find it much simpler than having the lists and having the the daily routines and the things like that because if you are this type of person
(09:19) you will do the types of things that that type of person would do and that also comes down to the many decisions we haven't accounted for yet you're going to be confronted with situations that you have not predicted in fact the vast majority of us don't predict things well in general it's because there's far more variables than we can possibly comprehend i think it's much more useful for us to think about ourselves in terms of if i were to encompass all of the things that i would like to be right and that's why i think the the
(09:47) what would jesus do was such a powerful statement in the christian community overall and candidly people outside of the christian community could use that same exact thing which would jesus do in this instance and probably get the right activity and become more like jesus right which is the entire goal of the christian faith and if it makes it easier for you to think in a more tangible sense when you're asking yourself the question i think the reason the jesus thing was so powerful is that it's there's a very real identity that
(10:12) they're associating this decision with um the ones that i asked are what would king solomon do um which he was considered you know one of the richest and wisest men which is why it's someone that i i revert back to and the other person that i asked myself was what would they do in this situation is warren buffett and charlie munger when i ask myself that question and it depends on the scenario which person i'm going to draw on to answer the question depending on what suits best you know what best suits the objective etc um but
(10:41) i think if you can if you can if you don't know someone that you can make it the value or the version of yourself with that value or you can just use an external person that embodies a lot of the character traits that you hope to have and that can be equally as effective so it just depends on who you are but i think any of those are good strategies that you can employ to maximally use this kind of tactic for self-improvement and self-change what we repeatedly choose to ask ourselves which creates our identity which then creates
(11:09) the tasks that we do in the activities we spend our time on reinforces the story that we tell ourselves about who we are right or what type of person we are what i shared with this individual i said you know what do you want to become and if it's like a billionaire it's like cool then what would a billionaire do and always asking ourselves that question and the reason that this was important when i was talking to this individual i'll read you the text that i had that i had said to him because they got shared all over instagram when i
(11:31) when i tweeted them or whatever is that after you left i said here's a thought for you so i was just like thinking about the conversation we had and he had felt kind of shitty and what's interesting about this is like as you level up in your life and this is just an observation that i've had is that like you will simply change who you compare yourself to and i think jordan peterson talks about this in some talk he had but i find it very true which is you just change who you compare yourself to and so you always find a way to make
(11:54) yourself feel terrible and even if you're the best in the world and stuff you'll just look at people who are better at other things than you and compare yourself to them to make yourself feel bad this is what i said to him and i'll share it with you i said every winner and every loser have the same goals what separates them are the activities they commit to committing to the activities that is the goal so commit to the activities that is the goal when you make a lot of money one month you've achieved nothing because
(12:17) the goal is the activities and then later i said do me a favor instead of writing down your goals just write down what would a billionaire who lost it all do or what would a billionaire do to keep it simple or whatever version of yourself you want to be the doing and the outcomes will happen as a result of the main internal identity shift which you can reinforce many times a day by asking yourself that question at each crossroad and so i i think that was uh relatively you know i i think it's a good point to end off on which is the
(12:43) only tactical ask that i have for you is to simply write down what type of person do i wish to become and then make that the chorus that you recite to yourself when you're at your your crossroads when you're at your decision points that are going to create who you are on a repeated basis every single day and i think going back to that refrain will be all-encompassing in terms of what would jesus do applies to a zillion scenarios but everyone at least in the christian faith and i use it because it's a very simple catch-all would want to become
(13:11) more christ-like right and so whatever the christ version is for you we can steal from that concept and continually reinforce it by asking ourselves those questions and if you ask yourself the next joshua question which is well alex i don't know what a billionaire would do or i don't know what an ifbb pro champ would do or i don't know what a okay well there's two ways you can see this number one is that most people know what they need to do to lose weight but they don't actually do it so i think that i could push back on the vast majority of
(13:36) people and say no you probably do know that and i like this saying a lot which is we need to be reminded more than we need to be taught most people know they should be doing more than they're currently doing in order to achieve their goals and i think an example of that is if you're if your family were kidnapped you would probably act differently right when you were trying to save them because you would take significantly more massive action in order to do so right you would take huge action in order to accomplish the goals
(14:02) which also means that you're the type of person who wants to save their family which is actually kind of a total side note here right but um in in doing that you already knew what to do all along you just weren't taking the action now that's if that's the vast majority of situations is covered with that example but if you're in the minority of situations right which is like well i don't know how to become a billionaire right well what are the things that would lead you towards that right which might be like maybe you need
(14:24) to lower it a little bit which is what would a millionaire do and if it's not that then what would somebody who's trying to become a millionaire do and they would probably talk to millionaires or whatever or talk to people like the thing is is if you really want to go bad enough you can ask the question in such a way that you would be able to answer it and make progress right and then the nature of the question itself can develop over time as you discover what you believe you need to do and i really will say this again
(14:50) the vast majority of us know what we need to do we're just simply not doing it and i think attacking why we're not doing it is a much more fruitful conversation than trying to discover the the secrets of the universe because the people who achieve the really extraordinary things do the uncommonly obvious thing for an inordinate period of time and that is what separates them is that they are doing it because it is who they are rather than something to achieve an outcome that is fine and external that they don't have control
(15:15) over because if you are doing it for who you are you will continue to play the game indefinitely which will give you the outsize returns versus the person who is doing it to make money which means that when they do make money one month they pull back on the gas because they accomplish their objective of doing the external thing rather than being who they are or more of who they want to be and so if you're new to the channel by the way welcome my name's alex like i said earlier my wife and i own acquisition.com it's a company that buys
(15:39) minority interests in uh service based info coaching uh digital products type businesses and then helps them scale to like 30 50 million and beyond and that's what we do full time but i do this stuff uh just because i struggled a lot on the way up and i don't want other people to struggle and i don't want my pain to be in vain and so that is why i make these videos so um welcome to mozzie nation lots of love and i'll see you guys in the next video bye

Transcript:
(00:00) if we were to just triple and get to a million this year would you be okay with that all we're going to make you so much money this is Ashley she runs a personal styling business and my name is Alex mosy and I own acquisition.
(00:11) comom which is a portfolio of companies that makes more money than I will ever need for the rest of my life and so today Ashley will be explaining to me her biggest business challenges and I'm going to try to help her scale her business $2 million in revenue and beyond all right hi I'm Ashley caps I'm founder of AC Styles so we are a professional wardrobe and personal styling service that helps trans transform our clients confidence and save some time so Revenue we make about 309,000 annually 130,000 in profits that gives us about 42% in net margins so we've been in business for about 4 years and so far we've served over a th000 clients thousand clients yeah how'd you get a
(00:50) th000 in four years that's over my whole uh career the business has been for you've done a th000 yourself awesome super cool so my immediate reaction was she serves luxury clientele and a lot of people who serve luxury clientele don't charge enough because they sell out of their own wallet rather than out of the wallet of the person they're serving or the value that they're providing so that was something that was in the back of my mind 42% profit margin you know healthy a little bit low given the fact that I figured
(01:14) this was like a solar printer thing so I was going to I be curious what the other costs of the business were to make this happen so who do you help right now about 50/50 men and women typically in their 40s all the way to their mid-60s these are folks that are stay-at-home moms they could be frequent flyers they could be going up in their career into the SE Suite those that really value their time and really also value having expertise so how do you help them we transform our clients fashion style and
(01:40) confidence and also help save them time so we have two different phases in the way that we do things so onboarding phase phase one so we do a style assessment so basically we establish Baseline with their current style a low style you look terrible like look at the mirror you look horrible pretty much okay we establish Baseline and then we show them where they can go so once we show them they can go that's when we go in we gut the closet we get rid of everything and we get them into some new outfits looking feeling good and then from there that's when we determine you
(02:09) know just based on their lifestyle does it make sense to work together on like a monthly level on a quarterly level at that point we know we have ongoing styling sessions we put lookbooks together okay cool and we have like an on demand Service as well that they can text us if like oh I goty if you will pretty much so when you say you show them what the future looks like is that just like here's a like like looks of like other models or something like that or like putting together a style mood board and then we also prior to that we say hey just based on your complexion
(02:38) here's the colors that are going to complement you and then based on your dimensions of your figure here's like the Silhouettes that are going to work best for you oh cool and then a big component of it is lifestyle like what are they doing on a day-to-day life and making sure that whatever they buy fits the life that they're living today and not just like oh that looks really cool on a mannequin got it initial reaction seeing phase one and phase two that ashy put together was good every quality business has recurring or reoccurring Revenue recurring means some sort of membership or subscription reoccurring
(03:08) is like Coca-Cola you buy some Coca-Cola this month and next month even though you're not on a subscription and so the quality of a service or product is dictated by the percentage of customers that want to buy it again and again and again the idea is that you want to acquire a customer once and have them pay you for the rest of their lives so how do you make money important question so onboarding package that I mentioned 8,500 bucks that's over the course of 60 days then it goes into either monthly at 2K a month or quarterly at 4500 a
(03:35) quarter and then right now we also make about 10% of our revenue from commission from clothes we get about 10% margins from the the vendors that we work with Okay and right now we just actually focused on having just this luxury tier in the past we had two different tiers and we focus more on one time and you realize you make more money on the luxury tier so you do more of that yeah love it all right so that's what you sell that's how you make money where do you find them so right now we're doing AdWords we're spending about 300 a month
(04:02) with Google and then we're also spending about 300 a month with Thumbtack we have affiliates with other luxury like services so like matchmakers and things like that we host events and then also of course client referrals do you know what percentage of customers come from each of this uh roughly you don't know worries four are coming from Affiliates I think about a third is coming from the other two and then a third is coming from refer so kind of like evenly split between referrals would you consider Affiliates referrals or not no I kind of segment
(04:31) those out okay so referrals is one Affiliates is another then paid ads between Thumbtack and Google yeah I like to understand what percentage of customers are coming from every source so that I can see like is sometimes there's one where it's like oh 90% of my customers come from this and then when I ask where they're allocating their time it's like well I'm putting half my time and this thing is getting me 10% of my customers and then the other half my time is getting me 90% it's like okay well then let's double down on that thing and the next following question is like okay well is this Tapped Out is
(04:56) this an exhausted Source or can we do more and most times you can do more okay so that's where you get them from how many do you get a month so right now we're looking at about 12 total leads eight appointments 100% show for those appointments total sales four so close ratees 50% show ratees 100% 40 clients currently and uh one churned in the last year okay these 40 clients still pay you monthly these are active yeah okay okay so they're coming in from different timelines so some are monthly some are
(05:25) quarterly some are annually just from different package testing we're going to probably talk about that in a second the 40 clients thing because I think you probably have a big Revenue opportunity there so what's the goal right now all right so you know just the easy five million revenue and really I think what we can do is because it's easy for me to get stylists to train them is to build like an education component just like a totally different business I know yeah but have Stylus in major metros okay so
(05:51) have stylist in other metros and then the long term is to be able to create a training program for them like super long term like super super long term super super longm next lifetime oh I'm just messing with you but fundamentally for this business the goal is 5 million doing what you currently do or a scaled up version of what you do and in other met major metros yeah yeah no that's cool that makes sense 5 million big number we can do it what's the problem so what's what's what's holding you back what's getting in the way leads okay we
(06:18) need lead flow we need more of them consistently and we just we need more at bats that's really what it is and also I haven't been able to be as consistent with content creation and I think there's opportunity Miss there for most small business owners as long as the core economics are good which a lot of times they're not once you have the core economics of the business you have your price properly so you have enough gross margin you have good stick rates and people want to keep paying you over and over again they come back they refer their friends which actually has all of
(06:43) these things then it's kind of Shifting back to the front and saying we just got to get way more leads in the door we got to let more people know about it which is going to come down to advertising all right understand all that show me the numbers so 309 in total revenue 130 in profit 42% net margin Blended CAC of 600 um LTV is 10K annually so that gives us a 16 to1 LTV to CAC ratio 600 in marketing spend show ratees 100% close ratees 50 okay got it from a basic economic standpoint her business is actually really healthy the fact that she's only lost one customer over a year out of 40 That's whatever 2 and a half%
(07:21) turn annually is phenomenal the fact that she has you know decent sh rates and close rates all of that's good and so me looking at these numbers shows me that she's delivering some core value to a key audience and honestly it's just the N is low she just need to do way more volume and then do you have any other stuff by platform so Google we're looking at 3,400 for the year for 2024 cost per click $189 total clicks 1,800 do you have prices on the site what do when they click where they click does it show your prices or is it just like an opt-in page I do not show prices is
(07:51) there a video that's being implemented right now okay okay but I think that that's the uh big problem is it's just like he and you don't give them anything right there's no reason for them to opt in all right we're going to make you so much money it's a lot of fun so when I saw 1,800 Clicks in eight sales it was clearly a conversion issue and so she's leaking a huge amount of prospects who aren't immediately ready to buy CU that's all she has available is like click you know click here schedule call and basically buy and there's no incentive and so I'm very interested to
(08:21) see what we can do to solve that conversion issue because it could be a massive unlock for the business so despite like basically no incentive for someone to actually book a call you're still making eight sales and so I think that what's happening right now is that like you the show up rate and the close rates you have like you're just basically skimming the absolute people who are like are in such a dire pain and they don't and you don't know them because they're coming from ads right right right like if you if you're in
(08:47) that situation then like like this may sound exciting for you but like you could probably 5 to 10 x the sales of the business just by fixing this like we could do nothing else and you could just do that so we'll get into that in a second but okay the good news is that even with the massive amount of inefficiency that's there your ltbd CAC is still really strong it's really good and I think we're just losing we're just leaking a lot in the in this process okay show me the thumb tech one okay also people that are in pain right now CU they know that they're searching for it so 6K total spend Leads Here 58 leads
(09:18) 38 bucks a lead total sales eight CAC 750 same LTV okay thing is thumb Tac is like 90 to 95% unqualified in terms of purchasing power M so it it's good because it was a way for us to rank higher for SEO through this page through your thumb teac page that you then pay extra to promote yeah on thumb teac okay cool I mean 38 bucks at least not bad um given the price point that you have but the issues that they are unqualified so do you actually do you have a minimum income requirement I would say for this new model a million a year in income yeah okay so yeah so this is definitely
(09:56) a top 1% 1% because 8,500 Plus what is like it's about 25k all in for the service the other the thing is they have to have money for the clothes as well so you're looking at about a 40 50k let's just even say 25k year spend in close Average Joe schok canot yeah I love that Ashley is going after high income earners I think a lot of business owners are afraid to go after high income earners and I'm very happy that Ashley's already identified rather than trying to say like I'm trying to come up with this diet light really mini versions she's just leaned into what
(10:28) she's obviously really passionate about about and just trying to find the customers who can actually afford to do the type of work that she wants to help them with she doesn't compromise her quality to meet lower-end customers and I think that's really cool to be clear I'm not saying that there's not a space in the market for something like that it's just obviously not her passion and so she should stick to what she loves is there a specific like life event or something that happens that triggers people into like getting getting into this buying cycle yeah so it is typically a a a transition moment I had
(10:55) a baby my body has changed none of my clothes fit that's for women I got divorced both men and women or I'm just I'm getting I want to start dating period my image doesn't match my status as a sea Lev person or even VP yeah so that those are those are the typical triggers okay I feel triggered um no you're good okay so that's the thumb D data tell me more about the affiliate side the the the mat because you've got I've got I get both of these these I understand the referral side I understand both your paid acquisition Parts I think the continuity
(11:27) is lacking we can work on that I think there's efficiency ad funnel we'll talk about that I think Affiliates is kind of the last piece uh before we dive into like figuring out what we're going to do so for those you who don't know what an affiliate is come closer I've got a book $100 million leads and inside I'll I'll read you the definition so Affiliates are independent businesses that tell Their audience to buy your stuff and so Affiliates seem like referrals on the outside but are actually much different
(11:50) under the hood first they have their own businesses and do their own advertising second they agree to offer your stuff to their engaged leads in exchange for money free stuff or both both so she has these Social Clubs and these matchmakers that are existing businesses that advertise their own services and she can kind of harness those businesses to just funnel some of their leads her way for free now she has to do some sort of deal with them to make it worth their while but sometimes some businesses are like oh you help my customers too and I don't want to do that so here so basically
(12:23) they we it's just like a lead pass through so they make the introduction and we offer a complimentary style assessment to help help them get their dating profiles ready it's really just a glorified sales call okay yeah and so you have these mat how many matchmakers do you have who refer you customers on a regular basis so combination of private social club and matchmakers we have about six okay how did you find them Googling them and reaching you reach out and did it that way mhm and what percentage did they send you so as of
(12:54) this year it's about a third ooh M interesting so when I see that she's got only six people that are sending her a third of her business and then when I asked how she got them she just said oh I just kind of like Googled them and reached out I was like I had an inkling that she had not done that much work to get a third of her business that sounds like onetime effort and then ongoing new business like that's the type of high leverage work that I love to see because then each of these Affiliates become consistent nodes of business for you so
(13:26) even though the customers themselves may or may not recur obviously she is is a recurring Revenue model but the Affiliates themselves become consistent traffic sources where they send every month one or two customers one or two customers one or two customers and so all we have to do is say how do we go from 6 to 60 okay cool it's cuz it's like very aligned audiences yeah they're literally already buying the types of services related to what you want it's great I feel like I'm pretty clear on what what he said okay yeah but if you were to become an AC Styles client okay
(13:57) here's an outfit you've got these really nice Olive under tones dark features so navies Browns these are your tones and there it is in action I like the we want to look like the one on the right we actually look like the one on the left you know what I mean I could be Giga chat this could be me thank you all I got no I appreciate it this is good okay so you want to make 5 million right and we're at 300 so that's a 17x from where you're currently at right and so if we were to just triple and get to a million this year would you be okay with that totally down
(14:30) cool cuz then going from a triple to a 5x from there it's like because the thing is the business will usually change there's there's something called the Chinese rule of three and 10 which fundamentally just means that sysems break when they triple and so I like to think in in triples in terms of unless there's some massive order of magnitude change that we can do but the things that we have right now a handful of these are triples independently and so when put together I think we we absolutely could get the five but I just
(14:53) like setting goals and expectations kind of kind of that way so that you're not like oh my God I only made a million dollars this year poor me so Ashley's about to come over to this side of the table and I'm going to walk through a bunch of solutions I think can help her grow our business but before I do that comment below and would love to see how you guys think and how it compares to what we ultimately end up doing all right that was awesome you did great I've got some notes why don't you sit over here and we'll gaml it out I think what I want to do is break this
(15:17) down in terms of who so let's talk about the Avatar a little bit because then that'll inform the offer and paid ad stuff a little bit more to get it targeted and then clean up the funnel okay so first thing I want to talk about is going to be the Avatar is getting it on who you are going to serve cuz right now you serve a lot of people not to say that it's a bad thing but I think over time we are going to get narrower so that we can make our value proposition a little bit more compelling for them the next is going to be paid ads uh funnel
(15:41) which we're going to look at the pages and we're going to look at the offers so that we can see okay can we tweak something we add a lead magnet here that would get the right people and word off the bad ones and is there kind of some process things that we can do that just will stop the leakage the third piece is still Acquisitions it'll be Affiliates that I want to cover and then the fourth uh what I want to hit on is uh continuity and so those are the big four that I want to hit on we can talk about the corporate thing that you mentioned in between my initial gut reaction is
(16:05) not yet because the thing is is like if we can get to a million probably we could probably given the things that I think that we're going to uncover here you could probably get to like two is two to three just from some of the things I'm going to show you in a second cool okay then maybe you get to there you're at three you might be like wow what if I just kept doing this rather than the other thing um okay so Avatar Clarity do you have any idea if there are some customers that are like way better than others or that you enjoy
(16:29) enjoy working with more like what's your dream customer and just like work backwards from there stay-at-home mom okay frequent traveler kids with many social events mom who has kids with many social events yeah okay like one daughter just got married son is having a baby that kind of thing so usually mom so it's Mom right so there's kids obviously cuz it's Mom okay got it there's a few of these women plus money got it and they just want to have new outfits for all of their trip like socials kind social lights private not
(17:00) public people yeah yeah I understand okay so Mom socialites is that the number one your favorite Avatar and then men CEOs okay by percentage of Revenue is it 5050 yeah it is interesting okay CEO man huh do you ever get cross cells CEO men gets wife wife starts or husband starts typically wife starts interesting this is kudos to Ashley that she really understands her Avatar and she understands kind of the the part of their life that they're going through and what path to status they're seeking to fill with her services and the reason
(17:33) I was pushing on this is because sometimes you'll find a business owner who serves two type of customers hates one loves the other and then still feels like kind of beholden to keeping that one that they don't like because maybe it starts paying the bills and then also the reason I asked for the split is this as as silly as it sounds sometimes it's like 30% of my business is this customer I hate and 70% of the business is customer I love and in those instances it's like great get rid of those ones and double down on these ones that you love now she happens to love both and so
(17:58) maybe in the future maybe at 3 million maybe at 5 million a year I would maybe look at this to revisit and say hey now that we've had way more reps do one of these customers stay longer are they worth more some of these you know people refer more than others but right now given the data we have I don't want to have her pick I'm cool with sticking with both pay ads funnel can we pull up her uh Google ads oh so they're not running right now oh they're not running right now okay do you know what page they go to let's go to the work with us
(18:22) page personal styling it's probably the closest okay is it get more info if we click that will that take us there no Okay click on that though that takes us to so right now they're filling out this air table form that and then I send them MH a kind of a brochure that breaks down our services and then gets them to book a call so that's a very simple funnel all right and so this is them filling out they basically check these boxes and then scroll down okay so then we have the contact First this is just a big application yeah okay so first thing that we can do on this one is is and
(18:59) obviously this isn't I mean you could okay there's a lot of things here but um wherever you're driving your traffic to so whether it's the homepage or it's this page you should probably have some big lead magnet that people are going to want what's something that somebody like that would want a lot so that's been my thing after reading offers and thinking about a lead magnet it's like what appeals to these people and they don't want to sit there and like get a checklist of how to go through their closet themselves so the only thing I
(19:24) could think of and this isn't very scalable is the complimentary style assessment but that's one-on-one with somebody mhm and that's okay though cuz I mean you're still getting them to more of them to opt in but right now is the assessment the thing that they're booking on the Google ads page today it's just a a call okay so it's not being positioned as as that so for like the the 1.
(19:51) 0 version is uh style assessment is what you can basically promise them uh on the landing page but I was thinking more something like really tactical like the perfect outfit for you like one perfect outfit or something to match their skin like like your ideal colors like that would be a cool one cuz like that doesn't you have to like put a whole thing together it's just like oh this skin cone you know there's like 10 tones and you just pick the one that's appropriate for them yeah okay so we we're going to we were going to do that next and and also something else we were going to do the one perfect
(20:16) outfit but it's it's so nuanced but then we were thinking okay what if we just share with them hey here's how B like what are some of the steps that they do to prepare to if if they were to work with us how are they invested so we were thinking like take their measurements having them do some of these steps like create uh creating a a mood board themselves so we want them so for a lead ma to be really valuable we want it to be risk-free easy and fast and so those things require effort okay and so we don't want the Avatar to work to get the value we want them to just click and get
(20:49) the value okay and so I think what we think about is like I like I think this is actually really interesting this is just me me personally so maybe I'm a CEO man but it's like there are some some skin tones that combination basically it's like you have a combination of hair and skin tone and eye color that is unique to you and between all these different permutations there's a hundred different variations people can have and they have a different color palette that would be unique to them now you'll know
(21:11) behind the scenes that there's probably like eight different you know color stylers or whatever and so I think either doing color cuz that feels like the easiest one degree more Nuance than that would be a specific style being like you know Street Wear hip-hop like whatever you know what I'm saying like you know that better than me professional casual yeah exactly and so I think that this is like you could do this tomorrow you don't have to change anything just by repositioning lead magnet so the reason that I'm hitting so hard on lead magnets and I have a whole
(21:36) chapter about this inside the leads book is lead Magnets How to engage your leads is that she has this huge leak in her in her funnel right 1,00 clicks and only eight Sals so it's like we can solve this with the right lead magnet now most people give terrible lead magnets so so a lot of people give no lead magnets the the the few that do give lead magnets often give terrible lead magnets and so we want to have an exceptional lead magnet which typically means we have to work more on the front end so that our Prospect has to work less and so it's
(22:01) kind of like pre- digesting the food so that they can just immediately get the value think about you as a baby bird just kind of feeding your prospects the value and as a little Pro tip for you if you have the choice between two lead magnets one thing that's more valuable but takes longer and the other is less valuable but immediate this is the one that customers will rather have especially as a lead magnet which then can lead to a service that looks more like this I would experiment with the different headlines there and then we
(22:24) need to measure the conversion rate of the page I know that you've turned them down can you pull up the um the uh numbers the interesting thing here is like 1,00 clicks I think we could be able to get somewhere in the neighborhood of like if we're doing this right like 500 leads from that amount of spend oh and just if literally we just need to nail this because on a Google ad High intent search like this you should be able to get like 30% of people to op in so from a benchmark perspective to this to something that is right for this audience the only reason
(22:55) we were able to identify this whole and huge opportunity in Ashley's business is because she actually had her data and so it is amazing to me the amount of business owners who have no data on their business and they're like man I don't know what to do well once you get the data the data can often tell you where your opportunities are and so here there was a clear leak now she might not know the benchmarks for this but having been in the industry of business typically an opt-in page for some sort of lead magnet with qualified traffic can get somewhere between 20 and 50 sometimes 60% of people to opt in for it
(23:24) if it's very clearly defined and there's a good match between the traffic that's coming in and so for her me saying I think 30% is a good Benchmark is kind of where that came from like so if someone's looking for personal stylus near me or personal stylus La then it's like what is the first piece and like I always think about like our offer is you've got all these steps that someone has to take can I peel off the first one even though it's something that I normally charge for what's my actual cost it's going to be time can I template some of these things out so
(23:48) that I can still provide a lot of value but not have it take too much of my personal time and the cool thing with these um like kind of like more costly or unscalable lead magnets is that you only have to give it to people were qualified so you are not obligated to like you can choose to do this only if someone who meets these qualifications and you just say that in the landing page okay so it's like hey if you're a mom with kids and a social light or you're a CEO guy and you're not getting um what you want then like schedule one of our style assessments where we'll go
(24:18) through personally your skin tone your hair color your eye color and find the things that will immediately make you look better just within your existing closet cuz that's like again they don't have to do anything and they'll immediately look better that's like immediate value not a lot of work okay so i' be like okay that's what we're going to offer so now I can get more people to apply now they're going to fill out their stuff and again if they're not qualified it's like well you didn't read the headlines so don't worry about it and then for them I would probably just send them some free things so they feel you know they still gave
(24:41) them something but that would be the thing that I would do to improve the funnel right off the bat without really even seeing the funnel is clear headline around what they're going to get sub headline is either an image of like almost like a before and after of style or some sort of image that shows you know white skin brown hair don't do this okay and then they're like oh shoot I do that and so just like a simple thing that they're like shoot I do that and then they're like oh my God I need help and so all we're doing is increasing deprivation so that they they take the next action okay so that would be the lead magnet component that I would do
(25:11) for these paid ads now I think that you have the scheduler so they they apply then they schedule I know you're going to put the video together yeah there's the video before the call that gets them to book and then I would probably consider sending them a second video between booking and showing okay and then that does a little a little bit of the pre-sale for you and I think about this in terms of like what are those things that you repeat on a regular basis on the call so there's usually like in every call there's kind of like a little bit of a sales pitch that occurs where you're like okay so let me
(25:39) tell you about what we do I just try to put as much of that before the call okay so that I can spend the the majority of the call on the person the decision-making process rather than basically have this like pre-recorded script that I have to keep reading over and over because it tires out you ties out your sales team eventually and so I would just I that's how I would I would try to do it I think that if we can do the lead magnet we can capture more leads I think if we add the video to the to the landing page so it would look like this so we have our
(26:04) page there we go we've got a little video here and so then we have our little scheduler underneath now this Booker we should have our qualifications so we want to have like income right do you do you ask for income no I would ask for income or budget if you only knew two or three things about them to make them qualified what would you want to know are they open to it's a good one okay uh open a change yeah okay what about start date yeah that too okay the budget's really honestly the biggest thing okay well then I would
(26:40) definitely have that be prominently featured do you think it makes sense to put the pricing no on the no I don't think so I think that if we ask for qualifications and we describe the services um that'll give us 80% and then basically you just want to find cuz the thing is is like you don't want to just squ because there's some people who will be in who have a smaller income but really want this yeah and so it's finding kind of that sweet spot which is like if someone then says like I want to start immediately I'm super open and
(27:05) their budget's like medium then you probably take the call right if they're like my budget's zero then like okay well it doesn't matter how muchad you want it it's not going to work right so two important points here one is that when you give a very valuable lead magnet away you don't have to give it away to everyone and so we want to make our lead magnet super valuable but only give them to qualified customers and so that's what makes it kind of like a honey trap for the right type of people number two is that what I'm going through is baned which is budget
(27:29) Authority need timing and so that's what most people need in order to be qualified to then you know get closed and so asking those things kind of in the friction process helps push out the bad traffic and help us judge and score the leads that are coming in so that we can see which of these have the highest leg of closing and then prioritize low leads to sell and so I think that on your qualification question which you'll have on your scheduler we just asked for the fewest amount of questions that are required for us to make the decision
(27:52) whether or not they should stay or not okay all right so now we just have to figure out and this is where like the headline is like free you know look better you know dress for your just obviously you know your uh your your tone whatever and so this is something that you will just test more than anything else and it'll be relevant to whatever your little freebie that you're going to give them okay and I like I really like the like existing clothes so like how to best use your existing closet I think is a really strong angle because now they're going to come in and then you're going to be
(28:31) like oh you don't have one of these oh you don't have one of these ah like and then it's like and then it's then you're like you're in the sale right so this is probably what I would do for the Lander and I think that if we did that that'll give us more throughput that'll give more leads in terms of followup you currently don't really have followup other than like manual hey checking in kind of thing MH so if we want to have the 2011 version of this we can take this scheduler and put it here which is
(28:55) like the thank you page and then just make this an opt-in where we just ask for this and then if they're qualified they go here and if they're unqualified they go like free thing you just give them a free thing that way you don't have to waste your time and they don't they don't fill up your calendar oh okay and that's like with something different than the than the either of these you're saying Yeah okay or you do an automated version of the same thing right right and so if we wanted to to make it seem a little bit more we could put skin so like it it'll feel personalized
(29:25) if you're like what's your skin cone what's your hair color what's your eye color that might be an easy thing that you could ask and people like oh okay this is personalized and so if they say they have no money then it goes to the here's what people who have brown hair and white skin and whatever and then they can just get that free thing and then if they are qualified and have the money it's like hey great all you got to do is you know book your appointment below and uh look forward to talking to
(29:44) you and then you just work the lead confirm the appointment just like you normally would but then the lead is not so much about okay so tell me about where you're at with your style it's I think you'll do that on the sales call okay but I thought that with this skin tone thing well we'll we'll deliver it on the sales call delivered on the sales call right I'm just trying to think how that would how do you how do you fit that into the script so the way I would think through this is that I'm going to have like 10 templates that I know that are
(30:09) color palettes that work for these 10 you know characteristic people and if I have asked their skin hair whatever up front then I know I'm going into the call which template I'm going to be using when I talk to them so it's like hey oh you're blah blah blah actually you know what I would describe you more as Olive than white and I think this might actually be a better thing for you cool okay and then you go into your normal sales process which obviously works I don't I don't even want to talk about sales SCH you're closing 50% okay
(30:34) right now it's like book a cost a sales call basically and that's like obvious what I'm speaking about but then this feels like oh just have a call about skin tone well this is sales yeah and then it it's not an issue because we're they're already qualified MH you're only taking the calls with people who have the income so you're going to take more calls you're also going to hear more nose but you're going to make more money like fundamentally I could I could just say like I could run an that just said
(30:59) hey I have this really expensive thing book here if you want it and this is the price and the people who h on those calls will be incredibly qualified but if I just said I have this really free amazing thing that'll help you with the first problem let me help you with that and then people are like oh but do you do any of ah you know what I do do that stuff it's so funny you ask and I get 10 times the calls and so if I close 30% of a 10x number I still close three times the deals okay does that make sense and
(31:24) so there's a little bit now part of it is because you're selling out of your own wallet in terms of time yeah and so it's because you're like I I have my time and I understand that but all we have to do is just tweak these things so like if you have somebody who you have the information about them you have the income and so what I try to do for these is band so budget this is kind of like the um Authority can you make the decision need how bad you want it which is your biggest problem and then timing when do you want to start if I were to accept you when when you get started and so you
(31:56) want somebody who says immediately I'm in high need I can make the decision and I have the money and so that's fundamentally what these are and if you want to add your personalization of like skin and hair and what You' know this better than me you know eyes upload your photo yeah oh really yeah that one's going to be a lot of friction so I would consider having that in the Fallout process okay because someone's like take their phone out they got uploaded pictures oh what because think about this there's a decision they have to make they're going be like what picture am I going to pick and then it's and then they're gone they're like in another world and they're in their phone
(32:25) and they're like oh yeah I forgot I have to call Sandra back and then it's like they're off I mean I can really just and train somebody to just do it live yeah I mean as many things as possible you can do like we want to decrease the friction here for qualified people right so there's good friction bad friction so good friction is something that increases the overall quality of the lead and gets out people who uh suck bad friction gets everyone out a slow page load time for example everyone leaves good people and bad people we want to
(32:52) get the type of friction that only bad people leave and good people stay okay and so if we have budget Authority need timing we have the specific spe ific things relative to the lead magnet then your followup if you want like hey if you can send me a picture it'd be great if not I can just go off of your Facebook profile or something like that then they show up to the call you have your one of 10 plates that you already figured out ahead of time that then sets up the sale which is for you it's like oh you don't have this this this and this all we're doing is expanding the gap of like you're here you want to be
(33:15) here oh you're missing all this stuff oh you know what so funny I think you'd be perfect fit for weh have can I tell you about it and then you're in got it makees sense yeah okay so this is what I would do to change the paid ads funnel can you spend more on this yeah well I'm like dude if you if I had a machine in front of me where you and this is without you doing any of this that's the crazy thing that's without you doing any of this right so if I said okay um instead of paying $3,400 uh a year what
(33:42) if we paid like $3,400 a month yeah well that would 12 x your business that'd be chill right yeah I mean it beats the S&P 500 where you put a dollar in and get $23 back within the next week it's not bad right a lot of business owners are scared to spend more money on marketing because they don't have the data to show what the return is if you have a machine in front of you where you put a dollar in and and it spits out $16 back in 30 days why would you have any kind of limit on that budget you'd put as many
(34:06) dollars in that machine as you possibly could right of course and so she has one of these machines and probably just in preparation for this show uh she got the LTV to CAC ready so she could see what a discrepancy there was and if you don't know what LTV toac is it's the lifetime value of the customer relative to the cost you acquiring them so basically how much money does it cost me to get a customer and then how much money do I get from that customer once I got them the cheaper it is to get a customer and then the moreone money they give you the greater the discrepancy between those
(34:30) two numbers the more money potential there is in the business and so this is fundamentally the economic Arbitrage that exists at the core of every business that then fuels all the growth of everything and here's the craziest part Ashley is getting $23 back for every $1 she puts into her machine and she's only spending $3,400 per year in this machine but that $3,400 times23 is generating $78,000 in income within a year like imagine investing in the S&P 500 put $3,400 in at the end of the year it's 78,000 you'd be like holy cow this is the most amazing investment in my life her business has that inside of it and
(35:04) she's like hey I don't want to put too much in I'm just G I'm pulling her chain but a lot of businesses have these huge treasure troves that are just sitting there and not being leveraged I I'm going to put an order of actions here so I'm going to tear this off because and we're going to save it and at the end we're going to order everything okay so the next thing um that I want to go over is the Affiliates cuz I think that's really important you would not touch Facebook ads well you already have an acquisition Channel that's working and
(35:27) super profitable so I'm less likely to want to do that now okay so um because you can spend more if you wanted to yeah yeah let spend more okay but we'll do that I'll do actually put that as a note for me so I'm going to put steps in here for you okay um all right let's talk about Affiliates so matchmakers yes okay so you have six matchmakers right now uh four matchmakers two private clubs okay so I'll go I mean whatever it doesn't matter yeah you're good okay so you got six Affiliates yeah you've got four four matchmakers and two private clubs okay
(36:01) got it so how much time did it take you to get each of these Affiliates not much time okay we did a cursory Google search of LA and found that there were multiple hundreds of the people who do this so in a magic world what would it take for us to go from 6 to 60 yeah I think not that long okay and each of these sends you people on on a consistent basis yeah what was the process that you did integrate with them I met with the owner and so you did Outreach to get them manual Outreach okay is it like phone calls text email DM email okay manual Outreach um
(36:41) explained that we can offer a complimentary service to their new clients oh cool and you know that we we could close them love this almost like it's directly out of the affiliate section in the book wherever it is here it is kly gutter sits in there all right anyways keep going and that's and that's and then they would and what percentage do you close to the people that you talk to um that's been the hard part is like talking getting them okay do you know how many Outreach attempts you did to get to the six um probably about
(37:19) 40 okay and I I want to I want to paint something for cuz I think it's going to be interesting okay it's not often that you find you know a single point of Leverage in a business that's as clearcut as this one is for Ashley when I do find them I get very excited about it because it's like these are the things that can change people's lives right it can change the income they can have the the the neighborhood they live in the schools their their kids go to and just completely can change a family tree for generations and so when I find these types of opportunities I just like I I light up because I'm so excited about it because I know what what's
(37:49) going to happen I know what's going to happen later once this lever gets really pulled when she said that she'd only emailed 40 people to generate a third of her Revenue I'm like 40 emails because I have a context of what kind of response rates cold email gets and it's certainly not you closing 15% of cold outbound normally if you get 1% or half a percent you're thrilled and so she's at like 10 times the efficiency 15 times the efficiency of what normal outbound does and so as soon as I saw that I was like this is it so you sent 40 emails and you were able to close Six right yeah okay
(38:22) now how much money do those six so it's a third of your Revenue right so it's $100,000 a year roughly okay so think about this so every one of these emails need you $2,500 yeah that feels like pretty good return yeah for sending emails probably copy and paste right h two more of them what I have I have a wild idea what if we sent 400 emails yeah that's it yeah if Ashley just goes from six to 60 Affiliates and they're currently a third then that would be a 10x of something that's 1/3 so that alone would more than triple her business and here's the crazy part what's the cost of
(39:23) sending 400 emails it's even less than the paid ads so her LTV a c on this particular channel is even better than her paid ad Channel which is already insane I don't even want to mess with the affiliate process that you have right now yeah you're reaching out manually is obviously effective you sent out 40 emails like if you did that for 4 hours every day right that I mean you'd probably be able to send even if you did them completely personalized completely manual the way that you probably did you don't have to buy any software like you
(39:49) can just send the emails you'd be able to do that in like a week or two weeks if you want to spread it out it's like not a lot you know we'll give you we'll give you we'll give you the weekends off so we'll go so it's 40 emails a day 40 emails a day I'll give it to you in a month how about that so we'll do 20 emails a day 20 emails a day that feels like that's that feels reasonable yeah okay cool let's do that best place to like pull the data good question cuz I think it's the matchmakers but it's also could be executive coaches M could be um high-end
(40:21) fitness trainers people going through a transformation weight loss weight y they need they need yeah for sure I would think about about I think you have them these in segments right and so you've got high-end trainers high-end pts number one you've got exact coach right mhm you've got the dating people right yep you've got I'll give you one divorce [Music] attorneys so that's four lists these ones you can find probably from Google this you can find also from search and Instagram there's also like list Brokers
(40:57) so you just like Google list broker whatever City and then you can usually they'll have this massive National list and then you can W it it down to a a localized area can you do any remote Services yeah yeah we definitely I'd say 50% up like especially during covid we only work virtually but I I prefer you prefer in person that's fine that's cool I like doing this stuff in person because there's there's so much more richness to the interaction I can see someone's re I can see I can see minor expression changes and I can gauge how my you know recommendations like are
(41:27) they confused by what I said or like are they I can I can sense if they're like not they don't want to push back cuz they're like they don't want to insult me or something like that I can see if they like they don't really believe it it's like okay I need to dive in here more and make sure that like I can break any belief that's here or maybe explain something a little bit differently I don't think I get as much of that online or in like a zoom setting and honestly I just like I mean I love business and I think that when I have like kind of the talking head videos which there's plenty of on this channel I am a little bit
(41:50) more intense in those settings because I'm when I talk to a camera and there's no one else there I'm basically talking to myself and I talk to myself a little bit more rough than I would talk to somebody else and so I think in this setting you can see that like I don't like I'm Pro entrepreneur you know what I mean like it doesn't matter whether you're making $100,000 a year or you're making $100 million a year like you're in the game and for that you're eternally somebody that I you have my respect okay um so this obviously makes
(42:16) money and doesn't require any Financial Risk yeah and is also a compounding way of acquiring customers because you did this work think about this you sent 40 emails one time and then you got six people to send you business for good not bad now what do you do to continue to reactivate them host events okay so you do so you do events okay so for the Affiliates yep okay cool um I mean like especially for like the matchmakers they're happy because their clients are getting made over they get better pictures therefore they get better matches so I love that yeah really good
(42:53) so I think uh do you do that like regularly like it's on a calendar or is just like okay good cuz that's obviously that's why part of why it's working so normally one of the things that that falls off with Affiliates is that they don't stay activated they don't keep referring you and so you have to like work them like customers like it's another set of relationships but if you can put them all together an event on a regular Cadence where like all of the dating coaches bring all of their people and they all look good and they all get to meet each other like that's value for everybody it hasn't quite turned out
(43:17) like that but just like more oneoff okay like hosting events with the individual company okay well still that works yeah yeah and I think if you do like one or two of those a year or three a year I think that's like more than enough to keep the activated and I would I would try and figure out a way to put them in the same room just because I think you'd be like I would be pitching on collaboration rather than competition which is just like hey you have single people so do they maybe they that's true
(43:43) actually yeah they're all single yeah they're all single and obviously looking to mingle and trying to look at their best life like um it would also be desperation City but anyways uh so that's so that's the affiliate piece okay I I feel I feel really good about that okay and so in terms of list I would go list brokers s social media and Google first that' be like my first thing and then I would look at list Brokers once I ran out of those but between like these four sources you need to send 400 emails it's
(44:07) not that bad and then what's crazy is like if you send it and then they don't respond you could send it again okay next one's continuity so let's talk about that okay so this is about increasing LTV right so you already have pretty good LTV but I have this feeling like there's something that we can do better okay so right now now LTV is $10,000 right yeah okay so walk me through so someone comes in so I come in I'm CEO $88,500 I pay you for my whole lookbook Etc transformation y okay and so the delivery of that transformation is like a lookbook primarily and then
(44:46) like yeah walk me through it a little more no so uh this assessment figureing out where we're going to go with your style your look then going through your current closet right getting rid of all the old stuff actually go to their house yes okay get rid of all the old stuff reorganize the closet so that it makes it works for their life okay so closet tear down yep and then we document we do an inventory of everything in their closet so that way when they text us or they say hey I'm going to Turk St Kos hey great pull this pull this pull this uhhuh and we can give it to their um
(45:18) housekeeper or whatever here's your packing list okay then we get new outfits new clothes right now our promise is about 5 to 10 new outfits okay we don't want to get the whole new wardrobe right but you know enough to like okay I'm excited I feel good mhm and then that's when we make the determination okay does this make sense given your lifestyle you travel all the time on a monthly level or accordly level yeah in terms of the continuity you mean well do you have turn on the continuity do a lot of people so people stay and they keep paying if it's in front of these people
(45:52) not the one time people these people they don't what was the one time thing so it was priced at 3500 uhhuh and you just did this but then didn't have anything else yeah okay and it was um it could be all virtually oh okay got it or it could just be like a one day shopping way better to do in person it's a different relationship yeah yeah no I like that I'm I'm I'm a fan okay so and then the ongoing price point is what on the back end uh 2K per month per month or 4500 so LT so $88,500 and then $22,000 per month so so we should be at
(46:24) now I'm guessing that you have a lot of grandfathered people of those 40 customers that are paying less yeah okay what are they paying um 1,500 monthly yep week or per month month okayo was like wow okay uh and then uh some are on like 1500 quarterly okay got it got it I'm guessing the majority of them are, 1500 quarter yeah okay got it because then it's 500 bucks a month because this just all transitioned in September we only have like two people currently on the new system okay so most people are at $1,500 so if you have call 38 customers
(46:58) who are at I'm just going to say in general right $500 per month because it's 1,500 per quarter I'm just looking at Revenue yeah okay because this now makes sense with the revenue that you're doing okay cool so the vast majority of the money is actually in a recurring Revenue base MH that's not bad that's good yeah that's really good and the turn's low so all that stuff's good okay so I actually don't really want to mess with this that much because you have a low turn what's the percentage of people go from here to here now that I've just
(47:24) said hey we're only working with you on a reoccurring basis it's it's good right um the thing is I'm almost wondering if I did you say that yeah good I'm almost wondering if we kill this and just do the quarterly because this seems to be not most people okay do you think that it's better to simplify things or just still keep it no I think you can have it what happens it serves as a price anchor okay so even if only 10% of people take it it increases the people who take that one okay so I don't think it's actually a mistake that it's there okay cuz if you're like cuz they had the reaction I did I'm like $6,000 a quar I'm like
(47:56) Jesus like or just do $1,500 like oh no that works I'll do the $1,500 no no no it's 2K a month or 4500 a quarter uh with this one yes okay so you're saying at the at the new price point yes it's at this okay but this is brand new and here you have all the retention that you have so I dove into her continuity because there's oftentimes a lot of opportunity here in terms of billing Cycles in terms of pricing in terms of Ascension process to get more people to go from front end to back end most of her stuff here was working and I'm trying to be mindful of the fact that she's she's a very small business and
(48:31) she has limited resources limited time limited capital and so I want to be really selective about the things that I recommend that she do and in what order so that we select the things that have the highest likelihood of working that have the lowest you know initial cost in time and effort to make uh happen even though I probably saw some opportunities here that I think we could exploit later for now I was like this is good enough to scale we'll deal with it later once we achieve more volume and then we'll have more data that can make that can inform our decisions even better and most importantly we'll have the
(49:01) resources in the cash flow to be able to enact those changes without overwhelming Ashley yeah yeah okay but you haven't had any issue with sending people into that into the $4,500 a quarter either I mean the few that we've had no but it's the same take rate yeah okay yeah so I'm fine with quarterly billing okay so if you have monthly and quarterly that's fine okay I'm good with that yeah so it's if it's now um 2K more SL 4500 per quarter um but even if like 90% op into this versus this oh that's fine totally
(49:29) fine totally fine that's great no big deal yeah all that I mean honestly we'll just like I feel comfortable with that but I always let the market tell me so like I just keep edging up the price until people stop saying yes and then I'm like okay that's about right and then and you kind of back down a little bit and you're like that's my price now I know that this for these for these types of people that's the number that they're willing to pay unless we change the Avatar the marketing or the messaging that's going to attract these people and they're willing to say us at that price okay okay so from a
(49:55) continuity perspective I don't think we Chang that cuz I think we just changed it so that stays the way it is I think the $8,500 I know LTV is $1,000 but $8500 for the tail down and then you have the quarterly and so this LTV that you have here is probably going to go up it'll just keep going up over time right okay great so I mean honestly the so the good news is the actual business is strong okay so you have goodish margins uh 42% continuity has almost no turn that's great LTV CAC strong and so the
(50:23) real leverage with this business is that we just need to do more all right so this is this is going to be the priorities in terms of how we're going to do this all right now you stopped spending money on ads why cuz we were adding the video and we were adding in the you're fixing that stuff first and then Okay cool so this is what we're going to do so video sales letter plus lead magnet so plus the B qualification so budget Authority need timing budget Authority need timing plus skin tone color analysis personalization yeah yeah
(51:16) Okay cool so that's number one so once we fix that that's a that's a conversion mechanism so then what I want you to do is increase your ad spend and So currently you're spending 600 was it $300 a month so why don't we just go to 600 how much actually let me ask a question how many can you handle like how many more leads could you handle than you currently are more like how many more like that convert into new clients yeah well like how many calls basically it's a call thing so how many calls can you take to turn customers you're currently taking 12 right
(51:48) something like that yeah easily could double or triple that okay so let's go with uh 600 to 900 per month cuz sometimes the lead cost might go up a little bit that's okay just like so basically you might get a little bit less efficient but that's fine cuz you're still you have really strong TVD C so it's not a big deal all right number three is we need to send the 20 emails per day to Affiliates plus one event per quarter to keep them activated plus four affiliate types that we went over all right so this is a big three so the reason that I put it in this order is that uh she was
(52:34) already working on the video sales letter and so it didn't need like I wasn't really going to change anything she was already doing so I was basically like go put this in place and just add the lead magnin which is really just like you know you put a PDF together it's an afternoon and you change the headline on page it's not a huge lift there increasing the ad spend is literally clicking a button so the first two things required basically no effort maybe a half day of work maybe one day total that could in of themselves double
(52:58) triple the business then I was like okay the next big lever which is the affiliate play is to then let's 10x the Affiliates that we have using the tried and true Channel you already are doing and just do way more of it but that requires work and focus and effort she has to Google the people she has to find them then she has to reach out and she has to personalize those responses and so that's going to take more time and so I wanted to just knock out quick wins that she could just do with a click of a button in a day before getting to the kind of like the more mey things that might take a few weeks and then I don't
(53:24) want to mess with the continuity so those are those are the like so if we're looking at like how much could this do it's like okay here we have a 2 to 3x here actually I'm me to do this because Michael will ask me to do this so we've got a 2 to 3x here that we have from this guy yeah I think this if I knew what the conversion rate was on your page so if you sold can you go back to the um yeah okay so here so we got eight sales this year so it's like one like a little bit less than one a month right so so I just wish
(53:58) I knew how many leads were coming from Google I just really wish I knew that number and those eight sales were those just like phone calls en closes so 16 calls created eight sales kind of thing yeah okay so and they weren't from the ads they were from search got it but then they clicked on your ad you got I don't even know if they clicked on the ad okay so we're also going to do this before we put in the ad spend so 1.5 so this is 1.
(54:28) 5 we need to get attribution tracking okay because we have to know like the first step of running ads is know what happens otherwise you're just spending money in the dark so obviously I think you're you're getting a return by accident rather than on purpose okay and so let's get the attribution tracking in place so this is going to go we'll use blue this will go up here all right so you'll fix the funnel yeah you get the attribution tracking in place I think the funnel lift could very well like this this this is going to sound wild this could somewhere they R of like 2 to 5x the lead flow you
(55:07) have just doing this especially with a good lead magnet okay now the next piece is that each of your Affiliates were a third of your revenue and if we were to 10x that then we would 10x 1/3 which would be a triple if we did this and so the result of a called a 2X to 2X and a 3X would be a 12x which would take us from 300K per year to 3.
(55:37) 6 million great we on our way excited yes boom thank you now you bet you're going to crush it so Ashley was amazing I'm super stoked to see how this pans out for her in the next 6 to 12 months and you know see how her numbers uh go I'm very bullish on it I think she's great if you like this type of content of actually diving into real business owners real stories I personally loved making this I prefer making this type of content but if you guys like this tile please let me know I'll probably end up just making more anyways cuz I really like it but either way let me know and
(56:05) then it'll make me feel better about making more of it for you

HOW TO GET WHAT YOU WANT (6 Proven Methods) - YouTube
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PCCqqv2pig

Transcript:
(00:00) you can get anything you want in life if you can get other people to get it for you which makes persuasion among the highest leveraged skills in the world tons of research has been done on how to become more persuasive and I have to give my nod to Robert Kiel do you need to go who made most research accessible to the masses in his book influence what I want to do is show you the most effective ways I applied his methods in my own business that now do over 200 million dollars a year in combined revenue tool number one is reciprocity I
(00:24) try to get in contact with Arnold Schwarzenegger when I was running gymwatch I thought it would make a lot of sense I wanted him to endorse my book that was like my whole goal turns out nothing worked it also turns out Arnold doesn't really care but in order to get his attention what Layla and I did was he donated a million dollars to his charity and then we ended up sitting down with Arnold multiple times when you show kindness and generosity towards others they're more likely to return the favor and like you as a result the gift
(00:47) you have to do is proportional to the person you're trying to give to so for example if you pay for your friend's lunch that person now feels obligated to return the favor they're like hey I'll get the next one right and it's the same reason that outside of a retail store as soon as you you come in they offer you cold water it's not because they're nice people it's because they know that you'll feel indebted to them and be more likely to a stay longer be listening to them and see ultimately buy imagine how much it costs a store owner to give
(01:10) everybody who walks in the door a water I don't know five dollars a day and if they get one person to buy extra a week off of that which they probably get a lot more is that worth the investment it's probably the highest return on investment thing in his entire business now keyaldine gives a really beautiful example of how to leverage this in business he shows an example for a waiter so if a waiter puts a mint on the bill they get three percent more tips right people get something and they're more likely to tip them a little bit
(01:36) more the waiter gives the person two minutes all of a sudden the tips increase by 14 and the third way they did the waiter example was that the person put a mint down walked away turn around and put another mint on the table and that created a 23 increase in tips it's worth paying five dollars a month for a big bag of mints just to make sure you get paid but the thing is is that in business there are tons of these five dollar mint bags that are laying around you can immediately implemented your own business years ago I actually had this
(02:03) done to me and I saw the effect and it was wild all right so there was this guy that I thought was a complete weirdo whenever I saw him he would try and ask me like 100 questions so he was local to where I was he was in like some entrepreneur networks and he would just like try and Corner me and I was like dude just get away from me eventually I had to confront and be like stop talking to me like go away and so what happened is he was so ashamed of the whole experience whatever he started sending me gifts every single month so I'm
(02:25) talking about like 500 000 gifts every month like Cutco knives and like clothing which is kind of weird but it was expensively lemon stuff anyways for nine months you see so many birthday cakes that were custom made and ice cream like was wild after a while I just started feeling bad because he just kept sending them and saying like so sorry I hope everything's awesome blah blah blah and I was like you know what maybe I just saw him the wrong way and I was just like got him off on the wrong foot even though I knew what he was doing it
(02:49) still worked and I ended up going out to meet him again turns out still a weirdo and so that's to show you how powerful this stuff is you can just start by giving people free gum when you're in class which is the first time I learned it when I was in Middle School porn is mean to me when I gave them gum earlier that day and so this tiny little thing that cost me almost nothing that made my life in middle school a little bit easier tool number two is consistency we judge people based on their actions all right consistency can be used in
(03:10) Persuasion by asking someone to publicly commit to an idea or action a public key can be just in front of you but it can also be widely to the world if I said hey are you the type of person who like takes action and is willing to invest in themselves if someone says yes then later on if I say hey since you're the type of person who's really willing to take action and really likes to invest in themselves and I think this would be perfect for you boom and then I can make the ass because I just reminded them twice of the commitments they made
(03:33) earlier and I'm asking them to be consistent with those later during the close so there's a famous research study they did where they asked people in a neighborhood to put up a little sign that said please Drive slowly when they ask people to put a massive sign on their front yard that said please Drive slowly most people didn't comply with that request but when they asked people to put a tiny little sign in their window the size of a note card that said please Drive slowly and then two weeks later they sent them a letter that said
(03:56) hey since you're a type of person who's so pro-safety for the neighborhood but would you be willing to put a much bigger sign to save more lives guess what way more people said yes after saying the first yes because they voluntarily identified as a certain type of person and the researchers got them to remain consistent with the commitment that they had made and so if you want to get the big yes sometimes you get the small yes first this is why lead magnets and front-end offers tend to work well to get people to ultimately buy a much
(04:23) bigger thing later tool number three is social proof people look to other people for cues about how to behave or what to believe and this is how we learn to be human right when we're little kids we just look at other people we say oh do what they do because that's what humans do and then you start to become a human if you see something on Amazon it has five thousand five star reviews you're way more likely to buy it Amazon does this stuff because it knows it gets people to take action and so if you've ever heard a laugh track on a show where
(04:45) it's like hahaha in the background people then laugh more than if there is no laugh track which is wild we are so conditioned to behave in accordance with how everyone else does that that laugh track persuades US gets us to do something they want us to do which is LA F better than anything else and so here's how I use it in my own businesses I printed out every single five star review I got online if you have a brick and mortar location this is where it kills is that you look at all your Yelp reviews and you screenshot every single
(05:12) one of them so I screenshotted all of them and I framed every one of them so that floor to ceiling my Lobby was five star reviews and then the other half was before and after pictures because imagine a world where someone says like hey Alex I don't think you can help me lose weight and I would just like look around the room be like really and then I would say how much proof would you need to believe and at what point is your requirement for proof more and reasonable than the amount of proof I have and that crushes their belief of
(05:37) whether or not they could do it or at least that I was good enough to do it tool number four liking or what people would like to call Rapport people like people who like them or they perceive as friends and the more you like someone the more likely they are to say yes to you and so the liking principle states that people are more likely to be persuaded by those that they like and want to be like and that's the second part is important and they even did a research study to test this they told people that they paid strangers to
(05:58) compliment them they then got complimented by a stranger who they knew were getting paid to compliment them and guess what they still like them more than strangers they didn't and so even if you know what someone's doing it still works and they also found out that there's actually no cap to how much flattery someone will take provided it's genuine and here's how I try to use this in Persuasion so I always use the ACA framework acknowledge what they say compliment what they did about what they said and then ask another question you
(06:25) can get basically anybody to like you in a sales conversation or an associate situation acknowledge what they just said because it shows that you're listening and paying attention to them because the thing that people like more than anything that they pay people hundreds of dollars an hour to is just to listen to them talk C you compliment them on what they just said and how it ties to them being a great person in some positive attribute and then you ask them the next question to move them down the conversation and so the way that I
(06:46) actually was able to keep my spirits High because if you are ever front facing in a role whether it's customer service or at sales or anything you get tired and so what I did was that I actually bought a mini trampoline and I put it next to my desk and so I would meet with people and I I was doing 20 plus consults a day in person and I would be bouncing on this trampoline and they would look at me like a psychopath people would close more because like this guy's such a goof you cannot be in a bad mood and on a trampoline and when
(07:08) I didn't have the trampoline before that I actually used to do a cartwheel every single time before I shook someone's hand when they walk in my gym so imagine you walk in the gym some guy to the car wheel and it's like hey welcome to United Fitness nice to meet you my name is Alex you would crack up be like who is this guy but you know what you did after that you give me money because you liked me automatically even if someone was a sourpuss I could still turn the mood around because what they ultimately wanted to buy was the feeling that I was
(07:28) giving them during the conversation persuasion tool number five is Authority think about a man who can tell the president of the United States to drop his trousers and stick his finger up his ass well Proctologist can do that whenever they want because they're a doctor and in the doctor's office they are the authority if Warren Buffett gives you investment advice you can move on it faster because you just trust that he's right even if his advice is the same as a high school teacher the reason it's so powerful is not because what an
(07:54) authority says is actually more persuasive in terms of the actual words they say but because people put up fewer filters and accept more things as truth which means it has more persuasive ability independent of the message as soon as you find a trusted Source what do you do you just listen to it right which is why mentors are so valuable because it actually decreases our speed to decision making and getting action done which is why we seek out mentors to begin with which is maybe why you watch stuff on YouTube what do you have to do
(08:16) to do this you show diplomas credentials Awards Etc and your track record which is if you followed my Channel at all all I talk about is building your life resume and having a track record to stand on rather than puffing your chest and having lots of Charisma instead just saying you can believe me because of what I've done not what I'm telling you I'm going to do but on top of that if you want to add third party accreditation I printed out certifications for myself and every one of my trainers because people would come
(08:38) and be like well are your trainer certified I would say like one which ones do you want they would never have any idea and two I would say all of my trainers are double or triple certified mind you certifications are not accredited in the United States meaning I could have 10 certifications that I certified them myself no one knows I did pay for my trainers to get certified through actual ones but I also internally certified them so they had more Authority persuasive tool number six scarcity and urgency urgency
(09:03) is a function of time so promotion ends tomorrow scarcity is a function of units I only have a hundred of them left people value what is scarce the reason gold is inherently valuable versus a rock is that there's just less of it the reason De Beers has become this diamond conglomerate even though rubies and sapphires are actually rarer than diamonds is they own all the diamonds they keep them in vaults just so that they can keep the scarcity high enough on the diamonds they fesh a premium price and so the way that you implement
(09:27) this in Persuasion is that you use limits limited time limit Supply one time offers to create the perception of scarcity the other way to doing is talking lost language so instead of like don't you want to get it's you don't want to miss out on different way of framing the same concept people have more loss aversion than they have desire to gain so if you've seen Chanel or Gucci or Prada or whatever they actually don't tell the stories how much of any item they'll send they'll have a new spring line and they'll send one or two
(09:53) or three purses and they won't tell the store how many they're going to send in a real way the sales people have the same concept of urgency they probably figured it out at corporate that even if they said hey say that we don't have that many purses the sales people like actually we got more in the back and so they just actually control the whole thing centrally they only send them and they're like I don't know when I'm gonna get the next one in or if I'm going to get another one in at all but then they took it even further and during covet if
(10:14) you saw it there were lines out the door because there's like one person and one person out you know what stores kept that while everyone else Let It Go the fancy stores because they want to hold a scarce resource they want to show that there's tons of demand that's a little bit of social proof you have to be special it's exclusive in order to get in the key to doing this is not being fake I don't know how to say this to you differently besides trust me if you actually put true scarcity on something you will sell more so if you can handle
(10:39) 20 people a week in your business or you have X amount of product tell people your limits the reason Amazon still says 23 left in stock is because they know that more people will buy it if they see that there's limits so if I said hey I continue a thousand customers smart you probably couldn't take them so just be explicit about how many you have left and you'll actually sell more

Transcript:
(00:00) so i was at a mastermind with seven other entrepreneurs and the total room cumulatively was doing over 500 million dollars a year in revenue and uh so this was kind of a cool meetup of very high level entrepreneurs and you know everybody kind of went up there and and shared the things that they were doing well and uh you know between things we're eating and having a good time and uh what was interesting to me is that in the entrepreneurial world so many entrepreneurs have all these weird shticks about like their food and
(00:35) their exercise and their hydration and their what you know orange glasses they wear and their finger toe shoes and their bio hacking and just all this weirdness but i actually came from the fitness world and uh all that stuff is complete make believe and so um it's really good for selling people stuff but it's complete a complete farce so anyways i uh the whole time these guys are sitting there and uh they're like oh no i only eat keto and they're so i only do intermittent fasting right and uh and i'm sitting there listening
(01:06) to them i'm like eating twizzlers and cookies and ice cream and they're like what the you know like what are you doing right and by the second day they see that i literally continue to eat this way like an um and they're like what are you what are you doing man like how does this work and so between all the stuff that we talked about business-wise um while it was lunchtime i was like all right this is uh this is kind of how i've been eating for 17 years and i was in better shape than all the guys there and believe it or not
(01:37) a bunch of those guys ended up telling me months later that they had all gotten in shape based on the presentation that i gave them which is a different way of eating and so um i've been doing this for almost 20 years i've been in shape that entire time i have not not had a six-pack since i was 13 or 14.
(01:58) um and i eat ice cream every day yep every day um and i drink alcohol and i eat cookies and i do all the things um that people want to do all right and so what i'm going to take you through is a very special little thing that i put together um which is actually an adaptation of what i presented to these guys um at this little meetup all right so uh buckle up and i think that you will enjoy this the first thing that everybody has to understand is what body type you are and what body type you'd like to become right and so i kind of put this on a
(02:30) little matrix of high fat low fat low muscle high muscle so you could be you know uh high fat low muscle and you would have a very feminine figure right you could have low muscle low fat and be skin and bones you could be high fat high muscle and just be big you could be low fat and high muscle which is what a bodybuilder is and you know there's various pieces along this curve right once you figure out where you are let's say you're skinny right and you want to get uh big right then you would have a line that you could pretty much draw
(03:02) directionally to the place that you want to go so if you're going up that way that means you need to uh increase your number of calories and you need to increase your volume those are the two things that you need to do because if you're going in this direction then this these are the two directional arrows this guy and this guy that you would need to adhere to right so you basically plot the same uh hot increase calories decrease calories decrease volume increase volume along the same plot line that you had high fat
(03:31) low fat high muscle low muscle all right don't get too sp caught up in this i just like to have visuals because that's how how i think if you know where you are and you know where you want to go then you can know what you need to do to get there you increase your calories and increase your volume and there you go here's the thing that got them all tripped up and then i said hey guys do you guys want to know why all your diets are the same and they were like uh what i was like yeah crazy i know and so right now
(03:56) not including alcohol there's three main macronutrients right you got protein carbs and fat if you're eating a normal balanced meal that's what something like this would look like right uh you have kind of an even distribution of protein carbs and fat in your meal now what happens is whenever you do a diet right so let's say you do keto all right well if you're doing keto all you're doing is you're going to be removing this orange thing and having just you basically eliminate your carbs and so you eat one third fewer calories makes sense
(04:26) if you have a low-fat diet you're eliminating your fat which is this yellow guy right and again you're eating one-third fewer calories if you did a portion control diet you would eat equal amounts of the same three things but just less of them overall and so you would you guessed it eat fewer calories and if you did intermittent fasting you would go from eating three meals a day to eating two meals a day and guess what you would be eating fewer calories sorry about the camera being crazy anyway so this is the thing that's happening right
(04:57) now right is that you're eliminating calories that is what is going on in every diet that you possibly do all right and so all these guys get all like oh no i do really well with low carb i do really well with high fat you know high low whatever it doesn't matter like it's all horseshit it's just calories it's all that matters okay and so um this was driving me nuts which is why i started making this little put together for you guys but this is why every other diet is the same right and here's the here's the fun
(05:24) one for you if you struggled and you had a diet that didn't work for you here's why let's say you did keto if you did keto the wrong the right way it would look like this right you would cut out your carbs right and then that calorie amount is eliminated from your diet and then over time you lose weight right now this is what a lot of people who said ah keto didn't work for me it's like because you started drinking butter right you started eating rib eyes for breakfast every day well no there's a lot more calories that you took in so
(05:53) the amount that you cut out did not compensate for the amount of excess protein and fat that you added into your diet that ended up actually netting you more calories than you would need right and that's why it didn't work for you that is why these diets don't work so what i will tell you now is what actually has to happen in order for it to work uh in reality okay so these are the only three things that 99 of people need to know in order to figure out what they want to uh how they wanna eat how they wanna look you just
(06:20) gotta know one how many calories you need to eat two how many grams of protein you need and three how much volume you need to do i'm not gonna talk about number three today i'm just gonna talk about one and two because that's what 99 you need to even think about anyways here's the simplest way to figure out number one now there's a million there's a million uh little formulas that you can use here the basic one is your body weight times your goal very simple so if you're a 200 pound guy right and you wanted to
(06:44) maintain then you'll probably be eating between 2 600 and 3 000 calories so 200 to do times 15 would be cool 3 000 calories right that's if you wanted to maintain on the high side right now let's say you wanted to lose weight unless you wanted to go a little bit more extreme then it would be 200 times 10 which would be 2 000 calories very simple all right there's a million different ways to try and calculate this and none of them matter because controlling what you ingest is easy understanding how much you expel in
(07:13) calories is very hard and so it doesn't matter anyways the thing is is step one is you determine how many calories you're supposed to eat based on your goal and the thing is is if you started this and you're like man i wanted to lose weight and you're not losing weight at a rate that you would find fast enough you can always just decrease it it's not that hard right very straightforward so you multiply your body weight by the the number here so you can see here it's from 7 all the way up to 21. if you wanted to have extreme
(07:39) weight gain it'd be your body weight times you know a high up number over here if you wanted to have extreme weight loss it'd be a low number over here and that's it right if you ever everything in between so i said if you wanted to have pretty fast weight loss then you'd be your body weight times 10 right very simple now that we've done that we go to step two you got to figure out how much protein to eat and this is the part that everyone gets kind of trippy on right because i'm showing you the whole point of this and put this
(08:04) together for you and then you can have all the ice cream and all the cookies and all the alcohol you ever dreamed of and still have a six pack all right forever for good because it's my belief that if you're if you're going to do this right if you're going to play the game you have to do it in a way that you'd be able to do it forever right if i can't do something for the rest of my life then i don't see a point in doing it who cares about being in shape for eight weeks right when i want to be in shape for the rest of my life right no
(08:26) one's going to remember you for being in shape that that time period they're going to be like oh yeah you always struggled with his weight and he was always trying new crazy things wouldn't it be nice to just solve it for good protein uh which is the second number here your body weight times 1 in grams is about what you need to have for protein per day very simple all right so for 200 pounds then you need 200 grams of protein now here's where it's kind of cool you're like well and here's the biggest life hack and possibly give you
(08:51) 100 grams of protein is equivalent to one pound of lean meat all right so if you need to have 200 grams that would be two pounds of lean meat and so for me the world's simplest you know diet of all time and by diet it's like this is just how i live he said i eat two pounds of meat a day all right and be like that's crazy it's not really you get used to it right and uh you just stop eating the crap that you probably eat right now so two pounds of meat can be two pounds of shrimp it could be two pounds of uh tilapia could
(09:22) be two pounds up it doesn't have to be the same thing you could have a quarter pound of four different things you know excuse me a half pound of four different things uh you could have a tenderloin you know you could have a skirt stick you have flank steak like those are very lean steaks uh actually not squishy sorry flank sticks lean you could have top round you could have uh top sirloin like those are all very lean steaks all of these are just very lean proteins uh chicken breasts right there's a million of these but the point is is that a lean
(09:47) meat is a lean meat and they're all about the same in terms of grams if you needed to have 200 grams of protein then you'd have two pounds of lean meat and that's what you would eat for the day all right wait don't worry you're like what about the cookies and ice cream i'm gonna get there now we have to figure out if we know how many calories we're eating per day and we know uh how much protein we're eating then we need to figure out what's left over so here's how you put it all together one is we calculated our
(10:12) calories for our goal so if we said we wanted to lose weight we were 200 pounds and we did 11 sure because we want to do moderate weight loss we would eat 2 200 calories a day awesome second step here we calculate protein for our body weight so if we were 200 200 pounds we'd have 200 grams of protein great which is gonna be two pounds of lean meat simple step three we're going to calculate our calories from our protein all right so roughly roughly if you want to be all sciency four four calories per gram is how many actual
(10:46) calories are in a gram of protein but when you eat a source of protein like a chicken breast there's also some fat in it right even when it's super lean there's still some fat and so what we do what i do my back of napkins secret super method is you just multiply it by five all right the reason i do that is so that i can account for a little bit of fat that's gonna be carried along with it so if i'm gonna have my 200 grams of protein times five it means i'm going to eat about a thousand calories they're going to come
(11:14) from my protein sources all right great so now what i'm going to do is i'm going to take my step 4 my 2200 calories subtract my thousand calories of protein and i've got 1200 calories of whatever the hell i want every day here's the secret to having the body you want for the rest of your life eating cookies every day and making every entrepreneur that you go to the masterminds with feel like a because you have a six-pack and you're eating ice cream and cookies and twizzlers and all the things that you want in this world while they are
(11:42) telling you about why they're biohacking right and why they're burning so much fat right now except they look the same every year here's the key you eat the 1200 calories of whatever the hell you want and you can do it every day you can change what you want to eat in those 1200 calories every day if you feel like it but the key point is that the cornerstone of the diet is that you get enough protein in so you get your protein in first and then you fill up to the lid and whatever else you want now you may find out that a white potato is
(12:07) more filling than nerds ropes i would know this from first hand but if you don't have a compulsive need to eat right which i don't um then you can control yourself and eat whatever the heck you want right i tend to not be that hungry as a person in general and so i like to have more appetizing foods and i'd rather eat less of them right some people love to have huge volumes of food in which case you'll probably eat more whole foods right you'll probably have more potatoes and rice and all that kind of stuff right
(12:32) the point is is that once you just know those two numbers how many calories you eat how many grams of protein you have you can eat for the rest of your life never go on or off a diet ever again and here's the cool part you can split up those meals whatever way you want all right you can eat them you can be like i can have five meals a day you can have three meals a day you could have one meal a day it doesn't matter all right crazy i know it's like it's almost like they've been trying to sell you your whole lives i know all right but the
(13:00) reason this is so cool is that you can't fall off right there's no like diet like you you can eat whatever the hell you want like it doesn't matter you want to have ice cream every day you guys from every day and so if you're like oh like you can't you won't feel like you're cheating on a cheat day because you have ice cream every day right the best way to get people to become obsessed with food is to get them to restrict themselves from doing stuff because then they splurge and you know do a ton of it but if you eat ice cream today it stops
(13:25) being special if you eat cookies every day it stops being special right and so this is how i've eaten for almost 20 years um this has been you know the the secret behind it um and i get very tired of seeing the entrepreneurial world get fooled with shenanigans of stuff that does not matter that is why i wanted to share this with you it's also like the number one question i get which is like hey what do you eat every day um this is what i've eaten every day for almost 20 years um and all i do is i adjust the
(13:53) you know the goal up and down if i want to you know if i wanted to gain weight i would eat the same two pounds of protein i would just have more extra calories if i wanted to have it's you basically have this base of protein that just protects your muscle right and then everything else is just variable of just how many calories extra you want to eat and you can eat them whatever you want i want to make sure that i got all my little notes here that i remembered but the big point here is that all this stuff works
(14:17) because you can't fall off right you can't cheat because nothing is forbidden right and no one is immune to a calorie deficit right if you eat nothing long enough you will lose weight everyone like like some people lose weight faster or slower but everybody loses weight in deficit that's it that's the that's the food portion of uh of what alex eats every day and if you're an entrepreneur and you're like man i wish i could you know you're obsessed with all this biohacking and all the all the supplements to try and uh to try and
(14:45) lose lose fat faster but you're but you look the exact same years later um then uh it's possible that maybe the stuff that you're doing doesn't work and it doesn't matter and instead you should take a page out of this and um what's kind of funny is that uh i know just as much if not more about fitness stuff than i do about business stuff but i just haven't talked about in a very long time and i don't want this channel to be a fitness channel i just get really really tired of the shenanigans and the tomfoolery
(15:12) that i see in the entrepreneurial space around this and people speak in these absolutes and they're completely false and so anyways i know that mossy nation you guys are intelligent and hopefully shredded and jacked in the future and i want you to be able to hashtag never skip dessert while also having a six-pack and that is why i made this video for you so uh keep being awesome lots of love if you enjoyed this hit sub if you didn't love either way catch you guys next video bye

How to Build a LEGIT Online Course (Works in 2025) - YouTube

Transcript:
(00:00) you've probably seen these make ten thousand dollar a month in 30 days scam businesses marketing all over the Internet and on the same degree you've probably seen Harvard market and say you might maybe graduate from Harvard and that's the only promise they make and you can pay us 250 000 a year and so what's the difference between this clearly scam business and this incredibly legit 100 plus year old business it turns out there's only four things and I apply this strategy in building acquisition.com that only buys
(00:27) companies that's all we do this is how we do it there are multiple levels of legitimacy for education on one side you have Harvard most people don't call Harvard a scam but they fundamentally sell education and on this side you've got a guy who tells you how to start an ATM business and promises that you're going to make a hundred thousand dollars a day in five seconds they both sell education and on the scam index why is this one maxed out and this one's a zero number one Harvard turns people down I applied for Harvard for 10 times
(00:57) rejected if every single person who apply eyes to work with you and the only requirement to become a customer of yours is a credit card and a pulse ding ding ding red flag number one most people probably aren't qualified to become customers and if you define a qualified lead as somebody who has the highest likelihood of success with your program or service or education then you should have screening metrics for who is not a good fit it's more likely that they'll be upset leave you bad reviews call you a scam which you can easily
(01:25) avoid number one by selling qualified customers only number two is that Harvard doesn't give income expectations they don't say become a Harvard graduate make money tomorrow there's a delay between when you start and when you actually even graduate and get the endorsement of their brand which to be fair is really what Harvard sells is the brand endorsement that you get to put on yourself the second thing is that instead of giving testimonials of students on income I graduated Harvard and I got my first job at 185 000 at
(01:56) Goldman Sachs you don't see that anywhere on their site but what they will publish is is data and this is [ __ ] huge if you do not track your customer success metrics meaning when someone buys what percent of them succeed at 30 60 90 12 months what are the averages for whatever the thing that you educate them on if you track the data then you don't add any sensationalism to what you're reporting Harvard publishes what the top 20 percent with the average with the median person gets and what industries their graduates go into because that's data
(02:34) they're not setting false expectations and they're not saying this is what you can expect in six weeks They're saying four years ago these people started and today they graduated and this is what they got the highlights that they have at Harvard are not the income but the experience and the network and the relationships and the character development now if you're thinking to yourself man it would be harder to sell people that way but if you do it that way and you only let in really good people what do you think happens you start to develop a
(03:07) brand for example I was having this discussion with Jacob my neighbor because he was saying he was considering starting a sales School whether he does that or not at some point in the future is irrelevant but I said if you were going to start one then you want to be legit about it because you see everybody and their mother has a sales school right now because they start selling High ticket they immediately make 20 grand a month and they start a course on how to make 20 grand a month that's a high ticket closer if you want to be
(03:30) legit about it what you would do is you would give tons of content away for free this is pillar number three you can monetize the education itself you can sell education but I think the smart move and if you've consumed any of my stuff is that you give away the secrets you sell the implementation take all the content you would normally sell as your course and give it all away for free so if I were selling the ability to sell then I would give away the course as content through all the different platforms I pass we could and the
(04:01) implementation would be let me listen to your sales calls give you feedback in real time and then monitor your performance over that period so that you become a salesperson pillar number four Harvard doesn't graduate everyone some people fail and the reason for that is because Harvard wants to maintain their brand because what they say is sure Johnny graduated from Harvard with a 1-6 GPA now he was smart enough to get in but through the four years we saw that he didn't have some of these other character traits so I was telling Jacob
(04:32) if you want to be smart about it number one you would just show the data number two you would probably not accept ninety percent of people who want to be sales people because you could immediately tell in the interview just like Harvard does that you're probably not going to be a good salesperson so it's easier to find people who have proclivity for sales and then just get them this much better and then endorse them but before you have the endorsement you still rank order them on who you think has succeeded the best and have the
(05:01) possibility that someone pays and does not get your endorsement because that is how you long term maintain the brand and so let's play this out how could we get 100 of people who graduate from my thing to be the best salespeople first thing is we pick people who are naturally good at sales second thing is cut out the people who are not third we set expectations that are only Based on data and the remainder of our testimonials and stories are based on the experiences of people who've gone through our system or programmer implementation I establish
(05:28) far more demand for my service than I have Supply so that I can keep my prices High by generating more content that is better than everyone else's paid stuff you maintain thought leadership and all they do is copy what you have and everyone else can then make a judgment wait their free stuff isn't as good as your free stuff so then your paid stuff must be better than their paid stuff that's the natural logic that the marketplace will always do let's say you did it and you had a really high standard and you've only been making
(05:59) content for let's say a year now if you're like wait only a year yeah it takes time to build big ship so if you build it for a year and let's say you only got 25 people to graduate but they're all killers Savages what do you think is going to happen to the companies that they go get jobs at you got any more now you have even more Demand on both sides what do you think is going to happen to the Friends of those people who start making twice with the industry averages for sales guys because they're that much better their
(06:26) top 20 top 5 sales guys rather than just run of the mail sales guys their friends are gonna be like if I'm gonna make three hundred thousand dollars a year rather than the industry average sales guy making 60 I make five times the income how much more valuable is this one-year education well we know Harvard charges people 250 000 for their four years so for a year you could probably charge a lot because you have the data to support the fact that one you don't let everyone in two when people graduate you also have a rank order is that an
(06:54) education business abso [ __ ] lutely is it a scam in no possible [ __ ] way

How to make SO much money it makes you sick - YouTube

Transcript:
(00:00) my goal here is to make you guys as much money as humanly possible if you're a lazy mother you better have a load to leverage now you have a $300 million year exit rather than a $25 million year he's like that sounds better here's what's crazy he 10x the company he just added $10 million to his net worth so we're going to start with a little exercise I'm going to call it the magic wand all right so right now if I have a magic wand or you have a magic wand and you wave it and you get to make as much money as you want all right so write
(00:28) down or put at least think about it in your head what number that would be per month okay how much money are you making per month okay hopefully it doesn't take too long to think of a number now who here currently is making that amount of money please raise your hand wonderful so we have just done is established a gap between where you are and where you'd like to go fantastic so here's you here's goal which we all just established now in scenario one you have these goals right and there's all of these different
(01:10) ways of getting there right and the problem is you're like which one do I do before I explain more on that scenario two is I don't know what to do to get to there let me tell you how these feel this one feels like anxiety so if you feel stressed or you are overwhelmed about which thing you should do that's this if you don't know what to do you're at a loss you feel hopeless because you're like I don't know what the [ __ ] to do like I don't know I don't know what to do and it's not about picking it's like you don't even know where to
(01:55) start and this has been really important for me to identify if I feel anxiety it's because I don't know which thing to pick if I'm feeling sad it's because I feel hopeless I'm like okay hopelessness means I have a lack of choices so I have a lack of choices means I I have ignorance around this topic okay this makes it solvable so then I can start solving for I need a path so that I know what to do it's the only thing I know me personally that's what makes me sad is if I don't know what to do I get sad is this resonating with anyone here okay so
(02:26) when you're deciding which thing to do this is a clear case of lack of strategy all right now strategy is a big fluffy amorphous word that gets tossed around a lot and no one knows what the [ __ ] it means but it's probably important and in my opinion is the most important but I'm going to give you a different definition for this to make it a little bit more useful okay strategy is just prioritizing it's all it is like whenever you hear someone say we have to figure out our strategy it just means we have to figure out our priorities it's all it me
(03:01) and in layman's terms it's what's going to get us the most bang for the buck if you want the fancy definition that I have it's how you choose to allocate resources that are limited against unlimited options that is strategy and the tough part about this about strategy in general is that when you're looking here you have all these options strategy is figuring out actually there's one that's right here that takes us off the page cuz the most costly thing in business isn't just the unknowns but it's the unknown unknowns as in the things that you didn't even know you could pick from I
(03:41) show this to say that right now if my goal here is to make you guys as much money as humanly possible by the time I am done my 46 minutes then if I can just get you to make the one chest move that will make you the most money then it will Roi everything you do this year or maybe the next five years because fundamentally people don't actually move faster than other people like you see me walk it's not like I'm hyperactive it's just you get more for each step when you are more strategic when you have better priorities and you
(04:13) allocate your resources time money energy into the fewest moves that get you the most bang for the buck you make the most money so back to this you guys want to hear a different example so we had a we have a our company that we bought we dove into the data and it looked like 85% of the businesses turned out within 2 or 3 months which is horrendous 15% of the customers paid the most and stayed the longest and they were different I was like wild idea what if we stop selling these 85% and only sell these 15 and cater our stuff to only them and he was like that would kill my business mind you recurring
(04:56) theme of the first one when I told him to shut his agency down he had to go to zero and then built the next thing and for 9 months he was basically at zero is hard like tough very simple to say very hard to do could you guys imagine if you have two locations I was like hey I can help you get there for a year you're going to have to make no money cool what do you do play long game right and he was willing to do that and that was me talking to him off the cliff every week being like hey man we're going to get there and so with this individual uh
(05:28) with the pr we he cut 85% we catered the messaging and we made it way more Niche down to this specific Avatar and we 10x the price and now we sell more units than we did before we 10x the company strategy rather than thinking okay what am I going to do to just get more now there's always a time for more believe me violence is the answer big fan all right of brutal Relentless effort but we want to make sure that we're capturing the most per unit of effort and so the equation for this is volume time leverage equals output which means the more times you do something and the more the more you get
(06:11) for each time you do it the more you get ultimately now if you're a lazy [ __ ] guess what you better have a shitload of Leverage no you can be lazy and still make tons of money you just have to have lots of Leverage you got to be really strategic in the moves you make the more activity you have the more you can let a little bit of that uh violence um work for you but it ends up becoming a cap soon enough because at the end of the day we only have X amount of hours and if you want to do big [ __ ] you need a lot of other people's hours to work for you which is a form of Leverage I'll give you a third one so we
(06:46) had a a company that uh is an association of of uh trying to keep it vague let's call dentists Association of dentists they had a they had a business that like they' glob all the savings together of all the dentists said that they would charge less than all of them saved with with the conglomerate of buying power right so if you save $30,000 a year as a dentist they would charge 10 super sticky model great business and so he's like hey I think I could sell this thing for 20 or 30 million and uh I was like how many dentists do you have there he's like I
(07:19) don't know 500 I was like and they all run the same systems I like yeah it's like what's the average dentist make like per unit it's like I don't know 500,000 I was like wild idea what if we take 10 every year bundle them up and sell them from 100 million every year get 20% give 80% to them that'd be chill right I was like then you get your exit every single year and then if you want to sell it we exit the machine that does rollups because then that you have rollup machine does 20 or 30 million a year in profit and we get 10x on that
(07:58) now you have a 300 million year exit rather than a $25 million year he was like that sounds better I was like I'm with you I agree strategy prioritizing what move will get me the most for the effort I put in all right now this is a perfect transition to you're like okay that sounds very pie in the sky so next Tik Tok theory of constraint so everything that we do at acquisition.
(08:29) comom and the approach that we have with growing any business is spending a lot of effort to try and identify the constraint of the business because every single business is constrainted there is one thing that is limiting its growth so right now and here's the [ __ ] up part many of who here works all the hours of the day like most of the hours that you're awake okay half of you if your business is not growing as fast as you want it to you are working on the wrong stuff if it has stayed the same and you were spending all your time working on it you're not going to get more hours so you're doing the wrong [ __ ] so it means
(09:05) that you have not properly identified the constraint of the business so I'll give you an example of this we had a media company that came to us big YouTubers 40 million plus subscribers and they were like hey I was like what's the goal they're like we want to make money I like cool love it great goal so they're like we think that we need to create a better media machine it's like okay okay they're like we need to really systematize this and do it better it's like okay how are you monetizing AdSense by the way very inefficient way to monetize okay and so they're like I think we're I think this is these are
(09:43) all the things we need to do to eliminate our constraint for our production cool it's like have you thought of wild idea maybe we just like the constraint of the business is that you don't have something to sell I was like you're like a 97 out of a 100 on media and you're a zero out of 100 on [ __ ] to sell and you're trying to talk about how to get to a 99 rather than like if we just went from 0 to 20 we would probably make you 10 times more money than you're currently making and so that is an idea of the theory of the constraint right
(10:15) like the constraint of that business was not media and many of you the constraint of your business is not making better [ __ ] workouts right that's not the constraint it's not the constraint right that's not the constraint and so right now if you spend all your day working on [ __ ] that doesn't move the ball working on the wrong [ __ ] so let me tell you how we do it so that hopefully you can too so one of the questions I like to ask is why can't we 10x this business like why can't we and sometimes asking that question and then it becomes really apparent what the problem is and
(10:52) the answer is sometimes well we just need to hire all these people it's like well let's [ __ ] do that right and so here's how we transition into the tactics around this so this is the actual first part of my planning process prioritizing process strategy process whatever shoe fits you for figuring out what we're going to do with a company that we're going to grow so when we're thinking about all the objectives all the things we could ually do it has to map to one of these three objectives which is one how is this thing that we're going to spend time money effort on going to get us more
(11:40) customers two how is this thing going that we're going to spend time money and effort on get us increased LTG make them worth more or three how is the time energy Etc going to decrease the risk that this does not continue to happen in the future which is another way of translating how do we increase the Enterprise Value overall so for example if you do all of this stuff that's great still really risky because if you die the business dies now if we have to hire someone to do the same thing as you is it going to get more of either of these probably not will it make the thing more valuable absolutely does that make sense
(12:20) so I'm going to segue briefly we're going to side quest imagine two people 5 million Topline 5 million topl line 2 million in bottom line 2 million in bottom line this guy is a single owner runs every all the day to day has lots of minions known with real brains and they just do what he says okay if this person dies the business dies this guy has a team that runs the whole thing and he makes $2 million in income from the business but it doesn't require him who's richer thisy guy question is how much richer a lot this guy because he doesn't
(13:04) have to do anything means that somebody else could also not have to do anything and also collect that $2 million a year which means his thing is probably worth depending on what type of industry it's in 10 15 sometimes $20 million and so when this guy here's where the leverage comes in Big L if you go from 2 million a year to 3 million a year in income he just added $10 million to his net worth this guy is concerned about all of the tax evasion strategies because he's trying to maximize income and forgetting the fact that the asset is the thing that's going to build us net worth this took me a really long time to
(13:35) learn like an absurdly long time everything I did was all about like how do I take the income I have be more efficient with it blah blah blah blah blah when it's really like you become wealthy from the [ __ ] you own not the [ __ ] you do so everybody here has a business and right now many of the businesses in this room are not valuable no one would buy them because it's really just you with some helpers and so the IDE is that we have to transition and this is a skill that is worth getting because no matter what you do for the rest of your entrepreneurial career you're going to
(14:05) need people you need to have the skill of hiring recruiting training onboarding managing Talent who here has one amazing Superstar person who works for you cool imagine if you had four of them at your one location how easy would life be right you make a ton of money here's what's [ __ ] crazy the difference between small businesses and big businesses is how many a players they have and so what happens is most small business owners hire a lot of people get lucky one sticks actually works their ass off at a fair rate and you're like ah man if I had six more sandras right
(14:43) I'd be good to go the thing is is that big business owners maintain a higher level or a lower tolerance for mediocrity and so they actually do keep looking until they find six Andreas and then it does become too easy for for them to kill it because I got six aners how could I lose that's the idea make sense okay this took me a long time to learn like I would just put up with people who are mediocre and right now many of you have a think of somebody who's mediocre on your team actually I'll make it easier think about that person that you thought about today who you shouldn't have
(15:18) thought about because if they're not making you money and you're not sleeping with them don't think about them first thing in the morning all right so anybody have somebody in mind so if you have that person in mind that person is taking up 25% of your bandwidth what a cost right and probably many of you the biggest lever of growth is on the other side of a few heart conversations I now talk to portfolio CEOs all the time and it is incredibly clear the people who will win and the people who will not is simply based on their ability to confront
(15:56) discomfort and it's interesting because as a mostly H it's kind of 50-50 actually audience U between male and female but a lot of guys beat their chest I can cold plunge I can run a long time without stopping lift lots of weight but you can't just say hey man I think you suck a little bit real can't do it and for that reason they suffer for [ __ ] decades because they can't fire Sarah not Sandra Sandra's stud right can't fire Sarah it's like yeah I know she slept with one of the clients but like I mean I think
(16:34) her heart's in the right place it's like whenever you're whenever you're qualifying that someone's heart's in the right place and deep down they're a good person it's because it's obvious they suck right hit a nerve on that one um so right now do me a favor write down the name of the person that you know you need to get back to and start what we call a performance Improvement plan which is you got 14 days to fix your [ __ ] or get out and many of you can't even have the conversation because you're too much of a [ __ ] pansy real
(17:15) talk and this will keep you poor seriously like you H like you got to grow up got to be able to have hard conversations be like hey my biggest my biggest piece of advice for this is you know the [ __ ] you say about Sarah while you're here behind Sarah's back God she's just like she's been slipping lately you know what I mean like she's not shown up on time she's not cleaning up after the classes she's short with the with the clients I two people complain about her right say that to her that's it just think about what you
(17:50) [ __ ] talk and just say it to them it's just the truth just say it to him see what happens one of two things either they're like [ __ ] I've had my head up my ass that's why it's been so dark um right you're totally right thank you pull it out right and all of a sudden they have a total 180 that happens like one out of five times four out of five times you say these are the things that you have to do they either say I won't do that or they say sure I'll try and we both know they're not going to and then you elegantly exit them from the business the problem is that right now
(18:27) Sarah teaches like six classes [ __ ] now what got to find somebody else she's killing your business so get rid of Sarah all right so that was a side quest but hopefully we found some treasure there and uh write the name of the person you need to have that hard conversation with and be like there's this [ __ ] speech and this guy I was talking [ __ ] about you and I should have talk to your face and so this is me talking [ __ ] to your face so that I feel better about it you kind of suck okay thank [Music] [Applause]
(19:14) you so right now there's a lot of [ __ ] that you guys probably learned so far you're going to learn tomorrow and the rest of the day Etc if it doesn't do one of these three things toss it number one number two you might only be able to do one of them or two of them and so then you got to pick okay of all of these things which of these has the highest likelihood of working with the least amount of effort you do that one first and as silly as this sounds many of you won't do this and the reason I say this is because I talk to people we making a million a month a million a week and they
(19:53) sometimes forget too so like when you have the same conversation over and over again you you start to develop Frameworks around it right and the first framework that I wanted to give you around strategy is how does this get us more customers how does this make them worth more and how does this increase the likely that those two first things don't stop happening if it doesn't map to that forget about it just cut it because there are other things that will do that that we should be doing instead cool now the second framework is going to go one level down
(20:34) what who how so usually when you do this whole thing you get a big list of whats right these are all the things I got to do what what what what what what what you're like [ __ ] there's a lot of whats who's going to do it most the time you're like me right the difference between the guys who become bigger business owners and the ones who don't is they have to think how can I get my team to do this for me now this is not a team team talk but I am telling you that the reason the gym launch went from 3 million a year or whatever it was to 37 and still cranks
(21:10) um was because of Lila because I was like we're going to make it the Alex show she's like that's a terrible idea um and so she built a team and started empowering the team she's like you can't do that she started taking things off my calendar I was like hey I like that she's like no not for you that's for Sandra look I got six sandras they all want to work and so what ended up happening is has anyone given a task to someone on your team and they actually just did a great job with it and you're like oh thank God that was awesome anyone had
(21:42) that happen Okay so big businesses do that all the time and you just do it lots of sandas and if you can't give [ __ ] to any Sandra then you're the problem because you have really low standards and you're a [ __ ] you can't have hard convos it's what it is like literally it comes down to that big Macho guys can't tell the female trainer that she sucks can't do it can't do it and so what happens is we have this big list of whats and then we put Santana on the first two and we're like but man it'd be cool if we could do some of these other ones who should we give it to and then
(22:27) we start assigning the hoop but here's a fun trick if you've given the same who the same thing 12 weeks in a row like each quarter and the what's not done the who's the problem winners win and I'm sure that the best people that you have on your team hit the ground running started taking [ __ ] off your plate immediately started executing everybody loved them remember what that felt like that blueprint is what talent looks like and you just have to do more of that get more of those people which then opens up
(23:00) the next thing which is I'm not the type of leader who will attract that type of talent I don't have time to get into fixing you right now but that is what the next thing that happens is okay fantastic so Tick Tock over for this strategy session go to the next one all right oh good I'm great I'm crushing on time next framework for [Applause] you more better new so as soon as we figure out that we have the highest strategic leverage activity that we can in a business we then ask ourselves can we just do more why can't we do more I want to do
(23:58) more more money let's do that more more more right or we say can we do it better we don't have to invest any your resources just do it better we're going to go from calling leads in 30 minutes to calling leads in under five deal fantastic once we do all the mors and all the betters then and only then do we do new now here's how most small business owners decide what they're going to do oh here we go all right new and the thing is is a lot of you guys are going to come back from here with lots of new you're going to be like hey team I'm going to vomit all over you
(24:46) I'm going to make no plan it's going to be awesome and they're just going to be like let's give it a week he'll forget about all the things he said and we'll go back to normal real talk it's going to happen gym launch since we sold it to whatever is years ago whatever the time was 2021 I'm so proud of kale and the team because they consistently ask thank you um how can we do more of what we're doing how can you do it better Jim wch has grown 40% since Alex and Lila exited the majority share we still own 30 plus% of it but and I think in a lot of ways Kale's
(25:25) a better CEO than I am because I also like new shiny things too but kale is super disciplined he's an exceptional CEO there's a lot to learn from him how can I do more how can I do it better so it's like hey dude I think we should be getting on Tik Tok he's like you know what we could also do we [ __ ] double our Co call team do that what do we do that what's the likelihood that if we double our Co call team we'll make more sales hi we already have a trotten path there let's just do more of that but what about Tik Tock it's like yeah likelihood that we're going to get sales I don't
(25:56) know we've never done it before I don't know but what about this kid I saw on the internet he's making millions let's just double our cold C team and then let's look at our better and say like do you think we can clean the numbers more do you think we can improve the script do you think we can follow up faster do you think we can personalize the reach outs more probably and so right now this is real real the thing that is killing most of you guys is the desire to 10x in 90 days and then not doing it and trying
(26:34) something new and hoping for a silver bullet That Never Comes it's just it's 100 golden BB's like the big businesses it's just golden BB's it's just improving lots of little things over and over again the 40% Improvement that Jim wch has had since we sold our majority share has there's been no one thing and man wouldn't I love to make that short video there isn't one thing we just improved a lot of little things and that creat Crees the big outcome and so right now you probably have this big list of should do like I should do that I should probably email my list
(27:11) sometime right at some point I should do that right I should probably do more cold DMS or do more reach outs I should probably make more ads to run I should probably do that I should probably figure out our pricing and optimize it I should probably create that sales training program or get my team to go through that sales training program I should probably set up a roleplaying Cadence for my team so they sell better but you know what's new that sounds cool the should do if you actually just wrote all the things that you need to do down and then you tick them off and you realize that it
(27:52) takes two years to build an exceptional business and you did nothing but just actually do all the [ __ ] you know you should be doing you usually build a pretty exceptional business it's the rush that kills everyone it's the hope that this new thing is somehow going to shortcut the work that needs to be done and like this has just been true and true because the thing is is that that list for a $10 million company is longer and bigger that list for a $100 million company is longer and bigger and it's just [ __ ] that needs to get done and so the faster you can confront the
(28:23) work that has to get done the faster you start getting the getting getting to the getting there you go is this making sense all right thanks man appreciate it all right now you're going to have a lot of different things you're going to have a lot of different things that uh that you could do right and you've noticed this is the central theme is like you've got a lot of decisions to make and I just want you to make the right one I want you to make the one that makes the most bang for the buck and an easy way to order
(29:01) this is impact ease there we go so when you have your big list of [ __ ] just put it as one 2 3 four just put a number next to it really easy lots of impact really easy do these first then once you've done all of those hey don't consume any more information once you've done wait but I I haven't once you do all of these then start working on these then start working on these then [ __ ] these I really want to Rebrand the logo why no one knows that you exist to begin with what are we talking about you're like I want to Rebrand it's like why like you have a nameless ass no one has any association with your first
(30:04) thing like Xerox is just made up letters right they created a brand because branding is the consistent action of associating the unknown with the known right it's I know I'm supposed to talk about social media branding I didn't think it was going to be super important for you guys uh because you don't need to for now in my opinion not because it wouldn't benefit you but because there are other things that I think would benefit you more just to be clear okay now I'm going to give you this little uh this little TI raade and then I may I may have time but I may not have time at
(30:41) the end for Q&A we'll see so often times the things that is limiting the business is the big obvious thing so we have really big egos about our business we assume that it's exceptional we assume that it's excellent right but in your heart of hearts you probably know that if you were actually [ __ ] exceptional you would not be asking questions about how to get more leads because You' have people referring their friends and referrals by the way are nonlinear in that they are exponential in nature two bring four four bring eight Etc so the book the
(31:18) $100 million offers book was probably my first big experience with that because I spent like a very long time writing it and then I gave it away for 99 and I made one post and I think this when I had like 20,000 Instagram followers in total and I didn't have really any other platforms and that book to this day sells more copies every month than it did the month before and like last month it sold 25,000 copies it's like almost a thousand books a day a thousand customers every day no marketing spend just word of mouth right and 14,000 F stars and so like it's the big obvious
(31:54) thing and from being in the room with Millionaires and sorry billionaires and decad billionaires the thing that has become so clear to me is that the people who are obsessed with their product are the ones that get the compounding and so every business needs to have some sort of compounding vehicle within it otherwise you're going to spend the rest of your life trying to promote it so think about this way if I spend two years trying to write a book and at the end of the two years it's exceptional I'm going to give the alternative example first if I spend two
(32:25) months writing a book and I publish it and I have to spend the rest of my life trying to promote it to get people to buy it it's a tough life low leverage on the flip side if I spent two years trying to build something [ __ ] incredible and then let my customers Market it for me for the rest of my life more work upfront less work long term it's just that being willing to delay satisfaction or gratification is in my opinion the single greatest skill that you can develop and what's Wild is that a lot of you guys think you have that skill you only do when it comes to cookies but not when it comes to
(33:03) money and so you like give your clients all these lectures about self-discipline and being hard and like you know believing in your better self but like you will take actions that are in direct contradiction that same thing it's just we're switching calories for dollars same thing and so when I see a lot of the B like the gym owners that struggle it's just the big obvious thing the sandwich sucks they're like dude what's the new marketing thing for like gyms I'm like have you tried your sandwiches they are
(33:33) terrible why would you want more people to know right like it's it's it's real though right like imagine I had a mediocre book which is what most people would have and then I spent tons of money trying to Market it why would I do that it sounds ridiculous when you think about it you're like I'm just going to let everyone know I'm mediocre that would suck but that's what a lot of people in this room do every day and so the thing is is that in my opinion if I were to start a gym over today I would consistently work on the actual product the experience the way people get greeted the trainings for all
(34:11) of the teams into the world's simplest model and until people were not leaving I would not be worried about bringing more customers in once you get that right then when you're pouring all this gas in you can catch it because if you got a hole out the other side your constraint is the fact that people don't stay and so the biggest thing that you have to solve for because now we we buy into a lot of brick and mortar Chains It's one of my favorites unsurprisingly is LTV or lifetime gross profit over everything the guys who can spend the most money on marketing are the ones who
(34:52) make the most money from ads so when you see these massive marketing companies or these massive campaigns that are out there it's not because they're better at marketing it's because their LTV enables them to spend as much as humanly possible in the marketing if you print cash on the back end you can get silly on the front end this has to syn in like this has to sync in and I keep being repetitive about this because I continue to get the same questions whenever I go and it's like what's the new marketing trick what's the new hack it's like you have to solve the roote issue and it's kind
(35:25) of like the uh it's like it's like the G who's like hey is it keto is it intermittent fasting is it you know like I'm just trying to give the parallel here like that's what you sound like you don't get it you got to understand how to count your Macros it is what it is done and so like in the business it's like you have to figure out how to get the mouse trap to work even at its simplest level so that people actually like the thing you have and I just feel like so many of the gyms that I see and I go to it's obvious like takes 5
(35:57) Seconds to see why they're not successful and the gymm owner because they're in it can't see it because their ego their identity is attached to it because you think that if your gym sucks it means you suck and that's not true so you have to break that you should be like oh yeah we suck at that onboarding non-existent churn through the roof you should see my trainers slaving each other it's terrible Place absolute Pig St right so what what's your Clan I'm going to Market it I'm going to Market [Applause]
(36:41) it so to give a quick a quick uh re recap and if I have time for Q&A I will one brand is making associations between things that are intangible with things that are tangible and unknown so things that people like if I hold a bunch of bricks of gold on stage or I hold a bunch of stacks of cash you will make associations of money with me and if you didn't know who I was you would assume that I have something to do with money that would be your assumption that would be the association if I stand next to a
(37:15) porn star you would assume other things right associations and so if you want to build a brand associate the service that you have with the intangible ideas want the prospect to believe about you so if you want them to think that you are clean and you are friendly and that you care then start there magic wand if you feel sad immediately translate that into I do not know what to do next it massively simplifies this very like hard painful experience it's been really helpful for me so if you feel hopeless or you don't know what to do it means you just don't have options like you don't perceive
(37:54) that you have options it's a lack of options so you just have to become informed all right so whenever I think sadness I think ignorance it's like oh that's solvable and then I can start attacking it on the flip side if you have lots of options and you feel anxiety it's because you don't know how to pick which means you have to prioritize it means you have a lack of strategy strategy is getting the most bang for the buck it is allocating finite resources against infinite options and some of the biggest
(38:29) strategic moves are outside the board and that's where sometimes having gym launch other people Etc is helpful because you have outside eyes so your mouth inch below your nose but you still need somebody else to tell you a bad breath I heard that the other day I really liked it right now There's a constraint in your business if you do not know what the constraint of your business is you will not solve it you'll continue to do the [ __ ] you have been doing and that has not been getting you what you want so right now unless you change the activities you do you will not change
(39:01) the getting that you are getting so if you go back so I'll give you a different one so intelligence and learning this will be fun so the definition of intelligence as I Define it is rate of learning it's it's a speed someone learns fast they're smart someone learns slow they're a little slow right rate of learning okay what does learning mean this is how you can remember it same condition new Behavior which means the phone rings and I trained you and you answer it one way before I train you and then I have the same condition the phone rings again and then after I
(40:00) trained you you behave differently you have learned if you come to this event and you do things and then you leave this event and you do the same things you have learned nothing which means that change in behavior is the way that you can measure intelligence the speed at which you change Behavior with within the same conditions is your rate of learning the faster you do that the smarter you are and so some of y'all are hold on I got to figure out the politic one uh dumb but again when I Define words or
(40:40) operationalize them it becomes a lot more under my control so I'm like man I don't want to be stupid it's like they got to do this thing I went to this marriage seminar and they say that when my wife walks in the door I should say something nice to her damn right walks in the door you went to the seminar and you're like nice blouse she's like is that the top one or the bottom one like I don't know one of them right and so same condition new Behavior it's also a great way to teach your team which is like I'm going to present this condition we're
(41:14) going to train and when I present this condition again I need you to change your behavior that's what learning is and so everybody here if you don't know what to do then you're not going to be able to change your behavior which means you're not going to get different outcome so most of the success that I've had is my effort to try and boil everything down into an inputs to outputs equation I remember when I was studying for the GMAT back in the day I found this research study that showed that the number of problems that you solved was in direct correlation with the score you got on the test and I
(41:52) was like oh yeah okay this is a clear input output like life isn't always this clean but I was like fantastic so I did about a stack of phone books this High I did four hours a day for 16 weeks of problems and then I scored above a Harvard Smith score I didn't start there but I had the graph I was like the more problems I do the higher my score is and by the time I got to the actual test I was like I've literally seen every one of these problems before and I've done all of them a 100 times right it's became really easy and so if you don't have the inputs outputs equation which
(42:21) will be the last thing I do because kale asked me to talk about leads then you're not going to get there all right so I'm going to give you guys a sneak peek you can write it down you can't take pictures or talk about it there's only eight ways to get customers you got warm Outreach you've got cold Outreach got paid ads got content these are the only four things that you can do so if you claim that you're constraint because everything's amazing about your gym and your trainers aren't sleeping with each other and the Gym's really clean and people don't churn and you're priced appropriately and you have
(43:13) really good onboarding experience and people get reached out on a regular basis to uh check in on them to show that you actually give a [ __ ] you do all that stuff right and you think that your constraint is more marketing which by the way everyone thinks that's what it is and if you keep thinking that nothing changes is H may be wrong anyways let's talk about leads so these are the only four things you can do you can either post content do warm reach outs do cold reach outs or run pay ads simple I like to quantify this by the
(43:43) rule of 100 which means you either spend 100 bucks a day on ads you do 100 cold outreaches you do 100 warm outreaches or you do 100 minutes of content you do it every day and if you want to get there faster do more cu but you'll also get better because you did more just like the problems on the GMAT test if you're not doing this stuff what are you doing you might be thinking about marketing or advertising might be strategizing planning you're not doing any of it and the amount that you get will be directly proportional to how
(44:16) much of this stuff you do this is how you let other people know about stuff that's it that's all there is now op is other people you've got your customers who can refer you people you've got Affiliates who can send you people you've got employees who work for you and then you've got agencies those are the other four types of people who can get you the stuff if you think about it any of these four do these on your behalf this by the way is leverage if I can go get my customers to tell everybody about my
(44:58) book then I won't have to if I can get Affiliates all the chiropractor places in a five mile radius from my gym and all the massage studios in a f mile radi radius from my gym to just give a free month with any new customer they have because they know that I will treat them right then I can just have 200 different businesses that come to me now do those 200 businesses comeing out of the sky nope what would you do warm reach outs cold reach outs run ads or make content targeting those people then they'd come and then they do those things on your
(45:31) behalf agency will do those things on your behalf or if you do all that stuff then you cold Outreach cold Outreach warm Outreach paid ads make content to get employees and then the employees will do those things on your behalf is this simplifying some [ __ ] right now business can feel confusing and usually it's because we have not defined terms if you define the terms then you can know what you're actually talking about rather than like making noise with your face okay if you don't make noise with your face and just
(46:02) know what you're talking about it becomes a lot easier because the variables become defined and so if you want to get more leads you have to do these things if you want to get even more leads you get other people to do these things for you which starts with you doing these things to get those people that's it I have three minutes so I'm going to see if I missed anything by the way giving away really good free stuff great way to get more people to opt into your thing just in case anybody needed to be convinced about doing free stuff who here wants to look know what
(46:38) it looks like when it's all the way right yeah talk about scaling it okay so this give you a little bit of vision for the future so we love local Brands they're great they're wonderful Capital compounding Vehicles what you need to know is how much does it cost to open a facility all right cost to open then you got to know your topl line revenue or more specifically your bottom line profit per facility the ratio between these things let's say it's cost me 100k to open a facility and let's say I make 100K per year then I have a 100%
(47:10) cash on cash return who here remembers what the stock market is less than that right which is why I like it now this would not be that interesting to me why because I know there's a lot of operational drag associated with opening facilties just make 100 grand right and so the idea is how can I is there a way that I can get a more leverag model so I can make maybe like 250 to 500,000 per facility and then maybe even if it cost me 500 to make 500 then I only have to open oneth as many facilities in order to compound my
(47:46) cash now the way to do this and this is one of the things that I've observed with some of the most successful franchisers in the space is you have your facility now it has been your special child you have lots of doodads and lots of whizbangs that you've attached to it specialized sessions blah blah blah BL blah the franchise the franchises that are the most successful simplify it even if their corporate or headquarters has like all this stuff when they want to scale they massively simplify they think how little
(48:16) square footage can I possibly use because I'm not using this to F fill my ego I'm using it to fill my bank account big difference how little can I make this so that I'm really efficient with capital and then how can I make it as little operational drag as possible I can do it with six people but can I do it with three how would I incentivize those people I know I went from like super dirt sorry clouds to dirt here um but that's that is how you unlock going from five locations to 50 locations and then
(48:47) you start building the machine that builds the location so then you have launch teams that fill it up before it opens you turn it over to management they keep running it and the big key of making all of these work is that it can't just be based off some unique acquisition Channel because those all eventually go away all advertising platforms will eventually become too expensive and they will eventually die because the tension always moves right and so the only way to become enduring with your business like if you really
(49:18) want to not like if you want to sleep well at night you have to fix the back end if you know that if you don't sell any new customers you're still going to be fine next month and you do that for three or four more months and you'll still be fine that's the perfect business to then go market but like that's the boring work that no one wants to do I'm going to end with this one thing a franchisor of a really popular uh not really popular they had I think 20 locations uh franchise came to me and he's like my
(49:50) franchise isn't working right and they had I think six corporate stores 14 franchised and the average store cost about a million bucks to open and they made about $150,000 in profit per year right it's like you might as well just like invest in a stock and just not bother right like that's that's what you have to think with and when I saw that they were doing I think the average was like 1.
(50:22) 3 in Topline and 150 in bottom line and I think they were running like a very small margin I thought to myself I think he actually less than 150 point is shitty margins he was trying to figure out how to Market his franchise better how ridiculous is that right but the thing is is that like many people who are in this room are thinking the exact same way and so instead what I said was hey man I actually think your margins below and I think you have a lot of interest because that's why I took the call I knew the brand and I was like I think you have really good products I think
(50:52) you just you just have to get the Ops right to get your Market margins in check right you've got this menu that has 500 items on it boil it down to the top 15 that everyone usually does look at all the ingredients buy type see if we can negotiate better deals with vendors because we're going to consolidate all of our demand we'll get more volume etc etc and so what I did was I said hey we've got 12 months I want you to spend one month 12 months in a row to get 1% profit back month one you get 1% back it's all you have to do
(51:24) it's my only thing I 1% back and next month you're going to find another 1% next month you're going to find another 1% that's all you have to do hey if you find three three months ahead next month another 1% and 12 months from now you would have a business that would be sellable would be investable and would have already tripled or whatever was the profit of that and made it a scalable Enterprise but he had spent 10 years 10 trying to scale the franchise when it was the big obvious thing the sandwich just wasn't that
(51:54) good the sandwich in the literal sense was okay for the customer but it was terrible for the investor so you had to fix the model and so I think right now a lot of everyone here as much as everybody loves to come for leads and that's great a lot of you guys are just serving mediocre sandwiches and I think if you spent a year eating your own sandwich you would immediately see all the things that are wrong with it you'd fix that and then the rest of your life you'd be able to scale this thing thank you

(00:00) I've eaten dessert virtually every night for 20 years I have never skipped dessert and I've been able to maintain a six-pack for that entire period of time I have done a lot of different diets keto stuff I've done high carb I've done low carb I've done high fat I've done intermittent fasting alternate day fasting carnivore style eating whatever the last 10 years I've pretty much eaten the exact same way be able to have business dinners be able to have drinks many of the entrepreneurs that I know who've seen me eat and been around me a
(00:24) long time end up adopting this and they never go back what I'm not saying is this is the most scientifically researched whatever I'm sharing what work for me if something works for you just keep doing that number one is you have to figure out what your goal is either trying to get bigger you're trying to get smaller from there you start at number seven all the way up to 21 my videographers will put it right here 7 to 21 and every three you go from Extreme Weight Loss to moderate weight loss to maintenance to moderate weight
(00:50) gain to extreme weight gain all you have to do is multiply your body weight so I'm going to use 200 lb as my average cuz it's easy with math so let's say I'm a 200 lb guy and I want to get leaner I'm going to go to moderate cut which is the second from the bottom here of these three which you've got 10 11 12 and I'm going to say 10 cuz it's easy math and so I'm going to multiply 200 which is my weight time 10 which is this coefficient which gives me drumble please 2,000 calories all right now if you're like
(01:15) doesn't it change what about my exercise and what if I have a physical job doesn't really matter if you lose too much weight too fast go to 11 you can adjust it we've got 2,000 calories great here's step three you multiply your weight 200 lb again you multiply it by one really hard math means 200 g of protein some of the science nerd are going to be like you can only metabolize 7 G per don't give a every pound of lean meat white fish ground turkey breast 964 ground beef shrimp whatever a pound is 100 g of protein so if you need
(01:47) 200 g you need 2 lb and that's if you exclusively ate meat I tend to eat over my 1 G per pound I like eating protein it fills me up I feel good on it that's why I do it if you don't eat as much don't now we're back to the math this is the last math equation we're going to have to do we have 2,000 calories and we know we have to eat 200 g of protein all you have to do is figure out what 2 lbs of meat you want to eat or where you want to get your 200 g of protein from and figure out how many calories are in that thing these 2 lbs of meat are both
(02:12) turkey I eat turkey for both meals crazy these are both 560 I know that that's 1120 that's how many calories I have of protein that I eat in my day so I subtract my calories associated with those meals from my 2,000 in this example and I would have 880 calories left over those 880 calories here's the magic of how this works you can do whatever you want with them if you need to go out to a business dinner you want to have drinks cool well cocktails probably 150 calories have two of those and have a 500 calorie meal of whatever
(02:42) you want because again you've already got your protein you could just stay at home and have an entire pint of ice cream that's 880 calories or each of these cookies is probably 400 calories you could have two of them and that could be your dinner it doesn't matter and mind you that's with a cut that's with me trying to lose a pretty significant amount of weight now I actually maintain cuz we're going to this third chunk right in this in this uh 13 to 15 chunk If I multiply my body weight I'm more than 200 but let's just
(03:08) say it's 200 for mat sake * 15 3,000 calories so I would have an extra th000 calories on top of that th000 if I did that same thing instead of having two of these cookies I could have like five of these cookies for dinner or I could have two of these bites and still have some food I eat the same breakfast and lunch every day I start my day with let's call it a 200 calorie bar you call it a brownie it doesn't matter if I'm traveling I might not have this with me and I'll grab a Quest Bar at the airport right 200 calories and 20 g of protein
(03:34) one of those bars and then I have a shake and this is 30 g of protein and 160 calories I'm in for 360 calories for my breakfast I got 50 gr of protein knocked down already then I go to my lunch I have a pound of turkey which we already know is 560 and I actually only eat half of one of these guys one cup of rice I now have 150 g of protein and 1140 in terms of calories that I've eaten so far mind you I have 3,000 calories to just to maintain all right not bad so now I go to dinner dinner is the big Flex meal for me
(04:00) now I also tend to eat a pound of protein at dinner do I need to absolutely not do I want to absolutely I love eating protein I feel good when I eat meat if you didn't let's say you were 150 lb and you'd already eaten 150 g of protein up this point your entire dinner could be whatever you want pretty cool all right as long as it equaled out to the total amount of calories you want and I do this also because then I'm full if I just eat cookies I'm usually not full this has worked for a very long time I actually had a couple of guys
(04:28) stop me and say dude you made this nutrition video and like like I lost 50 lbs using it like thanks so much I get a bunch of DMS about this stuff and so this is really what I eat every day some like where's your greens I have a multivitamin and I continue to stay alive and guys I've stayed away from Fitness stuff mostly because like there's all these armchair debates and like I just don't care if you want I can do a part two on how I train as an entrepreneur it's different than if you were like a pro bodybuilder or a
(04:51) strongman or a powerlifter Olympic lifter or just a normal gymrat I can make that a second video put in the comments if not just enjoy this one

Transcript:
(00:00) let's rock so you guys want to hear something absolutely insane well in the last 40 months my YouTube grew from zero to 2.23 million subscribers my Instagram Grew From 7,000 to 2 and a half million sub subscribers followers you get the idea my LinkedIn went from Zer to 324,000 followers My Tik Tok went from zero to $856,000 followers my Twitter SLX the artist formerly known as Twitter uh went from0 to 600 17,000 my Facebook which we just started went from 0 to 25,00 there we go going in big Facebook um my podcast went from 3,000 downloads to 25 million downloads
(00:42) and my email subscribers went from 0 to 700,000 for a grand total of two billion Impressions over that time period and 7.8 million new subscribers and for a grand total of a million copies sold of my book for those of you who are like well what does that mean and I'll get to that in a second so in 40ish months all of that happened and I show all of this is proof to start this to show one thing is that this actually works and you can build a brand without babes without stunts or kittens and I start this proof because
(01:26) lots of people talk about stuff that they haven't done and teach a lot of sucky fluff as a result you can see the man there he's saying the truth this this fluff sucks and I refus to do that and so before we got the two billion Impressions and the 7.8 million subscribers it wasn't like this because 40 months ago I started with zero subscribers and a big quote fancy plan and my fancy plan had Three Steps step one make as much good stuff as I could step two post it everywhere I could and step three learn as much as I
(02:03) could and after 40ish months $4 million in team equipment vendors Studios and software a thousand hours of me on camera recording and 35,000 pieces of content let me say that again 35,000 as in count to a th000 and then do that 35 times in a row I learned a lot of What Not to do but I did learn six things that made money and grew my brand that you can use today now what I'd like to do is for the remainder of the presentation save you the three and a half years and $4 million so you can just get the lessons
(02:49) without the scar so that little box is our box of six lessons cool all right let's rock so here are the six changes that we observed over the last four 40ish months that actually worked number one going from edutainment to education number two for us to for you number three wide to narrow number four views to revenue number five shorts to Longs number six assume more to assume nothing now most of those I promise you I will explain and if it looks like uh I think I know what that means believe me there's a lot more underneath of it so
(03:30) let's start with the first one edutainment to education so I see content in three buckets on one extreme you've got entertainment which is the entire point of entertainment just to define the term is to get people to watch the only point of the entertainment is to just get people to consume it that's it if it accomplishes that it has succeeded on the other side you have education where the point of education is to get someone to change what they do right right if you try and teach someone how to answer a phone and then in the same situation the phone rings and they don't do something and then after they
(04:07) watch you do something they then change what they do in the phone rings the second time they have learned so the point is to change their behavior if educ if the video or the content does that then you succeeded at educating them and lastly you have edutainment which has the point of both trying to teach and entertaining at the same time and to be clear it's less that you make entertaining content or that you make educational content it's more that you make content and people are either entertained or educated as a result and
(04:40) so you can make one thing that entertains some people and then that same thing educates other people and so I just want to make this very clear that you don't control the audience you make something and then education or entertainment occurs but for our purposes I'll Define the content category is the most common outcome of your content and so if a lot of people are entertained then you've made entertaining content for the purpose of this presentation even if one or two people learn something so for
(05:10) example some creators might learn stuff from Mr BEAST's videos wow I learned how to make videos but the vast majority of people are entertained they watch just a watch on the other hand Walla who's one of the number one Educators on YouTube you can even see the different looking feels and don't worry I'm going to get into that he may entertain some enthusiasts around that subject but mostly he educates students and until recently I've been trying to figure this out I've spent a lot of time really working through this and so I actually have videos in all three buckets I have entertainment
(05:43) videos where the point is to get people to watch I have edutainment videos where we try and teach and entertain at the same time and then we have education videos where we just want to change people's behavior we just want to teach them something and so the first change number one that we see over lots of the data I'll support in a second is that I'm going all in on education for three reasons number one is that when we looked at all of our data All Views are not created equal I'll dive into that in a second number two is I like educational videos and number three is I like people who like
(06:14) educational videos too Andor people who educate themselves people who want to learn and so let me explain these so all views are not created equal so there's this Theory and this is going to this will be one that's going to Rattle some cages there's a theory that media works like a funnel in fact the vast majority of marketing infographics and things like that almost all are funnels and the theory goes like this you make entertaining content and then the theory states that people who watch that content then we'll go to more educational content okay sounds simple enough we've got something
(06:51) wide we got something narrow fantastic but in our experience in my experience and based on our book sales based on our email optins and based on the applications we receive at acquisition. comom to become portfolio companies it works much more like this which is that entertainment people want more entertainment content and education people want more say it with me education content and so in other words these people do not become these people not in any appreciable rate that we would build a business around and they certainly don't read the books Jo join the email
(07:30) list or apply to become portfolio businesses so if I want more of these people then they deserve the stuff that they value and so that's the first reason that I'm doubling down on education All Views are not created equal number two the next is that I simply like doing it all right so you know I do believe that you should try and do stuff that you like doing and if it happens to also be in align with your goals awesome it's much tougher when the thing you like doing isn't align with your goals but in this instance when I got that first piece of data I was like thank God
(08:01) because this is the stuff I like making most all right and so when I talk to Ideal customers in my mind they are business owners and business interested people because if you know me and anybody who who's close to me would probably attested this is that like if you hang out with me for any amount of time we will probably talk about business because it's what I love talking about I I eat it I sleep it I drink it I work seven days on it and like I skip holidays for it because for me it is the holiday so this is what I like doing and this is what the people
(08:30) that I like serving also like and so they like it better too and this is where got confusing for me leading up to this and why this is so important is that it got very confusing when you have so many people saying man I really like the entertaining content and this is where it gets difficult this is where you have to read between the lines of the comments rather than just reading the comments themselves all right because the thing is is for us or at least for me they weren't necessarily who I was trying to attract again there's nothing wrong with that I mean hey if I could serve the whole world I will but I know that I tend to do better
(09:06) serving people who want to educate themselves than people who just want to watch or consume just for the sake of it and so that's why I'm debling down on going from edutainment some enter edutainment some entertainment to education so that's number one so let's talk about change number two that we saw going from for us to for you you're like what does that mean let me explain so recently a mutual friend came to the headquarters and he said hey I've been consuming your stuff for years but recently I just haven't been watching as much and he said it offhandedly wasn't like trying to smash my ego into bits um
(09:41) and he failed at that uh but when he said it I really took it to heart right it was very gut-wrenching he said it just doesn't resonate as much I was like okay got it it felt like a gut punch since he's literally the person I could help most this is a business owner doing 10 million plus a year and I was like man well that sucks and that's when I realized that reading the comments actually led me a little bit astray and for you it might be leading you astray and I'll give you some data to support that and so some people loved our different styles but
(10:11) not the people that I ultimately wanted to help or am best suited to serve and so we realized that we were serving the wrong who and that had some very significant Downstream impacts on what we made and how we made it so what is making for them or for business owners content really mean let me break this down into tactics all right so tactically it meant five things number one different packaging number two different introductions number three different meat number four different visuals and number five different what I'll call pre-work all right so let's start with number one so the difference between
(10:52) these two thumbnails is going from vague to clear all right so if I looked at all the stuff that we did in the past if I said what is the video on the left about you'd probably be like I a rule of some sort that might have to do with money not sure if I said what's the what's the video on the right the yellow background video if I were to describe it I'd probably say a map or a blueprint or schematics of some sort that go from zero to a million okay well guess what the one on the right it's exactly that the one on the left actually has nothing to do with what that thumbnail looks like and what do you know when
(11:28) people click on something that they don't know what it's about they have a smaller percentage of getting something they actually want than if you say this is what this is about and then they get exactly what they think it's about so we're going from vague to clear in both what it looks like the thumbnails and what we say about it the headlines so that's number one from a packaging perspective that we will be changing Andor going more all in on and I want to take a pause here for a second about this there was also kind of a pervasive narrative in in the kind of
(11:59) marketing world is like you got to have curiosity you got to like you don't want to tell them everything you want them to to be able to get no like if they want that thing they will click on that thing and then you just give them that thing and that has been a very hard lesson for me to learn and so I share it with you now so the second is different introductions you guys feeling this okay good okay different introductions now this one is really big so going from confirming the thumbnail or confirming the headline to proof and this is super important I'll explain the difference so
(12:32) a lot of the things that I learned like many of you if you are trying to get into content creation of any sort or media is that you look at the people who are who are the biggest right and so often times the biggest people in media are entertainers now why is that because everyone gets value from entertainment but there is no one thing from an education perspective that can provide value to everyone why because everyone already knows different stuff so if I educate a wide slice of people there's still already people who know that thing and then do not get value so
(13:03) entertainment by definition will always be greater or larger the followings for those people than people who educate there is no no bones about it like it is that way and so a lot of the lessons that entertainment teaches everyone listens to because they have the biggest followings but I don't think the actual tactics they subscribe or espouse are correct at a tactical level at a principal level yes and so so let me just say a second about what that principle is is that the person who's going to consume the content we want to
(13:36) increase their perceived likelihood that they will get what they clicked so just like the headline and just like the thumbnails now when they said in entertainment you want to confirm it well that's because most of the Sensational entertainment is something crazy and so the likelihood that someone just got the click so that they could not do that crazy thing is pretty high and so if you want people to watch you smash a Lamborghini then you better have the Lamborghini next to you or people aren't going to believe that you're actually going to smash it now let's flip to entertainment for a
(14:07) second sorry let's SL let's switch to education for a second if I say I'm going to teach you a physics thing I'm going to teach you about the law of I don't even know what the first law of physics is but if you push it it will move something like that anyways if I want to have proof or increase the perceived likelihood that they're going to be well taught then what I actually have to do is edify the person why should I listen to you if I'm the viewer there's a zillion people that could write something on a board but if you're a PhD physicist then the
(14:43) likelihood that I will listen to you and that I will get what I want is much higher and so in both of these examples we are actually doing the same thing but we do it differently if you want to educate and for me when I looked at my videos and I'll explain the data in a second it became really clear and so in entertainment it's say the title again and then literally show them what was on the thumbnail in education it's show them that you can do what you promised them in the thumbnail and that's the difference and to figure out what made
(15:13) intros for our videos work I actually rewatched my top 35 educational videos this actually took some time and so let me just save you like a lot of hours and just give you the Nugget and so I actually developed a new moniker around how to think about introd for ourselves that I'm spreading throughout my whole team and you can just steal it proof promise plan so I'll break down all three of these so all of the introductions of the best education videos that we had had these three characteristics and I want to make one point about the order of these is that
(15:50) you can have these three mixed in any order you want I would emphasize the one that is the most important for that particular piece of content so if you have something that you're making that you think the proof is going to be really important then lead with that if you have a promise that's incredibly important for the audience then lead with that if you have a plan that for some reason is going to be more emphasized than lean with that but I would say that for our content for the most because I'm a business educator
(16:14) about making money in general most people have this big glaring sign above their head before they can even turn on the volume of their brain which is why should I listen to you and so I tend to lead with proof and so proof is that you prove that you know what you're you're talking about you give people a reason to believe you the promise is to tell them what they're going to get or learn from the video and the plan sets the expectations of what will happen next so let me give you a real world example of this I started this presentation with
(16:44) data that shows that I've done what I'm talking about if I went up here and just skipped this part you might be like okay all of this up to this point why should I listen to you and you'd be right in thinking that because you have no idea who I am I could just be some random dude that looks like a birken stock slightly Lumberjack eish weirdly Dressed Man like why would you listen and you'd be reasonable to believe that right but if you start with that then you're like okay well he know something the promise was what I said you would get at the beginning I said I
(17:13) learned six things that made money and grew my brain that you can use today and I'm going to save you $4 million in three and a half years and you'll just get all the lessons that I learned that was the promise making sense okay and then finally we had the plan I said how are we going to get there how am I to complete that promise I said well there's six changes and I'm going to walk through them that's the plan and so leading with those things we found got business owners or the people that I'm interested in to actually better frame and perceive and get educated on the content that we're talking
(17:42) about and so that's what we're changing out of our introductions third now let's talk about how this strategy changes the meat of the content what we're actually like the the real bones the potatoes all right is that going from be real SL Vlog stuff because we have made that to list steps and stories when we looked at the educational content that did the best they had more of the right and less of the left from Razzle I would I would love to say to Dazzle but it really is it's just Razzle on the left and so I actually
(18:11) wanted to show a different type of content so I don't want to make this seem like this is all YouTube I just have like long form video there has all of the elements and some platforms don't have all of them so you YouTube's a very easy platform to base this off of but this is from Instagram and Tik Tok would function the same way Etc so if you look at the squares here I just pulled the last 30 days of content that we made and I looked at our bottom performing over the last 30 days that we posted that were reals and then I looked at the top now
(18:40) interestingly it was a almost a perfect reversal so the bottom 12 videos that we made eight out of 12 I would say had more Razzle emphasized it was more about effects a little bit higher production and on the flip side and this is what was crazy and this is why I'm sharing stuff with you because like I would I would literally never have guessed it and that's why we look N9 out of 12 75% of the best videos we had emphasize language emphasize the actual message more than the production and so it was about emphasizing the language rather than the Razzle I find this very fascinating now to be really
(19:19) clear you can have really bad language you're like poor vague unclear language and it won't do well and you might have Razzle that just absolutely crushes I just look at the trends of of 75% on this side were this style or this type and 75% that weren't as good were this style well then let's do more of this and less of that and so those are the main meat Changers that we're doing in the videos we're emphasizing language this also was true with Longs as well so if I go and show you this real quick language that's on the screen and that's one of our best
(19:51) videos ever and that takes up 70 80% of the video is actually just words interesting for me at least I mean I was a little offended cuz thought I had a you know good face but apparently no one cares so that's what we're changing about the meat so let's talk about visuals this one's a big one all right so going from over production and I want to be clear not over production over production for the objective so it's not like we did like my team did anything wrong or anything like that it's just that if we want to educate sometimes
(20:23) production distracts from the objective of Education if the point for entertainment is to get someone to watch then adding lots of things can be a good thing but if you're trying to learn physics and there's whizbangs and popups and changing backgrounds it's really hard to learn and if that's the throughput or that's the point of the video that it actually detracts rather than ads and so the difference that I put in this example here is we have a background that changes colors while I'm teaching something it does not help someone understand the subject matter better fundamentally changing background
(20:55) color will not help anyone learn more on the flip side clar ver ifying what words on a screen are because maybe my handwriting is not that good would help people understand that's the difference so over production to effective production from distracting to enhancing from visual effects to visualizing data so instead of having Flames behind me it's what does this look like on a chart so we can give relative scale so we have scope so we can show changes over time and so that's how the visuals that did the best looked like and then number five let's talk
(21:35) about pre-work for a second so going from postproduction to pre-search so instead of saying hey let's just record something and then fix it in post anybody who's in the media side knows what I'm talking about four weeks of editing after you know almost no prep to get a video out well what if we did four weeks of research and then we have almost no editing because we thought of everything ahead of time well guess what the videos where we spent I mean we're like the the the hour to hour ratio is stupid and I'll get to that in a second but if we spend a quarter of the time
(22:09) that we used to spend on Post in Pre we eliminate 90% 90 maybe 95% of our post edit work and man-hours and for the business owners in the room that's real cost that's real savings and for the also business owners in the room that also means increased production so if I can take the quarter of the time and I can get almost zero time on the back end that's four times the videos but not only is it four times the output it's also higher quality for your goal and your audience so this is a big thing that we noticed the videos that we spoke the most time on the front end we spent less time on the back and they did
(22:48) better and so we want to spend more time before than after and so this is my little quote if you want to write something down uh an ounce of pre-work is worth a pound of post so that was my little my little take on this and so by focusing more on what educates and what it means we do great and everything else distract from that goal and so those are the five things that we're changing tactically and that we're doubling down on to cater to business owners this at least for my audience is what they cared about and I happen to be in that
(23:21) audience and I feel that way too so I'm happy about it so that's how we went from for us as media people to a degree because I've got into this now uh to for you or for your audience and for me that means for business owners so now let's talk about why daero all right and this will also ruffle some feathers and rattle some cages so instead of talking about relationships and college and food and lifestyle I'm going to be narrowing down or doubling down on if you will business business models business leverage and selling in a business
(23:59) notice business being in all of these videos and all these topics and so that's how I'm going narrower very simple now that I'm going to go back a slide because I want I want to head on this for a second just like I said earlier that people who like Entertainment also just want more entertainment what we also found is that people who I'll go back quick people who watch relationship stuff want more relationship stuff and as they should that's what they clicked on that's what they want that makes sense and people who want to learn about college are people trying to make a
(24:34) decision about college guess what those people probably aren't business owners and people who want to learn about food they watch other food videos and people want about lifestyle probably watch other lifestyle videos but for me those were not necessarily the people that vibed the most with my stuff and that makes sense because to be fair this is a little bit more foreign to me when I talk about business I feel very comfortable when I talk about these things I just give what I would consider hot takes this is my perspective so that is what we're doubling down on in terms of the topics
(25:06) that were choosing for the content we make so that's number three let's go number four in terms of the the things we're doubling down on so before this we used to track views this is another big one man all six of these are big man I'm glad I made a presentation about so before this we used to track views as our primary metric so I'll take a second here who uses be honest be honest everybody's like likes don't you can't trade likes for for paying rent you can't pay pay roll with view sure okay got it who here actually tracks something besides views me say it again who makes views
(25:42) the most important metric you track all right right a lot of you that's okay me too but I'm going to give you a good metric that you can track and this is after pouring through believe me I'm I'm a big data guy um a metric that you might not expect so the main reason is that I had a 6 to 12 month deal cycle so I started by using views because I really had no other metric because for those you who don't know what I do well I'll explain in a second but we had no idea what what it would do besides driving awareness and I didn't really have any other objective right but in that time period of doing a deal in every six to 12
(26:16) months because we buy companies that's more or less what we do um we begin seeing a much closer correlation with faster feedback metrics and ideally in any business you want as little latency between the metrics you track and the behavior you want to change and so if you want to get people to change something and you want to look at something that takes a year to get feedback really tough to change Behavior but if you can have a a metric that you can see daily changes or hourly changes then those are things that are going to much more quickly change Behavior so that you can have a 100 feedback loops in terms of changing and getting better
(26:45) than one every year and so besides Book Sales optins and applications there was a metric that stood out as fastest and most measurable it was ad revenue and this is really surprising to me so and I this is the point I want to make real quick is that to be clear for those you who don't know who I am ad revenue is not how I make my money all right just very clearly um for those you don't know my wife and I exit our first big company uh for $ 46.2 million in December of 2021 you can Google it American Pacific group was the
(27:15) private Equity Firm gym launch and Prestige labs are two of those companies um and since then we invested and bought a number of companies that have grown a lot and do over $200 million a year so I do media to feed a lot of different things but I don't directly monetize the media and like ad revenue is I'll explain why in a second is an important metric that we can use for everything else okay so these are companies that we own great so for me I pretty much always ignored ad revenue and just saw it as
(27:41) something that could offset some of the cost of the immedia team there was really nothing else but I was wrong it's actually so much more so let's let's dive into a little bit for a second like how does AD Revenue come to be so it comes from two things this number of views times Revenue per views now the actual term is RPMs which is revenue per meal which is French for thousand but it's number of views times the revenue that you get okay per view fantastic so it takes into account and this is why this is important because we thought views and that was the only metric we had but we had to have something to counter it because
(28:11) otherwise then you get views for view sake but we needed a quality metric with a quantity metric which by the way paired metrics if you're ever tracking something for a department having like number of tickets resolved with rating against the the the resolution of how well those customer service reps resolved paired metrics allow you to get to to the best or most effective throughput for any department and I just didn't know enough about media to find out what our paired metric was and this happens to be a single metric that pairs both and so it takes account the quality
(28:41) of the audience which for me was business owners who have amongst the highest spending power and so RPMs are the highest now for so for me the RPMs go up it means I'm getting more of the quality people that I want and so this gave me and my team something that we could shoot for that bounc making videos for the right people who wanted to watch so I mean ideally we absolutely want to crank views with the right people and that's what that was able to track for us and looking backwards the month with the highest RPMs and AD Revenue also
(29:10) created the most Book Sales the most optins and the most business applications and this had nothing to do with how many views we got in fact we did kind of an experiment lately where we did 90 days of almost no business stuff we just did more uh more edutainment and entertainment style uh content and our views went through the roof like Way up 2 3x what we're accustomed to but even with the increase in views our ad Revenue dropped by half so we're actually getting the wrong people and I share this with you so you don't have to and so the nice thing about this from
(29:46) a team perspective for those who do have larger teams and want to translate this over is that my team now has real-time access to this so they can see every single piece of content in the ad Revenue that it generates and they can quickly generate baselines in their mind of what's good and what's bad on an objective metric that really is good and bad rather than just like hey this video cranked yeah but it didn't it didn't bring any of the right people we got this thing that had 10 million views okay but it drove nothing versus we had
(30:11) this video that had what 100,000 views and it made more ad Revenue than one that had 10 million and we saw the corresponding increase in the metrics that matter to us and so that's why we switch from views being the metric that we're optimizing for to add Revenue because it's a leading performance indicator it happens almost in real time rather than something that happens in a big in a rears to give a fancy word later so that's number four in terms of the things that we're doubling down on so let's talk about the fifth one
(30:42) shorts to Longs all right this is yet and end another big one that's going to ruffle some feathers so for a long time the prevailing idea in content marketing was again a funnel it's like everything's a funnel all right and it was believed that shorts viewers got more people to then watch Longs and then those long viewers would then translate into becoming customers right so people watch shorts and then they watch Longs and they give you money right that was kind of the prevailing thought but again when we looked at the data it looked more
(31:13) like this shorts viewers watch more shorts and long viewers watch more Longs and customers buy more and so the point is that that these are different audiences and I will make a note here that this can change my platform so I might be a long viewer on one platform and a short view or another and where I do think the magic happens is where you can have shorts in one thing and so someone finds you on Tik Tock but then they are a Longs viewer on YouTube and then they watch your Longs there so I do think there's an element there but not the way the
(31:53) narrative goes and so for us Longs drive a lot more conversions than shorts conversions being Book Sales opt-ins applications all right and business related content unsurprisingly brings more business owners than not business related content and so we are going to double down on more Longs about that stuff and change our short strategy to keep the volume the same but focus more on business overall and again people watch differently on different platforms so making shorts in order for people to on a different platform watch long still carries as far as We Know so despite the mega obsession with
(32:31) shorts that has kind of prevailed for the last few years because it was a new you know format of content we're putting now more emphasis on Longs overall for now as far as we have data so that's number five now let's talk about the sixth one that I'm going all in on assume more to assume nothing all right so what does this mean so let's start with assume more and what that what that really means broken down suum more means I made content assuming people already knew me okay so here's an example the Alex rosi
(33:06) guide to haters I might be like if I don't know who Alex rosi is or I've never seen that face before why do I care if I see the day in the life of Alex rosi yet again I assume everyone knows me in this I'm I'm sharing these mistakes with you as far as I'm concerned for getting new people into my world it wasn't made I assumed like everybody's going to know me the Alex rosi everyone knows me no they're like who is this guy right and here's why this matters if you want your content to bring people who don't know you which is why many of you guys make content then
(33:37) you can't assume they do and so this is what this looks like tactically from a headlines perspective if I were to remake these today I might try a first crack at business influencer crushes haters and shows how you can too okay so now if I'm clicking I would understand at least that this guy is a business influencer of some sort and he crushes haters okay I might want to see haters get crushed uh day in the life of $200 million per year CEO okay now the jet tells this me that this Alex Heros from the the first one before Alex Heros may be rich or maybe he can afford a private jet but now I know he's a CEO because I could be
(34:09) a rapper I could be more realistically when I walk around the place that I live all the people that in my community assume that I'm a football player it's the number one thing I like so you uh play football you on the hockey team and uh I I say no I can nope nothing wrong with that but no that's not what I do um and then the third one there Alex rosi Di 16 hour workday sixpack diet for business owners whatever the point is is that we actually make it welcoming to everyone and so here's how we do this
(34:37) tactically within the content itself so we go from they know me to introducing yourself every time so earlier I was like I'm Alex rosi this is what I do this is the the the subscribers I've gotten whatever we introduce ourselves two they know why they should listen to me tell people why they should listen to you every time three the inside jokes you know how I get no I don't know how you get please fully explain the reference because that references another piece of content that I haven't seen because it's the first
(35:06) video I've seen from you and if you tell an inside joke and someone doesn't understand the inside joke guess where they are on the outside and guess where people don't want to be on the outside and guess where people spend money on the inside and number four going from acting like you're already friends to pretending everything goes to people who have no idea who you are and when you make content so people who don't know you can enjoy it more do and for those of you who are worried because I can already hear the thoughts that are coming up so let me just address those right now I see
(35:42) you I'm going to lose retention if I introduce myself okay well let's play the equal opposite would you rather fewer people know who you are or more people who have no clue because on one hand we have some people who know you and on the other hand we have lots of people who also don't know you so you're in the exact same position you were before two well aren't people going to get sick of this you're going to keep saying your name every time or keep introducing yourself well from what I can tell warm people like the reminders
(36:13) and cold people need the introduction and as a total side note this is a fun little experiment for everyone here you can run this when you leave here if who here actually who here actually has posted content in the last year okay good okay good for a second I was like this would have been really bad if no one had raised their hand fantastic okay I want you to look at last year and I want you to look at your number one piece of content and this is what I want you to do just post it again and then let me know how it does and I will bet you that it does just as well
(36:49) or better than the stuff that you're posting right now and let me tell you one reason why I believe that to be true because if you have been posting consistently guess what's also happened more people have entered your audience and guess what they haven't seen that amazing piece of content that everyone from last year said was the number one best thing you ever made and you know what you said new people you don't get that that was only for my old folks my ogs they only get that no you got to reintroduce some of the stuff your greatest hits you got to bring that stuff in so that the new people also
(37:18) know what your greatest hits are so that the lore continues to compound and grow so number three and this one or subo and this is one for me personally I follow a bunch of quote accounts I you know I I like comedy and philosophy and like fighting those like kind of categories that I follow and gym equipment and so I get quotes a lot on my Newsfeed but you know what happens when I see a quote from Sophocles or epicus yet again that reminds me that I should just toughen up and keep going I like the reminder I'm
(37:51) not like epicus God you live 4,000 years ago like Get over yourself no he's not making new content but guess what people still post it and people still read it because we need to be reminded more than we need to be taught at least I do to give a little tactical one on this for mainstream because this might resonate for some of the older people in the crowd there was this thing called television a while back used to be big anyways instead of having it on your phone it was like this big screen on a wall you a is a whole thing anyways I W
(38:19) get into it it's like floppy disc regardless floppy disc okay anyway so so there used to be this thing where at the beginning of every show there was a theme s song right so they'd be like cheers where everybody knows your name and there's always a little introduction it says produce by and all that stuff and if those shows that spend gazillions of dollars on testing chose to think that despite selling more advertising space it was worth having the same exact theme song and introduction for the show don't you think it might be worth that for us too and here's an interesting
(38:52) thing the last thing positive associations and sticks if you actually get sing song about how you introduce yourself or the things that you relate to you it starts to become something that people expect and then they start associating it with all the positive other experiences they had with you so if I always introduce something a certain way and then I deliver value afterwards they associate the introduction with the value and guess who else do they associate that with you and so for those of you who are concerned you can add variety to this
(39:22) and I want to show you a cool little real world example of this so the Simpsons has the longest standing Show to my knowledge that has existed on television and the introduction is the same now Bart would be like 70 by now or whatever his actual age would be if it was actual humans but it isn't right and every introduction has barred at some point in detention writing something on the board for those of you who don't know the Simpsons every one of the introductions actually changes every one of them and so they still have the introduction that has all
(39:59) the positive associations with the funny times and the humor and the laughs that you've had with the show but they introduce a tiny bit of variety into them to keep it interesting and then what happens is people look forward to these introductions because they want to find the Easter egg the real fans now get catered to and the new fans don't know about it yet but they will and so now you actually serve both sides of the audience the people who know you and the people who first who are just coming cold and so that's it small variation same
(40:32) introduction you let the new people in and you give something to the the people who already know you so title it like they don't know you introduce yourself say why they should listen prioritize the content that makes sense for strangers deprioritizing the Vlogs the hot takes the opinions because if you can serve both audiences serve both let the new people in rather than have a wall they have to jump over let them in on the joke fully explain the references that you make make all jokes inside jokes for everyone and then finally mentally act
(41:06) as though you're always talking to a stranger because if the content does well you are at least that's what I'm going to be doing and so that's the six big change that we're doubling down on and so now that we covered those changes in my strategy I just want to get real for a second everything has a cost and it's not that other types of media or other topics or other formats don't work obviously we had a smorgus board we had a huge variety of cornucopia Myriad content types that we did over the last
(41:38) 40ish months and obviously we had 7.8 million subscribers and two billion views during that time period in a niche audience of business owners it's pretty good and so it's not to say that other things don't work I'd even say that my mess ups also work to a sort a small degree it's just that they didn't work as well as something else might have and so the game at least as I see an entrepreneur entrepreneurship is figuring out what's my biggest bang for a buck right what's the content that gets me the most of everything because you only have limited
(42:07) resources you have time money energy you put it into your team and that goes onto social media or the media that you that you Market on and then that has output and so if you can become more efficient with the inputs you get you get more output on the other side and so the question becomes with the resources I have how can I maximize the number of the right people who find out about my stuff and so this is something that I live by anything works better than nothing so raise your hand right now if you haven't made a piece of content in 90 days okay
(42:36) just do something because if you do something you will do better than what you're currently doing two some things work better than others and three nothing works forever and so the requirement of the entrepreneur is to start doing something see what works better and then do as much of that as they possibly can for as long as they can until it slows down and then figure out what the next thing to do is and then do as much as they can with that so is that helpful in terms of understanding content in media yes awesome do you feel like you got at
(43:16) least one lesson without the scar saves at least a tiny percentage of the $4 million that I spent learning what didn't work so I can show you these six things that do okay good would you like more stuff like this okay well then I've got a bunch of free stuff that I can give you to help you grow your brand and make some money that be all right okay so if you're just starting a business right now raise your hand okay this is for you I'm the co-founder of the school games inside you'll find courses full day trainings the easiest business model they know of to use this med this Media stuff because it's one thing to just say like oh great
(43:50) I just watched this whole thing on media now do I do well this gives you somewhere to actually practice it like a Sandbox you can learn it and you learn by doing this is one of the lowest Stakes way to make money get your first dollar across the finish line and so fun fact something I'm very proud of is that right now 30 3.
(44:05) 44% of people who finish their first month make their first dollar online by starting online community I think that's pretty cool and so you can start that for free by going to school.com games all right tell them I sent you so that's for everybody raise your hand if you're business uh uh you're starting a business right now okay that's for you now if you're a little further along in your business Journey I've got free stuff for you too all right trying to feel like Santa Claus today I wrote These two books right now which have 25,000 F store reviews they sold a million plus copies and I make courses
(44:36) for each of those books that are free on my site you go to acis.com trining so if you like this stuff you want to learn about offers you about advertising more about getting leads paid ads content all of that stuff so you can start making money within your business or scale it from wherever you are to wherever you want to go I've made this stuff for you these are real courses it's not barred anywhere you can click there watch them all all right see I put that for myself because this is how I roll get in the get in the zone so otherwise you guys are all amazing you can go there for stuff that will
(45:06) help you practice his stuff actually do it in the real world because if you just walk away from here today and you do not execute anything you learned nothing and so for the love of God just do one of the things so you can get a tiny percent of that $4 million and the 35,000 pieces of content and the Thousand hours that I spent recording just do one of them so you can take that lesson for you thank you guys [Applause]

(00:00) The single greatest skill you can develop is the ability to stay in a great mood in the absence of things to be in a great mood about. I've had some of the hardest days of my life this year. Maybe you feel the same way. And so in this video, I want to share a four-part framework that has helped me move forward even when life feels hard. So number one, learn the greatest skill.
(00:19) If you can be in a bad mood for no reason, then you might as well be in a good mood for no reason, too. One of the things that's been helpful for me is just actually recognizing the math of hard days. Think about you having a 100 days, right? Let's just say that you, you know, last 100 days of your life. Well, the top 10% of those days, you're going to have 10 days that are smiley face days.
(00:38) And then you might have, you know, kind of the middle 80 that's going to be kind of neutral days, right? And then you're going to have your bottom 10% days. Now, this is just normal because of a standard distribution of how days work. When I think back on, you know, my days sometimes, I'm like, you know what, maybe today is just a bottom 10% day.
(00:56) And if I didn't have this bottom 10% day, then I wouldn't be able to recognize the difference between these days and the top 10% days. And so in order for me to want to have top 10% days, I by definition must also have bottom 10% days. I think the most important skill that you can have is being able to reframe reality.
(01:14) And I say this because I had a very good friend of mine this year say something to me and it was it was really powerful and it's been top of mind since he said it. He said, "You're Alex Hermoszi. you can get away with whatever you want as long as you frame it right. And I really thought a lot about that and I've I've brought that perspective to a lot of the conversations, a lot of difficult things I've had to go through this year. It reminds me of a quote from Victor Frankl who wrote the book a man's search for meaning which he wrote while he was in
(01:37) the concentration camps during the Holocaust and he survived or he wrote about that time period. And one of the things that he said is he who has a why to live for can bear almost any how. If you think about that, the why is the reframe for dealing with the how. How can I frame this this difficult thing, this thing that I'm about to go through or that I just went through.
(01:56) How can I reframe that? In what world would this be an amazing thing? In what world were when I tell this story 40, 50 years from now, would I be like, this is a pivot point for me. I had to have this origin story in order to get to where I wanted to go or to become the type of person I wanted to be. These have been some of the mental reframes that I've used on some of the harder days that I've had.
(02:15) So, this year I had a gigantic bill come out of nowhere. It was a a multi-8 figure bill that was required to get paid in 72 hours in cash. I, you know, thankfully had that available to me, but I had obviously different plans for that money than dealing with this gigantic bill that I had to all of a sudden pay within 72 hours.
(02:34) basically the moment between when I got the news to me paying it to then kind of reflecting back because it almost felt so fast or was like I've got you know I've got all these plans and then boom this happens and then 72 hours later it's like wow okay what am I going to do what am I going to do kind of moving forward from this and there's this great quote by Marcus Aurelius which is what are you so afraid of losing when nothing in this world belongs to you I really thought a lot about that which it's like I can't take it with me in the end and so being sad about losing ing something that was
(03:04) never really mine anyways. Like I'm going to have to push all my chips to the middle of the board when when the game's over. I'm going to have to cash my chips and somebody else, you know, other people are going to distribute my chips when I die. And so it's like I'm really just a steward of these chips.
(03:15) I'm just renting these chips for a minute to be upset and to ruin the one thing that I'm only that is that is finite, which is the present moment for something that actually doesn't affect how I live. So this is the second piece. This is actually kind of a utilitarian perspective.
(03:27) It really helped me by losing that money. I asked myself, what does this change about what I do? What does this change about my life? It doesn't change the food I eat. It doesn't change where I live. It doesn't change where I work. It doesn't change what I do. It actually changes nothing.
(03:43) All that changed was just like in my mind I had an expectation of the future that changed. That was it. And I said, "Okay, because of this thing that exists in my mind, I am choosing to punish myself for not having seen this or not paying attention or whatever number of reasons I could blame myself for." But at the end of the day, I was like, "Okay, so you just get to pick how long you want to beat yourself up for.
(04:03) " And I was like, huh, well, what am I so afraid of losing if nothing in this world belongs to me? Nothing. This wasn't mine to begin with. And so that really kind of helped me quell that kind of negative thought pattern pretty quickly. So there's to put a little comedic spin on this. Mark Twain, which has some of the best quotes like ever, by the way.
(04:20) He said, "I've lived through uh many terrible tragedies, um, only some of them actually happened." And so it's like, you know, most of us suffer almost exclusively in our minds. I found it helpful when I'm in a bad season like I am right now. To be fair, I don't try to like put big labels on things, but I guess I'm just giving myself a little bit of grace, but to just focus on having a good day.
(04:38) And so, it's like, okay, even though this is a bad season, I'm going to have a good day in a bad season. It's kind of like a bite-size victory. And if I start stringing enough of those good days in a row, I'm going to turn a bad season back into a good season. And it makes it feel a little less bad because I feel like I'm making progress.
(04:54) I heard this bit by Bill Aman, who was like getting sued. He was going through divorce. He just lost $4 billion in Parishing Square for his capital. So he was like honestly all of this happened at the same time and he realized all these projects for these big massive things which is a lot of kind of the stuff I'm dealing with right now. They're not like okay I had a bad day.
(05:12) They're like things that just la they last and they prolong, right? And he said you just got a little bit done every day. That's it. He's like you just got to make a little bit of progress every day. And kind of like compounding and investing it's like you don't really you don't see it in in a day or two or a week or two.
(05:23) It's like but you look at back at 30 days you're like all right I moved the ball a little bit. you look back on 90, you're like, "All right, I made some progress." And it's just like if you have big goals, you're also going to have equally large obstacles. And so, you can't assume that, oh, my big goals are going to take many, many years, and that the obstacles that I have to maneuver around are going to happen overnight. Sometimes obstacles you have to maneuver around might take a year or multiple years to get around.
(05:45) And so, you have to be able to manage your headsp space and basically keep your internal combustion engine going during those harder times. And so, it's kind of like a monkey swinging from good good moment to good moment. Because even going from bad season to good day, you can even have bad day and good moment. So I was trying to thought, okay, today was a shitty day. Fine.
(06:03) What good moments did I have? And by focusing on the moments when I look back on my life, you forget most of your life. Like if we're being real, like you can't recall most of your life. Most people can't even recall what they ate like three days ago. But you can have the moments. And so the moments when I think about at the end of my life looking backwards, those are the only things I'm really going to remember.
(06:22) I just want to make sure that I take those down. Feels like a bad season now. I can try and forget most of the bad stuff and just try and remember the good moments. In retrospect, I can have rose rosecolored glasses when it comes to this this season.
(06:39) Well, how do you have a good day? And I think this is different for everyone, but I'll tell you what my little formula is for for having a good day. Good day formula. For me, there's only three things. Number one is eat with people I like. Simple enough. Number two, lift with people I like. And the third is write something. If I do those three things, I had a pretty good day. Like I look back and I'm like, I earned my shower today. I feel good about this.
(07:06) Maybe for you, your three things are going to be entirely different. Now, I'll give you a little wrinkle on something that's been really valuable for me, like absurdly valuable. The thing that I noticed that made these two things significantly better or really all three of these things is not being in a rush.
(07:20) If I have to lift and it's like I only have 60 minutes to lift, I don't like that. Some people are fine with it. Some people are like, well, this is how my life has to be. That's fine. I have come to a point in my life where I was like, I have a lot of money and I have the ability to not work anymore and there are not a huge amount of things that bring me big joy.
(07:43) If these are the few things that bring me joy, which is eating without a clock with people I like, lifting without a clock uh with people I like, and writing something for as long as I feel like, then I should organize my day so that I don't have as like many many hard stops so that if I want to lift in the morning, I don't have something at 9.
(08:02) And if I do have something at 9, it's something that's movable, right? Like if I have to, you know, make this video, it could be at 9:00, but the team knows if I show up at 9:30 or 9:45 cuz I lifted longer, that's fine. It's all good. It has taken my good day formula and made it like my super good day formula. And so sometimes it's like what are the tiny nuances that actually make something different between good and great.
(08:20) I thought about like the days that I had these three things happen and then I had better days that has those three things happen. I was like what was the difference? And the difference was that I didn't have to be somewhere else. And in trying not to have a rush, it means I have to give something else up.
(08:36) Then the question is, is the thing that I'm giving up worth having a better day. For me, I was like, yes, I'm willing to give up some money or some upside in order to have consistently better days. And that's a trade I'm willing to make at this point in my career. So, let's move on to number two, which is redefine pain.
(08:54) If you want to achieve a goal, you're either going to have to accept boredom or pain. And the bigger the goal, the more of both you'll get. When I started my gym, I actually lived with six other people in one house. This is like off of beach town. Think like sand everywhere, people everywhere, dirty dishes everywhere, not enough room in refrigerator for food, cooking was an absolute mess. Almost all of them had dogs.
(09:20) So, a couple had two dogs, another couple had one dog, another guy had a dog. Four different dogs in the house. And they were like all marking territory. It was horrendous. And I was splitting one room with a guy with a bed, like two beds. My bed was on the floor, his bed was, you know, elevated because he uh he could afford that at the time. And I would sleep with a fan on my face. I couldn't hear anything.
(09:38) That was my secret. Like is the fan like you there's like the wind over like that's all I could hear. The thing is is like I was doing that when I was making like 20 grand a month take home. There's always trade-offs. And the trade-off for me of living in that condition was that I could invest in the dream and build the business that I had at the time.
(09:55) Now, I could look back because I ended up losing everything, you know, a few years later. You know, you get this negative cycle of like all of that suffering was for nothing, but it wasn't for nothing because I learned all these skills along the way. You also can't operate from the perspective of like I might lose it all in the future, which means everything I do today is not worth anything because like you're going to lose 100% of everything the moment you die. So, trying to say that you might lose something in the future is a reason not to do something is ridiculous.
(10:18) You're going to lose everything at some point. You cannot wish for both strong character and an easy life because the price of one is the other. When I think about pain, I think about what thing am I paying for right now and is that thing something that I want and if so, it reframes the pain as the price of the thing that I want.
(10:41) This is super interesting is they've done research on this where they have somebody who like accepts like shocks. They can like opt out at any point. If you have the same man who's getting shocked and then you tell that man in the other room every shock he takes his family doesn't have to take his threshold of pain like quadruples. This may seem like some quote mindset whatever.
(11:02) But the thing is is like the bigger your goals the more pain you're going to endure whether you want to or not. It's the price. And if you can endure four times more pain than someone else I don't actually think that it feels four times more painful. I think it feels the same level of pain, but you have this padding that makes it feel worth it.
(11:20) Give a man a purpose and the ability to achieve it and he will crawl over broken glass with a smile. That broken glass, like how can you have a smile during the pain? It's because of what the pain itself represents. Now, I'm going to get get a little bit into behavior because I think it's it's valuable.
(11:37) I talk a lot about reward and punishment, but those are kind of more colloquial terms. When it comes down to behavior, it's actually reinforcers. A reinforcer can be negative, meaning it can be something that's aversive. So, for example, if I know that every time I hit my hand with a hammer, I'm going to grow muscle.
(11:56) Hitting my hand with a hammer or taking the shock for my family means something positive, which is that I'm protecting my family, I'm helping my country, I'm I'm doing something that I deem meaningful. The pain itself can become a positive reinforcer because you know you're making progress towards the thing you want. Now, you might think of that and be like, well, I don't want to have the pain.
(12:12) I mean the thing is is that when you're going through it, if you have this frame, it isn't as painful. In a lot of ways, it's like we are our own sculpture that we are working on. And as we chisel away, we also get to reveal the type of person that we want to become, the traits and the behaviors and the belief sets that go with the man or woman that we're trying to trying to grow into.
(12:29) And so I wrote this story, I want to say a year ago, maybe two years ago that related to this that I just want to share with you. So imagine you're talking to the creator of the universe about the person that you want to become. And so you say, you know, I want to be courageous. And the creator replies, then I will give you monsters that terrify you.
(12:46) That way you can conquer them. And you say, well, I want to be patient. And the creator replies, then I will make you work harder and longer and nothing will come easy to you. That way you can learn to wait. Or like, okay, well, I want to be wise. And so the creator says, then I will give you failures that will crush your spirit. That way you can learn the value of judgment. Then you say, that sounds like a hard life.
(13:05) Can you give me a good life? And the critter replies, "Just like we measure the quality of a blacksmith by the strength of his steel, I measure you by what you are at the end, not the fire and the hammer that it took to make you." A good life isn't an easy life. A good life makes you into a good person. And that, my child, is a hard life.
(13:22) It's about who we become doing the work more than the outcome from the work itself. And I love this, and this is a reframing of Proverbs, but the works on you more than you work on it. Like in all labor, there is profit. Meaning we always benefit from work. Even if the thing that we work on gets destroyed, even if you went bankrupt, even if you know that relationship didn't work out, even if that partnership falls apart, the work you did is eternal because it changes you.
(13:46) For those of you who don't know who are new to my channel, I lost everything five years into my entrepreneurial journey and then I made a little bit more and then I lost it all again. But the thing is is that I had this idea that, oh, I have to start from scratch again. But that's not true because you can only start from scratch once.
(14:04) Every time after that, you start with an experience. A man with an experience is never at the mercy of a man with an opinion. And you transition from the second to the first, the moment you begin working because you're no longer somebody who has an opinion.
(14:21) And as soon as you know what that truth is, because you've been there and you've actually done it and you have the scars to show for it, then their opinions matter significantly less. I'll give you a different reframe that I've had for redefining pain as it relates to other people, which is you can summarize just about every hateful comment on the internet into one thing. He lives his life in a way that I would not prefer. That's it.
(14:49) Everything is he lives his life in a way that I would not prefer. To which I respond, yes, I do live my life in a way that most people would not prefer and they live their life in a way that I would not prefer. And that is why it is their life and they can live their life the way that they want to live their life, the way they prefer it. And I will live my life the way that I prefer it.
(15:07) They cast these stones at you as though it matters. My dad told me this when he was going through his divorce. He said he went through this like divorce conference and the the speaker on stage said to somebody in the audience, he said, "Hey, here's a ball." and he threw it to him and he said, "Okay, throw it back to me." So he caught the ball.
(15:19) He said, "Now I want you to imagine that this ball is a steaming hot pile of and he threw it to the person again and the person caught it." He said, "Why would you catch it?" And so the lesson of that is just because someone hurls at you doesn't mean you need to catch it. You don't need to choose to participate.
(15:37) And I thought that was a really interesting frame. People can hurl whatever they want. It doesn't mean that they have justified a response or that you need to accept it. and that little reframe of, oh, I live my life in a way that other people would not prefer. Well, that makes sense.
(15:49) I'm not trying to live the same life as them, so of course. And then they say, he made trade-offs that I would not make. And I say, of course, of course I did. Why is this why is this somehow an insult? When I was making those trades in the earlier days, I didn't know when I would be successful or if I would be successful.
(16:08) The only thing that I knew for sure was that I wasn't going to stop. And that was it. I know I can just not stop. and that's something that I can commit to and that's controllable. I think a lot of the big gift of hardship is that it doesn't define you, it reveals you. The benefit is that you get to see who you really are and you make that decision yourself every day.
(16:26) I have this perspective on loyalty which is that like you cannot say that you are loyal until your loyalty is tested. You cannot say you're patient until your patience is tested. Otherwise, it's an opinion, not an experience. You can't say that you handle hardship and that you're emotionally resilient until you've had something to be emotionally resilient about.
(16:50) The gift of the hard time is to give you proof of who you are so that the rest of your life you get to know that you did that and you get to tell that story and relive that story to yourself for the rest of your life. And to me that gives the hardship memory dividends that pay forever until the day you die. I'll tell you a story.
(17:07) So I went to a school in the SEC and you know some of the SEC schools are renowned for hazing and and and aggressive stuff and so I I was you know going to join a fraternity and you know obviously they uh they you know build up how hard you know pledging is going to be and all this stuff right and I called my dad to to talk about it and he just said remember there is nothing that they can do to you that is harder than what you've already been through and it was a great reframe because I remember the times you know like when you know things would be quote hard during that that season of pledging and I would just think about the things that I had
(17:36) already survived, the things that I had already been through at that point and it made what they believed to be suffering appear childish. I was like, "This is cute." But for the people who were present in the moment rather than being able to relive through their memory dividends, using it as a shield for my emotional affect during the moment was like, "All right, I have these eight weeks where I have to stand here before you apparently give me a stamp of approval. Fine, then I will do that. I live my life in ways that you would not
(18:04) prefer." And that carried me a pretty long way. And so, let's say that you've used these tools to redefine pain, right? And you've realized that you are the outcome. The work you do is the only thing you control. And the person you become becomes the evidence of the work that you voluntarily subjected yourself to.
(18:29) And not only does that pain or that difficulty or discomfort make you better, it's also what separates you from everyone else. And whenever I do go through those moments, I do have these slight like crook of the smile, you know, I mean, crook of my lip that goes up because I'm reminded that everything that I'm willing to tolerate and deal with is what everyone else who wants to do the same thing will be incapable of doing.
(18:48) If it's hard for me, it will be just as hard for somebody else. And I think for some reason that gives me some sadistic pleasure that I will be able to to keep moving forward. That's kind of a perfect transition to number three, right? Which is endure what others won't. All of this becomes your competitive advantage. And that competitive advantage compounds.
(19:08) The more memories you have of hardship that you've been through, the more it stacks, the more it becomes a trait, the more it becomes in ingrained in your behavior. And the more it takes to shake you because you're like, well, this is my baseline. This isn't even close. It's not even it doesn't even register on my scale of something that's an inconvenience.
(19:25) We've all met that person where like if a if a if a call gets moved or a you know a dinner plate is late it's like it's like a nuclear bomb went off, right? It's like well what's the opposite of that? Like what's the person who like it doesn't matter if a nuclear bomb went off but all you see is a straight line completely undisturbed by the things that are going around them because you can beat 99% of people without being smarter or luckier but by being willing to endure pain and uncertainty for longer.
(19:50) It's hard for you. It's hard for everyone else. And most people avoid hard things, which is why you can beat most people by just trying and continuing to try. And the main thing is is that I think most people don't even know what trying feels like. Ila and I have been going through this season, so it hasn't just been me.
(20:10) And she had a mentor say something to her that she told me and I really liked it. She said, "Hey, you know, we had this difficult situation and you know, we're kind of relegated to, you know, this option or this option and neither of the options were particularly good." And she said to Leila, "Are you settling or are you moving mountains?" And I really like that because like whenever I'm looking at these choices that I like sometimes feel bad, I'm like, "Is there another option that I could see if I move the mountain?" And that has just
(20:40) dramatically increased the willingness to work, to really try. I keep thinking to myself like, okay, well, if I was going to get killed or Ila was going to get killed or people I cared about were going to die if I didn't come up with another solution or if I made the thing that I wanted to have happen happen, what other things would I do? And usually it's a lot more.
(21:05) whatever way you have to unlock that level of trying, that level of effort. Like most things are hilariously easy to do, it's just more easy. It's easier to just do nothing. Most people do nothing and get nothing and are dissatisfied because their expectations that they would get something for that nothing of work.
(21:24) What's crazy is that the highest levels of effort are so rare amongst people that you can unlock most things in the universe with it by just really trying like your life depends on it. because it does. Most of the time we know what we're supposed to do. We just have trouble doing it. Like, you know what you need to do to get a six-pack. You know what you need to do to build muscle. People already know this. Like, you don't need to know anything about training to do that.
(21:47) You just stop eating crap. Maybe eat some protein and add more weight to the bar over an extended period of time. That's it. That's all it is. You know that already. And yet, you haven't begun because you haven't really tried. Like, it's hilarious to me. It's it's it's apparently rarer to have a six-pack above age like 30 than it is to be a millionaire. Like, think about how crazy that is. And don't cite the sources.
(22:10) I heard that and I believe it. Whatever. 9% of Americans have a a net worth over a million dollars. Surprising, right? 9% of Americans certainly don't have a six-pack. It's rarer to have a six-pack than be a millionaire. I just I think about that. It's like we know what to do. It's just we're not willing to endure what it's required to get it.
(22:29) And we're not willing to reframe that pain as the price of the thing we want and to give our pain meaning. Fortunately or unfortunately, you know, humans, we live in a competitive environment. We seek status because of, you know, evolutionary backdrops.
(22:46) And so, how do you beat other people? And I want to be clear, I don't really think you need to beat anybody, right? If you just beat you every day, you'll beat everybody by default. And I think that you'll get to the end of the race and realize no one else is really racing anyways. But the main main is that you need to get out of I had actually conversation with somebody on my team this morning.
(23:03) They were saying they want to do this training um for the department that they're in and they wanted to talk about running on clean energy versus dark energy. And I was like, what does that mean? He's like, you know, clean energy is like you're going towards something. Dark energy is like you're running away from something. And I thought, I think that's a really good and noble idea.
(23:17) The problem is no one's going to know what to do with that. Because what it really meant was if you guys do your jobs using quote clean energy or knowing when to use quote dark energy, you will be more effective. Okay, fine. Now we have conditions for a behavior. I asked him, I said, "If you want this trainer to be significantly more effective, I need you to do two things.
(23:36) Number one is define what having clean energy looks like. How do I observe someone who has clean energy? What do they do? Do they talk differently? Do they ask different questions? They have different cadence." And to the same degree, you know, having dark energy doesn't mean you ask more times. You you push back more often.
(23:48) Let's define this in terms of behavior. And then what we'll probably find is that there's no such thing as clean or dark energy. There's only behaviors that under certain conditions increase the likelihood of a positive outcome or a desired outcome. Okay? In these conditions do this and in other conditions do that. And so then we can get away from these amorphous terms.
(24:04) And the reason I'm bringing this up is that we have to define everything in terms of the actions that you're going to take. Let me give you a visual of the difference between sadness and anxiety. I'm going to draw them and you tell me which one is anxiety and which one is sadness. Which one's anxiety? Which one's sadness? Anxiety. Sadness.
(24:35) Sadness comes from a perceived lack of options, which is why it feels like hopelessness. Anxiety comes from many options but a lack of priorities which is why it feels like paralysis. So looking everywhere but moving nowhere. And so you solve sadness with knowledge and anxiety with a decision.
(24:56) The goal from here is to see the path that's available to you. And you have to do that by learning. Once you have a path, if you have too many paths, then you have to start cutting paths off. So you can say this is where I'm going and then I have no more anxiety around this. So if you don't know what to do, the answer is to learn.
(25:15) If you know what to do, the answer is to do it. And if you're already doing it, the answer is to never stop. What I will reinforce here is that none of those three actions that I just defined have anything to do about how you feel today or in this moment. I want to be very clear. People think that I'm this uh unemotional or zero affect person.
(25:35) That's not true at all. Of course I feel things. The difference is so what? Like I can feel terrible and still do the actions that increase the likelihood of success. It's not trying to negate the fact that you have emotions or that you have bad feelings. It's about continuing on the path one step in front of the other despite that.
(25:58) And I think that the more you learn that your actions do not need to be equated to how you feel, the more these feelings can just be in the backdrop and ultimately they make you resilient. So let me show you what resilience looks like. Which one's resilient? This one. Why? because you return to baseline behavior faster.
(26:32) Now, toughness is a different thing which is how much does it take before I have this decrease? And then there's a third vector which I'll find the word for it. But when you do have the decrease, how low do you go? To me, the ideal scene is that. And the thing is is that all of these things are happening throughout this whole period and the other people in your lives are doing this, right? Or they're just doing low and they just never recover, which we've all met those people. If you want to become resilient, what are the actions that you take? You
(27:07) say, "Okay, this occurred. How long will it take me for my behavior to return to baseline?" And if my behavior never changes, did it bother me to begin with? And maybe it might have bothered you, but it didn't matter because it never changed your behavior. One of the things that will set you apart is the ability to move forward despite how you feel.
(27:24) This is, you know, Leila's classic uh her most known quote, which is uh your mood, follow the plan. And I would say like a lot of you guys don't know Ila that well. Ila is one of the most mentally resilient people that I've ever met. And she pulled herself out of a deeper hole than I ever did.
(27:41) She started from a poorer family. She had a worse home situation. She had a worse personal she had, you know, she got arrested six times before she was 18 or 19. Like she she has worked on her more than any person that I know. Not to say that it's not more than any person in existence, of course. I have no idea.
(28:00) But of the people that I've met, she has done the most active work and I have learned a lot from her. Let's imagine we're going through this, right? So, you've learned the greatest skill of reframing. You've redefined pain in a new way so it actually could be progress for you. we're willing to endure and take actions um that other people aren't willing to take so that we realize that they were never in the race to begin with and it's all about us anyways.
(28:22) And so what's the fourth thing is that you zoom out and you keep going. You will die months later no one will care. And so why care about what they think so much when they care so little about what you do? Like take the risk, right? Shake off the losses. shake them off because in the end you live for the story only you can tell to the only person who was there with you the entire time which is you might as well make it epic because you're the you're literally the story writer and the story listener the story consumer were born alone and we die alone even if other people captured your entire life they still don't know what
(28:57) was going on in your head they don't know your intentions they don't know what you were thinking through at every given moment only you do that being able to over time in my opinion and be the judge, jury, executioner of your own faith and your own judgment is one of the most valuable things you can do because you're the only person who can say good job.
(29:15) You might win in some circumstances and not have tried. To me, that's a loss because you know you could have let you could have put more in. You didn't empty the tank, right? You left some on the field. The other extreme, if you followed a logical thought path and you did, you moved mountains to try and accomplish something and if you actually had exhausted every possible path that you could think of truly beyond costs that were no that were not worth the price of whatever you were trying to get. You exhausted all the the paths that were worth it and you don't get it.
(29:43) Other people may have said that you lost, but you know there's nothing else you could have done and so you can still say good job because of the effort that you chose to put in. I have a few frameworks for zooming out that I think may help you. So, one of my favorites is the frame of the veteran, which is, okay, something bad happens.
(30:03) If it happened a thousand times in a row, how would I feel about it the thousandth time? Well, I probably be like, well, that's just how things are. And it would no longer bother me. And so, if it no longer bothers me then, then it means it's a choice for it to bother me now, so I might as well choose not to have it bother me today.
(30:21) The second frame is cosmic relevance, which is basically zooming out so far that you realize that we're just a tiny little marble in a galaxy. And you know, humans have only been alive for this tiny sliver of time throughout the billions of years. And the likelihood that your boss saying something mean or some person on the internet saying something snide or someone making a video just hating on you or some parents not approving of your current life path or somebody trying to discredit you for not being legit.
(30:45) does not matter. And to the third one, this is a really good one for gratitude is all considered the grandfather frame, which is basically you zoom all the way to the to the future. You're 85 years old. So, you're an old man, right? You've been, you know, you're in pain. Everything hurts. You don't have the energy you used to. You're slashing over and you're, you know, you're counting down your days.
(31:10) And then you imagine yourself waking up in whatever age body you have right now. and you turn to your, you know, your right or your left and you see your wife and you're like, "Man, she's so young. I couldn't can't believe she's so young right now." You look out the window and you're like, "Oh man, this is before they develop this whole area and we had all these highrises.
(31:28) " And then you like you get out of bed and you're like, "Oh man, like I'm not in pain, you know?" And you wake up and you're like, you know, I don't feel like foggy. I feel like my memory is sharp. I I'm like I'm acute. I know what I'm going to do. And you're like, "Wow, this is amazing." And the thing is is like nothing good has even happened yet because life just gets so much harder as you get older.
(31:45) You can imagine how like gratitude comes from imagining a terrible thing and then removing that thing that was terrible. That is gratitude. Like how do you operationalize gratitude? Imagine something terrible and then remember that that terrible thing has not occurred. That's gratitude. People are like, "Oh man, I'm so grateful for my health.
(32:02) " How do you get grateful for your health? Imagine that you have cancer and you're about to die and then realize that you don't have cancer. And then you're like, "Wow, I'm grateful that I don't have cancer." But you have to put that thing in there. You have to imagine that terrible thing. You have to go all the way there. I'll tell you something that happened recently.
(32:13) Leila had a doctor's appointment for something. And I was I was corresponding with our EAS and I said, you know, how's everything going? And my EA responded, she has cancer. And I was like, okay, got it. This is reality now. Okay. like and then I and obviously I'm texting back like you know what kind what's going on like do I need to be there you know what's up and then she was like oh my god I'm so sorry I meant the person who was the front desk the reason they messed something up was because she had cancer not Ila and I was like got it and so what ended up
(32:53) happening um was that Ila ended up having you know something that she was dealing with and they figured out what it was so it wasn't good news but what had framed that bad news was that she was potentially on her deathbed. For me, I was just incredibly grateful that she didn't have cancer. And so, it just gave me this really wonderful reframe by accident of like it could be worse.
(33:14) You're not dead. The fact that you were alive is living proof that you can endure it. And the day that something kills you, you won't have to anymore. Your life every day exists as evidence that you can handle everything that has come your way.
(33:33) And I think that if you've ever had any need for evidence, let that be the greatest evidence of all. A while back, there was a guy who had like broke up with his girlfriend. His grandfather died and like I think somebody else in his family had two deaths in a breakup. And he's like, "How do I keep going?" And I was like, "You already are keeping going. Like you don't need any answer from me.
(33:52) Every day you are living proof from the fact that you have endured." When I need advice, I'll be real with you. like everybody here, you know, everybody who's listening to this like being vulnerable, right? You know, with other people is tough and and there's I think there's some reasonable reasons why. One is like you don't want to be a burden to somebody else. Number two is like you don't want to be that person who always just like emotionally dumps on others.
(34:09) Like that's not good. And at the same time, like if you're going through hard stuff, especially if it's related to other people, people don't forget the hard thing that you're dealing with with somebody else. And so you might end up getting out of that and forgiving the person or whatever, but the person you tell will always remember it.
(34:22) Then sometimes it's difficult. Like let's say you have an issue with your your spouse. Who do you tell, right? Do you want to tell your homies? I don't know. That feels a little bit of a breach of of kind of like the the marriage, you know, the marital covenant. You're not going to tell your employees, right? You don't want to tell your family because then they're going to start they're going to see your your your your husband or your your wife differently. So, who do you tell? Because you could tell a therapist, but maybe you don't want to do therapy because you don't like it. Who do you tell? Who do you get advice
(34:45) from? And so, I'll give you who I think about this. And you know, unfortunately, the more status you acrew, the more valuable dirt on you is. If you're going through a hard time, the more people will want to gain that information to use it to their own advantage. And so, it actually makes it even lonelier.
(35:05) I use Solomon frame as my way of getting the therapy that I think is helpful. The reason I call it Solomon is because there's a thing called the Solomon paradox, which is there's a human tendency to be better at offering wise advice to others than it is to apply that same wisdom to our own situation, our own lives. They call it the Solomon paradox because Solomon was this big wise guy, but he actually his life was a bit of a mess.
(35:30) It's almost like Merlin could see the future for everyone except for himself. The way that I use this is I think I want to imagine talking to my 85-year-old incredibly wise self or at least wiser than I am now. And I ask him what he thinks I should do. And what's weird is it takes you out of your current frame and puts you in this other frame and you become more objective about your current situation.
(35:54) I actually had a a conversation with a business owner who was out here in Vegas at one of our advisory practice events and she said, "I've got all these businesses, not really sure what I should do, blah blah blah." And she happened to have like a business academy as one of her businesses. And I said, "Let me reverse the tables on you." I said, "Let me pretend to be a business owner and I'm going to say back to you everything you just said.
(36:12) What do you think you should do?" She was like, "Well, yeah. I mean, it's obvious when you think about it like that." And I'm like, "Right, it's obvious." It's only difficult for us because our judgment is clouded by our emotions because we have emotional context. We have emotional ties to the people or the situations or the investments. You can be like more logical decision-making is a good thing.
(36:31) By pulling out and thinking about your 85-year-old self, you're able to be less emotional about the current situation without sacrificing any kind of confidentiality because it's still you talking to you. You don't have to waste any time giving context or and let's be real, if you know how to persuade people, you can jade your data that you give to somebody else so that they give you the answer that you want rather than giving them the whole picture which you might be embarrassed to share. In my opinion, this framework of having these conversations and to be fair, I don't do
(37:00) it all the time. I do it when I need it. If I'm like, man, I got to work through this. I just have this little chat that I open up and I just start writing through like a a DM to me in the future. And I literally just sp, you know, enter space. Enter space. Um, that includes me mocking my younger self, uh, which I do frequently, or at least my 85-year-old self does.
(37:19) In my opinion, it has been more helpful than therapy because you have all the context. This has helped me make significantly better choices when I feel like I have emotionality that could be affecting me. to do a call back to the clean and dark energy thing. There is a lot of judgment online about how people choose to work, what fuels them, which fundamentally is it reward or punishment.
(37:45) Are they are they going away from an aversive stimulus towards, you know, a positive one? The answer in my opinion doesn't matter. And what I mean by that is I think the first rule of all entrepreneurship is use what you have because that's not going to change today. You have what you have. Those are the only resources you have available to you. You must become more resourceful. And that means that if you have shame and people tell you shame is bad, in what world could shame be good? If the shame you have creates this amazingly positive thing in your life, was it bad? If your dad not hugging you
(38:19) enough created the catalyst for you to go to the gym and live 20 years longer because you work out regularly, was it bad? Do we need to label it at all? All we know is that it happened and so what? There are these actions that increase the likelihood that you get what you want.
(38:37) Whether you do them because you had some negative thing or because you're going towards some positive thing, I think for the vast majority of people is narrative. They only they create the story. If I said, "Hey, why did you do this thing? We are trained to give an answer, but that answer may have zero grounding in the truth. Not because you lie, but because you have no idea.
(38:55) Because most people don't know why they do what they do. They just do it and then they ascribe a reason afterwards. We know that it's mostly BS and you're not going to have a double blind controlled placebo study on your life to be able to determine what the true root cause of.
(39:14) Was this the dependent variable? If you're not going to be able to do that anyways, who cares? Use whatever you've got to get whatever you want. give you a behavioral, you know, thing for this is like you might be going through something difficult or a hard season or a bad day or a bad moment, right? And I've heard this saying and it drives me absolutely bananas, which is that bad things come in threes.
(39:30) Anyone heard this before, right? I so wholeheartedly disagree, but I will explain why I believe that saying is a saying. Bad things do not come in threes. Bad things occur. People do not know how to cope. They allow one bad thing to snowball into more bad things. And bad stuff sucks. And the only thing worse than letting one bad thing be a bad thing is to let one bad thing ruin many good things.
(39:49) If you think about a bad thing as a cancer, it's like, well, we want to isolate that cancer as fast as possible and not let that cancer of you losing your job affect your marriage and then let you affecting your marriage affect how you're, you know, a parent and let you know how you're a parent affect how you were going to pursue this new endeavor.
(40:05) People just basically give themselves an excuse for misbehaving. I had a bad day. Therefore, I now have a legitimate excuse for being a bad husband or not being nice to my wife. They use it as an excuse to not exercise self-control. And that is when things snowball. This is why resilience is so important.
(40:22) Can something bad happen and I recover before I talk to somebody else. When things get bad, it looks like this. Something bad happens, something else bad happens, something else bad happens. And it keeps going down until eventually everyone in your life that is good has removed themselves. and then you slowly recover or you don't recover at all.
(40:40) And you've seen these people, he lost his job, he gained weight, and man, he's just never been the same. Pull your head out of your ass. There's this Buddhist parable. I've been um actually looking a lot more into Buddhism lately, weirdly enough. The Buddha asked one of his students, "If a person is struck by an arrow, is it painful?" The student nods yes.
(40:58) Then the Buddha asks, "If a person is struck by a second arrow, is that even more painful?" The student nods again. He's like, "Yeah, it is." Then Buddha explains in life we cannot always control the first arrow. However, the second arrow is our reaction to the first. The second arrow is optional.
(41:18) A lot of suffering that we incur like Mark Twain right said earlier like is optional. It mostly happens in our own mind to things that never actually occur in reality. A useful frame has been like if it has not occurred yet I will not worry about it. I used to really obsess about planning out contingencies and I still sometimes have this tendency but if you're like I want to play out this I want to play this out.
(41:34) I want to play this out. I'll play this out all these different all these different scenarios in a negative frame. I'm not saying planning is bad, but I'm saying ruminating on negative, you know, potential futures can be negative. By the time something like that happens, number one, it will not happen in the way that I imagined. It almost never does. Number two, I will have different resources available to me at that time versus what I have today.
(41:51) The path will become immediately obvious and apparent to me when that occurs. And if we're really honest about it, most serious thinking doesn't require that much time. But worrying can take all day and all night. With all that being said, sometimes you have to give yourself a little bit of grace because in some seasons of life, maintaining is winning.
(42:08) Just not losing ground is the W. You're not having a bad year. You had a few bad days that you're thinking about for the rest of the year. This has been something that I've been really visiting a lot, which is like we think about our our, you know, our lives like this and say, "This was bad. All of this was bad.
(42:25) " But the thing is is that these types of labels only happen in the abstract when zoomed all the way out. And so the flip side is when we're making our judgments, we want to zoom in because when we look at this line, our days were like this. I might have had a bad moment or another bad moment. And so I can just say I had these two bad moments, but I had plenty of good times.
(42:44) And so by percentage, I had 85% good and I had 15% bad. So all in all, not a bad year. And the reason I think this is so important is I will I will start how I ended. I'll end how I started which is the single greatest skill that you can develop for whatever goal that you're trying to achieve in life is the ability to stay in a great mood in the absence of things to be in a great mood about. of the salt.

How To Progress Way Faster Than Anyone Else - YouTube

Transcript:
(00:00) If you feel like you're not making progress, this might be why. In my earlier part of my career, I read a ton of self-help books, everything I get my hands on. But I realized that my life didn't change. And so this video is about why that might be the case. And more importantly, what you can do about it.
(00:15) If you think about, you know, climbing a mountain, a lot of people think that there's like what is the perfect path up the mountain. But in my experience, there's usually multiple paths up the mountain that you can take. But none of the paths will work if you're constantly trying to jump from path to path. Because in the real world, one path might be direct and might be steeper.
(00:36) Another path might have more loops. Now, you might see the other path and think, "Man, that one's not as steep." But we don't see about the path until you get on it. Is that, oh man, this one's actually going to take me way longer to get up the mountain. And so, most of the time, we need perfect conviction about our plan more than we need a perfect plan.
(00:53) And so, think of the paths up the mountain as your strategy. Like the mission is getting to the top. That's what we want to do. But the strategy is how we're going to prioritize our resources to getting there. Right? And so your ability to execute on the path, walk the path, stick to the path is ultimately the thing that's going to predicate your success far more than the path itself, provided it's sensible.
(01:12) And what I found in my experience is that most people actually have a pretty decent idea what to do. I'll give you a different analogy. So if I said, "Hey, you need to get in shape." If you know nothing about getting in shape, you still probably have an idea that you should probably stop eating crap and you should start moving more.
(01:26) And if you're trying to gain muscle, you should probably like lift weights. And if you want to get bigger, you should probably make those weights or those reps go up. These are probably things you'd be like, I kind of already knew that. But the thing is is that people don't do that. And so the issue usually is like, I want to have this perfect plan.
(01:41) But like, if you just did only that for the next 3 years, you'd probably be way better off than the vast majority of people. And so this was a big realization that I had, which is I had this this overanalysis of like what is the perfect plan? And I call it the fallacy of the perfect pick, which is that we wait and we wait to try and find the perfect p.
(01:57) The thing is is that this is a $5 million year business owner. So this is has nothing to do with where you're at. This happens at all levels, right? The mountain just gets bigger. But it's the same concept. And so for me, there was a period in my life before I started making, you know, a more money um where I had nine different businesses.
(02:14) All right? And I had nine businesses that I was CEO of and I wasn't making any money. And we were making revenue, but because I was so spread thin thing, I couldn't focus on any of them enough. And so all I could do is just barely keep my head above water. I had, you know, a dental agency, I had a chiropractic agency. I had my launch business where I was flying out.
(02:29) So I was in different cities every week doing these launches. And then I also had six locations of gyms that were running too. So I was so spread, I was stressed out of my mind. And so most people can't execute. And so what I would think at that moment in time like now looking back it's obvious and maybe you hearing it's obvious but for some reason it's kind of like the Yiddish seg where your nose is an inch above your mouth but need somebody else to tell you your breath breath smells bad.
(02:53) I think it's the same thing with this which is that at the time if you if I had asked younger me what do you think the problem is? I'd be like I think I need to change my strategy up. I think I need to change all these things up. When the reality is that most times you don't need to change that much at all.
(03:04) You need to actually just do the one thing really well. And so it's not about coming up with the plan or doing the plan. It's sticking with the plan, right? You can beat most people at anything if you just stick with it for a year. If you're willing to suck at something for a 100 days in a row, then you can beat most people at most things.
(03:23) The bar for excellence has never been so low. And so most of your competition quits after the first sign of difficulty, the first impass on the mountain where they don't immediately get it because they've never known what hard feels like. And so you having to figure something out, the unknown is the hard part.
(03:41) The figuring it out is the hard part. And so people think that, oh, I should switch paths because I understand the path of getting to here. So you might get this far up the mountain and you might be on this path and think, oh, I could do this path or this path or this path. The thing is, usually you have to go back down and then you got to go over and you got to go up again, right? So it's actually a lot longer to keep switching paths.
(03:59) But we don't think that because this path we can see. We already walk down here. We already see the bottom of the mountain. We can see the path to here. But then from here, we get stuck again. And so we keep, you know, releveling up and going from, you know, level one to level two, level three really quickly because we've beaten those bosses before.
(04:14) But then you get to level four again and you're stuck. And so you have to grit through that period where you don't know what you're doing. And this took me so long to understand like the not knowing part is the part that's hard and that is where people give up. It's not usually the the like, oh, I just need to work harder.
(04:29) Sure, there's some people who are weak and they just lose there, but most of the times when I talk to business owners, that's not actually where they lose. is because they don't know what to do and so they think, "Oh, I'll change my strategy rather than figuring out what to do is the strategy." And so most strategies do work.
(04:43) So I want to hit on this a little harder. One of the misconceptions about business is that there's this one secret thing, right? There's usually lots of ways to win. There's a few ways to skin a cat, right? If you have a dull knife, on the other hand, you're never going to be able to skin the cat. And the sharpness of your knife is your ability to execute whatever path you have, right? Whatever way of skinning cat, which is actually pretty visceral.
(05:03) and nasty like who's actually skinning cats should probably retire that saying I mean think about a skinned cat it's a little tough anyways when I was talking back to the business owner I said okay so if execution is the issue what's the that's the okay that's the surface level problem you're not doing what you know you should do the underneath of that is why is this not happening and so I see this as a combination of two different things and so one is culture and the other is talent so I'm going to explain both in a more operationalized manner so
(05:27) it's not just these buzzwords all right so what is culture so culture is the rules of reinforcement in a business. Okay. So, what are the things that govern what gets rewarded and what gets punished? And so, if you think about culture, there's probably a hundred or thousand behaviors that exist within any business or any environment, right? When we learn a culture as a society, there are things that we do. You hold a door.
(05:47) That's one thing that you do and it gets rewarded and if you don't do it, it gets punished, right? If you cut somebody off in traffic, it gets punished, right? And so, each of these things are things that get rewarded or punished. And that's what creates culture. But within every business, there's kind of a subculture within the larger culture where you have more and more nuance of things that are your preferences as a business owner.
(06:04) But if people are not working to your preferences, then it means the culture you have, the rules that govern reinforcement are not being adequately exercised. And the way that you reinforce culture is one, who you hire and who you fire. So who you allow to exist in the business tells more to your team about what you think is acceptable.
(06:28) Number two is the behavior that you do not allow to change. So if someone does something good and you don't reward it, then they learn that they don't get rewarded for doing that thing. On the flip side, if someone shows up 5 minutes late to a meeting and no one says anything, then you teach everyone it's okay to be late. And so the first issue with his business was that there's probably a culture of non-performance.
(06:49) And we have to get very specific with what makes somebody not perform. And sometimes it's only two or three behaviors. Often times it's like 20 or 30. And you have to be able to observe what are the things that makes me not like my team and what would I rather them do instead. And so I use the format of start, stop, keep.
(07:08) So what I want you to start doing that you're not doing, what I want you to stop doing that you are doing, and what do you need to keep doing that I'm going to keep reinforcing. It's a very simple way to give feedback that I really like. Now what about talent? Because that's the second half.
(07:20) This is one is the cult is the rules, right? The talent is the people who are actually doing the behaviors, doing the stuff. And so from a talent perspective, a lot of businesses can't expand anymore, not because they uh don't have the model to do it, but they don't have the ability to execute on the plan. And the ability to execute on the plan comes down to the quality of the people that you have in the business.
(07:40) And I can tell you this firsthand, you probably don't have high enough bar for who should be working for you. And I say this for myself, too. the moment I increase the quality of the people who work with me, the more money I make, right? And so what's really interesting is that I think that this is one of the greatest arbitrage opportunities that exists in business to this day still, which is that the 50% mark for a role is $75,000 a year.
(08:02) Now, for you to pay 90th percentile, it might be $115,000 per year. Right now, you might be like, "Wow, that's a big difference." But here's the thing is that this person is probably like five times more effective than this one, but they only cost 30% more. That's a great deal. That's a good investment. And so, at this point, all I really try and do is just find rain makers.
(08:23) I want people who are exceptional, who are obsessed with this task. Now, how do you differentiate the people who are good versus not? I'll give you a tactic around this. So, when you're interviewing, I like to know what someone's doing in their off time. And if what they do in their off time is not what I want them to do in their full-time, then they're not going to be full-time, right? They're going to be always moonlighting to their other thing.
(08:41) And so, I'd rather say like, what are you obsessed with? And I like asking that question. What are what are your extracurricular activities? Now, if they're like, "Honestly, all I do, let's say I'm hiring a videographer. They're like,"All I do is video stuff. Like, this is what I'm really passionate about. This is what I spend my time watching on YouTube is like, "How do I improve the lighting? How do I improve the audio? How do I improve the sets? Like, this is the stuff that I like really obsessed about.
(08:59) " I probably know that that person's going to do a pretty good job because also, if I tell them, "Hey, you need to improve this stuff." They're like, "Great. I love this feedback. I want to get better." Now, if somebody's like, "Oh, I love, you know, uh, pickle ball and using, you know, and working out.
(09:10) " There's nothing wrong with that. It's just that is that the thing that you're obsessed with? And so asking that question in a couple ways in an interview will tease out whether someone is spending their discretionary, effort, and time on the talent or the skill that they need to win in their role in the business.
(09:26) And so that's on the pick side, right? The third element of this, uh, here we go, is training. So if you have rules that govern reinforcement in the business, okay, this is what we like, this is what we don't like, and then you get really good people in, you still can have people who have potential versus actual.
(09:41) And so obviously the higher up in the business, the more you're hiring for actual, the less you're hiring for potential. The lower someone is in the business, the more you're hiring for potential and less for actual. And so when we're picking somebody, it's like I'll pick somebody who's just generally intelligent and has work ethic over somebody who might be more experienced in the career but doesn't demonstrate the same level of intelligence because I think the smart person will be able to catch up to that dumber person really quickly and then
(10:02) pass them. And so what does training look like? And so training in the business in order to execute, I'm going to be really clear here. The reason that your plan isn't working is because no one's doing the plan. So why aren't they doing the plan? These are the reasons, right? And so from a training perspective, it typically comes down to observing the details.
(10:19) I'm going to give you a story about this. So I was meeting with a different business which is a solar sales company that was doing, you know, multiple figures, which is great, goodiz business. And the founder was telling me that they were struggling to develop a sales leadership within the business. And he said they did an off-site and they came up with like their six pillars of sales leadership.
(10:34) And it was like accountability, time management, blah blah blah blah, right? They had like six things. I don't remember where they were. And he said after the two-day, you know, two-day event where everyone came together and agreed on those principles, they went back and no one changed their behavior. And I said, "Okay, well, what does accountability mean in terms of behavior? What is like, show me what someone who's holding someone accountable does? How would I know that accountability had occurred?" Right? And
(10:57) so what happens there's he was like wait so I need to be like oh you need to text your team every morning and you have to do end of week reports with every person review and you need to at the end of the day give kudos to the people who did well and then ask the people who didn't do well what they were struggling with and then drill them on how to improve that skill.
(11:20) He's like oh I was like right say that. Don't say accountability. No one knows what it means. We have to translate these big words into smaller actions that we want someone to make. And then it's very easy to say, "Hey, you didn't do these four things rather than," you didn't hold someone accountable because they're like, "I don't know.
(11:36) I thought I was holding him accountable." Because we both have different definitions for the same thing. And if this sounds more nuanced, guess what? Welcome to business. Right? These are skills that you just need to develop at some point because changing strategy forever over and over again is never going to get you up the mountain.
(11:51) All you're going to do is keep going down from this one over to this one and then maybe you get to here and then you change over and then you go over to here. And so each time you're wasting all of the extra effort keeping switching paths rather than saying, "Oh, the issue I have is talent, which means I need to recruit better.
(12:05) Oh, the issue is culture, which means that I have to show my leaders how to punish and reward behavior in the business. Oh, we're getting people in, but they're not being productive. So, we need to improve our training rather than just say, "Oh, everyone sucks." Right? And so a lot of success comes to sticking with something long enough to make the number of mistakes required to actually figure it out.
(12:25) Otherwise, you just keep starting from zero every single month. And you can beat 99% of people without being smarter or luckier, but by being willing to endure pain and uncertainty for longer. That's the path up the mountain. Hey guys, real quick. If you want to have a blueprint of how to get up the mountain, um this is the free 100 million scaling road map, the zillion dollar scaling road map.
(12:45) Um, this is something that was actually an internal tool that we made for ourselves so we could better identify at every level of scaling what a company would probably have to work on in order to get to the next level. And then we just decided to make it free. And so if you want this, you go to acquisition.
(12:59) com/roadmap and you can enter business information and grab it. And if you like my team to give you personalized tactics that on the next page, you can book a call. We'll get to know you, get to know the business, and ultimately invite you out if it makes sense. And at that point, we'd actually meet with you in person and say, "Hey, these are the things that we think are going to be the unlocks for your business right now.
(13:19) These are the things that can help pay down the uncertainty on the path you're already on." So, hey, just look around the edge, you know, just here's a drill bit so you can get through the rock, right? Rather than say, "Oh, we have to reinvent the business." Because most time we just need to do what we're doing a little better, a little different.
(13:33) And by doing that, it unlocks the path of the mountain so you can see it. So, click the link and uh maybe I'll see you here in

Transcript:
(00:00) Give me the next 30 minutes and I'll help you make the most of your 20s and your 30s. So, I made my first million when I was 26. A decade later, my portfolio companies generated last year over $250 million in aggregate revenue. And I'm 36 now. And so, in this video, I'm going to give you the real world advice that I wish someone had told me much earlier.
(00:17) So, number one is you want to take asymmetric bets. If you're under 30, you have no reason not to go 100% allin on your goals. The downside is nothing and the upside is everything. If you think about life as giving you kind of lottery tickets, right? You can scratch off a ticket and if you don't win, then what did you lose? The scratchoff ticket.
(00:43) But the thing is is that when you have nothing to lose, you have nothing to lose and you only have things to gain. And so the objective when you have as little as you can is to take as many shots as possible because your downside is zero, right? And so it's the only time in your career where you can take more shots than anyone else.
(01:01) And so the reason or the fact that people don't take shots and myself included when I was younger, I was so afraid to take a shot. But the only reason that was holding me back was the belief that other people who I don't even talk to anymore would somehow judge me as a quote failure. You never actually start from scratch ever again because every time after the first time you start from scratch, you start with an experience.
(01:20) So you still always net a positive. And so that's the beautiful thing about taking shots is that you either get the big win or more likely you learn something and then that learning compounds. And so the thing is is that I had a misunderstanding of how success worked which is that it's far more stacking many things on top of each other than it is nothing nothing and then something works.
(01:47) Right? And so if you imagine success like a bridge, right? So you're over here and you've got this chasm that you have to get across. Right? This is, you know, let's say there's alligators here and lava and all sorts of stuff, right? And then there's you over here who's got, you know, your big smiley face and you're happy and you're doing all the stuff you want.
(02:03) The thing is is that I thought that I just kept wanting to jump over this gap over and over again and think like if I just jumped hard enough or if I had the right opportunity, that's what would do it. But more likely than not, it's really like you install these these bricks on the path and you keep you keep walking and it's like, okay, well, I fall here. Okay, well, I'll fix this one later.
(02:21) And then you take a and then you you start again and then you fall here and then you fix this and you keep going and you fall here and then you fix this and then all of a sudden you make it all the way across. And that's what it looks like or what the experience of kind of becoming the overnight success is and that's why so many people talk about it where uh it doesn't happen at all and then it happens all at once.
(02:38) It's not that it happens all at once. The actual outcome of getting a system to work all the way through that is binary, but the process of building the system is actually very linear. I'm also not saying this from a position of um like even though I I you know I saw some success early in my career, I also started pretty early.
(02:55) And so I had nine failed businesses, nine before I had one that really worked. And so I bring this up to say that like I don't know what failure you're on right now. Maybe you're on zero failures, you're on one failure or two failures, but you have way more failures in you at the end of the day.
(03:15) Like one of the big realizations I had is that since life is an infinite game and what that means is that there are there are games where you have a defined time period and at the end you count the score, right? And then there's infinite games where the only point of the game is to keep playing the game. And so like the point of marriage is not to get married, it's to stay married. The point of health is not to get healthy, it's to stay healthy.
(03:33) And the point of business is not to get into business, but to stay in business. And so basically the only thing that you have to do to stay in business is to choose to continue to fight. And so once you realize that, then you realize that you become a success the moment you decide you are.
(03:51) Because being successful is far more about being in the game, about being in the arena. And so when you're in your 20s, what you lack in experience, you have to make up for in effort and hours. And believing otherwise leads to a life of honestly well-deserved mediocrity. So if you're hearing this, you're like, "Okay, I got it. I need to take more bets and I need to take maybe riskier bets because my downside is nothing. All right.
(04:10) Well, which bets do I take? So number two, don't follow your passion. So passion is vague and so it's very difficult to say I like this thing more than this thing. But what you can say is I'm better at this than that. And so passion usually then comes from competence, not creates competence.
(04:33) And so we usually like things that we get good at rather than getting good at things that we like, right? And so this is the thing like that I think confuses a lot of people. And so the other flip side of this is that enjoying something doesn't even guarantee that you're good at it or that you're going to be able to make money from it.
(04:43) And I remember my dad used to tell me when I was much younger, he said, "Listen, if I were following my passion, I'd be a bartender at a ski slope, right?" He said, "If you can just make money," he said, "The rest of your life, you can do whatever you want." And I actually think it was very practical advice for me. And I'm very grateful that I got that.
(04:54) But the thing is is that getting good at anything, you have to slog through this period where you're probably not going to be passionate about it because it's very boring. It's very monotonous. It's very repetitive. Right? It's it's one thing to say, "Oh, I like ping pong.
(05:06) " It's another thing to say like I hit 500 forehands and 500 backhands every morning and every night, right? It's a different level of dedication that you have to have to it. And that isn't going to be something you're passionate about. You might like playing the game, but getting good at the game are two very different things, right? And so it sets this false expectation that I think ultimately harms more people. And I think one of the biggest reasons of not following your passion is that your passions will change as you age.
(05:24) I promise you, the things that I was passionate about when I was 20 is not things I'm passionate about now. And I'm sure the things I'm passionate about when I'm in my mid and late 40s are going to be different than things I am now. Same as 50s and 60s.
(05:36) And so this idea that like I have to find this one thing, it puts a ton of pressure on that thing that it has to be perfect forever. And if it's not going to be perfect forever, then why don't we be practical now so that we can give ourselves options later. So fundamentally, all we're going to look for are things that you're good at that people already spend money on because that creates a very high likelihood outcome of you creating something that you can exchange in the marketplace.
(05:53) Once you've decided on something that you want to get better at. You're already good at it. You want to get better at it, which is hopefully, you know, maybe it is your passion, which be amazing, but a lot of times it's not. The next thing is you have to get good at one thing. Think about the equal opposite of this.
(06:06) How would I get someone to be poor? I would get them to keep starting new things rather than getting good at one thing. And so, do you remember that guy who got rich dropshipping, day trading, buying crypto, and wholesaling all at the same time? Yeah. Me neither. You have to focus.
(06:24) And it's arrogant to think that you could do multiple things at once and beat someone who does one thing with all their effort. You have to pick one thing and go allin and then you become the one who's hard to beat. So I told you earlier that I had nine failed businesses. Now here's the part that a lot of people don't know. Six of those I had at the same time. And so I like to tell people, oh yeah, I'm a CEO.
(06:41) I've got multiple companies, right? Like kind of the way I do now. But it's very different now because the thing is is that I actually have CEOs who run those businesses, right? Not me. because you can only be CEO of one thing. You can only drive one thing. Now, I drive acquisition.
(07:00) com, right? But CEOs of each of the divisions of each of the portfolio companies, like those are people who run their own profit and loss statements, and I didn't understand that. And so, I had a chiropractor agency, a dental agency, a gym launch business where we did turnarounds. I And then I also had five gyms of my own at the time. All right? Depending on how you want to describe it, I had five locations plus the three. So, I had eight. It's a lot. All right? It was too much.
(07:18) And because of that, I was stressed out of my mind. I was so spread thin and basically I had lots of things that generated revenue and I didn't make any money. The only thing that it fed was my ego, not my bank account. When did this big turnaround happen for me? Leila came into my life and she was like, "Hey, you're clearly really good at this one thing.
(07:34) Why don't we just cut everything else?" And that's exactly what I did. It was the hardest period of my life cuz I had to shut down all the other businesses but one, which also meant that I had to end partnerships with all these different other people that were relying on me. And that was hard. I'm not going to lie.
(07:46) Like it was not fun. Like these are people that I liked. But I had to make this decision. I had to cut off the life that I didn't want to have the life I wanted. If you want to impress people who are poor, talk about how many things you do. If you want to impress people who are rich, talk about how good you are at one thing.
(08:03) Like, at the end of the day, your ability to demonstrate excellence is going to be the only thing that someone who is ahead of you will look at. And so, you only fool the people who have no idea. And I'll be real, there's a lot of people who have no idea.
(08:21) So the thing is is that this is where the whole imposttor syndrome will start creeping up on you because you're like man I you know I kind of feel like a little bit of imposter because you are you're misrepresenting yourself. You know you're not as successful as you pretend to be. And so if you want to eliminate imposter syndrome just stop lying. When I say lying people like I don't lie. If you present something in a way that you know is going to be perceived differently than what reality is posturing in my opinion lying.
(08:40) You're misrepresenting. What you want to be able to do is state the facts and tell the truth. Period. And then if those facts and truth are not compelling and do not get you status, then change the facts and change the truth. Meaning not that you lie about them, but you work so hard that the truth is compelling. And sometimes that takes time.
(08:56) But I promise you, the people who are who are all in on the imposture stuff, the guys that I knew that are that were, you know, when I was in my 20s who were kind of like hustle bros, whatever, a lot of those guys faded, you know, and or they're still like jumping from thing to thing to thing, kind of like pretending to be successful, but like I know that they're barely able to afford their house.
(09:12) At the end of the day, it's a choice that you have to make. Do I want to pretend to be rich? Do I want to pretend to be successful? Do I want to look like I'm successful? Or do I want to be successful, which more likely is do the things that success requires, which today do not look like success. It looks like a very long string of failures.
(09:30) Because you will be rewarded far more in life for your determination than your intelligence. But the problem with determination is is that in the short term, it looks like a long string of failures until it works. Okay? So, you're like, "Got it. I'm going to focus." Now, let me give you something that's going to help you stay focused. Number four, stop networking.
(09:48) All right, now this is a really, really important point. Now, it's not that I even have some big problem with networking overall. That's actually not my point. It's more that there are there are seasons of life, right? In the beginning, you're in exploration. I grabbed this from Nval and I really love it.
(10:05) Later on, you get into exploitation, which is where you go allin, right? And so, the thing is is that in the beginning, you're tasting lots of stuff. you're trying to figure out what you are good at or have some proclivity towards. When you have that proclivity, then it becomes very clear now is the time to cut everything else so that we can focus and go deep.
(10:23) Right? So, you go broad in the beginning so that you can figure out what you to go deep on. The broad period that you're in is never the period where you're going to make money. Like this is the part you have to get. I'd say from the beginning of when I started until I really graduated from it was about 5 years. It's less of a binary, more of a continuum.
(10:39) In the beginning, you taste lots of stuff and then you just have to because in the beginning, you have to say yes to things. You have to say yes because you're so bad. You're so scared. You never want to say yes. But you learn to say yes a little bit and then you say yes more and then you say yes more. And then very quickly you learn to say yes and get overwhelmed. And so the only way out of this yes trap is you have to start practicing to say no. And if you're like, wait a second, that means that I have to change what I do.
(10:58) Welcome to entrepreneurship. Like you have to learn, you have to evolve, you have to grow. So let me give you a very tactical example. So, if you're debating between going to a networking event, right, or like a lunch with some dude who's like, "Hey, we should collaborate. We should synergize. We should maybe trade ideas.
(11:11) Let me pick your brain, whatever, right? And if you're picking between any of those things and working, choose the work because when the work works out, the people will still be there to take your call. But if you never do the work, no amount of networking will get the work done for you.
(11:28) " And the bonus or negative bonus here is that if you don't get the work done, they're not going to take your call in the future. And so they're willing to take the call today with whatever small amount of success that you have. But if you lose that success because you get distracted, they're not going to take the call in the future. That door will be open. I promise. And not only will that door be open, a hundred other doors will open for you if you win.
(11:46) During this season, losers congregate. Winners isolate. If everyone was supposed to win, they would have made podiums bigger. The top of the mountain isn't supposed to fit a lot of people. It's normal. The air is harder to breathe. And the thing is is if all of this seems antithetical or different than what you've heard or what other people around you are experiencing, ask yourself, is that do those people have the lives you want? A great way to make a mistake is to ask someone else's idea about your idea who has no idea. When
(12:14) you make this transition from going from the exploration period to the exploitation phase, you go from many looser connections to a very few tight ones. I tend to be very transactional as a person, but I think we all are and some people are just open about it.
(12:32) Everybody on some level does some sort of math in their head of like the person, this person in my life, I get more benefits than I have costs. But the thing is is that if you want to raise the standard of your life, you have to raise the standard of the people who you surround yourself with. Because the fastest way to change your life is to change who you're friends with. Because that reference group is ultimately going to be what you compare yourself to.
(12:50) And so if you change who you compare yourself to, all of a sudden you will create deprivation around the difference between where they're at and where you're at. The only way that people let you into circles that you don't deserve to be in is work ethic. There is no other way. It is the universal currency of respect across cultures, across time periods, across cohorts, across generations.
(13:08) An old man will respect a young man who hustles and they will always be willing to give time to somebody who they think will execute. Like this is that was my secret and it still is my secret. Like I I network with people who are above who you know I punch above my weight class in terms of the people that I'm connected with because they know that I'll do the work and so they don't feel like they're wasting their time by helping because the thing is a lot of people are actually very happy to help you.
(13:26) What they aren't happy to do is waste their time helping you when you actually don't help yourself. And so I've shed friends at every season of my life and my close circle has always been very small like very small. The thing is is that I think of my life in kind of seasons, right? And so you're going to have friends for this season and maybe you keep them for life but maybe you don't. And I think giving yourself permission to say like that was that season and they were amazing friends for the objectives that
(13:50) I had then and then my objectives change and it's not really fair to them to say hey I'm completely changing all the things that I'm doing. You have to still be friends with me. It might not make sense for them.
(14:03) And so not keeping this expectation over them has helped me kind of like free myself of that so that I can reinvest the time that I have in friends that I think will help me get to where I'm trying to go next. Okay. So, if we're taking these big bets and we're we're following something that we're good at rather than that we're passionate about and we're not going to get distracted and we're doubling down on one thing and we're turning off these other things that in the beginning we're exploring the the little lunches, the little networking because we know that if we just succeed at this one thing, all of those doors will be open. What do we do to make money? So, let me give you
(14:27) a money rule. Money loves speed. And this will relate back to the asymmetric bets. By the time you have all the information, the opportunity is gone. Sometimes you just have to make your bet.
(14:45) And it's almost always faster to make a decision, then make a mistake, and then correct that mistake than it is to painstakingly deliberate on the decision. If you know how long it would take you to fix something, if you're wrong, then just make your best bet because you can always fix it later. And so, said differently, if it takes you five minutes to decide and then 10 minutes to fix something, don't take two hours to decide because you could just do it and if you're right, you immediately are moving forward five minutes later. And if you're wrong, you're moving forward 15 minutes later.
(15:08) But either way, it's going to take you less time than trying to assume that you're going to know everything because you're just not. You have to get a grip with uncertainty. Like uncertainty is the job. Like, if you want certainty, don't try and go after your dreams. Because the thing is is that the only way to go after a certain dream is to go after an old dream.
(15:25) And if you go after an old dream that's already happened, you're trying to fulfill something that will not happen again. And so, you're either going to do the work or you're going to sit around wishing you'd done the work. And one of the things that took me a very long time to to understand was that the things that dragged me down were not the things that I thought they were. Because the heaviest things in life aren't iron or gold, but they are unmade decisions.
(15:43) They're the things that weigh us down. They take up all of our attention, all of our brain power. And so, right now, there's probably a handful of decisions that you know you need to make that you're just not. If you want to feel yourself go so much faster than you ever have, just decide.
(15:59) So few decisions in life actually are irreversible. Even the ones that people pretend are irreversible. What if I should I buy this car? Should I buy this car? You could buy it and then flip it. It's not like you can't sell it again, right? And so the real cost of the decision is the delta between what I could buy for what I could sell it for. Okay.
(16:16) Well, how much does it cost me waiting 6 months to do this? Probably a lot. And if I need that car to to, you know, or a truck so that I can like go to job sites or pick up clients or whatever it is, then like I am losing all of the time that I'm waiting to decide. And I'm telling you where people slow down is at the decision process more than at the doing process.
(16:35) Doing usually takes very little time. It's the deciding that people that bogs people down in quagmire, right? They just get stuck. They they feel like they're trudging through mud because they just hit these walls and all of a sudden there's no action because they're just thinking. They're planning. And I think I had to get comfortable with the idea that there's so many variables that I do not know.
(16:52) That I actually have to get comfortable with the idea that I just should test and learn and I'll learn way faster than if I try and deliberate. And that has happened more times in my life than not. I would say that approach has served me with bigger and bigger decisions in life. Like I have I've made monster mistakes.
(17:10) But the bigger mistake that I would have made is just not being able to make decisions to begin with. And so you can move through life at seven times the rate of other people by simply changing when you say you're going to make a decision from the end of the week to the end of the day. And if you want to move even faster than that, you can decide at the end of the hour. And if you move faster than that, guess what you could do? Decide now.
(17:27) And so sometimes like my team has seen me do this. Well, we're like, "Okay, so um you know, we've got to we got to make this decision." And people are always like, "Yeah, let's kick that to next, you know, meeting or let's let's circle back. Let's let's go offline for that." It's like, "No, let's confront. Let's just choose.
(17:43) Let's pick which vendor are we going with? Which website design do we like? What headline are we going to use? What's the ad hook that we're going to go with? Just pick. That's why all of this stuff comes down to bets. If you want to have a future that you want, you have to get comfortable with risk. So, if money loves speed, where are some of the money potholes? So, number six, pay off your debt.
(18:01) Now, I'm going to hit you with something you probably haven't thought of before, which is there are many kinds of debt. There's obviously financial debt, but the biggest and most expensive debt is ignorance debt. It's the cost of what you do not know but should. And to be clear, I still pay off ignorance debt every day.
(18:21) It's the debt in skills and knowledge that I should know to get faster and further to where I'm trying to go, but I don't. And so, I have to just fail until I get this knowledge. But the thing is is that if I don't fail, I will never get it. I am willing to pay in looking bad, in money lost, in time lost, in people judging me to make bets. And so I like this perspective on experts, which is that an expert is just somebody who's made all the mistakes you can make in a very narrow field.
(18:45) You have to learn how to lose before you can learn how to win. And the first rule of losing is that you didn't lose, you just learned. You paid down the most expensive debt. So then the question is, if you know that you have to pay this debt off, why aren't you? And I think it's because you don't realize how expensive not paying it off really is.
(19:04) And so know the price of inaction. Do you think that the reason that you're in the situation you're in right now is because you struggled to decide in the past that you've gotten all the way up to the edge, you've gotten all the way up to the precipice, all the way to the front of the line, and then you choose not to.
(19:16) And so the question is, how many times have you run that cycle? How many times have you thought through this decision and then not done something about it? And is the life you have you want as a result of those actions? Because maybe the best thing you can possibly do is maybe see this and then just choose to make that call because not making that call has gotten you where you're at.
(19:34) If you genuinely believe that you're going to do this sooner or later, right, make this bet, make this call, whatever, sooner or later, then you might as well do it sooner so you can start enjoying the benefits now cuz you're going to enjoy the benefits either way. But why would you want to delay the benefits of taking action? The real real is because you want to delay the costs of potential failure.
(19:52) Let's say you have a reason why you haven't taken action, whatever that is, right? Just imagine in your mind like it's some visual thing. Realistically, it's probably one or two voices in your head. And it you can probably think about whose voice that is. And it might not be yours. And so, who is the person that you're choosing to not live your entire life for? Whose judgment do you care that much about? And so, I will tell you the story.
(20:19) I almost didn't sell Gym Launch because I thought that $46 million was not enough to impress a specific colleague of mine. Real talk. I was very, very hesitant to sell the company. And the main reason is because I thought that they would think that that wasn't that that impressive. And when I thought about that, I was like, "Wow." I was like, "And this is this wasn't family. This wasn't friends.
(20:37) This was just kind of a colleague that I respected." When I was able to really listen to the voice, whose voice does this belong to? And what are they saying? And most importantly, is that the person who I want to give control over my entire life? And once I saw that, I was like, "Well, that's ridiculous. I don't care about this." They're usually subconscious.
(20:55) Like you don't notice them unless you listen for the voice, unless you name the voice. Am I really going to let John be the reason that I don't get married to this girl? Is Joe really going to be the reason that I don't raise my prices? Is Sarah really the reason why I'm not going to sell this thing? Ridiculous. But people do it, myself included, every day.
(21:12) And look, this isn't going to be easy, right? Building these skills, losing friends, taking bets, taking losses, you might find yourself stuck and then blaming your previous experiences. Which is why number eight, get over yourself. Everyone's childhood was difficult. Get over it. And if you want to win the award for hardest childhood, congratulations. I'll give it to you. You have the hardest childhood. You win.
(21:35) Feel better, right? No one cares about what happened to you then. Only what you can make happen now. And so the only person that's satisfied with whatever that reason is is you. And the everyone else calls that reason an excuse. And at the end of the day, do you want to get to your life and have everyone be like, you know what, he wasn't successful, but he had a lot of really good reasons.
(21:51) Wouldn't it be so much more powerful to say he had all these reasons he shouldn't have been successful but was anyways? Like those reasons actually give you even more fuel because you become a stronger story to everyone else. Like no one cares when the silver spoon kid succeeds really.
(22:09) And so all of the reasons that you can normally tell yourself of why you shouldn't do it are sometimes the best reasons of why you should. If you had disadvantages, I agree with you. Like you're right. It's harder to be successful if this thing happened to you or if you're born with X or you're in this gender or this race or you have this birth deformity or you speak a different language or you're born in a different country or you had abuse whatever.
(22:28) So the main point is despite the disadvantage, you only have one choice. What are you going to do? You can take action anyway and become proof to other people like you, your people who are also born into your situation, whether it was abuse, whether it was your gender, whether it was your your race, whe your country.
(22:45) And you can prove to them or prove to yourself that you can overcome it and that they can overcome it too. Or you can do what the vast majority of people do is that they protect their ego and blame and complain. And to be clear, this is not a pulpit. You can do whatever you want. I support your choice. Go you. But only one of those decisions is going to make you better.
(23:01) And likely only one of those decisions is going to get you closer to where you want to go. Because at the end of the day, here's the TLDDR. Losers define themselves by what has happened to them. Winners define themselves by what they can make happen despite what's happened to them. And so where some person sees an excuse, another person sees an origin story.
(23:17) Like you look at every every champion, every hero, every comic book, they all have hard pasts. And so you having a hard past, whatever that is for you or some disadvantage, just makes you like every other superhero who ends up, you know, changing their lives. And I actually love this. I heard this from Joe Rogan, so this is not mine.
(23:35) Every single one of us can today wake up like it's the first day of a video game. Like you just like got transported into this body and you're like, "Okay, look around. I have a wife. I have some kids. I have a job I hate. Or I have a business I don't like. Or I have some bet that I I have this thing inside of me that I I know I can do more, but I'm not. You have all this stuff that's around you.
(23:52) And now you can choose like everything else behind you. You can just have today be your spawn point. And so when you're in a video game, it's easy to just forsake all that stuff because you don't have this emotional connection to it. But the thing is is that like the action needs to be taken either way. So whatever frame of mind you need to be in in order to do it, then do that. All right.
(24:09) All right. So, once we have this head trash out of the way, then we have to get back to back to business, if you will. So, what's the next thing that we have to do? We have to solve bigger problems. If you want to make more money in your 20s and 30s, solve bigger problems, right? If you want to make a million dollars, you have to be willing to endure a million dollar worth of pain.
(24:28) If you want to make $10 million, you have to endure $10 million worth of pain. And here's the thing is that most people have never endured that. And so, when they start getting into it, the thing is is that the nature of the pain changes. And so in the beginning the pain is I don't know what I'm doing. Later the pain is people judging me and later the pain is lawsuits and a lot of the pain is just not knowing what the hell you're doing at whatever stage of business you're at because that never goes away. And so not knowing is a constant.
(24:53) So trying to solve for not knowing is silly because it's never going to happen. And so this is why you have to get comfortable with uncertainty. You have to make uncertainty your friend. If we're going to solve problems, right, we might as well pick big ones. And I'll give you a great a great analogy that I got from Stephen Schwarzman who's the founder of Blackstone.
(25:09) He said big goals and small goals are usually just about as hard. A common VC saying is that having a really successful restaurant, you might have to work 80 hours a week and manage all these different people to have a really successful local restaurant. And you might also have to manage all these people and do all this other stuff if you want to build a billion-dollar unicorn. Both those things are hard.
(25:27) And so if it's going to be hard regardless, you might as well go big. And actually it's been a very like that is a very helpful frame for me because one of the beliefs that I have about business and life is that suffering is a constant like I have to remind myself this on a regular basis which is that if we are growing I am in pain.
(25:46) If we are plateaued I am in pain and if we are declining I'm in pain which means that I am pretty much always in pain. And so to think that there's something wrong with pain misses the point of how this works. It is a constant and if it's a constant we don't even need to think about it. It shouldn't be a reason to do something or not do something because it's just always there.
(26:03) Competition for big goals, believe it or not, is actually much rarer. It's thinner air. People believe that it's so unrealistic that they don't shoot for it, which actually makes fewer people there to compete against. And so, it is probably harder in some ways to have a local restaurant that is really successful than it is to have a, you know, big business.
(26:20) And what I found is that most problems are solvable, which means that most things are knowable. And the reason that you probably haven't gotten to where you want to go is cuz you haven't actually started trying it. And so you're going to have to be obsessive about it. And I think one of the big things that I didn't understand was just how obsessive I was going to have to be.
(26:40) Is normal to not be like your other normal friends if you want to have extraordinary outcomes. If you think about the reverse, it wouldn't make sense if we do the same things as our normal friends and somehow get something different. It's a positive indicator. It's a green flag that you're living a different life than everyone around you. Like I had a conversation with my EAS this morning.
(26:58) They were like, "Man, I feel like if you were a normal person," that's what they said to me. They're like, "I feel like if you were a normal person, you would drive this kind of car." I like looked at them and I was like, "So basically, if I were not me, I would do things that not me would do. Right now, it would make sense that you're going to do things that normal people won't do because you're trying to not have the same outcome as them." 10. Obsession is the ticket of entry. It's the price of entry.
(27:22) And the thing is is that obsession isn't really obsession. It's actually just trying and no one else tries. Like that's the real real is that normal people call what I consider sane people to be obsessed. But sane people, which is what I consider myself, consider everyone else insane because they do nothing and waste their lives.
(27:47) And so we have to be comfortable with reasoning from first principles of like I am only going to live here for not that long and I'm only going to have a certain amount of hours to do the stuff that I want to do. Why on earth would I not do it because of some face noise that some person some other, you know, advanced ape is going to say to me about them having a preference about how I'm living my life.
(28:09) And so you can boil almost all insults or judgments down to this statement. And I think like I hear this, I translate it when I hear hate. You do not live your life in a way that I would prefer. So they're like, you know, you shouldn't. I do not live my life in a way that you would prefer.
(28:21) And that's okay because that's why you live a life that you prefer and not a life that I would prefer. And that's why you live your life and I live my life. And so people just get so triggered by this. So when people hate on you, it usually means that they're jealous and believe that you are undeserving of some part of your life. And so to be clear, it's not that they're jealous of your whole life. They might be jealous of the attention you get.
(28:40) They might be jealous of maybe just the money you make but not the way you look. Or they might be jealous of the the body you have, right? And they're going to be like, "Ah, you're chewing to that food, right?" Or, you know, "You work too much.
(28:52) " Or whatever the whatever the little snide remark is, right? But what they basically think is that life has unjustly given you the benefits that they believe they rightfully deserve. And they might be right, but life isn't fair. Here's the thing. People who obsess about work life balance are typically mediocre at both. And so obsessed people apply their obsession to everything and just call it life.
(29:10) And they also don't consider themselves obsessed. They just consider everyone else unobsessed and just plain and banal. And so I get criticized all the time for work life balance. People say like, Alex, you don't have any hobbies, right? I don't want any. I don't want any. They're basically saying yet again, you live your life in a way that I would not prefer. If I were in your position, I would live life differently. Right? And that's why you're not in my position.
(29:29) So why should I sacrifice the things that I prefer to do in order to do the things that I don't want to do? Right? just to make your definition of work life balance happy, which I don't accept. So, like work life balance is a wonderful goal. I have no hate for it. It's not going to happen if you want to be the best.
(29:46) Like, you've probably heard the, you know, work smart, not hard, right? That only works when you're competing against people who are not smart. If you compete against other smart people, the only thing you will have left is to work hard. If you work smart, not hard, you will get beaten by someone who works smart and hard. And if I don't know about you, I would rather be that person because at the end of the day, I would like to just win.
(30:04) And that is point 11, which is work hard and smart. If you extrapolate out what a normal life is like, right? Maybe someone makes, you know, a million dollars or $2 million over the span of their entire career, right? 40 years plus, I think there's just a certain amount of work that must be done to generate income.
(30:23) And so what I would rather do is just take that 40 years and just cram it into four and then have the other 36 years of my life to do whatever I want with resources far beyond what I would be able to do there. And so I remember Ila uh had this very early conversation with me because I think it was our first date. She said she's like I just want to help people right like that was her whole thing.
(30:41) And I was like do you think it'd be possible for you to help people and to make money? And she was like well yeah and I was like okay do you think you could help more people if you made more money? And she was like yeah. And in that conversation she shifted from being what I would consider a bleeding heart of just like doing everything like just trying to just just help every single person. But the thing is is you're li your resources are so limited.
(31:00) You can't do much. And so if you want to help a lot of people, it's like you got to learn the game. And the thing is to win that game, it's like you probably have to outwork people, a lot of people, and you have to be called names by people who live lives that you don't like. I want to be very clear about this. When I say work hard and smart, it doesn't mean it's going to be exciting.
(31:18) So 12 here is accept boredom. Like if you want to be creative, you must first learn to be bored. If you want to achieve a goal, you'll either have to accept boredom or pain. And the bigger the goal, the more of both you're going to get.
(31:36) I have this great visual in my head about how winning works, right? And so you imagine you have this this marathon, right, that you're running. So you've got this starting line here, right? Start. And then you've got this big race, right? And then you've got a finish line over here. Tada. Finish. Now, when you've seen a race, where do people gather? They gather here and they gather here. So here's the question.
(31:54) Where does the winning happen on your own? Because no one cheers for you not drinking for a day or not smoking, you know, on a lawn drive if you're trying to quit or not overeating for one night or skipping out on going to the club with the boys. No one cheers for that. No workout or meal is ever impressive on its own.
(32:13) And so the reason so few people understand success or at least achieve it in my opinion is that consistency never looks impressive in the moment only at the end. Because if you think about how consist like it's very difficult to visualize consistency because you can only see someone do something once, right? You see a snapshot of someone take a shot or hit a backhand.
(32:30) The only way that you can actually witness consistency is working with people who are consistent because the thing that you have to see is that person show up every single day. Like someone can show a workout of me working out and someone else might be like, "Okay, well I mean that's a workout. Maybe I should kind of work out like that." Sure, there's a level of intensity that might be there or form and things like that, whatever.
(32:48) But the thing that people won't see is it's very hard to witness 20 years because you have to be there for 20 years. And this is why I think so few people are able to internalize consistency, which is the most important success trait because it's very hard to lose if you show up every day. It's very hard and showing up every day is boring.
(33:06) And so, if we're willing to accept boredom, the next thing that we're going to have to be willing to accept is sacrifice. We have to give up some things to get others. And so like at the end of the day like all we have are trade-offs. We have what we have and what we want. And the question is what are the things that you currently have? Are you willing to trade for the things you want? And I think this such a perfect way of thinking about it. Like you have everything in your life right now that you're going to have to trade. Like everyone trades. Everyone starts even
(33:29) when you had at zero. You have things in your life and you have to trade those things for things that you currently want but don't have. There's no perfect way to live your 20s or your 30s, right? You either live them up and become an underskilled 30 or 40-year-old or you work them up and become an underlived 30 or 40-year-old.
(33:46) You just have to figure out which you'd rather be and accept the trade-offs and know that there are no doovers. And that's okay. And when we're really thinking about sacrifice right now, no human will ever get more than 24 hours per day. We all have that, right? And so fundamentally, everything that you spend your time on that is not you pursuing your goal, you are determining is more important than your goal.
(34:10) And so if you look at what you did every single one of these hours and then you actually surface it and say, you know what, watching Netflix, you know, doom scrolling Tik Tok and Instagram, hanging around, doing nothing, surfing the web or whatever it is that people do these days, that is what's actually more important to you based on your behavior.
(34:27) And so, is it really a sacrifice to give that up for what you want? Because the thing is is that a year from now, you're not going to look back on today and be like, man, I'm so glad like those clips that I watched really changed things for me. they you probably won't even remember any of the clips that you saw. They did a great research study on this where they did short form versus long form even and people remember like 11% like 24 hours later it was a tiny percentage.
(34:53) And so we have to accept that the things that we spending our time on most of the time is just wasting our time on. And so I think Senica said this, it's not that we don't have enough time, it's that we waste the time we have. I come back to this which is like is it really a sacrifice or are you finally just saying I believe this is my priority and therefore all of these things that are not helping me pursue that I'm now going to trade out for things that will help me get this priority. That's it.
(35:17) And to me if you like what you're going to get why would you not make the trade? And so I had this clip that went super viral from a podcast that I did yesterday. And the host asked me, "If all my books and all my tweets and all my emails and all my YouTube videos were all deleted and I had to compress all of my stuff uh into into 60 seconds, what would I say for somebody who's in their 20s and 30s?" This is what I said. Figure out what you want.
(35:39) Ignore the opinions of others and do so much volume that it would be unreasonable to not be successful.

How the top 1% make their money - YouTube

Transcript:
(00:00) the majority of millionaires are made in real estate the majority of billionaires are made in private equity and the point of this video is to walk you through the moneymaking process that they use to make tons and tons of money for themselves tons and tons of money for their investors and most importantly accelerate value in a business so let's walk through an example that everyone probably understands so if you were to buy a house and you wanted to use this as a real estate investment then you make money on this in two main ways one
(00:26) is that the value of the house goes up so let's say it's worth one million it becomes worth two million great we had appreciation the other is that you get checks for $1,000 a month from the tenants right but the point is is that you're going to get paid every month for some sort of production from a renter and the house is going go up in value now if you just did your own house then you're just not paying this or you're just paying the bank for your mortgage and what not and you're pretty much just going to make your money in appreciation
(00:48) there are some things that you can have appreciation that's just happens over time the other is kind of forced appreciation which is where you fix the stuff you clean the windows you add a kitchen you you know you do work right and then it increases the value of the thing because somebody else might be more likely to pay for it or buy it all right very very simple now the thing about real estate and why I think it makes so many millionaires it's a really simple business model like you buy the house you put a certain amount down you
(01:17) take a loan for the rest as long as you put a tenant in that can cover that now I'm obviously simplifying this but that's because that's the point I'm simplifying it for the point of a video plenty of people have lost their asses in real estate but because it is a reliable thing they're not making any more land and they do keep keep making more people over time as long as population growth continues uh real estate will be a really good investment okay now that is a big [ __ ] ass risk because of how population growth has
(01:39) been happening look at Japan's real estate market for example because their population has declined we take some of these things to be true we assume that humans are going to always have more humans but that's not always the case okay now our second example is let's say that we have a business so let's see if I can make a really simple business storefront all right we'll make that my little business storefront right that looks is that kind of business no all right there's my business if you don't like my drawing deal with it um so the
(02:06) interesting thing with private Equity is that there's more ways that you can make money number one is you can buy businesses with a much wider range like a house isn't going to go for sale for a dollar but businesses do sometimes get given away for free more or less and that's also because there's no debt a lot of times people buy houses they have debts that they have to pay back and that kind of fixes pretty hardcore where people's kind of bottom is they're like I'm not going to lose money on my house like fine I won't make money but you
(02:34) have to at least pay the bank back of course the market still dictates prices but I think there's still a strong line that people will hold in negotiations which slows down uh crashes in real estate whereas a business can go from being not valuable at all to 12 months later being worth hundreds of millions of dollars let's say it's a technology or let's say it's a patent that goes through or some sort of pharmaceutical thing that I'm giving you extreme examples because you're like wait a second how's this apply to my business
(02:59) well if you didn't have a way to reliably get customers and then all of a sudden you find a channel that reliably brings you customers that makes something that isn't valuable incredibly valuable right or you hire one key person in the business that expands a new territory for you makes something that was once a risk and the thing is is that a lot of times businesses accelerate in value kind of like the forced appreciation here when you build in a kitchen or you build in a a bathtub or something the forced appreciation in
(03:23) business sometimes takes a negative and then turns it into a positive and so what was once a risk then becomes a a pillar of value and so when you're thinking about accelerating value in business and this is what we do at acquisition. comom is that we think through what are all of the negatives what are all of the risks associated with this business and then if one by one we can flip the risks into pillars of value then we take we get we kind of get counted twice so instead of a negative discount on our value it becomes a pro uh and adds to
(03:54) the multiple and so this is kind of the big difference with private Equity versus the house right with a house you can't change the neighborhood right maybe the neighborhood can slowly change over time but you can't take it and then put it in Manhattan right it's just going to be where it's going to be you can fix a couple things so there's there's kind of an upside limit to real estate you're not going to get a 100x deal in real estate but you can get a 100x deal in private Equity all the time and that's why the people who amass
(04:19) fortunes the richest people in the world know how to reliably create 10x 50x type returns and at least in their careers especially the best ones have had multiple of these 20 X's 50 x's in big big bets and so let me walk you through how that would actually happen so let's say you've got a business that's doing three million bucks a year all right and let's say he's doing $1 million in profit this business is not going to be valuable like not that valuable all right so no Institutional Investor is going to want to buy this it's too small
(04:51) I mean it makes money maybe it requires the founder so there's keyman risk there's a bunch of other things but like fundamentally this isn't going to be a super attractive business now a retail investor meaning like some doctor or lawyer who's local might want to buy this business as a a retirement asset for themselves not knowing what the [ __ ] they're doing and then lose their asses so someone could give you money for it because they don't know what they're doing but it doesn't mean that it's actually worth anything it just means
(05:13) that you pulled one over on someone all right so the thing is is that a good private Equity investor realizes that this is not worth much to a potential acquire today but could become very valuable with a few small moves and so if all of a sudden this business starts doing let's say $12 million a year which would be a million doar a month and then it gets to somewhere in the neighborhood of call it $5 million in profit okay this is now a much much more valuable business and so here's this is the this is the magic this is how it works is
(05:46) that you could pick this up for almost zero dollars you wouldn't have to pay a lot to get a business that does a million dollars in profit depends who you are but fundamentally like you might have you might do some seller financing put some money a little bit of cash in just million dollars a year in profit you might put five 00 Grand down like as a show good faith but the thing is this thing is riddled with risk right a $3 million top bu business probably has I don't know 10 15 employees like not a lot of people and so it's it's not very
(06:10) reliable it's very volatile and so it just screams risk and so risk means fundamentally the multiple that you ascribe to a business's profits is a direct correlation to the risk you ascribe to the business so saying that in the opposite way is How likely you think it will continue to make money if if nothing happened and so if the owner leaves that's a material change to the business how long do I think this business will keep making money when this person leaves if I think it's absolutely guaranteed there's no way
(06:43) this business doesn't make money even after the the person leaves then he's going to get a high multiple in the business his his revenue and profit are very valuable because they're really secure on the other hand if it's like I think this could maybe burn down in 6 months then it might get a 0.5 multiple or just realistically a zero multip the business saying I'll just take it over for you I'll take it off your hands for you right now the thing is is that sometimes the difference between these things doesn't actually take a ton of
(07:10) work it takes some expertise but like not necessarily a lot of time and so if a company's doing these numbers it's like all right well we probably need to hire a CEO we need hire a COO probably need to have bring in some sort of director of marketing to run s of the some of the uh the datto day for it we probably need to you know update sales Ops uh in the business we'll probably update pricing because they're probably mispriced right and because we update pricing we can now spend more on marketing which gets us more sales right
(07:37) and we just we we run that little CIT and sometimes something like this can happen in like I don't know 12 to 24 months not not a very long time in terms of time periods but here's the crazy part here's the crazy part this business is basically worth nothing this business and let's say that it's moderately risky so it's not it's not like this is not a bank it's like they're probably not going to go out of business not even going to cover that but like 95% of Banks Banks are actually a very very stable business and they
(08:04) make a lot of money um there's way more restaurants go out of business than Banks I'll just put it that way all right but let's say that this business gets an 8X multiple and this would be a $40 million business okay so in what world do you know that you can go from something that cost you no money to 12 to 24 months later having something that's worth $40 million not many and so fundamental this Arbitrage that exists here because it doesn't take many steps or much time to create huge step UPS in value that is
(08:38) where private Equity investors make their money this is where business owners who know how to play the game get filthy rich and the thing is is that a lot of people are just very intimidated by this this word and these Concepts but this is all it comes down to is that 99% of transactions are going to be some sort of multiple when I when I say multiple of eida eida is just a fancy word for right now just call it profit but in the private it's earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization which is just the earnings before this
(09:10) is the part that matters earnings how much money you make before all this other stuff so if you made money and then you get taxed in different differently in different states would you say the business is worth more or less well I could incorporate a different state okay well then I want to know the earnings before the taxes right well I just bought this piece of equipment and like if I didn't buy the piece of equipment we'd have more profit cool well then I want the earnings before the depreciation that you're
(09:32) going to apply right that's that's the idea here okay and so there's that means that there's two big two big variables that we can influence with a business the multiple and the iida so basically if we can increase how much profit a company makes and how reliable that profit is and growing then we're going to get a higher multiple all right and so let's say we have two businesses all right we'll say two businesses business number one let's say they're both the same size let's say they're $10 million in Topline revenue and let's say
(10:19) we're they're $3 million in profit so let's say we have two identical businesses here this business is purely transactional meaning it's one-off transactions there there's no recurring Revenue there's no annual revenue retention it has one way of getting customers it has a Founder Who's integrally involved in delivery and marketing and operation so all three aspects of the business so running the day-to-day the running making sure the product's good and making sure we're getting more customers so one guy's involved in all of it and they're going
(10:47) down they used to do 20 million and six and now they're at 10 million and three all right so this is our $10 million business so is this growing no would you say that this is reliable in the future that it's going to continue to happen well the thing is is that this business is basically unsellable like it's not that it's worth nothing it's just that it's worth nothing to someone on the outside the thing is to the to the guy on the inside who's making $3 million a year there's value to the business there's just not value to anybody else
(11:16) and so that's the key here is that when you're thinking about building the business it's I want to make this valuable for anyone not just valuable for me so if you own a a barber shop and you make 200 Grand a year from your barber shop but you're involved in the DayDay there's nothing wrong with that I mean you're meant to work forment to work right but it's just that I haven't built it so that it can be worth $200,000 a year to somebody else if you can build it like that then now you own an asset that has intrinsic value to the
(11:39) marketplace now let's go through SE this other one so this one this guy's worth zero I don't know what that was there this is worth zero dollars unsellable to this guy so this one last year they did five million this year do 10 million and they're pacing 20 million for this this upcoming year they'll do three million this year but they'll probably do six million or seven million next year um it's all annual recurring Revenue we think that the margins are going to expand as they get B because they're going to have economies of scale
(12:06) um and so we've got profits going up we don't think the Market's going anywhere it looks reliable and it's growing well this thing might get a 12x multiple and so then this thing might be worth $36 million and so then you're like wait how can these two businesses with the same size and the same profit worth such dramatically different amounts because fundamentals of value creation how reliable is this money that I'm going to be making and how much of it is there so if you have a lot that's not reliable then you're going to get a small
(12:36) multiple and a big number if you have a small amount of profit but it's super reliable and it's growing then you're going to get a big multiple on a small number and if you got a ton of profit and it's super reliable and growing really fast then you're going to get a monster multiple like fundamentally that's it that's how it works so here's one of the other big things that people don't get with private Equity is that with a house you can't build a house from scratch I mean you can build a house from scratch but it's going to
(13:01) cost you money but a business you can start with nowadays almost nothing you can start selling your time and you start making some money you start paying other people all off cash flow in the business which the business can start for free and so you can have something that literally costs you Zer that becomes worth billions and there is no piece of real estate on Earth that you can build for Z doar and then it will someday be worth billions and so the reason that private Equity makes more money than real estate
(13:31) at the highest levels is because it requires more skill because there are more skills required in order to do it now to be fair this is in some ways just as strong as an advocate of real estate is that it's a simpler business model now people still lose money in real estate all the time just got to look at the forums people lose money all the time in in real estate when they get greedy but in terms of reliably giving people returns over years and years and years it has worked provided population continues to grow so if you are going to
(13:56) buy real estate try and buy it in areas where people are continuing to either move to or have more kids so fundamentally there's only three ways that you make money in a business or make a business more valuable number one is you increase the number of customers number two is you increase their value which I'll just say as LTV or lgp depending on how you say which is how much they pay you over time third is decreasing risk right which is increasing the reliability of the business over time and so whenever you're allocating money
(14:31) or time in your business it has to Circle up to this is going to get me more customers this is going to make them worth more or this is somehow going to decrease risk and if you can't very clearly State how you know it's going to get your customers how you know it's going to make them worth more how you know it's going to decrease risk then you have to ask yourself is this the best use of my time money and effort and this is where I think most people do this instead is that they then spend money on stuff that's worth nothing and
(14:55) that's why a lot of people don't get rich when they try to is that they don't know where value value gets created and so you either have to make more money or you have to make the reliability of that money more valuable and you make money by getting more customers making them worth more and then you decrease the risk associated with that in the future so you're like okay well I want I want to have that big amount of profit but I want a massive multiple associated with my business so let me just give you a couple of kind of like the big leager
(15:18) ways that people think about this ais.com is a family office that functions like a private Equity Firm and we look at lots of different businesses and one of the easiest ways that we have for companies to get into the portfolio is that we can meet you at one of our workshops and so we run workshops occasionally at our headquarters here in Vegas and so if that sounds interesting my team will be there we can give you a whole bunch of things that you can do to make your company more valuable and maybe someday become a portfolio company
(15:41) in the meantime you can go there acquisition. click scale and maybe we'll see you here so number one is how much debt your company that looks like pet doesn't it how much debt your business can carry and so that's going to be a function of cash flow all right and so if you have a lot of cash flow meaning that you could take distributions in huge amounts every month then it means that your business can support a lot of cash flow which means it can support a lot of debt so unlike you know with your first home there's like these fixed
(16:04) amounts that banks will say you have to put 20% down and if it's commercial real estate you have to put 35% down whatever it is right they're they're these fixed amounts that they say you have to put down in order to limit their risk but the thing is is that with businesses it's varied based on how much cash flow a business has right and so a business that has almost no cash flow like it's going to be able to take on almost no debt and one that has tons of cash flow can take on tons of debt right and a disproportionate amount the second thing
(16:28) is organic growth so this is the stuff that I teach on this channel right which is like Marketing sales pricing all these things that we do this is all considered organic growth inorganic growth is when you buy other companies in order to grow and you combine balance sheets all right but if you are growing as a business that's going to give you a bigger lever on your multiple meaning you're get you're GNA get more for it because if they know or they believe that you're going to consistently grow 20% a year no matter what for the next
(16:52) five years then they know that the business is going to double in five years so if they did nothing they're going to more than double their money because they're not going to buy 100% with cash they're going to buy it with debt so if you double a business and you put 20% down then you could fourx or five extra money on the business because of the leverage that debt gives you this is all why these multiple levers increase how much you get paid so the third one is categorization which appropriate for letter C here if you are
(17:17) a business that is categorized as let's say a traditional service business right but you're able to build some technology into your business that allows your staff to get 10 times more done or handled 10 times the customers then you have something that would be called Tech enabled service right or sometimes even a true SAS business and so Tech enabled Services have higher multiples than traditional services and SAS companies have higher multiples than Tech enabled services and so how you categorize the business if it's just moving one step
(17:50) over which is okay let's just look at our delivery let's just invest in a little p technology so that we can get categorized differently it might cost you a hundred grand to get some streamlined processes and Tech in place to help 5x 10x the delivery and if that's the case then you got a $100,000 investment that might give you three more turns on your multiple three more turns being like you go from a five multiple to an eight multiple and let's say you make a million dollars a year it's like well that had three million to
(18:16) your Enterprise value for a 100 Grand it's a 30X return so like this is how you have to start thinking about it within the business it's like oh this is totally worth it so should I take this $100,000 put in my pocket and then put in the S&P 500 well if you're a business owner you can put it right back into the business a way that you know you're going to get a good return on Capital so categorizing what type of business your business is really in next one is a size premiums this is one that a lot of people don't understand when you buy
(18:40) Wholesale in your real life if you buy one roll of toilet paper or you buy 20 rolls of toilet paper the 20 rolls of toilet paper are going to be cheaper because you bought bulk you bought wholesale right businesses are actually the opposite if you put a ton of profit together you get a size premium so a business that does a hundred million dollar a year in profit it's worth a hell of a lot more than a company that does $100,000 a year in profit and a big part of that believe it or not is that the people who have the most money in
(19:07) the world have so much money and this is very hard for like you to probably grasp if you're not familiar with this but like the people at the top black rock Blackstone you know like all the all the big guys all right State Street all that stuff they have so much money that they have minimum check sizes so I was talking to a friend of mine at um one of the banks I'll just put it that way and their minimum check size now is 150 million so not Enterprise Value that's just the minimum so if you have a $300 million company they have to buy at
(19:39) least half or they're not interested because they need to be able to write checks of 150 million or greater because they have so much money that they can't waste time writing checks smaller than that and so they pay a premium for operators to go in and gather a bunch of assets together so they can write one check I know this sounds insane but this is how people make gobs of money is understanding this other world all right and so this is why people are like man I've got you know keyman risk in my business I'm like dude you make a
(20:08) million dollars a year of course you have ke risk it's a tiny business like this isn't where you solve that we solve that when you're at once you get to an Institutional level which by the way is about five million in profit per year is where institutional investors like begin to really take notice of a business below that you're not really going to get much and at the five million Mark you might get somewhere in the neighborhood of like 20 to 40 somewhere in there but like if you cross 10 million it gives you a size premium you
(20:34) get a little bit more on the multiple so not only do you have a bigger amount of profit you also get more for that profit so it's like a double multiplier effect and this is why people talk about patience all the time it's like you could sell a day for 25 but maybe if you waited a year and got your five million to 8 million in profit and you shorted up a couple things you go from having a $25 million sale to a $75 million sale for one more year of work so $50 million of Enterprise Value 3x what you would have gotten paid for one more year of
(21:03) work and this is how that compounding unlocks these huge numbers in private Equity e is age so to further on my little uh my little speech there on uh on patience the age of the business also makes the business more valuable and so think about this way imagine there's a business that's one year old that's doing these numbers and then a business that's do it's 10 years old and doing these numbers well you'll probably feel more confident buying the 10-year-old business because you're like it's been around for 10 years like it's not going
(21:32) anywhere so the managing partner APG said this to me and I never forgot he said a business always becomes more valuable every single year until it doesn't and then it's worth nothing and it was such a profound statement which is basically like as long as you keep growing no matter how slowly or even even even maintain and the business dayss around the business is more valuable so $10 million business at year five then $10 million year six it's a little bit more valuable year six because it lived another year but the
(22:01) moment it goes down a little it's worth nothing because no one wants to touch it unless you have distressed asset experts and I'm not going to get into that all right and so when you're thinking about your business it's like okay I want to create lots of cash flow in my business I want to have lots of organic growth I want to grow I want to sell more I want to Market more I want to make sure that my price is good I want to get efficiencies within my organization so that can get categorized as a better type of business that has generally
(22:27) higher multiples I want to get it big enough that I get a size premium so that I get more for each dollar of profit in terms of Enterprise Value and I want to keep doing this for a long time and if I do all this stuff I can make generational wealth in a in a number of years and so no this is not the get rich in six weeks stuff this is like get rich next six six years is but the thing is that six years at least for me now is like not that long six years is not that long like you're still pretty much you're in the same decade that you're
(22:56) currently in right and so when I think about like that I'm like most people simply can't wait 6 months for anything and I was telling one of the one of the business owners here the other day about this is like the woman in the red dress I talk about it all the time because it's this it's been the hardest thing that I've struggled with in my entrepreneur all the things that's been the hardest and once you stick with something for five years you get it you're like oh I understand now now it's not just saying you had a business for
(23:24) five years because some of you guys I'm [ __ ] looking at you do six other things all the time and you have the one business that makes you money and you never paid all the attention you should be paying it to because you're always busy thinking about these other opportunity vehicles that could be better when in reality think about the logical extreme here one guy starts a new business or new side hustle every six months think about the other guy does one business for 50 straight years never does anything different who makes
(23:46) more money you already know let's say you're four years into your business okay and you say man I have this opportunity that I could be doing so much more money okay that's fine but for you to do that that means you're going to miss out on your five of your current business all right now what you're really missing out on is not only are you missing all of all of this right but the new business has to be able to do that year one now maybe the new business does half of that year one which is great but again now year two let's say
(24:21) you're you're a little higher there that's okay but this is what you're also missing out on the line that would have been off this [ __ ] graph right here is that this is the second year and this is the second year from when you made the decision and this is what people miss out on this is what people don't get this is why people stay poor is they can't stick with stuff because a mediocre opportunity executed to Infinity is going to do better than an inferior opportunity that you consistently switch to over and over
(24:48) again and so the reason that these things create more Enterprise Value is that most of these take time even in the recategorization would take work in time almost all of these take time and so if you just think about the logical exam of what your actions lead to you can reverse into the present of what actions will I get the most return for my effort and that is how you can create a lifetime of generational wealth and if this stuff about focus is hitting for you I made a whole talk on this at my headquarters here in Vegas to a group

Transcript:
(00:00) I just gave a guest lecture last week at University of Texas for a class on entrepreneurship there are some people here who don't try for one of the key questions that many of the aspiring entrepreneurs in the classroom asked is what should I sell first off we have to Define what are the actual things that can be sold and this may sound crazy but there's actually fewer of them than you think and there's digital and physical formats of each of these things which actually give you 14 different things you can possibly sell once I Define
(00:26) those I'll talk about how we can increase the scale of the deliverable that we have using something that I call the delivery Cube number one is you can sell products you could sell a physical product which would be like I sell water bottles a digital product would be something like a PDF the second category is services so this is stuff you do for other people in the Physical Realm a service would be a massage mowing someone's lawn fixing someone's car on the digital side oftentimes that service is something that happens in the digital
(00:55) space so if you are an ad agency and you make ads the ad itself that you're making as a service also buying media is a service all of those things would be Digital Services category three you have access Visual access is like you lease a building you gain access to the building digital access is you gain access to a library of digital content like Netflix category 4 is attention you can sell or buy physical attention that could be like a billboard cars physically drive past it and see it to the same degree Facebook and Google have digital
(01:29) attention and they sell the eyeballs and the attention of that audience Category 5 like the hurricane is risk selling insurance but you can insure a building but you can also insure against in the digital format a cyber threat if you're an established business owner and you sell physical products or even Services you can sell the risk associated with it which is like ensuring the product so some people give guarantees but you can actually get people to pay for a guarantee which is Insurance just like AppleCare is just paid for insurance the
(01:57) next thing you can buy or sell is money itself the entire banking industry is predicated on buying and selling money and the rate they charge is the interest itself and so you can have physical money right like the actual US Dollars you can also have digital money which I'm not going to get into crypto but that is a form of digital money category seven is an endorsement or brand in the physical world I say hey you can use my logo on your shirt and you give me a percentage of all your sales in the Digital World when they sell a check
(02:25) mark on Instagram that is selling an endorsement it's selling a brand it's selling some sort of status that gets transferred and a fee is paid as a result of that one of the key points here is that it can be a combination of those categories so if someone sells a rock concert for example you're selling access to an experience but you might also sell drinks and t-shirts while you're there now you might record it and then also sell the digital versions that see what I'm going with here in terms of picking which one to sell it's mostly
(02:52) going to come down to two things one is the resources you have and your skills value experience if you're a first-time entrepreneur then you're like well I don't have any other experience but you actually do and let me hear me out your parents did something and if you don't have parents the people who praise you did something and if no one raised you people you knew did something and you were around them so like for example my mom is a doctor she's an eye surgeon so I know a lot of stuff about eyes that would be a category of stuff that I
(03:19) actually know a lot more about than you might expect if your dad was a mechanic you probably know what a carburetor is I have no idea what it is I've heard the word before oftentimes you've had little odd jobs like when I was in high school I was a blender tenor and then I did catering at an Orthodox Jewish company you probably know a lot of stuff just from osmosis of being around it we have these seven things digital and physical is there any one of these that already have a little bit more experience with
(03:42) and then of those things which problem is the biggest that I think I can solve given the resources that I have access to what I was talking about with this entrepreneurship group is that they had a hundred dollars to start their business now that would probably preclude you from most physical products probably most kind of digital like software type stuff and so most of the time you're going to start selling your time which is often Services here's the person I provide the most value to for the least I'm amount of money to me
(04:08) that's where your sweet spot is as the first or next thing that I would probably package and sell once you've established that how can I enhance or make it more or less valuable or more or less profitable for me as a business owner the delivery Cube has six pieces to it that's eight six number one is can I deliver this thing one to one in a small group can I deliver it one to many each of these have different value propositions that are associated with them if you sold semi-private group stuff it's a small group of five people
(04:36) doing something that's different than doing a webinar to a thousand people at once versus having a call review system where you review someone's calls to give them feedback one-on-one the second frame of the delivery cube is do it yourself DIY DWI which is done with you as in you're holding their hand through the process of whatever it is you're doing or done for you where you do all of the work yourself and you sell them a final product or final outcome each of these give you different levels of scale do it yourself you can sell it unlimited
(05:03) out typically the value is smaller done with you you have in between mean the two extremes of do-it-yourself and done four you've done for you is the most expensive typically sometimes the easiest to sell but one of the hardest things to deliver on the third frame is what level of support am I going to do and specifically on what medium am I going to offer support via chat am I going to offer support via email am I going to offer support via phone call gonna be Zoom call these are all different ways that I can support
(05:28) whatever the thing is that I'm selling obviously if I do email support that's going to be significantly more scalable it'll probably also be significantly less valuable than somebody who's real time available to hop on a zoom call whenever they want filter number four is how do I want them to consume the thing they can consume it visually they consume It audio wise they could consume it live they consume a recording they consume it visually via text so there's different ways we can have people consume some sort of thing whatever it
(05:53) is anything that's live is typically going to be perceived as more valuable and if it's in person and live probably the most valuable and probably the least scalable on the flip side if I did something that was recorded and was digital it would be the most scalable but probably the least valuable the fifth lens is the speed and convenience of whatever we're delivering this comes down to multiple things one is it 24 hours a day or is it just nine to five frame two is how many days a week am I maintaining that level of service three
(06:21) is how fast is that response so I might be open 24 hours a day but I have responses that are guaranteed in 24 hours which is different than saying I'm open nine to five five days a week but I respond within three minutes and the ultimate extremes are either you're overstaffed but your customers don't have to wait you incur inefficiency so that they have convenience or they incur the inefficiency and all of your staff is 100 utilized because they're going call to call to call all day long different strategies there's wildly
(06:49) successful companies that do both frame six is what I like to call the 10x to 1 10th test if I charge 10 times more for my current thing what would I have to change about my thing that I sell in order for it to be worth 10 times more this ultimately gets me thinking in much bigger ways about how much value I would need to provide let's say I go from a ten thousand dollar thing to a hundred thousand dollar thing that still would be profitable at a ten thousand dollar thing it just makes me think differently because I now have to justify my hundred
(07:17) thousand dollar price tag the flip side of that is equally powerful which is if I had to deliver the same or even more value than I currently am but I could only charge one tenth the price that I currently am what else would I do that would be perceived as valuable but would not cost me enough so I could still justify one tenth the price but maintain my value this gives me a very good starting point to both figure out what the first thing I might want to sell is and then how can I scale it and make it more profitable and or more valuable to
(07:45) my end consumer and think through the ratio of how many people I would need internally my company to facilitate that and so this is what I was explaining with the University of Texas and if this was interesting to you we actually have the entire full lecture in Q a the link somewhere around here I'm sure it'll be available to you if you want to watch the whole thing go click there and check it out

Hard work won't make you rich. - YouTube

Transcript:
(00:00) hard work will not make you rich I get driven nuts by the amount of gurus and influencers and whatever who want to brag and say no one can outwork me I'm the best in the world so many people outwork me I still make more money than them there has to be something else one of the things that grinds my gears about a lot of people that I see on Instagram that you probably see too is this whole like no one can outwork me Mantra first off it's objectively false because many people a outwork you today be outward give in the past see you haven't met
(00:26) everyone indeed it doesn't [ __ ] matter anyways it's the same thing when someone's like I'm the best and you have to say you're the best because if you don't think you're the best it shows that you're not confident to me I don't take that at all if someone's like I'm the best then why aren't you on [ __ ] Billboards that's what the best would look like absolutely you need to do the work you need to put volume in it's the only way you get better but if you start claiming that you are the best you cannot be outworked you are making
(00:50) statements that you know are not true why are we bragging about work because work has very little to do with the highest levels of the game Warren Buffett talks about if he makes two good decisions a year he's had a good year and so how how is it that one of the best investors one of the best business people in terms of measuring it by money which is how you measure business talks about how he does basically nothing reads five or six hours a day eats McDonald's and makes a couple good decisions a year how is it that that guy
(01:12) is making so much more money than the people who are bragging about the fact that they work so hard everyone only has the same hours of the day anybody who only sleeps eight hours or only sleeps seven hours and works the remaining of hours of the day all of them would be tied for hardest working so what creates output you have volume of activity and then you have the leverage of the activity that you're doing that's what creates the total output in order to do anything you must do something there has to be some level of energy that gets
(01:37) input into the system our activity in terms of number of activities is a very newbie measure of success in the beginning Warren Buffett doesn't say I sent a thousand emails today he doesn't talk like that he's playing a different game Jeff Bezos didn't like woke up at 4am today now mind you I'm saying this to somebody who likes waking up early we can't be as superstitious about what matters waking up early doesn't matter going to bed late doesn't matter not sleeping a lot doesn't matter the few things that matter are the
(02:02) inputs that go into the system that have the most leverage to create the most output now if you're a newbie and you can't get your ass off the couch then by all means figure out how to actually get your ass off the couch and do stuff but then there's only so many hours and so boom and then very quickly you hit your capacity of work great you've maximized that now what the leverage that we have on that activity is going to dictate how much we get out of it and if we do a low leverage activity many many many times
(02:26) we might get more than a high leverage activity that gets done once a CEO who's going to work with acquisition.com Works virtually every hour of every day when they come in almost everybody does sometimes they ask they're like am I going to be working more or like it's impossible for you to work more but you are going to be changing what you work on because that's the only lever we have there's only 24 hours so we're going to switch these nine out and we're going to plop these in with higher leverage activities and so the way that we do
(02:47) that is we look at their calendars and we look at their org chart this is how you [ __ ] grow business you look at what they spend their time on and you see which of these activities are low Leverage is there anyone else in this org chart that we can hand these activities to and if a large percentage of these activities are a certain type of thing and they don't exist in their chart then it's a role that we need to hire the point of why I hate the concept of no one cannot work me is that there are many ways to win the game if you
(03:08) were to think about an amazing goal as a dragon to be slain if you are familiar with video games in any way when you create like a war party you have a group of people that are going to go go on a quest you don't just have 10 paladins or guys who just have Shields and swords so you've got a Healer a mage that's really good at damage but can't take a lot of damage then you've got a paladin you can't hit as hard but he can take a lot of shots you find people who have complementary skills if you're playing football you don't have 10 running backs
(03:35) the entrepreneur really should be the coach of the team it's about organizing the pieces and how the well they play together that ultimately determines how good the team is like how many times have you seen the team with the All-Star that has the poor Supporting Cast get beat by the overall better team it happens all the time a lot of entrepreneurs as I see in them are trying to play the game like they're the star player and they want to score all the points but they lose to Apple because Apple's got a team we celebrate
(04:02) a specific action like work when it's really just saying oh look there's a paladin who can take a lot of hits cool that's not the only thing that's required to win I think what is more valuable is to know what are each of the roles that exists within the business a b is there one of these that you map to based on your characteristics and skill sets and then see what is my eventual Evolution through entrepreneurship we'll start at the beginning which is what are the players on the field so if you think about it by function you've got somebody
(04:30) who has to promote who's got to be a good marketer they have to understand how to make things known across different platforms telling stories building a brand providing value to an audience that's what marketing is sales is being able to convert that raw attention into a sale direct response ads sales Pages video your sales letters Etc which is pretty much anything that's physical products or software based that's low ticket or it's higher ticket people-to-people hand-in-hand combat who know how to in the beginning sell and
(04:55) then later train how to sell and then later later lead people who train how to sell these are not necessarily the same people I've met really brilliant marketers who suck at sales I'm really good sales people sucking marketing then you've got somebody who understands product how do I make something beautiful the guy who started Shopify he's not CEO of Shopify he's had a product he's a mage he knows how to cast spells and you've got the experienced people who are managing everything outside of the actual product itself how
(05:19) do customers engage with us how it can provide more value how to give an amazing experience how do we make sure they're hitting these Milestones this person who knows customers experience and customer success is not the same person who understands product and ux and design that's a different game which is different the guy who knows how to close this different guy that knows how to promote the bigger the Enterprise gets the more specialized the skill becomes and the deeper The Well of experience that people need to be they
(05:39) have to be more specialized when people are like I can't be outworked you're bragging about the wrong thing it should be like I can't be out recruited I can't be outmanaged no one can build a culture like me that's super high leverage across the organization no one can lead like me but no one can outwork me it's just an irrelevant activity metric I love working I work all the time but I would never claim that no one works harder than me I tend to have very good leverage with the activities that I do I spend tons of time writing a book in
(06:06) that book prints and sells copies forever it's a different way to play the game and so level two of this which player you are in the Middle Run of this you end up segregating yourself to a portion of the business that you're an expert at or that you're best at CMO or chief sales officer Chief product officer it's not about one player being the champion here it's about how the team works together which then gets to the third level of this is just about being the coach think about what the best coaches do they're literally trying
(06:30) to head hunt the best players and they're trying to recruit the best people from college look at what Google does think about their recruiting efforts they have huge influxes dedicated to getting the best and smartest people out of college and they have another ring for the best and smartest people come out of business school and then another one is their very high level recruiting at the top of the executive level the parallels between sports and business they are almost the same in that way now mind you you can only have you know 10 or 11
(06:52) people on the field you might have ten thousand but if each of those players represents a a function or Department of the business it makes more sense when we move up the levels of Entrepreneurship we need to make sure that we're playing the right game and that we're using the right metric to measure our success final level of this is being the coach is recruiting the top level Executives and creating a farm system underneath to feed into the company that you have so you can have a sustained competitive advantage and create a dynasty for the
(07:20) team so you can create the best winning team every year and have the soft skills of creating culture of high performance so that you get the most out of every individual player and the difference between amazing coaching and mediocre or poor coaching is what would players do if they had no coach or leader and then what would they do if they had the best coach and best leader the Delta between those two is the value of the coach the value of the CEO the CEO needs to have the highest return on time out of anyone
(07:45) in the organization because they need to always be solving the next problem as long as when they replace their time the activities they do with the new stuff builds the business even more then that trade will always work and if CEO can come in and turn a business around even behemoths around in two three years based on the standards that they set and the values that they stand for that Delta across the entire organization is your greatest Leverage

(00:00) in this video i'm going to explain the single equation that helped me turn 1036 dollars into over 120 million dollars in sales and right now um our portfolio company is about 85 million a year so this concept has been the central concept to how we've grown each of our portfolio companies with 100 equity without taking on outside capital or investors right and so the key here is if you don't have a lot of money you have to think different and play the game differently most people when they try and play the game when they when they get the
(00:28) investors from outside or they have some sort of seed capital of their own they think i'm going to have to take two or three years before my business uh is break even or positive and that is definitely a belief that you can have but not necessarily one that you have to have right and so i prefer to you know change the variables the game that we're playing uh to try and figure out a way to make money all the time right because it's like well if i could make money the whole time then that would make this definitely more fun and a lot less
(00:51) stressful and so the equation that i'm going to outline for you is what i call client finest acquisition this is how we grew our first uh lice you know shoot i grew i went from zero to six locations at my brick and mortar chain uh in three years as a 26 year old and i was able to open up each of those locations at full capacity except for the first one obviously but each of the ones after that once i learned how to do this on day one so that's not normally common so we're going to open up each facility at complete completely full capacity and
(01:18) then i did this at 33 other locations over the next few years after that we transitioned to our licensing business and we used the exact same model that i'm about to show you uh to go from zero to two and a half million dollars a month within i think it was like 12 or 14 months and then and that's per month not per year so went from zero to 28 million top line right and then uh 12 months after that we're at 4.
(01:41) 4 million a month the second business that added that up went from zero to 1.7 million a month in four months all right the third business we started our software business went from zero to also 1.7 ironically within six months all right and so this equation matters profit matters if you want to be in a capitalist society because it's the only way that you're gonna be able to weather the storms all right so this is the writer downer this is an equation but it's a process all right client financed acquisition what this means in plain terms is get your
(02:08) customers to pay for all of your marketing your acquisition costs and so what that means is if you can plug into the universe's money not your own money but you plug into the money of the universe you can pretty much cash flow anything you need because you can make more money getting someone to enter your world than it costs you to get them there and if that is your case and you still have all the lifetime value that you're going to collect but if you can do that in the first 30 days and you can and you can pay the cost of fulfillment and still
(02:34) have money left over then you have what is called a negative acquisition cost right it means that you make money getting customers all right so this is the actual equation you know the number two but then there's three things in here that you may or may not understand and so i'm going to break down each of them let's call this number one let's call this number two let's call this number three so if i were to read this in plain english it would say 30-day cash oopsies i usually write this the other way 30-day cash must be greater than
(03:01) two times the cost of acquiring customer and the cost of fulfilling that customer okay so what this means is cost of acquisition all right so let's say it cost me a hundred bucks to require a customer and that includes my marketing team that includes my sales guys and their commissions that includes the advertising or whatever method i did to acquire the lead okay so let's say all luna cost me 100 bucks i'm just using simple math here let's say that for me to fulfill this thing whatever the thing is let's say it cost me another 100 bucks
(03:32) all right so that's 200 that's gonna cost me to fulfill and sell this thing these are my costs right and so the idea is i have to have two times the sum of this all right remember this is in our little parentheses which means this is 400 that is what i must make right that has to be less than what i make in 30-day cash which is a term that i use that i've never really heard anywhere else i'm sure there's a fancier word for it but i call 30-day cash which is the amount of money that i can collect in net free cash flow to my business
(04:05) within the first 30 days of a custer customer entering our world now we may have upsells and down sales and continuity and future things that we're going to sell but none of that matters to the small business owner who doesn't have cash and so the reason it's 30 days is because that's the amount of time that you can get interest free financing all right so if you have a credit card people will extend your money for 30 days interest free that means if you paid off in the first 30 days you can you can pretty much take unlimited money
(04:31) all right for the most part now you pay your stuff off you get bigger limits whatever but the point is and this is literally how i started my second business is that i would use my cards i'd put the money on the card to acquire the customer so on my card there'd be 200 because that's what's gonna cost me to fulfill and acquire but i would have made 400 on that and the reason it has to be greater than this is because i have net right because we have to take out the 200 that we lost here right minus 200. so i have 200 left over
(05:03) what a coincidence that's the exact amount that it's going to cost me to get another customer and fulfill that customer which means that i'm going to get you guessed it another 400 from this customer and we play the game again which means that you have unlimited power to acquire new customers which means you get unlimited money which is why if you if you play the game this way and you choose to think about acquisition in this manner you can grow your companies without capital constraint now it doesn't mean that
(05:33) there won't be constraints there will be you'll have operational constraints you have hiring constraints of other things but if you play the game this way getting new customers and making sales will never be the thing that is limiting your company it will be only you and this is what we've done over and over and over again is design a process in every business that we can figure out where the amount of dollars that we make in the first 30 days is greater than two times the cost to acquire plus the cost of fulfill and that works in any
(06:02) business in the world all right and now ideally i don't want to be just twice it just has to be more than that if i can make this you know 10 times right then it's even better all of those uh make it just even easier because then i'm getting multiple customers and i still have cash flow to go invest in other things but this is the minimum requirement for cfa or what we call client financed acquisition and so right now if you don't have money or you don't have capital and you think it takes money to make money you just keep believing that beautiful
(06:34) lie and let everyone else go win while you keep complaining all right so keeping awesome mosey nation i know you're not that type of person um and so we can beat all those people who have those limited beliefs um but i had a thousand thirty six dollars in my bank account five years ago all right right now the portfolio we do does 85 million dollars a year i took no outside money to do that which means if you can learn how to play and multiply and multiply and multiply and not use your own money because i'm using my customers money to
(07:02) finance all of the growth in this business if you enjoyed this if this if you found value in this uh click subscribe i'll see you next video i know this is a little bit more tactical um i'll talk about more uh managing people and and scaling the company side but this is the this is the stuff right this is this this is the these are the things that actually grow the business all right so anyways love you all keeping awesome buzzy nation i'll see you guys next vid bye

Transcript:
(00:00) what's going on everyone i want to show you in this video one of the fastest ways to make a tremendous amount of money in a service business all right so right now if you want a service business or any kind of business where you provide stuff uh to customers if you sell stuff then this video is for you um just so you if you don't know me my name's alex romozy i own acquisition.
(00:15) com we do about 85 million a year in revenue uh and this channel is just because a lot of people are broke and i don't want you to be one of them all right so uh i was thinking about the different businesses that we have um we have a publishing business we have a photography business which is a chain of brick and mortar um somebody asked me in one of the comments to name a out i don't tell you the actual names of these because part of the deal structure that we have with a lot of these are our influencer based or personality driven
(00:36) brands and so i don't want it to be like oh you're just one of alex's businesses all right so just to be clear for everybody the reason i don't do that i'll tell you the ones that i own 100 of but the ones where i'm a minority partner in i don't um i don't tell you what they are i'll tell you what categories they're in um so like i said we've got a publishing business which is a digital digital business we have a brick and mortar chain photography studios we have we have a certification business we also have a an online it's a similar
(01:05) business but online for trainers we have our gym licensing business which is gym launch we have our cell phone business which is prestige labs um and then uh we have allen which is our software uh company for for agency owners that helps brick and mortar agencies uh work leads all right so just so you're curious that's what we do and we're looking getting some others anyways one of the things i was thinking about within our businesses is like what are the different categories and this is kind of a spin-off of the recurring video that i
(01:30) made about cracking netflix's code right is what are the different types of products that we can sell and i'll show you one of these that's incredibly valuable that if you're ever pressed for cash it's the easiest thing that you can sell for a ton of money first there i was like you've got products right you've got widgets you've got stuff all right that's the first category the second category let me see if i can draw some nice lines here the second category is you've got services right where people do stuff right for other people
(01:57) and the third and this is the one that a lot of people miss out on is access all right so i'm gonna go through all three of these in a second all right so products everyone should kind of understand what these are right you get these in the mail and they can also be digital goods so here's a here's an aab version of each of these right so you've got physical and then you've got digital so you've got physical product would be getting you know supplements in the mail a digital product would be uh buying buying to buy netflix uh like
(02:25) you know buying a netflix subscription right that's where you're you're consuming a digital good when you buy media that is a digital good right you're buying eyeballs right if you're buying physical services that would be like buying a massage you've got digital services which would be like um like a marketing agency that would be a digital service right they're not actually buying you're not buying something that's going to happen in the real world you're happy you're buying something that's happening in the digital in the digital sphere
(02:47) right third is access where you've got physical access which would be like uh concert tickets right you have access like to someone or to an experience of some sort and then you've got digital access right which would be uh you you buy access either to um like a virtual a virtual event or or you have access to me via slack or something like that right that would be digital access all right and so when you're thinking about your products and services right one of the easiest things to do to make it more valuable is think
(03:15) how can i add if you have let's say products how can i add some sort of service component to it to make this more valuable and we do this so that we can not be a commodity right the goal is to be so different from everyone else in the marketplace that people have to consider you on their own as your own standalone business so that you can have monopoly prices all right despite what the government will tell you in antitrust laws the goal is to become a monopoly like you win the game by being a monopoly by being so good
(03:39) that no one else can compete with you right and now because those companies have so much power they own the government now anyway not getting into that that's not the point but the point is is that uh you can pair these concepts so most people just consider themselves i am just a physical products business it's like okay well can we add some sort of digital products right to our physical products to enhance the value and differentiate ourselves if i have a service i have a physical service maybe i can add some sort of digital component
(04:04) to it or maybe i can add some physical products that go with it or digital products right they go with it or thirdly is there a way that i can add access which is probably one of my favorite of the types of of businesses and here's why this one has almost 100 margins right digital access is almost 100 margins same thing with digital products almost 100 margins right um digital services less so so services just so you're you're wondering why so many service businesses of a hard time scaling this is very hard to scale
(04:39) people it's also hard to scale things that have hard costs right and scaling people you have to scale culture you have to scale training you have to scale onboarding there's a lot of things have to scale for scaling services which is why most people don't like buying those types of businesses which is why and i'm making this video right now if you want to increase your enterprise value it's trying to figure out how you can add multiple of these things so i just gave you six different categories here right of things of
(05:01) different types of things that you can have in your business i know that the sun is making me you know i'm dodging the sun here right i'm a sun chaser right now when you're thinking about how you can add more value right and i'll tell you the hack right now all right so you guys ready for this in terms of if you needed to make money the way that you do this all right this is my favorite one that you can use which is access all right i'm gonna put this in big is that you sell a more individualized higher touch version of your own solution all right
(05:29) and so what that means is you can say hey i can only take five people for a one on one right or a small group right experience for one year for this big outcome that they're all going to want and i'll guarantee that you'll get it or i'll keep working with you for free until you do which means when you buy this thing and when you give me this money right now it means that you've solved this problem you can put this money down it means that that outcome is going to happen i'm going to try and get it to happen 12 months because i don't
(06:00) want to keep working for free but you know that i will continue to work with you until you achieve it all right so right now if you have a client base and you're like man i'm strapped for cash and the only way that they can do this is if they prepay the entire period of time all right and so the thing is is you don't need to have any kind of discount for an offer that's structured like this the reason that they're getting a lot of value is because they're getting access right they're getting access in addition to a service
(06:23) all right and they're getting some level of expertise on top of it all right and so right now if you need to make an extra five grand 10 grand 20 grand 50 grand whatever it is that you have depending on the size of your business that is one of the easiest fastest ways to generate cash flow for your business and use up some of the uh audience while still maintaining good pent-up demand all right what i mean by that is that if you sell a hundred of these or you sell out in terms of like you sell out all the demand that's there you running
(06:48) something else in the future will bomb right and so the idea is if you know that you could sell 20 people sell five if you know you could sell 100 people sell 20 right try and maintain the vast majority 80 of the demand still there and have it pent up so that when you do another offer like this in the future you'll sell out again and the idea is that as you grow the number of people that you will have in that demand pool continue to increase and so you will always be able to sell out but the number of total slots will
(07:15) continue to increase whereas most people always go for the biggest ass they possibly can try and sell out and liquidate all the good well they have in their audience all the time which means they're always searching for building up the next demand which is why they're always poor because it's very hard to do that all right it's much easier to maintain goodwill and multiply it and then feed and then just skim a tiny amount off the top and then grow the goodwill of the base to go from you know 100 people in your base who want to buy
(07:39) the thing to 200 people in the base and the next time you go from 20 to 40 rather than going from 20 to 200 right because you could do it but then after that you're done nothing you got to start from scratch again and so it's much better to always keep some goodwill kept up one of my favorite ways to liquidate that in a very controlled burn manner is to have access so you can have implied urgency and applied scarcity uh with a very very high ticket premium and you'll probably get some of the best customers to do this with you they'll be the least
(08:06) needy believe it or not um and get some crazy great testimonials and great outcomes as a result of it so um anyways moseynation like i said my name's auction wizzy on acquisition.com uh with 85 million dollars here and i have nothing to sell you if you enjoyed this video uh hit subscribe i share other stuff like this that's helped us scale our businesses all right so keep being awesome and if you didn't enjoy this video i still love you anyways and i'll see you guys the next bit bye

Why The First $100k is the Toughest | Charlie Munger Secrets - YouTube
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9fSDCRPQNA

Transcript:
(00:00) what's going on everyone i've got a special uh podcast episode for you today um what i want to break down is a conversation i was having with a different friend about how a hundred thousand dollars is the hardest amount of money to make um and i was actually talking to him he's he's starting his physical therapy uh clinic practice right now um and he's he's he's you know he's eating for lack of a better term you know what i mean like he's just he's just trying to figure this out and the thing is is that a hundred
(00:27) thousand dollars is the hardest amount of money to make for a variety of reasons and that's not me i'm not the first person to say that charlie munger said uh who's warren buffett's uh business partner said the first hundred grand is a he even says that uh it's a quote you can look it up um but anyways and and there's there's a bunch of reasons why and so i wanted to kind of walk through it uh the first is the the biggest one which is that when you're when you set the goal at a hundred thousand dollars you only think
(00:50) of hundred thousand dollar opportunities right um and what i mean by that is you're not like if i were to say hey you need to make 10 million dollars you can't 100 grand your way times 100 to get there right you have to think of a different way of operating of doing business in order to make 10 million dollars right because at that point you know you can't sell your time like it's not going to work right you have to do something else and so inherently when someone puts the constraint of i want to make a hundred thousand dollars on
(01:17) themselves then they automatically only construct confine themselves to vehicles where they have to sell time for money right which are inherently constraining which is why it's a right it's hard because you literally have to sell your time in order to do it that being said most people who've made millions started with something that got them a hundred grand and i will tell you personally the first hundred thousand dollars that i put in my bank account was by far the most meaningful that of all the money that i've made in my life
(01:41) um i remember when i looked at layla and i had a hundred thousand dollars in my bank account after everything um i remember looking at her and saying it's gonna be okay we've got three and a half years of money now that if we mess up for three and a half years we'll still will still be all right and i remember feeling that that sense of relief and the reason that i think it was so impactful is that difference between zero or let's say the difference between a thousand dollars you're making a hundred thousand dollars is a hundred
(02:06) x increase for me to have that same 100x increase i'd have to go from 100 000 to 10 million in my bank account to have the same proportional increase in terms of security and i'll tell you even after 10 million my bank account i was like it still didn't feel as good as the first hundred grand all right and so it doesn't matter where you're at like i'll tell you if it's hard right now it's normal it's supposed to be hard but it will get better because you're gonna start thinking differently all right now back to the original topic of why 100 000 is
(02:33) the hardest money to make first is you think of time vehicles time for money vehicles the second is that you have no leverage all right so what i mean by that is that inherently all businesses arbitrage right you're buying and selling things at less and you're making the difference right if you're in a service business i'm buying people's labor and i'm selling it at a higher price to the marketplace because i see the discrepancy between that and i can add value to a person by training them in certain ways or putting them inside
(02:57) of a system and then the sum of the individuals or sorry the sum of the whole is greater than parts right that's essentially what it is but when you don't have money you have no leverage on anything and so you have to do everything yourself and so again it takes tons of time to get small amounts of output and so because of that you're really inefficient right because you have to and you also have to wear all of the hats you have to learn every aspect of the business in order to really turn the first dollar and that takes time and
(03:26) it takes effort a lot more effort than you think it will right and then once you finally figure out how to make the first dollar you have to keep repeating that action over and over and over and over again until you have you know 100 000 in your bank account but once you have that you can start paying people to do things you can start paying for you know advertising and you're not worried about paying your rent or and what happens is you now start having the big l word right which is leverage you can you can you can move
(03:54) the world a lot faster because you can have 10 people doing outbound for you you can pay a team to make advertising for you you can have a video set up or whatever that's going to get you a higher roi or make your stuff look better and you get more you know you get more engagement or whatever right but the thing is is that that first hundred grand is so hard because the vehicles that exist for it require all your effort if you're doing sales right you're working all the time if you're doing a job you're working all the time
(04:20) if you're you know if you wanted to drive uber to make 100 grand you probably work 12 hours a day and it would require time but thing is is that once you do that though you can you can then start piecemealing out pieces of your day and you do that in reverse order of the value that you can buy that same skill in the marketplace so let me let me dive into that for a second so let's say that in your business you might be doing 15 different things but you might find out that the administrative work of scheduling um and
(04:49) answering the phone might be the least valuable it may be it may not be whatever but let's just say it is and let's say that the marketplace you can buy that skill for ten dollars an hour and so what that means is you can get let's say four hours of your day back for ten dollars an hour and so now you have four more hours and if you can make more money in those four hours and this is a key point i see this one as a mistake too is uh people will outsource certain work that they're doing but they will not replace the time with higher
(05:15) value skill so then they basically just pay people and then stop working and make the same amount of money which can be cool but if you want to grow then you're going to need to continue to work and just do higher and higher and higher value higher leverage time in the time that you buy back right but fundamentally when you think about your business as what would it take for me to make a million dollars would it take for me to make 10 million dollars you think of different vehicles in order to get there and if you don't know of
(05:40) the vehicles i would highly highly encourage you to look at the vehicles that already exist so like one of the things that's here's an interesting nugget for you there's no reason for anyone in the united states to make less than 25 dollars an hour why because in one day you can go through a certification and become a phlebotomist and make 25 an hour so who wouldn't take a one-day education to triple their income from minimum wage who wouldn't do that the reason people don't do it is because they don't know people are ignorant right and so if
(06:09) you're watching this and you didn't know that that even existed there are so many other opportunities that are like that that you can immediately get more leverage on the time just as you're starting so if you're if you're working a job and you're not making that well then go find go find small opportunities go find little mini certifications that you can get that qualify you uh for now that's only get a certification if it's required if it's just like oh this is a certain don't worry about it but like if if you can find these little
(06:32) opportunities you know like i'll tell you for me my plan b of like if my business was going to fail i knew that what i was going to do was i was going to drive uber and i was going to strip at night that was going to be my 100 my my gig because i knew that if i drove uber 12 hours a day and i stripped for four hours every night i would be able to make about 200 grand and i knew that even if i started at zero i could do that again and try and try and get another do-over right and the thing is is that as your skill set
(06:57) increases right the base level of your building as i like to consider it like this is your building of skills the base level your basement continues to rise right and so the level that you can fall down to continues to go be higher and higher right and so once i learned how to sell i knew that i would never really make less than 250 000 a year because i knew i could always go to a car dealership and sell cars no matter what i could go sell cars make 200 300 400 000 a year i knew that because i had that skill and
(07:26) that means that from this point going forward with my life i'll never make less than that right but then i learned how to market and then as soon as i learned how to market i knew that that was going to be my because now i could take my sales skill and pair it with marketing and then i could generate demand at will right and then that means that my new level might be 3 million a year that i'll never make less than because i have the skills that even if i have to start over i can end there and the thing is is that
(07:48) if you think about your your journey as an entrepreneur in terms of as a skill set stacking all you're doing is acquiring skills and putting in your back pocket put it in your tool kit right then you inherently become more valuable and you stop seeing your failures as failures but rather lessons on the way to where you're trying to go because you inherently become more valuable because your work works on you more than you work on it all right i'll say that again your work works on you more than you work on it
(08:15) and so even if you didn't make a hundred grand the first year that's okay because you developed the foundational skill sets that maybe got you above 50 000 a year right but as long as you were continuing to acquire skills that baseline will will go up and the speed with which you move up will be how much volume you do so volume of work for a specific skill with deliberate effort will improve your skill set now you can do it faster or slower depending on how quickly you learn the skill but you still have to learn it and there's
(08:45) usually a certain amount of volume that has to happen which means that there's some amount of time but then how do some people acquire skills faster than others some people are more deliberate with their practice some people get mentors and experts that feed into them every valuable skill that i've acquired in my life i've paid someone to acquire so i could get it faster alright and so if you're like well i don't have money then do the high value do the do the leverage do the shitty work now do the first 100
(09:07) 000 that's a do that work now you have to trade some of your your life for money and that's okay which is why i have a saying which is you can you can't be busy and broke right you can't be both if you're busy you should be making money right and if you're broke you're not busy which means you've got time so you can always trade back and forth time for money right if you have more money then uh and but you're busy all the time then you can trade some of that money back to buy some time back right but you can't
(09:32) be busy and broke all right so think about that and if you feel like you are busy and broke i guarantee you're wasting a lot of your time so anyways uh to ring this full circle a hundred thousand dollars is by far one of the hardest amounts of money to make because we think about it only in time vehicles and for many of us it's the first thing you have to do so just bite the bullet go do it and then after that you can start leveling up your skill set you can pay for skills you can pay for um for for things to happen faster for you you can
(09:59) pay for other people to do some of the lower value work that you're doing because they're earlier on in their journey so you can buy their time that's less valuable than yours and you continue to work up and build the foundation of that building that eventually becomes a skyscraper of your skills and then you'll have the perspective to identify the 10 million the 100 million the billion dollar opportunities and go all in on them because at this point you'll have the skill set to make it happen so anyways hope that was valuable for you hope
(10:24) you're having an amazing day uh and i'll see you in the next video bye [Music] [Music] [Applause] you

Transcript:
(00:00) it's not how much you make it's how much you keep and inside of this video I'm going to share with you in a single presentation everything that I have ever learned in paying over $3 million in taxes in The Last 5 Years which was miserable and probably paying $500,000 million in tax preparation stuff so tax products experts accountants audits all of that stuff all the fancy things that the rich people don't want you to know I'm sharing it all with you here in this video it's a presentation it's a little different than I normally have so let me know if you guys kind of like the longer form I know some of you guys said you
(00:29) did and so if you're new to the channel my name is name is Al mosy welcome to mosy nation and enjoy after paying $22.68 million in taxes in the past 5 years here's everything that I've learned about saving taxes in one presentation and if you don't know who I am I'm going to prove to you that those numbers are legit in a second but let's get forward and at the end of this I'll give you my six Consolidated takeaways that you can immediately use to save yourself taxes make more money all that kind of good stuff and a bonus set of beliefs that have served me well up to
(00:52) this point in my life and we just recently sold a 66% stake in two of those companies at a $ 46.2 million valuation which you can look up on the Internet yourself if you are skeptical which would be totally realistic and reasonable of you considering the many tubers and interweb S that exist that are probably saying things that are a little bit stretched from the truth all right so let's dive in so quick confession um I used to be obsessed with tax savings so was literally like took up a very large percentage of my time um
(01:19) I spent roughly $1.6 million in legal and accounting fees to figure out the structure that I have today uh and so this will be a culmination of all my applied knowledge and beliefs related to taxes to date as a US citizen um in a single presentation and hopefully save you five years of learning and all the money that I have spent so enjoy my gift to you all right so here's the four beliefs about taxes that have improved my life and probably made me a lot of money up to this point so number one is that tax shelters cost more than they save you might be like how is that even possible great question I will dive into
(01:48) it number two tax shelters decrease your net worth how is that even possible as well boulder dash Alex I know it's crazy number three tax shelters diminish your life how can it diminish my life I will prove it to you in just a moment number four tax shelters don't make you a better person you're like well that one I believed okay fair enough well I'll show you each one of these and more so the problem with number one which is tax shelters cost more than they save is that what tax shelters save you they
(02:15) cost you more in other resources so what they save you in money they cost you more in other things all right so there's three primary costs that people do not account for and that I myself did not account for when I started this journey so long ago in the business world so number one is the cost of Discovery and conversion number two is the cost of upkeep and number three is the cost of unwinding and if you're like I don't know what any of those things mean let me explain all right so number one the cost of Discovery is that 90 I'm going to borrow this from Charlie Monger so 95% of solutions are swampland and 5%
(02:46) are legit and so as he is my hero uh in many ways not just in investing um I turned to him first to try and figure out what the best kind of course of action around tax was the short and simple answer is pay them and the reason for that is his quote here is that 19 out of 20 of these things are not legit and are actually going to get you into trouble and so the problem is the cost of Discovery is the is the the cost of the time and the attention that it takes you to sift through all the crap to figure out the one out of 20 that is actually worth it right and let's just
(03:17) assume somehow you're like you know what you did all of that work you got on calls with accountants and lawyers and your legal operating structure with every one of these things and you ran through all the tests that I'm going to show you later in this slide deck of the things that you should look for in these types of structures and let's assume you did all of that stuff then it you have this huge cost to conversion right it takes a lot of time to vet these things create new entities transfer all your stuff over reincorporate recreate your
(03:41) new contracts for all of your clients Etc new banking relationships and all of that stuff so there's a cost of figuring out which of these is actually legit which 95% of them are not number two is that if you actually happen to find something that might be legit right not even including the cost on the 19 that didn't actually you know were not actually legit then you have the cost converting them but that's just cost number one cost number two is that okay now you've converted your thing you have the cost of upkeep all right so what you have to do now is you have to trade valuable attention for less valuable money by percentage all right so I'll
(04:11) give you a couple stories to drive this point home so a very close friend of mine um traveled 104 days a year back and forth between Puerto Rico and the United States so basically every weekend he'd fly back home um and then you know on Monday he'd fly back out and he did this every single day because he didn't want to pay us taxes right but guess what he was traveling 104 days a year and we were on the phone and I was like hey man do you think it'd be possible that you could make 30% more money if you didn't travel 104 days a year he was like I didn't really think
(04:42) about it like that I was like yeah but you should and the thing is so we're trading this very valuable time and attention for less valuable money by percentage all right number two is I I have a different friend who uh counts his days in New York City to go back and forth and it's like guys like can we can we not figure out a way to to just make more money within the current vehicle a different friend of mine actually missed their baby's birth because they had to get their days in right like what are we trading here and then finally on a more
(05:14) tactical level a a close relative of mine uh was like hey I think you should do this captive insurance thing with me and I said okay let's look into it so we looked into it together and I'd already looked at captives a couple time uh because you know there were some tax savings by the way they're very marginal in my opinion um and definitely not the B cost of upkeep and so every month every quarter you have to allocate a certain percentage of funds and decide how much of those funds you need to allocate into the insurance vehicle so that you can stay legit in terms of are we really using this for insurance are
(05:43) we going to actually take claims out of it and then what is reasonable amount that we can put in here and you're constantly allocating attention to this thing that does not provide value to the business number two and this is what I did not know when I was getting into this game is that one there was the cost of Discovery and cost of conversion two you've got the cost of upkeep and three and here's the real one that no one tells you about especially the people who are trying to sell you these tax shelters is the cost of unwinding and fines all right and so not only do they
(06:06) cost more than they save upfront they often don't even end up saving you anything in the long run and here's why most of the big tips and tricks get Unwound in a matter of years and the reason for that is because the IRS is 3 to 5 years behind and so when they see a loophole they close it right but they close it 3 to 5 years later because they're so understaffed and all that kind of stuff right and so often people will get fined because they uh they're evading taxes right and so they'll say you were not using this clause for the
(06:35) manner in which it was intended so now you owe us taxes on three years ago plus fines plus interest and so then you not only have the fines and the interest but then you have to spend the cost of the legal and the accounting and all the other stuff to unwind the structure that you did under the wrong guys because you pretended to use a structure in this way as it was intended but you didn't actually do it in the way it was intended because you did it to save taxes which is not the point of the clause and I have had this happen to
(07:04) people I know very close to me right and the thing is is like everyone has to understand this they write the rules and so what matters most is what your intention is when you use these structures that are complex like the tax code is an incentive system you have to think about it like that they are putting penalties and incentives so that they can move the economy in the way that they believe is right so the reason real estate has a lot of tax Inc because they believe that they want people to reinvest in infrastructure in the company they want people to develop land they want people to keep buildings from
(07:36) falling apart and so they give lots of incentives to people to go invest in those things if all of the tax incentives in real estate disappeared real estate would not be nearly as attractive and a lot of buildings would fall into disarray because it wouldn't be worth it to people so then the country by extension would fall into disarray right and so the idea here is that we have to read the tax to as an incentive plan and that's just side note number one but point is is that with these things they cost more to discover cost more to convert cost more to upkeep and most of the times will not actually
(08:05) end up saving you money in long run which is why tax shelters cost more than they save okay so that was number one hopefully we check that box off number two tax shers do not increase your net worth and you're like how is that even possible I thought the whole point of this is that they're going to increase your net worth I will show you why so what they save they cost you more than other resources I'm going to drive this one in all right so there's three PE pieces here one is the people two is the
(08:28) thinking process and three is how Fortune are actually built and number c you're going to want to pay attention to because it's something that I did not understand until way too late in my entrepreneurial career so let's dive in all right so the people so look at the richest people in the world a lot of them live in the United States and not only that a lot of them live in California and New York which is wild right how is it that the richest people in the world can live in the highest tax tax places in arguably the world how is
(08:52) that even possible maybe they know something that we don't which is that they are using they they know how to build fortunes which I'll get to in point C but the thing is is is that if that were the case then simply going to a tax friendly area is not in and of itself going to increase your net worth all right which is I think is important and as a as a an important side note is that when you also surround yourself with people in those types of environments especially when people move to very specific Geographics only and
(09:17) solely for the purpose of tax Sheltering right what in my opinion what happens is they start thinking increments rather than in orders of magnitude so let me explain so it's majoring in the minors it's thinking how can I save 30% chunks rather than make 30 times more money right and you've talked to those people they're going to make the argument like well I know I'm going to do both it's like no you're not because you're you're literally sacrificing everything that you have to just save 30% when and I'll get to the big picture stuff in a minute but the
(09:47) big WIS are what drive your net worth right so you can spend all this time and attention obsessing about stuff right these little do dats to save 2% and 1% whatever that might end up getting Unwound later and because it's probably swampland it's probably not legit anyways or you could have just bought Bitcoin in 2014 and been done with it the point is that that the big wins the very few big wins are the things that are going to drive the net worth the most not the tax shelters and so people disproportionately allocate their attention towards these savings when that is not where the disproportion amount of the net worth is going to come
(10:17) from and so don't surround yourself with people who are obsessed with this stuff because they're thinking in increments not in orders of magnitude they're not thinking how can I 10x to thinking how can I save 10% and that in my opinion is the wrong way to go about building a fortune which if you're watching this Channel and you're part of mosy nation that is the point all right so see how fortunes are actually made this one is one that I hope that you like slow down and I will try and talk a little bit more slowly than this because I really
(10:40) want everyone to to get this one okay so how fortunes are actually made you make and I I grabbed this from Jack butcher E I think on Twitter but this is a loose a loose uh paraphrasing but you make fortunes by taking a lot of risk with a little bit of money you maintain fortunes by taking small amounts of risk with a lot of money all right so just understanding how fortunes are actually made all right now let's dive into some some math in a second so wealth comes from the appreciation of equities not income all right so how is it that all these very wealthy people live in these high teex places it's because 94% of the
(11:13) force 100 growth came from appreciation not income in other words what we build builds our net worth not what we make huh interesting let's dive a little further into this all right so let's ex let's let's put an example like you're in year four of your business and so let's say last year your business made $10 million in eBid all right which is profit fancy word for profit sort of all right now and you can move the zeros you can make it a million you can make it $100,000 it doesn't really matter all right you can make 100 million the point is that let's just say in this case last
(11:48) year BS paid $10 million and E B profit all right and let's say you it's valued at 5x which would be a $50 million business okay and you receive 10 million time 63 um which would be 37% is taken out for taxes so you get uh 66.
(12:08) 3 million in after tax dividends and let's assume that you're not reinvesting any of it in the business and you're just taking Dollar's dividends just for the sake of this simple example okay now you're like okay I guess that makes sense now pause and hold that so you made 6.3 million and your business is worth 50 got it now next year let's say you go from 10 million to 12 million in IA awesome good for you little 20% growth very conservative sounds good still valued at 5x and the value wait a second goes from 50 million to 60 million huh but wait there's more you receive 12 million time 63 which is$ 7.6 million after tax in
(12:40) dividends and so if you look at your net worth increase the net worth increase is $10 million plus 7.6 million so you had a net worth increase of 17.6 million so let me break this down for you all right which is 60 million the new value of the business minus 50 million right is the 10 and then 12 million times the 37% tax rate gets you 7.
(13:07) 6 you add the 10 plus 7.6 to 17.6 million but here's where it's interesting if your net tax so you made $22 million in increased net worth and your after tax was 17.6 million then you were effectively taxed at 21% huh and why is that it is because 56% of your net worth increase was taxfree it was based on the appre appreciation of the equities of the things that you own rather than the income that you make which is why what you build builds your net worth more than what you make all right so this one I really want to drive this home if you can make the business
(13:40) that you have more valuable the income that you derive from the business is not the primary value that you are actually building right if you double the profit of the business and you have a 5x multiple right you were you have a double multiplier that is happening on something that you own in a very real way compared to what you're actually taking out of the business and so in a lot ways like give yourself the salary live on the salary that you have from the business but let the value of the business compound and it doesn't even matter if you're living in the highest tax state ever because here's what's even crazier this is valued at 5x right
(14:12) if you look at publicly traded companies like some of the S&P right now has traded at 40 which is absolute Insanity I'm not you get into that but that means that if I were to increase my ebba in this example by $2 million there's a 40x multiplier which means I increased my net worth by $80 million so that is why these guys can manufacture these fortunes because there's massive multiplier on equities right so it's not the income that you make that's the thing that's building your net worth and so letting that be the primary driver of why you make your
(14:43) decisions of where you live when how you feel about where you live is going to create far more wealth than the savings will right it's orders of magnitude not incremental thinking all right which is why tax shelters do not increase your net worth as much as people will make it seem all right so number three is that tax shelters do not improve your life all right so little shift here is that I call this inverted priorities so saving the tax money will hurt other aspects of your life let me explain so uh one follow this line of reasoning I want to
(15:12) increase my net worth so that I can live where I want to live with the people that I care about so in order to do that I'm going to not live where I want to live or spend time with the people that I care about to have more net worth so that I can wait a second some doesn't make sense here and that is correct it does not make sense because what we're doing is we're putting the means of achieving the goal above the goal itself right and this happens all the time because us as entrepreneurs we create this this reinforcing cycle of conditional Behavior we get this
(15:43) intermittent reinforce which is how you create addiction right of the work that we do and we forget why we started doing the work which is we have this goal and don't don't get me wrong I think that work is the goal right but at the end of the day if if we claim that we want to uh increase our net so that we can have this level of Freedom Etc then we can't make the means which is money be more important than the thing so for sacrificing the goal in order to get more means it doesn't make sense which brings me to number two is why sacrifice
(16:13) a resource that I care about and that I can get no more of for one that I need no more of and can generate at will and as a side note has decreasing marginal utility which means that the more of it you have the less valuable it is which is not the same with time but anyways so number three um we can say and this was actually a text exchange that I had with a different friend of mine um who you know I was like listen you know we can be on Instagram we can be on on YouTube and we can say money doesn't matter and blah BL blah blah blah um but it's a very different thing
(16:46) to say that money doesn't matter or we can live that money doesn't matter which means it's like if you can be making these posts and making these claims about how you know you've really moved on from this and you've got this bigger picture about life and perspective I was like but all you're doing is sacrificing your life so that you can save little points here and little points there it's like it's fake it's not true like you don't actually believe that right and so I think there's one thing to be talk to
(17:10) talk the path and another thing to walk the path and so if we claim as entrepreneurs to want this Freedom then I I hope to God we don't we don't we don't flip the priorities and uh and sacrifice our freedom to get more means and so I had a I had this was actually a real conversation which is a spark of this entire presentation um is that it's hard to do the whole temporary argument so he's you know he was like well what if I just go there for a temporary period of time stack enough cash and then I'll come back it's like the problem is that the enough number is going to change and it's very very hard
(17:40) to come back from paying 0% you know to paying a third or or half of your net worth and TA or half your income in tax it's just hard mentally I'm not saying like you can still do the rational argument for why you're doing it but it's just like I think it's very hard emotionally to do it and the thing is is that if we are hard driving entrepreneurs which we are we set up these games and move the goal posts on ourselves and so so you know I I can promise you like my first Freedom number was $4 million in after tax net worth
(18:06) and then I immediately and literally when we hit four I was like oh I think 10 is actually more reasonable and then 10 went to 14 I have no idea what 14 was really like meaningful to me but it was and then from 14 it went to 20 and then 20 went to 30 because that's what ultra high net worth is and then it I was like okay now it's 100 and the thing is is the goal post continues to change because you become a c you you literally get exposed to higher levels of wealth and then what you say is like okay well this this this of wealth allows me to
(18:30) live but I want to thrive and then when you're thriving then it's like well I want to Super Thrive and why can't I have an island in every single continent that belongs to me right the thing is you might and you might be listening to this and be like I would never do that watch your tongue because a lot of very smart people have said the same thing and experienced the same desire because we as hard driving people play to win and to stay hungry you move the goalpost but in moving the goal post you create a very difficult equation for to be satisfied all right and so as a quick
(19:01) story to this um I could have done and this is why tax shelters diminish your life I could have done an intentionally defective grantour trust which is a fancy thing that basically functions like a waterfall of trusts where um for every $5 million of a sale that you're going to receive you out you you put it into a trust and the reason it's 5 million is because that's below the the limit um and you have to wait three years before you can touch the money because that's after the the trust passes the statute of limitations on trust being Unwound by the IRS you're like wow Alex how do you know this
(19:31) because I've looked into this stuff right and I could have saved myself about $6 million in taxes right roughly if I had done this right I think it might have been more than that but whatever roughly but for what right to save more money that I don't need and now to needlessly give myself something to worry about because I can't touch the money and I have to follow these stipulations and for some reason something happens then I have the IRS on my back and then get audited right and that that little story that I told you
(19:55) earlier about the uh the captive uh that relative of mine they ended up getting audited and even if they do win what a headache just to save like 4% like who cares right just go and make that much more money without having the stress of a darn audit and if they do lose now they're literally going to have lost all the all the discovery time all the upkeep time all the conversion time all the the the the effort that goes into it they'll have to pay the fines and then they'll have to pay the cost of unwinding the darn thing right and all the attention that all of that took they could have been spending on increasing
(20:31) the value of the thing that actually compounds taxfree which is their business crazy all right okay so I didn't do the intentionally Grant tour trust and I just paid the darn taxes which brings me to point number four which is that tax shelters don't make you a better person all right so I only have two main points on this and I will I will drive this these these home because I think these are like as as we've gone down these points uh they become increasingly meaningful for me of actually how I make decisions and so these are the only two things that I've really made the decision with which is
(21:01) number one is reputational risk I believe that I will be a billionaire at some point before I die at this point we have about 100 million doll net worth between my wife and I and uh we're you know I'm 32 she's 29 and so like if I if we just get 10% a year like we will hit it and that's if we don't make any income and we don't grow businesses which that would drive me nuts and so we will be doing that so I think that at some point we will do that but who knows by then maybe billionaires everybody will be a billionaire and an apple will cost a million bucks who knows but the point is is that um I would never want
(21:30) to become a billionaire and then have everyone say he did it and escaped taxes I just don't want that brand I'm not saying there's nothing wrong with that like I don't think there's actually anything wrong with that if you did it legally right um but I would just prefer to be known as the person who paid his dues and still killed it that's just me that's a personal preference that's a reputational risk for me right and uh i' I've said this quote before on this channel but I'll say it again like you only get one name and you have to keep it for the rest of your life right and
(21:56) so it's like investing in accordingly I can't imagine like that at that point in my life if I were you know worth two billion or three billion and I could have been worth remember guys like if you're saving 30% right on your taxes it's only going to increase your net worth by that percentage like think about it so it's like if you're worth 10 million and you had saved 30% of your taxes you'd only be worth 30% more than that so it'd be like 13 million right like and just think about it like that it's like so it's not like this crazy like it's just that that's all it is
(22:27) right so number one is reputational risking for me I don't think I would ever sacrifice my reputation for that marginal gain all right number two 85-year-old self test and uh this is my number one most tweeted tweet which is when I was 20 I wanted to be a millionaire now that I'm a millionaire I want to be 20 and I overheard a version of this which makes me realize that when I'm 40 I'd rather just be 32 my age with nothing just to be 32 again which is a different frame on gratitude that I thought I'd share which brings me to my 85-year-old self test which by the way is probably the most useful
(22:56) decision-making frame I have ever made and is probably the thing that I use the most in thinking through everything in my life all right and so when I think about my 85-year-old self a Deca billionaire whatever and he's old and crass as hell and he's looking at 32-year-old self Alex he laughs at me at the idea of sacrificing anything for money sacrificing my youth to make more money that I won't need like I would give half of my net worth back to live my life wherever I wanted to during my youth and to make 12% more net worth if
(23:28) you're deciding between states like will I care if I have 9 billion or you know or or or 11 billion or 9 billion or 6 billion when I die no I won't and so I feel like I can Envision this conversation that I have with myself it's like don't don't sacrifice anything for me like I'm good I'm old like you're young enjoy like just soak in life because it's going to go away fast and like most of the things that you're concerned about won't matter and you will always have more than enough and you will never go hungry and you always
(23:59) have people around you who love you and so like just live and so this idea of obsessing over these shekels that we're going to give back at the end of our life just seems silly to me and that's at least why my 85-year-old self laughs at me for thinking about these things rather than just spending time in the places that I want with the people that I love all right which brings me why number four is that tax shelters don't make you a better person all right so so far we covered number one tax shels cost more than they save number two tax
(24:23) shelters don't increase your net worth number three tax shelters don't improve your life and number four tax shelters don't make you a better person all right right and so if you're mosy Nation you're like okay well what do I take from all this I'm going to give you six rules of thumb which is why I added an extra finger onto that palm and then seven beliefs that have served me well I told you I'm going to make one presentation to rule all others for myself and you so that I can also partially make this as an answer to a question that I had which is what do you do for taxes so this is it all right so
(24:47) if you're not going to listen to any of the advice that I said up to this point and just pay your taxes which by the way like to thank our special sponsor to the IRS um for sponsoring this video uh six rules of thumb for you all right so let let's dive in real tax savings typically come from three primary scenarios number one is when you give up ownership or control that's what charitable giving is right that's why trusts tend to be vehicles that people will use because if you do them correctly you no longer own
(25:11) the money which is why you don't owe the taxes on it right that's the idea all right so you either have to give up ownership or control typically to do that and so some people when they really see it they're like oh like so this isn't my money anymore it's like yeah now you can make the argument like well you control it because you control the person blah blah blah but the thing is is like there's a lot of steps there um and it's up to you but like that that is like when the real saving stuff comes from things like that number two is that they come from depreciation so in the
(25:36) tax code just like I mentioned earlier with real estate like the government wants you like the the tax code is just an incentive plan right it's it's the government's way of saying we want you to do this and not do this right and so they allow you to depreciate assets that you are buying uh which allows you to not pay taxes because they're basically function as losses right so if I buy a building for $10 million I might be able to depreciate $4 million of that building and if I had made $4 million that year then I could depreciate and have zero tax which by the way is how most people who run real estate funds do
(26:05) it is they don't give a lot of the depreciation the people who are investing and they as the general Partners will take a disproportionate amount of the depreciation from a company from the funds that they raise so that they can pay no money which is how Grant Cardone doesn't pay taxes right that's the idea that's how he does it through depreciation all right number three is deferral over elimination all right and so this is also just a rule of thumb is that like a lot of these structures allow you to defer the taxes rather than and eliminate them and so
(26:29) the idea is you basically defer them until you die but you're not necessarily eliminating them so the three ways at least that I have seen that have have been the most legitimate um across times Etc is are the are these Concepts all right um that being said here's some of the advice I have for you in almost all of these structures there is hair you must find it make sure it's really worth it factoring the cost of Discovery factor in the cost of conversion factor in the cost of upkeep into savings cost factor in the fee
(26:58) structure that they're going to impose upon you to do this whole thing right and whenever you hear someone say the wealthy You' been doing this forever it's just a sales pitch when they're like ah like the vils have been doing the structure for a hundred year like it's every single guy says that so just like just move on get over it right but you have to factor in the money the time and the attention that's going cost you and and could you allocate that into your business to get a much higher return something to think about right
(27:21) number three don't pretend to know things that you don't know don't be afraid to ask questions seriously anyone who makes you feel otherwise is not to be trusted all right I always start and this is a very true every single person in my company would know this especially my finance team like when we hop on calls with like experts and all this stuff I always say the same thing I say hey I just want you to pretend you're explaining the structure to a golden retriever all right who speaks Spanish all right pictures simple words I want to understand and if someone cannot explain something to you simply it's
(27:48) either because they're trying to confuse you or they it's because they do not understand it fully think about that people if you are confused and someone cannot explain something simply to you it is because either they do not understand it or it is because it's their desire to confuse you and seem intelligent neither of those scenarios are good for you so if they kind cannot explain it to you visually and simply I would say look run the other way all right because either they don't have the right intentions or they don't have the right skill level of skill all right so
(28:17) number four this is one now you're like okay I checked all the other boxes now always ask for people who've been doing this strategy for over a decade and ask to speak with them the reason for that is because the IRS will unwind things three to 5 years after they uh impose a clause because they'll find out that people are using it as a loophole in order to get through and evade taxes all right and so what they'll do is that's why you need to look at people who've been doing this for over a decade because they've already gone through a full IRS cycle and you can say okay you've been doing this for 11 years
(28:44) you've never had any audits you've never had any issues okay great let me talk to three other people because you might have just been lucky let me talk to you know a handful of people and see what was the cost of upkeep what was the cost of conversion what how much time per month you have to allocate to making sure that this continues to stay you know within the standards of the IRS and then and then is it worth it right number five always do background check on the person and the entities that the owner associate with quick story on this one I had a recent person say hey I
(29:12) think this thing's really legit I think it checks all the boxes blah blah blah and so I looked into it which is not something I normally do because I've kind of like made up my mind on this which is I just pay my taxes but that being said I decided to look into this one and literally on the first Google search I had of the guy who owned the entity all right and there's two there's two red flags right off the B number one is that the entity was a brand new entity which means that they're spinning up new entities all the time that is a big easy red flag of like why don't you
(29:35) have the same entities why are you trying to always change entities all the time that seems weird there's no reviews online Etc okay second is if and after I googled this person they had literally been indicted for tax evasion and I was like what and like one of the biggest tax evasion scandals in history right and uh uh and you know the guy who made the intro was like but they got to quit it and I'm like do you want the reputational risk of being associated with someone like that right and some someone might be like hey Alex can't believe you forgive he was proven like I
(30:10) get it there's just other people who hav it and for me I would rather just not take the risk that's just my two sents all right so always do a background check on the people and the entities they that they own and are associated with all right and then finally don't spend money on stuff that you wouldn't just to expense it all right this is one that I hear all the time like just expense it expense it right I'm saving X percentage on this like if you if you spend money that you otherwise wouldn't in order to save money because you don't have to pay taxes on the money it's cutting off your nose despite your face
(30:40) right like it's like oh I don't want to pay 30% of $100 or 40% of $100 so I'm just going to not even have $100 right that just doesn't make a lot of sense to me now if you were going to do it then by all means like if you want to reinvest in the business and that that's expensable then great then wonderful as long as it's an asset and here's the key point it's like if we can if we can if we can figure out a way that it can become an asset that's going to build value within the company and somehow it's expensable then fantastic right
(31:08) that's the idea uh but spending money on stuff that uh that you wouldn't otherwise just to not pay taxes is a very very very silly way of living life in my opinion and ultimately not one that is a good uh behavior that will build wealth over time all right so these are just my six rules of thumb that if you're not going to listen to the advice at least please do these things when you're thinking through some of these other tax structures that you come with and then finally these are the beliefs that I currently hold um I'm not saying you have to hold these but these are the things that have served me very well all right so number one is that
(31:37) attention is my number one most valuable asset never do anything that takes it without disproportionate return number two pay zero attention to tax saving schemes focus on the making not the saving number three whenever it decides to come up right number three there we go replace savings with orders of magnitude so instead of trying to think in increments think in orders of magnitude instead of saving 10% think about how can I 10x and you'll never have to worry about the taxes again number four never count your pennies on roads untaken all right it'll destroy your spirit and have you focus on the wrong part of your life your past versus
(32:06) the future so if you make one of the decisions to start living in the place you want to live or live in a state that you that you feel like being in whatever right don't start thinking oh I could have saved 12% over the last four years if I had that money right now like don't do that it'll destroy your life and probably you might not have made that money that you made now because you would not have been in this head space that you are currently Etc right at the end of the day there's just there's no benefit to it so once you make the decision move on all all right number
(32:29) five this one and this is this is a big one all right just remember that when I die and this is me right remembering that when I die the people that I compare myself too will also be dead right and here's a crazy one we will all be taxed at 100% as in we don't get to keep it no matter what and so here's my here's the probably the best analogy that I can give you which is a casino analogy and this is this is kind of how I imagine really life in the game overall right which is that I believe all of us are given a token in the in
(32:57) the casino of life right and we walk in the door and we sit down to the table and there's a bunch of other players around and we can and we get dealt cards and we play the cards that we're dealt right and depending on our skill uh in the game we can continue to amass and amass chips right and we get these Stacks and stacks and stacks of chips but the difference between a regular casino and the casino of life is in the regular Casino you can take these big chicks go to the counter cash out take your cash celebrate Etc and then you get
(33:23) to go spend that money but in the casino of life you have this big stack of chips and then when the Grim Reaper tapss you on the shoulder and says you can't play anymore you have to get up them table and the chips stay on the table and what they do is they push them right to the middle of the table and then everyone keeps playing with your chips and so for me when I think about it it's like do I just want to be in a nice Casino or a shitty casino but at the end of the day I have to give all the chips back and so for me when I think about it like that it's like no
(33:52) matter what happens I'm getting taxed 100% upon death and you might be like a legacy it's uh to me that's silly cuz sure multiply by 100 generations of people who don't know you Chang their last names and have mixed their their genetics with you you know uh one half to the hund power and no they're they're just humans and no they don't remember you and no they're not your your descendants they're just humans and so all of that stuff goes away with time and so it's like we're just here to play the game and all of the chips that we amass are going to get put back in the
(34:18) middle anyways and why sacrifice the lighting and the niess and the types of people that I get to play the game with so that I can potentially keep a higher percentage get in the table that I'm only going to give back at the end something to think about and then finally money exists to buy us options therefore do not trade optionality for it all right so um if you are new to this channel thank you um I make these videos because no one helped me learn this stuff I had to learn the stuff on my own or to pay a lot of money for
(34:44) these lessons uh either in mistakes or in experts and advice and so I hope that the pain that I experienced isn't in vain which is why I make these videos I just hope that someone can benefit from it and I like this visual here because we have these goals we fail we learn principles we improve and then we have more audacious goals and my goal for you guys is that you can just jump from audacious goals to more audacious goals because you can just use the lessons that someone else has already learned and suffer the pain of consequence for I
(35:08) repurpose that from Ray Delio's principles but I just really like that Visual and so um anyways welcome to mosy Nation if you're new appreciate you enjoy the video hopefully some of these takeaways can be helpful in your journey on taxes and Entrepreneurship love you and I'll see you in the next vid

Transcript:
(00:00) there's tons of other businesses that you can absolutely demolish who are making lots of money just by doing the basics and if you execute on that for 10 years your business Grows by default because your competitors won't do that growing businesses is hard because it's different than people expect it to be the singularity of focus is so important we get presented opportunities every single day that could distract us and the thing is the bigger you get the bigger the opportunities that get presented to you so the harder it is to
(00:24) say no I want to tell a quick story about the woman in the red dress and I'm going to relate it to business in The Matrix one of my favorite movies there's the woman in the red dress and so it's one of the training programs that Morpheus takes Neo on uh the main character to teach him one simple lesson and so they're walking through a crowd it's normal New York lots of people everyone looks different and then there's this woman in this red dress and Neo's head turns and morphis is still talking to him trying to teach him a
(00:46) lesson right and then he looks back and more if he's like re-listing and he was like what he's like were you looking at the one in the red dress and he says look again he looks back at the woman and it's agent Smith pointing his gun to his head the thing is is I see distractions and New Opportunities shiny object as the woman in the red dress and at every level of business the woman in the red dress becomes more and more attractive because at first you have to say no to thousand opportunities then ten thousand then a hundred thousand and
(01:07) you have to learn how to say no again at every level because I thought that once I learned how to say no to the one in the red dress I'd be done forever but that's not true she comes back every level she just gets hotter and hotter and hotter I used to think that like Innovation was everything and I think Innovation is important a very very small degree but the vast majority of the business success is actually doing all the stuff that you know you should be doing but you aren't A friend of mine has a wife who's really popular and they
(01:28) have literally 60 businesses he has an Excel sheet to keep track of all the businesses he has and I think they make about total between everything maybe eight figures a year and to some people like oh that's amazing but hear me out so we're having this long conversation and I just said you know if there were a magic wand and you could snap your fingers and eliminate all businesses but one how easy do you think it'd be to grow that business he was like oh my God it would be so easy to grow that to like 30 or 50 million I was like then why
(01:52) don't you do that and he said that that question has messed with him for an entire year and he has since that conversation shut down business after business after best business after business so that he could focus on the one that he thought was the biggest opportunity Mark Zuckerberg didn't have side hustles if you do one thing and you do it right you do it all the way you can get as big as you want you can have a long way business that cover the entire United States you could do that you could have a Cosmetics business that
(02:15) covers the entire United States you could have whatever type of business you want that covers everyone if you waited for a long enough for your time and didn't get distracted it's one of my favorite poses by Neil Strauss he said success comes down to doing the obvious thing for an uncommonly long period of time without convincing yourself you're smarter than you are it's the details that pay the dividends the depth and the Nuance of understanding how to do something and so for example right now obviously lots of opportunities that we
(02:38) have I still don't feel like we're doing the basics if we're not on every platform why are we thinking about starting a new business if we're not hardcore email marketing regularly and providing value why are we going to start another business if we're not even building the SEO out on our site why are we doing something else if we haven't completely built out the sales training for our sales team to keep their execution High why are we thinking about doing other things and so so many entrepreneurs that I see who are we're
(03:00) talking about how they want to grow their business and do this next new thing or this exciting add-on aren't even doing the basics and the thing and I've said this before but being Advanced means that you never don't do the basics and if you're like well Alex that's going to take so much time for me to do each of those things welcome to building a big business because big businesses do the same things little businesses do but they do them better and they fill the holes in the bucket and so if you were to think about a business as a bucket
(03:25) and you've got water pulling in the top which is the traffic or the eyeballs or whatever and then the bucket is what you're keeping right so the first thing that you're going to do if you want to grow the amount of water you have in the bucket is you don't have multiple buckets what you're going to do is probably fix the holes in the bucket you got number one fix the bucket number two once you fix the bucket increase the flow to the bucket once you've done that and you've completely maximized that then you add new flows but most people
(03:49) have never done that and so the moniker that I remember about this is better more new and so whenever I'm thinking about our business or our businesses in the portfolio I think have we maxed out better yet if we we have not maxed better yet there's no point in incurring the risk of more renew because more is riskier than better better is the lowest risk opportunity that everyone has do what you're currently doing do it better follow it faster follow up more make better copy make better creative optimize your site hire better people
(04:15) train them better have better Management Systems better incentive systems but you're like but Alex that sounds so boring welcome to Growing big it's how you do it you literally fill all the holes in the bucket that you know you should be doing but aren't if you were to make a list of the top 25 things that you could do in your business that you are not doing the obvious things that you know would make you more money if I emailed more admit more if I did more reach out to make more money if I made more content I make more money if I
(04:39) train my sales team or if I did more call reviews I'd make more money if I did reorganize our customer onboarding process if I created a better Cadence or training for our customer support team or customer success team we need to make more money put out every single one of the obvious bullets that you had that you know would grow your business instead of doing the new thing do those first and once you finish that list what you will see happen and this is why it's spiritually difficult as an Entre because we stopped doing the old thing
(05:01) we started the new thing and we got reinforcing that behavior and so we learned the wrong lesson we learned that when we start new things good things happen and so we think we should start new things this is where it's difficult and we have to learn at each level you started the new thing and you got rewarded but now if you start another thing you will get punished and some people never unlearn that first lesson and so you have to switch from new to better because the Innovation already happened when you got the product Market
(05:24) fit as soon as people started buying the thing you're selling that's when the new needs to end for a while because now you just need to do better and more so you fill the holes in the bucket with all the better and then you do more then you go from one piece of content a day to five pieces of content a day from one sales guy to five sales guys from one video editor to five video editors it's about doing more once you fix the first one and make it better businesses will grow by default and they will beat their
(05:48) competition if they do everything their competition does but better because what happens is most entrepreneurs will divert resources from their core thick think about the two paths boring entrepreneur number one who finally finds product Market that people like the stuff that they're are selling and then they say I'm not going to do anything new for the next five years all I'm going to do is do this better and do more of it that's all I'm going to do and then you think about the other guy who says oh we got some product Market
(06:09) fit fantastic now I'm gonna sell something else and I get to get my rock sock get my jollies off over here thinking about all this new stuff all this new marketing all this new product while the other business starts to wither away a little bit because atrophy starts happening because the things that were there when you're overseeing it aren't happening anymore anyways and not only that it's never improving and cost of media goes up cost of talent goes up and the business is literally getting worse relative to the market over time
(06:29) if you're not improving it and so you got these two entrepreneurs and this guy is diverting resources that would have been allocated back to the same bucket to fill the holes as instead taking some of that and trying to build another Bucket over here meanwhile the holes are getting bigger in the first bucket because it's getting worse and worse and worse and so then they find themselves with five buckets that are all tons of holes in them they don't have the bandwidth to actually go to the one bucket and fix it and that's when I
(06:50) asked the magic wand question so right now if you have multiple things going on how easy would it be to grow your business if I could wave a magic wand snap my fingers and everything ended except for one pretty easy right so why not stack the chips in your favor the thing that makes it hard is the discipline you have to have not the concept strategy is easy execution is hard it's the execution risk that is the much bigger risk for most businesses if you deliver dry cleaning that is always clean always and always on time you'll
(07:17) have an exceptional business the strategy isn't complicated it's the execution is where everyone fails but this is the thing is that the strategy is the new and exciting thing people allocate tons of attention tons of time two new strategies new ideas rather than making the obvious truth of if I deliver everyone their clothes on time and they are always perfectly clean this business will work one of the things that we do when we're growing the business after understanding better more new when we think about anything that we're growing
(07:41) is what are the need to believe what do we need to believe for this to grow we need to believe that people will always want things fast do is that something I want to bet on yes people always want a good product so that we clean their clothes perfectly every time do I believe that that's something that people want in the future as much they want to date or more yes people will always want good service do I believe that that's something we're on the future or in the day yes it's one of the Beautiful Things is that when you enter
(08:02) a Marketplace something as boring as dry cleaner boring as Lawn Care boring is whatever is that oftentimes you're actually not competing it's the smartest people in the world because smartest people in the world are on Silicon Valley all are trying to make the next platform but there's tons of other businesses that you can absolutely demolish who are making lots of money just by doing the basics and what makes them Basics is how hard they are to understand but what makes you Advanced is how well you execute them like it's
(08:23) not hard to conceptualize that you take 10 guys and each guy makes 200 calls a day it's 2 000 calls a day it's not hard to conceptualize that how well did you train them how well did you recruit them what is their incentive structure do you listen to calls on a regular basis is there a leaderboard because you're thinking yourself when you have that big list ah we need to do competitions for the sales thing oh I need to get that leaderboard set up oh yeah I need to be doing more call reviews that is the stuff that grows the business it's not
(08:43) the big idea people always want leads promise you you know how to get leads you know how to get them better you will make tons of money people always need a place to live you have better buildings that are cleaner and things run right and you treat your residence well you have successful buildings if you have uh lawn care where everyone communicates well and is cost effective and the the grass always looks great and the hedges are clean lines at the Cadence that's perfect for most people you will have a good business you might be competing
(09:06) against people who are not who don't even think that way and so you can absolutely take their lunch money but you have to not get fancy so when I was going through the sale process for two of our companies Bankers introduced me to a couple of other CEOs that they had done deals with because I I wanted to know what it was like after things like that like oh we can just connect with these guys so I talked to one of them and the conversation changed my life he was a mercenary CEO so he was a third time CEO that private Equity buy company
(09:29) Place him in he'd grow it and then they'd sell it and he had done that three times already so super seasoned guy he was a long island guy really thick accent he said you know everybody wants the super fancy trick plays you know it's like okay hike and then I you know fix to the left and then we go right and then it's actually going to be reverse you know whatever and then and then we toss it and then what do you know what happens he uh he catches it and then fumbles it and the other team takes it down for a touchdown he's like
(09:50) no we're doing Simple backyard football he's like two fat guys in the middle run to the right consistent yardage he's like don't be cute and he said that and it really changed the way I saw business you don't need to have any fancy play to be successful you just have to be willing to get the consistent yardage people want clean clothes people want them fast people want good service and if you execute on that for 10 years and you fill every hole in the bucket your business Grows by default because your competitors won't do that this is where
(10:20) I say like business is not hard in that it is not complicated it is hard because people cannot stay focused on the same thing for a long period of time it's also because once people make a certain amount of money if they only did it for the income they're trying to find the next thing that's going to make more income rather than the mission of the business because if you believe in the mission of the business you will be willing to do it for an extraordinary long period of time and I can tell you right now from all the friends that I
(10:41) have that make shitloads of money they've all been doing the same thing for a long period of time so as much as the world wants to tell you you should have 17 majors in college and you should taste everything and I think there's value to that it will not fight against the reality Ben Francis started gymshark when he was whatever 17 and now he's 28 or 29 he's got a billion dollar thing could he have tasted more stuff sure he tasted from like 14 to 17 right but then when he started that he's been doing it for 10 or 11 years now now he's a
(11:06) billion dollar thing the work needs doing and you just need to decide when you want to start the compounding clock in your favor which means how long can I commit to this thing and so I would say once you've had a little bit of your entrepreneurial licks as fast as you can to learn those lessons you have to think what need to believe is there that I do not think will change over an extended time Horizon and then serve that every day all you do is you look at how to do better and how to do more of it and it's
(11:28) going to kill you inside because you like doing new and that's what was positively reinforced your entire life as an entrepreneur in the beginning and then you have to unlearn that lesson because that's what it takes to get big is you do the same thing and you just do it that much better than everyone else and that takes time it is arrogant to believe that you are going to out compete other people who are fully focused on one thing when you're split on five like think about how arrogant it is to think that and the thing is plenty
(11:52) of people arrogant so many of you will still do this but you'll also still be poor so whatever some dude is he's got a lawn care business and all he does is longer all day every day that's all he does is molons and he believes that everybody deserves an amazing long because he's got a story when he's a kid and that was the only thing that his parents could do was cut the lawn to even though they were poor it was like something that gave them status neighborhood and he'd remember his dad crying because somebody give him a
(12:11) compliment on and he hadn't gotten a Coughlin forever whatever that reason is he's driven to make that company and he got the other guy who's like oh yeah I'm doing Drop Shipping I'm doing some Lawn Care stuff and I'm doing some Consulting gigs on the side for marketing and I'm you know I'm doing nfts whatever right he's got all these things going on who is going to win at lawn care it's obvious and yet we still live like this other guy and so my hope is that you recognize that if that's you stop and I'm only saying this from a place of
(12:37) love because I had nine businesses before Jim launch took off before you think oh well what I'm gonna do because I hear this all the time I'm gonna do them all and see which one takes off none of them will take off because any of them could take off if you just focus on one of them thinking that the outside Market is somehow gonna make you successful like you're gonna pick the right bet when you can force any of them to be successful right provider you're not selling newspapers and acquaintance Amaya from high school and he said hey
(12:59) I've got a roofing business you know it's awesome I said oh that's great and he said oh yeah we also uh do real estate flipping it was like okay all right he's like oh and we also do uh General Contracting okay he's like oh we do window stuff too that's actually glass and windows we do that stuff too because it's like you want to be vertically integrated for Real Estate I was like dude you're doing like four million bucks a year like you're not vertically integrated you're just distracted if you look at the biggest roofing
(13:21) companies in the world they're billion dollar companies billion multi-billion dollar companies you can do one thing to scale and make all the money you want and you will only get there with the scale from the details from the depth that's how you get these compounding returns from doing the same thing over and over again because you get better about a better at it the other guy who's got four things he's never gonna get good at any of them he's just gonna be barely good enough and he's going to make barely good enough money if you're
(13:42) not making money in any of the things is because you don't understand any of them well enough because if you can see anybody in your industry who's doing the thing that you're doing and making a hundred times more money than you it's because they know it better than you so how quickly you're going to pay down the ignorance you're going to try and divide it by four you're gonna try and pay down the ignorance instead of one of them as fast as you can so you can start the compound

(00:00) you really need to hear this out because it really changed my life and I hope it changes yours it's been a massive shift in the economy in 2022 and my investment thesis has changed I've taken all my cash out of Banks and I've put it somewhere else that's both safer and gets me a higher return the way you put your money has to shift because the economy has changed and at the very end of this video I'll tell you my entire investment strategy and what I have shifted towards now I'm 33 years old and I crossed 100 million dollars in net
(00:22) worth last year and much to my dismay there was no parade I'm still 2 000 times poorer than the richest man in the world no songs written about me let's talk most I have talked to many billionaires to try and figure out what my investment strategy was going to be to get from 100 million to a billion because the economy has changed things are priced differently there's inflationary pressures real estate is a is hanging on by a thread crypto is crashed stocks have crashed so before we can get into the investing part you have
(00:48) to understand what to actually do with the cash itself while you wait to make your moves what do you do with your cash if you've ever heard Warren Buffett or you heard people in the news say he has x billion dollars in cash or cash equivalents he doesn't actually have it sitting in cash he has it sitting in something else that's better and I'll explain what that is in a second I'm going to rewind and explain what actually putting cash into bank account means and why it's important in today's environment so when you put cash into a
(01:11) bank you're actually writing the bank alone to then loan your money and get something back people don't know this but you actually are a creditor of the bank so if a bank goes out of business they owe you money now what happens is the bank will do one of two things they will either loan money to the government by buying bonds now why do they do that because the likelihood risk that the government is going to be able to pay them back extremely high why because they can print the damn money and give it back to them or they will loan it out
(01:37) to people on mortgages and things like that they loan the money out again and they make more than they pay you and so right now if you look at your account they'll pay you between point one and one percent annually on your money boo that sucks they take your money for 0.1 percent a year and then they give it to the government and the government gives them four percent a year so they get 40 times what they pay you by giving the US government money now here's what's most important about debt when you loan people money there are two factors one
(02:03) is what are you going to get back which is the interest rate and the second is How likely are you going to get it the interest rate is if you've loan someone of money for a house and it's five percent or whatever then if you put 100 Grand and you get five thousand back and you get paid that for taking on risk now this is what's crazy and I didn't understand this when I was putting my money in the bank if the bank goes under you lose all your money outside of the FDIC insured amount the FDIC right now is completely bankrupt anyways and on
(02:26) top of that if it exceeds that amount you get stuck in the bankrupt company whoop-dee-doo what if there were a better alternative that was lower risk and had higher returns I just learned about this and the reason I always ignored it was because it looked boring and ugly what we decided to do before I tell you the big investment strategy that we've invested like the big money into we decided to take that money and buy U.
(02:48) S treasuries and you're like why would they do that because I'm not seeing treasuries as an investment vehicle I'm seeing it as a bank account who is more likely to go under Bank of America United States government Bank of America more likely to going who pays me more Bank of America U.S government U.S government on top of that you can take loans against treasuries for up to 80 percent of the value so if you get a hundred thousand dollars in treasuries and you get four thousand dollars a year in interest I could take a loan for up to eighty thousand dollars keep earning
(03:17) my interest and then put it somewhere else you're like why don't they talk about this they are happy to take your money and go make five percent on it and pay you point one that's the business why would they tell people my entire structure of Investments has changed over the last five years really last ten years the first chunk of my life was SME 500 I put all my excess cash into learning skills getting access to people coaching mentorships workshops Etc highest return investment I still have ever made today number two once I had
(03:43) more money than I could possibly reinvest in courses and coaching and whatnot I started applying it into the S P 500 because that's what Uncle Warren told me to do I figured if it worked for him would work for me the third phase came post sale all right so we sold three companies last year I talked to a bunch of different friends who were very very wealthy and one of them is a very good investor he outlined a strategy for me they called a barbell strategy which is I have stocks over here real estate over here very little between and then I
(04:06) just have my private equities of the companies that I own so I'd make money here and plowed into these two right with basically nothing in between here's the thing that you don't know in the last two years I've maybe made five Investments and those Investments represent in total maybe 10 of the cash that I have I didn't realize what the problem was until I saw a video from Dave Ramsey and before you cast judgment you really need to hear this out because it really changed my life and I hope it changes yours so I was watching a video
(04:29) where Graham Stefan was having Dave Ramsey analyze his Investment Portfolio and he said hey Dave don't you feel like I'm over indexed on real estate 80 plus percent of my net worth is in real estate deals Dave Ramsey gave one of the wisest responses that I've ever heard in investing and it changed my life he said well Graham if you put a big circle on the table and I'm Loosely paraphrasing and we had to say what percentage of your knowledge is real estate versus stocks and bonds and other stuff what would you say it is he said oh well I
(04:58) don't know 80 85 of what I know is really about real estate and he looked at him he was like well then that's a perfect distribution for you because it reflects your knowledge if we were going to put a portfolio together of your knowledge base it would be 80 real estate 20 stocks maybe so where you invest is what you know and so then he went on to say I have talked to many many billionaires probably far more than I have he said I've learned two things from them they don't do many things and the things they pick are
(05:25) things they understand and they do a lot of them they find something that they like and that they understand and that they're good at and they do it a lot and for whatever reason the combination of understanding that in the circle this is the slice of the pie that he knew and that the people were the richest in the world just pick one game or two games they know really well and they do a ton of those games is what changed my perspective my takeaway was not oh I should go have 85 percent of my portfolio be real estate because 85 of
(05:52) my knowledge on investing is not real estate and the reason I wasn't able to write checks for two years despite having this theoretical barbell strategy you know we had laid out with a friend of mine who's awesome investing is that that was his investment strategy was it Alex's investment strategy what are the things that I actually know it turns out not a lot what I am good at is we're very good at service based businesses that is where I thrive if I just write my money into deals there I could do that with my eyes closed and so I had a
(06:18) deal that came to me recently way bigger than any real estate deal that I've ever even thought about participating in I just looked at the guy and I was like I will write you an unlimited check how much do you want I understand that business this is something that I've spent my entire life doing and this is a Warren Buffett quote it's only risky if you don't know what you're doing and so if you don't know what you're doing the reason he gives the S P 500 advice is that you don't know what you're doing so just put it into 500 companies and
(06:41) you'll be okay but where you get the outsized returns is playing in a game where you have an unfair Advantage where you know more than everybody else does now I'm at a point where I feel pretty comfortable writing sizable checks into actual private deals I'm actually pretty risk-averse but in this world I know the risks and so I can name them and I can know where to look for them and I'm like oh this is appropriate risky if you don't know what you're doing step one invest in you step two invest access in indexes and then when you feel like
(07:07) you're good enough at your main game then you have the stockpile and you can deploy it and then that starts the compounding machine my investment strategy after all of this time has gone completely back to my business strategy which is singular Focus do the things you know do more do it better and keep doing that for an extended period of time and it would be unreasonable that you don't win

My Best Sales Tactic (to Make a TON of Money) - YouTube
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bx48qPlaGvE

Transcript:
(00:00) I want to tell you about the most powerful sales tactic that I have learned I never learned it from a book I actually learned it by accident and it will be included in the 100 million dollar sales book when it comes out and so you heard it here first but it's a concept that you can do as a salesperson to gain trust and I stumbled into this I ended up selling a hundred percent of people after I made this one switch and how I sold and I was able to teach it to people who'd never sold before and they were able to close 80 90 of people who
(00:24) are coming in the door mind you this is a retail environment selling physical products so rewind the clock I was selling supplements at my gym and the way that we would sell supplements is that we'd sell some sort of service package and then we'd do a nutrition orientation the camp the nutrition orientation we'd actually you know set them up with their meal plans and then we'd make recommendations for products now normally I would sell pretty well but still I always wanted to sell more and get better we'd killed this launch
(00:46) for like a new challenge or something and we had a hundred new customers there come in and I ran out one of the key uh products I had ladies come in the first half of the day and able to get the products and then some of their friends who signed up with them came in the second half of the day and were like hey my friend Sandy told me that I need X X Y and Z and I was like oh we don't have Z anymore and it was like really awkward and I was like a lady came in and so rather than me try and skirt around this clear item that was on the list that I
(01:12) didn't have I said hey by the way you can get this one for cheaper down the street at Costco so like you don't need to get this one from me like this one's a little better but I think it'll get the job done you can get this one after you've done the program and they're like oh thanks like that was cool after I made that one crossout I was like but you do want this and this from us and they're like okay cool as soon as I made that switch from saying hey you don't need to buy this one you can get that from over there everyone bought what I
(01:38) recommended afterwards and I was like whoa and so then I leaned into that and was like I wonder if I could do more of that so I could sell even more on the back side so then I had two products that I was like hey you can get this and this over here get this brand it should be at this price you can go get it it'll save you 10 or 20 bucks and they were like wow even better and then I remember I looked at my list and there was you know a lady that it was like a mass Gator and she obviously wasn't trying to gain mass and so I was like you're not
(02:03) trying to gain Mass art and she's like no I was like you can just cross that out go ahead you don't worry about that and so I gave her recommendation two things that she could get for cheaper and then I said you don't need to worry about this and then when I said hey like I need you to take two of these in the morning next to this take three of these take them next to this put this in your car so you always have it with you I closed everyone what that gave birth to was something that I used to call sacrificial Lambs but now call ghost
(02:23) products because it sounds better but I ended up over time not even carrying the products that I had on there that I was recommending out because they were so powerful as a sales tool for me to gain trust from the other person this is an incredibly incredibly powerful tactic and like all persuasion the difference between manipulation and help is intention and so if you want to help someone you are manipulating them but you're just doing it in a positive intent now and if you change someone's behavior and you have negative intent
(02:51) you are manipulating them if you believe in the stuff that you sell you can create an environment where someone will trust you faster by giving them a reason to trust you and so that means that you acted in their self-interest rather than your own so that they can feel like you're not trying to take advantage of them now if you know that they need this stuff but they don't yet know that they need the stuff then you can make a concession using a ghost product or using a sacrificial lamb so that you can gain the trust faster and so if you feel
(03:15) uncomfortable about not having the product on your menu then you feel free to carry a product and never sell it if you feel like it but I realized quickly that I was never selling it and I was always giving those ones away and so if you're going to use this tactic my recommendation is to make the products that you send across the street to be the ones that are the lowest margin product gain the trust by giving away the low margin stuff and then keep the high marching stuff for yourself so that people trust you and then they buy that
(03:41) stuff and so if you're in an environment where you sell multiple products this has been the most effective way that I've learned to sell what you want to do is give someone a vision of what their life's going to be like when they're experiencing the benefits and so you want to explain to them exactly how to take it before you make the ass what we would do is say hey a this one is going to help you do benefit benefit the way that I need you to take it need you to take it is that you're going to take two of these in the morning then I ask a
(04:09) question and I'm like what do you do every day no matter what in the morning do you wake up and smoke a cigarette do you drink a cup of coffee do you take a shower like brush your teeth like what's something you do every morning and then they say well I brush my teeth every morning I'm like cool so I don't want you to put this in your cupboard because you'll forget about it I want you to put it next to your toothbrush so we don't have to make a new habit they're like oh and what I want you to do piece of tape
(04:28) put a two on it I want you to take two of them we're gonna put an extra toothbrush got it that's number one I would go through that with each of the products that I have and I would say okay you can have all these you're good to go did you just want to use the cards you have on file now they don't have to take their wallet out they don't have to make another purchase decision they just have to say yes it's a one-click upsell that is a combination of a prescriptive clothes and having ghost products to set up trust you're also being a good coach
(04:52) by showing them how they're going to make this happen in the rower now this is obviously a consumption based product any product that you want someone to use they have to use it at a certain point and and so we want to figure out ways to associate the usage of the act of the product with something they're already doing getting someone to make a new habits incredibly difficult getting someone to break a habit is incredibly difficult and so we just want to piggyback on habits they already have and so that makes you both a better
(05:13) salesperson and better Coach like overall if you're trying to help someone and so that kind of selling process that set close getting the trust make the prescription Works unbelievably well and then if for some reason the point person's like well how much does this cost blah blah blah then you can say well are you on a budget and if they're like I'm on a budget that's like okay then would you like me to order these in order of importance and the things that I think you absolutely need to have versus things that'll just get you more
(05:38) benefits faster what I would then do is take off one and say this would be the lowest one I'd remove does this work for you and if they're like I can't do that I'd be like really getting into the Bare Bones here I'd be like I could take this one out but like this is what I want you to add to your diet to replace this thing you don't want to show that what you took out isn't important because then it looks like you're selling stuff doesn't matter so like these are ingredients but you're gonna have to eat a shitload of broccoli now all right so
(05:58) you okay that you know what I'll just get the thing okay cool now it's back in hopefully when you're selling something you're trying to solve a problem if they don't buy the thing then you reintroduce the problem that you were solving so it's like hey I don't want you have to eat a pound of broccoli which is why I had this they're trusting me to make the prescription because that's why they're paying you for expertise and then you can pause and say well are there things that are your old identity that you're
(06:18) going to stop doing as a result of doing this program are you going to go out less you're going to drink less or you're going to smoke less or you're going to whatever last I'm like cool well how much of that do you do cool we just found some money don't worry about it let's associate with these new activities new identity if this sounds really smooth I've done this a lot of times you'll get used to it and I think one of the best gifts you can have is trying to tack yourself into an existing sales process of a big business so if
(06:41) you work at a business that sells lots of low ticket stuff like think car washes massage think Nails think hair stuff where they just see lots of people every day at low tickets see if you can work with a business owner and incorporate some sort of inject yourself into their sales process so that you can get rep after rep after rep after rep and it will teach you more about the skill of selling and dealing with people than any course ever will and it will equip you for whatever you want to sell for the rest of your life it's one of
(07:07) the best things I ever did was do tons and tons of transactions at low tickets so that when I got to selling higher ticket more expensive stuff I was like oh my God this is a breeze if you sold Services let's say you sold Web Design Services and you had like a laundry list of stuff you could say hey we this is like we can do this but it's not necessarily our core capability and it would probably cost you more if we did it because we'd have to allocate more resources so there's guys in the Philippines that will do it for you I've
(07:30) got a connection I can I can talk to you to about after this call and if you really want to be sneaky about it if you're the owner it's harder if you're a salesperson owners tell your sales people this you can have it seem like they're leaning on their side of the table to be like hey man like you don't need to worry about this like just I'll hook you up with a number of a guy and then the sales person becomes incredibly trusted it becomes like they're on that side of the table but what the person doesn't know is that they're trying to
(07:53) sell the other stuff at the end of the day the goal as a salesperson is to move to their side of the table if you start the conversation across the table the goal to end shoulder to shoulder so that you're both looking at the decision together with the same information to make the best decision for the person and so if you can walk yourself around the table psychologically this is one of the fastest ways to do it

How I Would Build a Business in 2025 (If I Had to Start Over) - YouTube
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7bLRKwKSms

Transcript:
(00:00) I've been in business for 14 years. I have a portfolio of companies that last year did over $250 million in aggregate revenue. And if I had to start over from scratch today, this is the most important concept uh to learn, right? And so I want to be clear, this is not a tactic. It's not a funnel.
(00:14) It's actually a ratio. And once you understand it, you'll never really see business the same way again. And the way I like to think about this is that there's a lot of people out, you know, in the marketplace who talk about different methods. But what this is is about a better model. And the thing is is that methods expire.
(00:28) Methods are like onetrick ponies. you figure out a new DM hack, you figure out a new way to, you know, get your content to go viral with a new hashtag, whatever, right? Those are methods. Those are tiny tactics, but those change all the time. The things that endure are the models. It's the economics of the business itself, right? And so that is the engine that fuels everything.
(00:49) And so, everyone likes to talk about marketing, content, branding, etc., but none of it matters if you run out of money. And so, let's think about the number one rule of business is don't go out of business. And so what's the thing that prevents you from going out of business? Cash flow. And so if you can manage your cash flow, then you can basically stay in business forever.
(01:05) You can continue to play the game. In Silicon Valley, they're able to do this by artificially inflating the cash they have in the business by raising money from the outside. Now, the vast majority of businesses, 99% of business owners, don't have outside investors beyond themselves. Most businesses are bootstrapped.
(01:22) And so, if your cash is the only thing the business relies on, you better well make sure that you build a business that makes cash flow. so that you can stay in business. And so what I'm going to walk you through is basically the concept that unlocked my business career. So to illustrate the concept, I'm going to kind of tell you the tale of two businesses.
(01:39) And this tale is actually what I built, you know, my my wealth off of this idea. So like I mean it made me a deculta millionaire. So maybe worth paying attention to. So when I entered the gym industry, they were running things what they called LBOS's, which is funny because in the in the M&A world, LBO is a leverage buyout.
(01:56) But in the gym owner world, it was a low barrier offer, right? That's what it that's what it meant. Sometimes now people call it a low ticket offer, but they would go they would run these $21 21-day programs, right? And this was like kind of like industry standard. That's what everyone ran. So you get 21 bucks for 21 days and then afterwards you try and convert them from $21 into a $99 per month membership, right? And this would take 21 days. Okay.
(02:18) What we came in to start doing is we ran uh six-w week challenges. And with our six week challenges, we would get $600 upfront day one. And then we would sell another $200 of supplements within the next 48 hours. And then at week three, we would get them to prepay for the year. And so we would get another $2,000.
(02:43) Now, of course, not every single person took every one of these upsells, but blended, we'd be looking somewhere in the neighborhood at a thousandish dollars within basically the first 30 days. Now, look at the difference in economics between $21 in the first 30 days and $1,000. So, if these two people or these two businesses are competing in the same marketplace, which is an auction of attention quite literally when you're running ads, who do you think can outspend whom? This guy by a mile.
(03:11) And so when we entered the space, our gyms that ran our model, not method, our model, didn't matter what advertising platform we were advertising on, could outspend the competition handily. So fundamentally, the business that can make more money from its customer than its competitors wins. And so because you make more money than your competitors off your customers, then it means you can spend more to acquire them.
(03:34) And if you can spend more, then it means you have a veritable monopoly over the attention. Because think about every one of these eyeballs has a little auction that's going on in real time every day. If I can outspend everybody in my market and I can actually have the ability to deliver on all of these customers, guess what I can do? I can buy up 100% of the advertising space and have a legal monopoly over that market because I can just outspend everybody.
(03:59) Now, it's not like I have some network effect on pricing people out. It has nothing to do with that. If anything, I make more money from customers so I can charge I can pay more to get them. I'm not undercutting them and doing competitive practices. It's the opposite. I'm competing by having a better model. And so these guys would lose money because for them it would still cost them about $100 to get a customer.
(04:19) So you're like, wait a second, why would they pay $100 to make 21? This actually happens all the time in business. And then they'd get one out of three of these people to buy the $99 thing. And so it's really closer to $300 for them to get a $99 membership, which on average would stay six months. not a very good business, but this is what the industry standard was.
(04:39) But for us, we're making a thousand plus and for us, if we had $300 and it cost us less because our offer was actually better, we were able to acquire and then continue to profit this whole period of time. So, if you have these two businesses, if you're in business one, do you have a marketing budget? Of course you do, because you have to limit how much you're burning to get customers because you're losing money getting them.
(04:58) So, you have to say, "Okay, we're willing to spend, you know, $4,000 and we're going to get 40 people to buy our $21 thing. That's what we're willing to spend." And we're going to wait until we get these people to add into our recurring revenue and then we might be able to spend $5,000 the next month. But, we have to budget it. Now, in scenario two here, what is our marketing budget for this business? Well, if it cost you a hundred bucks to make a thousand, what's your budget? You spend as many dollars as you possibly can and keep those numbers. That's how you do
(05:27) it. And so this is what allowed me to bankroll the opening of each of my gym facilities when I had them beyond the first one and to open all of them at full capacity on the first day, which is not common. And so basically, this is what it would look like. I would put $5,000 into a bank account and I would sign a lease.
(05:47) And then I would start running ads for $100 a day. From those $100 a day of ads, I would get 10 leads. From those 10 leads, I knew that I was going to close two of those leads. From those two leads, I knew that I was going to get, let's call it, $600 each. So, I was getting 1,200 bucks immediately from the $100 that I spent earlier that day.
(06:15) Now, what's going to happen to my bank account? Well, I was at 4,900, but now I have $1,200 more. So now my 4,900 becomes 6,100, and I repeat the cycle again tomorrow. Now, if I did this every day, then I would make an extra call it $30,000 in profit month one. But I was a sneaky sneaky guy. And so instead of spending $100, I would spend $500 every day.
(06:43) And then with that money, there was some inefficiencies that happened. Sometimes lead costs went up, etc. But I would usually be able to generate upwards of $100,000 in sales within that period of time from one gym. And so with that $100,000, guess what it cost to open a gym? A little bit less than $100,000.
(07:01) And so I was able to finance the opening of each of my gyms by putting $5,000 into the bank account, running through this black box, and then getting $100,000 on the other side in that first month. And so that then allowed me to buy the equipment. It did the flooring. I bought the sign. I did the painting.
(07:17) I put the lobby in place. I got my weights. I got everything I needed, the sound system, right? Merch, all that stuff set up so that at the end of the 30 days of the pre-sale, I could then kick the gym off completely outfitted, completely paid for by the customers that now started. And then 6 weeks after that, we would roll those customers into a recurring membership.
(07:38) And then at that point, 6 weeks later, the business was cash flow positive. And this is how when I was in my very early 20s, I was able to open up six locations off of the cash flow that the business was able to generate and in such a short period of time. And so the thing is is that every single business can build a box like this with skill.
(07:56) So coming back to the number one most important business concept, this is what you need to know. Number one is what what's a customer worth to you? over 30 days. Now, the reason I limit it to 30 days is because that's typically as long as most small businesses can handle from a cash flow perspective, as in like you're willing to pay money, wait 30 days to get it back.
(08:27) That's also because that's the the interestfree time period where people will give you money for no interest. Credit cards are interest free for the first 30 days. And so, you basically are limited by your ability to get credit if you actually had no money. But if you do have some money, then still you want to recover it back within the first 30 days.
(08:40) That's a rule of thumb. Now, the second thing is, okay, we know what a customer is worth to us. We know what gross profit, how much we're going to make from them after we pay the cost of delivering whatever it is that we sell. The next is what's a customer cost me? Now, what I'm going be clear here is I'm not talking about cost me to deliver.
(09:00) I'm saying what does it cost me to get them? So, what do I have to spend in marketing, in advertising, in content, in sales commissions to get a customer in the door? And you have to know these two numbers, number one and number two. And ideally, number one is greater than number two, right? Like, we want to make sure we're making more money from customers than it costs us to make it.
(09:21) And the thing is is if you don't understand your business math, you'll continue to blame other things, right? You'll continue to blame your methods. Oh, Facebook doesn't work for me. Oh, outbound doesn't work for me. content doesn't work for me. Well, imagine you're in this scenario, right? Is it actually an issue with Facebook ads? Is is it the ads that aren't working? Is it the method that's not working? Or is it the model? You have a model issue.
(09:45) If you could make hypothetically a billion dollars from a customer, you could spend 12 cents to reach every single person on Earth and just try to get one customer. That would be a business that could probably spend a lot of money. Real quick, I have a gift for you. This is the $und00 million scaling roadmap.
(10:00) It's something that my team and I put 200 plus hours into building and breaking the stages of scaling into 10 steps. All right. And so what we did is we broke down everything that got us basically got us stuck and what we did to break free at each level of the business. And if you'd like to know what product, marketing, sales, customer service, IT, recruiting, human uh resources, and finance look like at the stage that you're currently at.
(10:22) This is a free gift. So all you have to do is go to aquis.com/roadmap. You can plug in your business information. And if you want our help, you want my help to help you break through whatever level of scaling you're at, this is not a promise. I'm just saying I'd love to help. Um, on the thank you page, you can book a call.
(10:35) Uh, every month we have a workshop out here at my headquarters. You actually talk to my real team that does does our marketing, does our emails, does our ads, does our copy, does our does our does our sales, does our finance, does our recruiting. The real people are doing this at a very high level. And what's really cool about that is that they can typically find and spot what the constraints are in a business like that.
(10:54) And so it's one of the most valuable things that I could possibly do. Obviously, you know, space is limited based on our actual headquarters. Um, but if that's interesting, on the thank you page, you can book a call. No pressure. This is a gift either way. It's absolutely free. Now, I've been I've been I've been hiding the the the real words for this, but thankfully, business actually has a term for this, which is the lifetime gross profit, which is LTGP.
(11:23) Sometimes people refer to this as LTV or CLV, customer lifetime value, lifetime value. All of these more or less mean the same thing. What's the amount of money you make after you spend whatever you got to spend in delivering for the customer? What's the extra cash on top? If you they pay you 100 bucks, it cost you 20 to deliver a sandwich.
(11:40) 80 bucks is your gross profit. If they do that 10 times, $800 is the lifetime gross profit. All right. Now, what's a customer cost me? This is CAC. This is cost of acquiring customer. That's what that stands for. All right. So, this is our ratio of LTV to CAC. Here we go. Now, if you can do this math for yourself, and I'll give you the back and napkin way of looking at this because you're probably like, I don't track this stuff. And that's okay.
(12:03) Look at what you spent in marketing for all of last year. Okay? So, do a whole year. Very simple. You can just look at the line item, what you spend in advertising, what you spend in labor that's associated with it. So, you might have a videographer or a contractor. You might have spent some money on ads.
(12:16) You might have spent some money in commissions. Everything that it takes to cost to get a customer. Okay? all of those cost. You add them together and then you look at how many new customers did I get last year. Maybe you got a 100 customers and let's say it cost you $100,000. Okay, so that means it cost you $1,000 per customer.
(12:31) Okay, this should make sense. That gives you how much your CAC is. And the nice thing is that CAC's the easiest one to calculate. You just literally look at your cost divided by customers. That's it. I'll give you the back of napkin simplest way to do it which is revenue divided by number of total customers. Now I want to be clear.
(13:00) This is going to give us our lifetime revenue. We still have to look at our gross profit here. So we would just multiply that number by gross profits. And if you're not sure what your gross profits are, if it cost you 20 bucks to make a sandwich and you charge a h 100 bucks, then your gross profit is 80, meaning 80%.
(13:17) All right? So you'd multiply that number by 80% and that's what your lifetime gross profit's going to be. So I'll also give you the simplest way to do gross profit. So I'm giving you the back and napkin quick and dirty ways, but you know what's interesting that I found is that the back of napkin way when you do it over an extended period of time tends to be the most accurate because it takes you don't have these good months and bad months.
(13:36) It actually gives you a more accurate picture of your business. All right. So, the way you do it is you look at uh total costs of goods, which some people call COGS. All right? Or cost of delivery if you have a service. So, it's like if you have a bunch of reps and you have some software that you use to deliver or you've got some contractors that you deliver some stuff, whatever it costs you to deliver for all customers for the whole year divided by number of customers.
(14:06) That's it. So that'll give you what your cost per customer is. And so if we then take our lifetime revenue and subtract our cost per customer, then we'll get our lifetime value. All right, which is the gross profit per customer. And that's like a very real way of doing that. So we have, you know, two variables, simple divisions with some simple subtraction.
(14:34) All right, so this is not intimidating math. And if this intimidates you, I would encourage you to get over it because this is this is this is not even this is third grade math. I don't know when they teach multiplication, division, but I think it's around third grade. All right? It's not a lot, okay? Like you can do this. Like literally, all you have to do is just add up just add up the line item at the end of your bookkeeping because your bookkeeper probably does this.
(14:54) Just look at your advertising total, look at your sales commission total, look at your your payroll total for everything else that's not marketing and salesreated. And then you add all that stuff up together and you look at how many customers you have in total that are active and then you divide it. And so the end result here is that you're going to have an LTV number or lifetime gross profit number whatever it is and you're going to have a CAC number on average for the last year.
(15:18) Now ideally you want the ratio between these numbers to be as big as possible. Now I'm going to give you three kind of considerations for this. Many of the people in the software world, the very smart Silicon Valley people talk about a rule of th one, which is you want to make sure that you're making at least $3 in gross profit per customer for every dollar it cost to get them. Okay.
(15:43) Now, having done business for a while now, that is only true under the conditions where you have all three elements of business that are automated. And you're like, what are the what are the components of business? Basically, lead generation has to be automated. Conversion has to be automated. So sales, how you going to get people to to to give you money, right? And then you have delivery or fulfillment.
(16:06) These are the three components that have to be automated. If all three are automated, yes, 3:1 works. Now, if two of the three are automated, right? So let's say this one isn't automated, this one is, and this one is, then I think you change that to about six to one. Now, if two of them are not automated and only one of them is, I think you change that to nine to one.
(16:27) That's at minimum. And then finally, if all three are not automated, meaning you have people at every one of these steps in the process, you need to be at over 12 to one. Now, you might be like, wow, that's a lot different than what I have, right? And that's why we need to improve it, which is what I'm going to talk about next.
(16:42) Now, you might hear this and then wonder like, wait, what degree is does this like the checks and the X's? What does that even mean? Okay, so lead genen, something that's high leverage would be like making content. That's one to many. Running ads, one to many. Those are things that would qualify to me as being high leverage.
(16:59) It's not one person. You don't have manual labor that's really installed there in order. You're not limited by human. Now, if you're doing manual outreach in order to get customers, you would be limited there, right? If you have viral coefficient, it's all word of mouth and it's compounding. That has high leverage, right? So, if you were doing outreach as your primary way of getting customers, well, there's nothing wrong with doing that to be clear.
(17:19) But if you do a manual process, then you're going to have an X here. So, it's going to mean you're gonna have to increase your LTV to CAC ratio. Now, if you're like, why do I have to do this? The reason that this ratio has to increase is because there's a number of costs that the business incurs as you scale. So, number one is the cost of getting new customers is actually going to go up as you go to colder and colder markets.
(17:39) Cost of getting customer, believe it or not, always goes up over time. So you might whatever you have today, believe it or not, is likely going to be the best cost per car customer you're ever going to get. All right? Because CPMs go up over time. This is a fact of life. More competitors enter the marketplace, this is a fact of life.
(17:53) And even if neither of those things are true, and you just went into colder and colder markets, as in you scaled up your advertising, you're going to reach people that the algorithm thinks are slightly less likely than the first people that they displayed your ads to, which means it's going to cost more because it's going to have to show it to more eyeballs to get the same number of conversions.
(18:09) So it's going to cost you more per customer. you're going up the interest graph, right? You're going up kind of the normal curve of people are less and less interested as you go colder and colder and spend more and more. That's number one. The second reason that this is important is that you're going to put in layers of infrastructure in your business.
(18:22) You're going to have levels of management. And these things, although they suck, still add cost to business as it scales. And so, you're going to need some padding in terms of your lifetime gross profit to be able to afford this level of scaling. And typically, customers that come in later are less sold on the idea and sometimes are worth less.
(18:39) So they actually end up spending less money over time. And so all of these reasons kind of compound together. And the last one which is so important when it comes to this X mark is that when you have people in every one of these processes, whenever you hit a point of kind of saturation, you've hit the capacity of let's say your sales team.
(18:55) Let's say you've got five guys that are proficient, they do well. Well, at some point you're going to have to scale your sales. And so you're going to bring a sixth person in or seventh person in. But that new sales guy is not going to be as good as the first five. It's going to take time for them to get good, for them to get on.
(19:08) Same thing when it comes to marketing. You're going to have to have a new marketer who's going to come. He's not going to be as good at making content. He's going to have to get reps. Same thing on delivery. You might have some star account reps on the back end that do some level of of service delivery and you have to bring somebody else up to speed.
(19:19) But the thing is is the business has to incur that cost immediately day one and doesn't always get the return on that for a few months. And so if you're at 3:1 and then you have these all of a sudden, imagine this, you're at 3:1, but then you have to bring in a new marketer, you have to bring in new sales people, and you have to bring in new account reps.
(19:34) Well, all of your metrics are going to suffer, which means all of a sudden you're going to go from barely being profitable to probably not being profitable at all. And so, we have to have this these increases for each level of manual that enters the business in terms of manual labor so that we have padding and cushion for cash flow in order to scale because the number one rule of business is you have to you can stay in business as long as you got money.
(19:56) That's the rule. And so, we have to make sure our economics of the business support the fact that we're going to have inefficiencies as we scale and it's going to be lumpy, right? right? We have to bring in a whole bunch of new sales guys. Our conversion rates are going to tank. But we have to have the business economics, the model to support that.
(20:08) Because if the only way your business works is that you're selling, you're never going to scale. You have to fix the model. I could make 20 books and movies on on on what you do to increase this ratio. How do you improve it? All right. So, off the off the top of my head, all right, some things that you can do to immediately make more money.
(20:26) Number one is you can raise the price. Number two is that you can decrease costs. Number three is that you can have upsells. Number four is that you can add downells, which means that a higher percentage of customers who otherwise wouldn't have bought now do. So you actually make more money per because you actually sell more people.
(20:41) If you start selling uh expensive people who would have bought an expensive thing, a cheap thing, you make less money. So you got to be very careful with downells. Um you can add in financing. All right, this is something that pulls cash forward. Again, this is from a cash flow perspective. You can change the terms of how you collect payment.
(20:56) You can say, you know what, you can have a payment plan and you can pay as long as you want, but we don't start working until you pay off everything, right? There are different ways that we can structure these things that we can frontload the cash in the business. You can also have cross- sales, which means that you sell them something different.
(21:11) Rather than higher quality or more of something, you actually sell something different. You sell a burger with fries rather than a bigger burger or a better burger. Right? And as I'm going through these things, you should absolutely know how to be able to apply this to any business. All right? So if I have let's say we'll take let's take take this book. All right.
(21:30) So if I wanted to run through this I could raise the price of my book. I could buy in larger economies of scale to decrease the cost of the book or I could figure out what I could do from a shipping perspective to negotiate better rates on my shipping. Um I could have maybe AI support so that I don't have to have as many people to manage kind of shipping issues.
(21:48) I could upsell a nicer version of this book. So instead of being a digital book, I could upsell a hard version of this book. or I could give you audio and a hard copy and ebook version of this book. If I wanted to cross-ell, I would sell a second book that was different than the original book. If I needed financing, which for the you hope that people don't need financing for a book, but I could introduce financing so that people could pay for this book up front.
(22:11) And so all of these different and if I have a the downell here is the reverse of the upsell. If people can't afford my hardback, then I say, why don't you have one of my digital copies which is cheaper. All right? And so every business you should be able to on the top of your head think of ways to apply this.
(22:23) I'm going to do this again because I think it's worth doing. All right. What is this? This is a table. All right. So I can increase the price of my table. I can decrease the cost of of manufacturing this table. I can upsell a higher quality table. So I can say, "Hey, let's make this marble, right? Or I can downell a wood or plastic version. I can cross-ell chairs or table covers that go with this thing.
(22:44) I can add a warranty on top of this that I can upsell or cross-ell, excuse me. um I can add financing or I can change the terms of collection. All of these things are things that can drive up the lifetime value. And if you can't go through that exercise with your business, you don't understand your business well enough.
(22:58) You could absolutely do this with any business. It's actually harder with physical products than it is with services. Now, of course, what every business owner wants is they want cheaper customers because no one ever wants to admit that their business isn't that good. And the reality is most business owners want more leads and it's usually the last thing they really need.
(23:12) they really need a better model so they can afford more expensive leads and that gives you a competitive advantage. You wanting cheaper leads means that you're competing on methods and that means that somebody else can copy your methods and if they have a better model, they'll still outspend you.
(23:27) And so the model is the competitive mode. A method is a one trick, right? And that will expire. So you want to always double down on the model and obviously you want to know what's up to date right now. Hey, if you can get customers for cheaper, let's do it. But the long-term thing is you want to make sure you have a better model.
(23:40) Now, how do you decrease the cost of getting customers? All right, so you can improve your offer, right? How do we how do we make the thing that we have more compelling? We can improve our ad creatives. So, this is uh better ads. So, think about this in terms of volume and quality.
(23:57) How do I put out more ads? How do I have better hooks? How do I remake my winners? We can also increase CRO, so conversion rate optimization in terms of uh our pages. So, are we split testing our pages, split testing our follow-up? Are we split testing uh the scripting that we're using on the phone? Are we training our team if we use phone sales? All of these things uh decrease your CAC.
(24:16) On top of this, we can go to um I'll just say cheaper CPMs, which is you're going to advertise in places that cost you less per eyeball. Now, again, lowering CAC is not necessarily the answer. You can lower CAC, but that assumes that you're and again, CAC, can not cost per lead because you can get very cheap leads very easily, but you not might not get good leads.
(24:34) You might not get customers if you do that. And so we really just want to maximize for our return between these two numbers. So I'll give you a hypothetical example. Let's say uh in scenario one, actually I'm going to give a fresh page here. So let's say scenario one, LTV is $5,000 and CAC is $500.
(25:04) And let's say scenario two, LTV is $1,000 and CAC is $200. Which business would you rather have? Well, if you just said, "Hey, I want cheaper customers." Then you'd say this, "But does that make sense?" No, because you're getting five to one. Wouldn't you rather put $500 in and get $5,000 back because now you're getting 10 to one. And so obviously this business number one is the better business to own even though it costs you more than twice as much to get a customer.
(25:36) And so we want to optimize for our returns not for one specific number of I want the cheapest leads or I want the cheapest customers. You want the customers that are worth the most relative to what you pay. This concept if you actually can internalize this and actually choose to make decisions about your business like this because I'm telling you right now most business owners optimize for this.
(25:54) They say, "Oh, we're getting this is getting us cheaper customers. Let's advertise broader. Let's make sure that we open up the top of the funnel." Well, guess what? You're going to get way more and you're going to get way more trash. And then all of a sudden, you're like, "Man, all these customers suck.
(26:06) " Well, it's because you're not you're not willing to spend more to get a better quality customer. The thing is is the higher the customer is typically the more expanded this LTV to CAC ratio gets. So, wouldn't you be willing to spend a million dollars to get a customer that pays you 20 million? Yes.
(26:21) And sometimes that's what it is. It costs a ton of money, but then you make so much more. But you've got to be willing to pay to play. So, this is how real business works. Everything in business changes once you understand this. All you have to do to stay in business is you have to have cash. And in order to have cash, you need to increase what you make versus what you spend to make it.
(26:42) And managing that ratio and the payback period of when you get that money back is going to be the lever on how quickly you can grow and reinvest the money back into your money-making machine. So, if you can spend more to get customers than your competitors can, you win. And this is what I wish someone had told me or got me to explain year one.
(27:00) And so hopefully now you know.

3 Hours of Money Making Advice You Needed To Know Yesterday - YouTube
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TooAB8Ow6cQ

Transcript:
(00:00) I just spent 8 hours with the top 10 business owners on school from last month sharing the money-making strategies that they used to win the school games here are the best ones the first thing we talked about affected every business in the room and yours which is how to get more leads and how to turn those into customers so it's using a free school group okay okay so essentially what we do is we create like content on YouTube um Instagram stories we're doing a bit of cold Outreach as well I that it didn't really help with this so you're doing content yeah but it was content is one of them you're doing
(00:32) Outreach to the people who follow and all that stuff on your content yeah and um also we were get like School organic traffic as well yeah starting to do that yeah what ranking are you ranking your pre group like you know you're in Discovery a no idea like we didn't optimize for that I am be worth looking at how many do you know how many searches a day we get on school I don't know a like yeah there there's a lot um but the pro honestly there's more visits to profiles that makes sense yeah and then they go profile and way more traffic goes through the profiles but so you have so you have content you have
(01:14) Outreach um we'll get you don't worry about it um we've content we have outreached what are you what what else are you doing yeah it's like the school organic so people just clicking my profile um and it also being other people's profiles as well you know they just join our curiosity so we then get those people they join the free school group as well so promote on like whatever platforms so how do they um so in in each of these so you make content and do you have it in like the description and do you integrate into the content like hey yeah so I just like leave the link in the description also
(01:43) I'd put in my Instagram bio so actually in YouTube videos where I just promoted my Instagram people would join the Instagram or follow me on Instagram and they just join the community I have curiosity even though I didn't promote it was just in the bio um with the Outreach we didn't promote the free group that's only like if people weren't interested which like okay we got this free group you might want to join it and then with school people just join naturally okay um I say Biol links plus description yeah okay got that and so and what's in there is that the the free
(02:11) group or the the paid group uh it's all free Okay so this this goes to the free group free score got it all right what else okay so when they join to get the auto DM which is the first line of our DM script okay and then we also in the classroom section so we have like a start here post that tells them to go to the classroom so DM as soon as they join the free school yeah okay yeah it's all on the free group got it okay and then we also have like a start here like pinned post that tells people to watch a course and there's a pinned course as well so that's in the classroom section and the
(02:46) course is essentially like a perfect webinar by Russell Brunson like we kind of break it into a course but it's like a perfect webinar yeah and it indoctrinates them to like book a call and then we just close them on the call and then we also did the DMS as well so you CTA to call and then what do you do to maintain the value in the community yeah so our community is actually it's extremely like inactive so I just put po like now and then but like it's like the members who are inactive are the ones buying though it's like cuz they they you have like zombies or like
(03:19) dead bodies there yeah so like the free community has I think it had like 400ish members 450 is and we got like 53 sales so it was very like high converting yeah yeah so it's pretty active but the community was dead but yeah people so you converted 14% of people who went to your free thing yeah ex into your got it and did you convert them into just a a higher ticket paid Community is that what it was yes it was $999 yeah got it that's why it's did by the way H because you just took the most engage people in mov but your I is engaged yeah that's
(03:50) completely accur basically you take your most engaged people and you take them out and put them somewhere else and like talk here inste of course it makes just total sense no it's like the people who are inactive were joining the the high because they're active there yeah yeah it's true that's actually true no that's exactly why yeah yeah and we also tested this with someone else as well so um he was going to enter the school games but he just kind of gave up but he was making like $500 a month and we got him to $10,900 this month so what
(04:25) the fun of was was Tik Tok and Instagram real short form content School community exact same process and basically 20 ex's income so literally just drawing I mean I I was saying this the other day cuz um somebody asked me this question I think on a Q&A call but it's like how do I convert people from free to paid and I still think that the single simplest way to do that is just like depending on the price point like if it's a low ticket paid then you just add the onboarding call to personalize their experience which then it's like hey what are your
(04:53) goals what are your obstacles right now you know what you might be really good fifth or whatever and then you can just sell straight into it um if it's high TI then you have your you know your vsl or your webinar or whatever that you incorporate into their onboarding process and allow them to self- select if it's a you know $5,000 or whatever you know Plus offer that's probably the most I can imagine that would be the most widely adopted method this one yeah yeah it's simple it's the most easy to understand I mean I almost didn't understand anything else that I heard but that yeah I've seen that be used
(05:25) over and over and over again like in a lot of slightly different ways but cuz a free community if you've got content and then you're promising a free community conversion rates are through the roow it's the most efficient mechanism to convert it's a lead magnet I mean fundamentally community and like on the free community as well you make like indoctrination Parts it's like you know how Russell Bruns talks about like the internal belief the external beliefs you you just basically shatter all their limiting beliefs you need to make a note
(05:51) to make a training on yeah I I'm going to simple I'm going to do a simple version of this which is just traffic free group yep free school it's the group funnel yeah free school we already have that training yeah but it's old and in the wrong place and it was for high ticket yeah and it's for yeah exactly exactly that works so well I it's probably the most common Ping On school is I think someone didn't an analysis that almost everyone ranking in Discovery and Lead boards has two groups one free one paid it's like the
(06:32) yeah the funnel it's the tactic and it works yeah so this like for everybody at home traffic free school DM to web plus Al basically you just drive everything there so your PIN post there you make content you soft toss it be like hey make sure you watch this the pitch in the classroom which kind of is disarming cuz you're like oh this isn't a webinar yeah it's it's a module and we've got some people to rather than making like one long video cuz this is why teach the students is to break it up into small videos and like
(07:03) distribute the webinar like that make it not look like yeah it's like there's four videos an introduction and then three core stories and the fifth video is I've got this thing for you and it puts everyone off guard as well cuz like I don't sign up to webinars anymore cuz like I'm in that space this just putts people off guard completely yeah every step of this is like extremely efficient cuz like I know if you have a link in BIO to a free group it absolutely crushes like those groups are the ones that at the top of Discovery cuz it's just so efficient we see 80% conversion rates on the pages like and so you get
(07:37) them in and then the autod DM sends like 100% of people and then you put them to that module and that module it starts the funnel and the funnel is like module one module two yeah and then you get them onto a call yeah which is probably going to be the most efficient method at converting free to paid yeah and some people they don't even book the course they watch the course they don't book the call but then when you DM them they're like oh yeah I've watched the course and then they do it so it's like so you DM again so basically after they watch it you follow up DM no so we just
(08:08) DM them anyway but some people just they watch the course and then book or they'll book later on they'll just come back to it and as long as you're making the post then they're like they find they go back to the course to get the link and then they book it yeah how much is the thing that you're selling them the paid group so it's $9.
(08:27) 99 a month okay but this could work even for a cheaper thing like like you don't have to do high ticket you don't even you don't even have to do a call actually it could just be selling a $99 month thing over DMS and maybe even a call cuz for I'm just thinking for beginners you need cuz you don't have a ton of traffic and a ton of like like privileges to work with essentially you have to like get the most efficient conversion at every point right cuz you're looking to squeeze every last drop it's also I mean this is also from a from a technical complexity
(08:59) like this is pretty simple like click to free free to you make the five modules and then you talk to them and ask them but yeah this is the most effective it works amazingly well as well because especially with the short form content this is something I realized recently um so the guy was working with he had like 900 members he made one post and like 800 people joined we were like that's insane and of course we booked like hundreds of sales calls from that yeah it's monster this is very simple I like this a lot do this
(09:31) this is great really good the the thing that I I keep I keep this is me making a bet um is that I will bet that there's going to be a lot more ,000 a month type quote high ticket like shifting over um partially because of what you noticed which is if you can double or triple acquisition because it's LTV to CAC ratio and so you can still drive down CAC a lot to improve that ratio and so I think I mean the the space always has like a vibe like you have like the rank and rent which is kind of coming back right I think in the high ticket world
(10:03) there's a lot of a lot of people have like the pendulum swung a little bit this way and I think it's kind of coming back just a tiny bit um where people this is why like brand and content ahe and like value in advance is becoming more and more important because there's not a lot of trust and to be fair there was there will always be less and less trust over time um and the more mature the platforms get the less just eyeball Arbitrage exists like if you remember for that 5 Seconds that Clubhouse was a
(10:26) thing like I had I knew plenty of people who went on there and then we're doing like 100,000 a day on clubhouse because it was just it was just huge Arbitrage of eyeballs they're getting way more exposure than they normally would but as platforms kind of settle then it's like okay whose legit starts to rise and who makes the best content and things like that and so right now there's not like besid school there's not like a another platform that's really like emerging and so um it's my belief that that's why I trust that's why content stuff is so important is because it'll improve
(10:56) conversion across the funnel and I think that this whole um $1,000 a month like instead of being the $3,000 $4,000 a month I think a lot more people are willing to stomach the $999 a month um because they can see and as soon as we roll out more stuff with like reviews and things like that it'll just make it more and more trusted and I was talking um the other day about this but like if I could start gimmal launch all over again the probably the biggest thing that I would have done differently is I would have probably tried to make it like 10 grand a year and I would have
(11:28) put all my focus on how do I keep 80 90% of my customers renewing and um that would have been my main focus like I just want such a crazy valued price discrepancy that no one would leave um and they would refer more people etc etc because I would have probably acquired two three four times the customers but they also would have stuck uh longer because like over the last however many years we've done like 5,500 locations that have gone through gym launch and like if all 5,500 of those locations were still paying me I'd
(12:00) be richer than I am today um and so I I think about that a lot of like sure there's on one hit like when you don't know how to sell it's very exciting to like start Rising your price and be like oh my God I just sold 10,000 oh my God I sold 20,00 oh my God 100,000 like it gets really cool but once you learn how to acquire customers you then become completely obsessed on the other side which is oh shoot you realize the game like Sam and I have talked about this at length which is you don't want to keep having to go get customers I mean of course you have like you want be able to
(12:30) go get customers but not to have to go get customers and so like that's the big difference and so like when I look at businesses now I care almost exclusively about how much does this thing grow on Word of Mouth how much like what percentage of customers stay every year once they're like in and activated and whatnot because then it means that I get credit for customers I sold two years ago and so even if you sold 100 customers a year if you can keep all of them 10 years from now you're 10 times bigger and so the vast majority of like the internet marketing World focuses on growing by simply selling more units
(12:58) because they can't keep it body but the people who make the most money just don't lose customers but you have to like learn how to sell in order to get there but like this is kind of the evolution that happens and so pricing I like my thoughts on pricing has changed from the the old school Dan Kennedy model which is like say as high of a price as you can without cracking a smile um like i' swung back a little bit more to like well let's just make them smile at how Blown Away they are with the value that we have and then they're more likely to tell their friends more
(13:26) likely to stay longer and then like I wildly under underestimate how how much Word of Mouth affects these businesses like some of you guys have probably bought coaching courses and whatnot because a friend of yours was like I went through his YouTube training it was actually really good and then that guy doesn't know that you were told that he just sees an ad and he sees a conversion he's like oh my ads are killing it but it's not that it's cuz the product's really good and so like in the early days of gym launch we got 100 to one return on Advertising it wasn't because
(13:56) my ads were exceptional it's because everybody who was going through was just printing money and so like that's the that's the the big shift and those are the guys who make the most money there the ones who actually have a pretty good product in the second clip we talk about pricing and I talk about pricing a lot because pricing has the strongest lever on profit more than getting more customers more than even retaining them longer nailing pricing will make you more money than any other skill I have a question
(14:20) on the pricing because I did you know the what you said charge as high of a price and I tried to increase it but I didn't follow the principle of only increase the price after sufficiently increasing I notic the people are much more likely to ask for a refund at the higher price before it was 77 a month now it's 137 mhm should I suggest going down to 87 which is still bigger than the previous price or it's not a huge price change okay yeah just 77 to 137 is not like a m i mean it's a there's definitely going to be a jump in terms of conversion or like rather a drop in conversions um but
(14:53) the all all you're optimizing for is conversion rate times LTV that's like that's the whole equation so we talked about the four levers in this business right like you've got traffic you've got conversion you've got price and you've got churn like those are the four levers so like to grow the business you have to increase well decrease turn but increase the other three right and so if you know that let's say you've got 100 clicks to a page let's say at 77 you convert twice as many customers well it comes down to really just like what's your earning per eyeball and in the
(15:24) affiliate world it's called epcs which is earning per click and so you just literally want to make the most money per click over the longest period of time and so now if the 77 converts at twice the percentage of the 137 and they turn at half the rate then over when you do that hypothetical Max calculation you'll you'll be like you literally all of this is just math you just plot the see what it looks like see where it maxes out see what the other one maxes out at and you're like okay that's the price so how would I do that if I'm
(15:52) sending people straight from YouTube to about page on school you look at what it's at at 137 or whatever and then you know you what your metrics were at 77 mhm right and so you just compare what's the so here let's do the math so let's say you've got 77 bucks oops there we go that's a seven all right there we go uh and what was turn on 77 well I don't have the exact number so that's another issue obviously yeah yeah okay like let's just walk through it hypothetically months average would stay people okay so that would be 33% churn
(16:24) right yeah and so you divide that by I have bad numbers because I started it like few months ago you're fine don't wor about on 147 is probably like two months only okay cool all right so 137 divided 50% turn means you just double 137 right and so you've got uh what is that 200 and uh 74 is LTV here and then here you've got uh what's that divide times three uh1 what was that 241 thank you 24 241 41 31 Okay cool so LTV here is bigger than here but then the question comes into conversion right which happens before this so then you're like all right what
(17:11) percentage of clicks do I convert here what percentage of clicks do I convert here and so can someone do um uh 274 divid 231 for me 1.86 1.86 yeah right so if you can convert more than 20% more on this one than this one this makes you more money does that make sense yeah and how would I track that if I'm sending people from YouTube straight to school about you've got to just use some like fancy guess work but you should have got a feel of like when you were making a video a link how many kind of members joined yeah okay and do you know if there was a big
(17:54) drop or if it kind of stayed the same I mean there probably was a decrease but not you know more than 20% or what well 20% might be hard to feel yeah because it' be like one day you get four one day you get three like five like that might be tough to feel um but I know that that metric's coming out soon anyways for us so once as soon as that conversion metric's on there I've already looked at it by the way like L conversion rates across the platform there's a the biggest indicator is the price obviously yeah right yeah I mean some free groups convert it
(18:25) 80% um but the difference between you know something that's like 10 20 30 those things can convert like 5% but once you get a price that's like over 100 it drops significantly yeah yeah and so here we know what each of these is worth and so you're just thinking what percentage of people buy it and that's the conversion and so if 50% more people buy this then you're like okay well then 50% even I'm making 50% more sales at this price versus uh I mean this is just a classic like chart of pricing versus volume that's all it is I really want to
(19:11) make to make sure it makes sense though yeah okay this is how you figure out pricing and I would just encourage you guys to be willing to test like the um PC who who just sold profit well um they did this big meta study but basically uh the more frequently you analyze price the more profitable your company is just it's like a direct correlation so companies that never look at their price or never adjust their price are way less profitable than ones that look at it annually which are less profitable than the ones that look at quarterly so just be willing to test price I got some
(19:41) questions for you though like which one do you think is making you more money on your traffic cuz your traffic's probably remained somewhat a constant right well I'm not pushing as hard as during the school games you know because was selling every video and I don't want to do that for long-term brand so it's hard to compare but I would say it's more like the Optics of being less than 100 a month feels like different you know than over 100 a month so which one do you think was more efficient probably 77 because it's like I feel like the
(20:09) product has more more aligned with the value there your your audience is younger on G side no they not 25 to 60 well I'll tell you personally we had a portfolio company that we ran um this is like this you guys might find this really interesting hey guys if you want to be in this room it's actually free for all these people is they won the school games and so school is a community platform it helps you build a group and a community that you can monetize online or that you can build for free and so we give you the tools we give you the training and we give you the community so that you can actually
(20:42) recreate that and as of right now 54.1% of people who start a paid community on school make at least $1 and so I say that because the first dollar in business is the hardest one to make because there's so many skills that require to get there and we've been obsessing about this for the last 5 years to make it as easy as humanly possible if you want to start for free you can go check it out and if you want to ask me a question I onboard all the new customers every single Monday so sign up start for free and I'll see you next Monday it's school.com games so we
(21:13) ran uh we ran We R in a high ticket upsell and we tested 50k 35k 25k and 15K wildly different price points I'm just I love this um and so what's really interesting is that the conversion rate time basically the revenue we generated from all four of those was identical and so on one hand you might think oh I'd rather just have fewer customers at $50,000 but for me personally I would rather have more people that I can again what's my Valu price discrepancy as provided the cost of goods is not like you know like I don't want to eat into you know crazy margins or something but provided the margin on all you know all the the the services are still pretty
(21:55) good I would rather have four times the customers to then sell keep and then also have a crazy like in terms of Word of Mouth from those people saying that my thing is unbelievable that make sense do you know what I've noticed like high ticket you can like change your price and conversion doesn't move but with the lower ticket it really does yeah which I think it's because it's more intimate like when you buy something that's real high ticket you're it's small and you're talking to a human and everything but when it's lower ticket it it it does seem to make a big difference because I
(22:29) high take it fundamentally if you believe you're going to get this big expensive outcome then logically 25k and 35k like if you go and make a billion dollar business they're both worth it like right um it just like comes down to whether you can actually afford the you know the difference and so I think it becomes like a structural conversion difference where what I mean by that is like some people literally can't afford the difference between you know 15K versus 50k like there are just some people who just literally can't afford it even though they both might want to buy it um but yeah here you're you're selling in in a you're alone it's like
(23:01) you with the your finger over the button you're like I mean my fear is that if I decrease it to 87 I would piss off all the people that joined at 147 yeah so like how would I test the price then H well the worst case is they could cancel and come back not the end of the world because so just just for everybody here like just from a perspective um taking if you plan on having this business for a long time then it's not going to make any difference like you figuring out what the right price point is for your community is going to be the thing that matters most and so like you might lose
(23:32) a month like you're turning already at whatever 50% they're going to be gone in two months anyways yeah so like I'm just being like really real right so like you we want to tweak this stuff to get right High by the way yeah like that's way above the which do I aim for at this price point below 20% yeah okay like good is good is like in between 5 and 10 yeah like 20% is like average is yeah cuz I I actually analyzed yeah I actually put the whole platform's numbers into profit well oh sick yeah that took profit well
(24:07) for like 7 days to to process it and it almost broke it um cuz there's like 50 transactions a second almost um but it's like yeah the that's probably around the average what's interesting is it's coming down every month because I think people are learning more about what works and what doesn't work um but the good ones are sub 10 but so if you're 50 that price is too high I don't I don't have data to be honest yeah okay this it you can do it if you just if you have like 4 hours and some coffee yeah so go to your churned members and it'll click on their
(24:47) membership and it will tell you their LTV we calculate on a per member level so just go and fill out your own spreadsheet yeah um and you'll figure it out like it's the numbers are there that that's what I said you just have to use some some different methods yeah and for the like General churn should I just export like the list of all members and compare out like week to week or something no no you want to look at your churned members will tell you their LTV so you want to see all of your churn members and their
(25:16) ltvs and then look at the average LTV that's your LTV that from there you can reverse engineer your churn because LTV would be divided by your price that gives you your you can do the math yeah yeah yeah okay that ansers it yeah cool awesome well this is great I know that we yeah go for it so just going back to on pricing too and what you're saying with gym launch I I do believe I could sell what I've built for 30k like I believe I sell it for 30k whatever but I also do have a painting business now that's why is my main focus and I am also willing to sell that same thing for 97 so just to go this is what my advice
(25:50) to you uh would be because I understand your business outside of this business I think that I would try and I would want it to be just high high enough of a price that they care and so maybe make it 5,000 a year maybe 10,000 but the whole purpose is not to Makey I mean sure you'll make money doing that but the real money is that if you can get those people to then open your version of painting under your logo and basically you can consolidate and have them use your systems and whatnot then it's like they kind of basically become partners of yours as they open up locations underneath of
(26:23) your flag and if you have the capital then you can front I'm sure the capital's not too big for starting painting stuff I would I mean do you know I mean it's like 27 net right you can afford it um so like I would be like off front the capital you can get 20% and I'll give you a base and then I'll show you how to run the business or whatever and like you're going to be a co-owner like that's I think that might be the mega play for you and then you can still use that to have them have skin in the game and you take that community and skim from the top so it's like you let the like you don't need to
(26:55) take you don't need to bet on them you let them you hold tryouts you know and put the pull pull sticks in and just see who kills each other and wins the leader board and I'll bet you if your leaderboard was about who is the who's the next one who's going to be able to partner with you bet your leaderboard would go up take not cool so you got what you need to do have a question yeah you had that one form that one equation conversion rate times LTV was there like a equals to it conversion rate where yeah you wrote it on the I think you flipped it over on the other page oh
(27:32) traffic Trum bottom I don't believe that that's where it was but I don't know if you said the you finish the equation oh for uh the these guys at the top yeah I think we're just talking about that cost PR so this is price divided by turn equals LTV okay that's what this that's what this is and then traffic times conversion this is the other two of this is then you've got price as your levers and then you have uh turn so these are the four levers of the business that we're talking about so if you want to make more money
(28:06) in your community you either have to drive more traffic to it you have to convert a higher percentage of that traffic you have to price it as high as you can and you and this is all balanced with churn which is okay well I I can raise my price but does that also increase churn and by how much and so that's why we're find like it's balanced between these two and price also affects conversion so there's a bidirectional relation between churn price and conversion and then this is this is the machine right this is
(28:38) your business machine right this is the machine that we have at school this is what you drive into it which is the traffic so this is the effort that you guys are doing on a regular basis it's the inputs into the like this is the big black box of making money this is school and then this is what we're driving traffic whether it's Facebook ads or whether that's content or direct Outreach or whatever it is this then just flows into the machine you're looking for the maximum like yield yeah so like how much dollars per
(29:07) click any way right and all of these variables play into that and you're looking for like the most efficient way to turn the click into some money in yeah couldn't you just put that in school like this metric you know and just get that number so we see it cuz you have all the stats no which one well I mean like yeah I can calculate that it's like if we had that you know if you go into the dashboard you can see the Mr if we could see that right underneath or maybe like you know the churn so we can see it in real time cuz
(29:39) it's easy to see increases in Mr but like this takes more effort yeah that's a good point like I you yeah the next kind of metric we're rolling out is like the traffic and conversion stats that helps cuz now you can see your conversion annual clicks right and I already have that data and I've already looked at it that's why I had some insight and then we've already got the churn data too so I guess yeah that would be an interesting formula it would be like EPC earnings per click I think yeah that could be a cool thing to see and
(30:14) then yeah good idea in this next clip we talk about beating your competition by doing things differently than them and how to identify a great market and other great opportunities and how to approach them a way that other people aren't seeing if you're on school especially in like the last couple of months you probably noticed that there's a lot of really good value there but it's it was getting stuffy there wasn't a whole lot of like personability right or fun so to speak so it was an obvious Niche and um
(30:45) it kind of happened organically where uh the offer was solid funnel builder stuff like this different business model though instead of it being a high ticket all up at front and then he would give you the package and then off this one was hey Will work with you and you just give us a subscription so th000 Mr and is it 999 what's the price 999 Okay cool so that was the price and so we started with what you guys were talking about free and a high ticket so two groups two groups yeah okay great yeah this is yeah recurring theme but but it keeps going and something else I think
(31:19) so where was traffic coming from just school okay we to this day we've never made a single nothing not even social Instagram my friends don't know that this is going no one knows yeah you okay got it so traffic was going to free group right um yeah traffic was going to free okay however school games front page would bring people to paid so we had a link there that said here's the free okay cuz that's where a lot of people were coming so it's actually kind of like this yeah yeah yeah anybody a simpler one than this yeah I said I was
(31:50) answer your question upell like 15 people eight bought within the first hour okay and so everyone's like who the hell is this guy and then from that it sort of was a nice flywheel and the pre-sale you did inside of the free group uh yeah actually it was friends family members basically anybody that had something that we could offer was it a zoom like do like a zoom no it was like in person phone calls people in the world we knew people in the world get in the floor get in the pment okay so um that was what got it going yeah but then from that point on um what
(32:26) we were doing was sharing I Sam doesn't like this phrase but you know we'll have to come up with a different one A a valuable post something that had it in there I wouldn't call what you were doing a value post no this is really interesting though because I think this industry's gotten real weird with value posts you know what I mean it's like people posting value but no one cares yeah because it's not even value it's just some opinion or article and like what Goose did differently is he he made things fun and got other people to contribute on his post so his posts blew
(33:06) up way more than value posts there was like hundreds of comments and they were really fun and like alive and so he bought like personality fun in like I would say personality in fun posts and that those were like crushing a lot of people engaged and then a lot of people like who is the guy and they viewed his profile then they saw his stuff then he got on the leaderboards now he's got another thing feeding him and then he got on Discovery and now there's another thing so by making things fun and adding some personality
(33:40) and being interesting and not just trying to like post articles you everyone kind of started to know who he was and then that energy started going there and then it started looping on itself there was like a feedback loop it was really interesting to see that happen h yeah and it'll probably start happening more in the future the gift group is the the next one so we're starting to see this new pattern actually where funny things are working really well this guy made a group it's a pure joke yeah when you get to level 9 you get kicked out
(34:16) yeah it's it's really funny like see how see what that does to everyone and SEL and every all of these serious business owners with seven figure businesses are joining and just laughing yeah and posting funny and like I love that I think there's there's definitely something that we a topic we could talk about today about Community culture yeah cuz I think that's how you get retention and that's how you get raving fans as if it's there's a culture and a vibe to it um and that's starting to happen and work honestly more effective than the logic that I'm seeing really start to
(34:56) take off it's quite interesting that's probably how I Define a culture yeah entertainment business in other words too I think what goo is really great at is making POS are really engaging like I even like again plenty of seven figure business owners I just like like to make it f so that's like your thing that you brought it's like not a value posst just like a posst that drive engagement and to make people like collaborate which is huge yeah um there's a there's a a theory that I have behind it that actually is something that people can probably start to use cuz it's kind of I
(35:32) didn't realize it until I was looking in retrospect but it's something that I call um broccoli wrapped in bacon where it looks really stupid and fun so you're curious about it but by the time you're done reading you actually learn something so each one of my posts take like 45 minutes to an hour to make cuz sometimes I have the funny part or I have the the broccoli part but I have to come up with the other part and so what we started to find in this system was right after you got eyeballs and as long as you had a good offer you immediately
(36:04) could just start sharing all of your successes everything that worked everything that didn't work or even how you felt that day if it was somehow valuable but not a value post I suppose and uh the the engagement went through the roof and this is what it meant which might help a lot of people that are here is one of the reason we didn't go back and start offering up ads is because at least I was nervous a little bit about the dilution of the quality of the people cuz they were all coming from school and those people knew how School worked and were really engaged
(36:37) and so we have I don't know 600 members something like this but we're more engaged than groups with 10,000 members a lot of them and every time something goes off like let's say it's someone struggling with a I don't know a heartbreak of some kind a bunch of community members just swarm on this dude and help him out and it was that culture as Sam was talking about that we somehow stumbled into and realized oh okay this is this massive thing it's not just like kind of a niche it's totally a niche um addressing sort of the personability the things that you might
(37:09) need from a friend and then that was why people were signing up for everything else they just wanted to be able to do that and run their business in like a safe space so um there's something to be said I suppose about being able to uh reach out to the things that don't logically make sense and that was what we ended up doing there so as you said in conclusion the discovery ended up being uh that backbone where uh probably a lot of us should maybe lean on a little bit more if you can if you can get that slightly higher the number of
(37:45) people that are coming into school all the time is just rising and everyone's looking like if you've got one offer here you've got another one over there that you can just jump over the same person it's just a bunch of really high quality leads and people that are waiting to to jump onto those I may not have much for you to chew on there I just no that was fine much to share it's the first one we've seen that didn't really use external yeah yeah um mean I know Evin I mean she obviously did Drive outside traffic but she crushes internally as well because she
(38:18) she has truly valuable posts um and a lot of her posts like the differen is so for everybody at home uh I feel like the difference between the value post and the quote value post and valuable post is that the quote value posts are like here are six things to no one gives a right um the value bull posts are like I did work for you or I took risk for you or I spent money for you that you don't have to spend and so fundament it's a bargain on time or money and so like Evelyn's like hey I spent $25,000 on ads and these are the ads that I ran and this is what happened and people
(38:56) were like oh well great I don't have to do that and this worked for her like she gives her tldr at the end and you're like that was valuable yes if you can blend if you can get a blend of that and then people making like a parody video about the community like have you seen the ones people have made for school if you can get a good balance of that that I would say is like Perfection cuz you've got the value but you're also smiling and feel like a part of this group and then you they're like I can't believe I'm having fun and I'm talking to people that make millions of dollars
(39:27) if you get those two it's like it's experience and results so on this on the customer success side like in normal B2B businesses we talk about both it's like you can get someone results and there's also client experience which are just like the soft and the hard and believe it or not like client experience matters sometimes a lot more than even the results does um like if you have amazing results and a terrible experience the moment they can find somebody else who can get get them the result they will leave but if you have an amazing experience and like mediocre results
(39:57) they're like well I love these guys and they'll stay yeah so one of the the the tweaks that we ended up kind of noticing is that we on school is so great cuz Community we actually don't really have the post as a thing or what we do we really turn it back into them so the community is the community and we really highlight that versus being like the overlord being like here's what we give you guys it's like no more and more in the comments comments DM like that was the thing that really just gets super fan do you guys think I'm you guys GA
(40:28) engage a lot in your own Community right and I think that's like most people could do it like in terms of the people at home are like my my community is dead and it's cuz you're expecting like the community to do the work and in the beginning like you need to drum it up like you need to engage you need to be thoughtful about your responses to comments and things like that they are small things they're really nuanced um I mean School understands it really well because it it use the platform but like if you're making a post and you're not
(40:54) using a poll you're up there there's something that you can do that just adds a little bit of flavor to what you're doing um there's also like we were talking about earlier pinning to module like every little thing that school has if you if you're not using it you're kind of leaving money on the table because there's usually a lot of thought that's gone on behind the scenes for that thing and I'd even go as far as saying that you know we have this freet to- paid system but probably what's going to start emerging a lot more here is what we did where there was a lot of
(41:23) drop off where people wanted to hire us from the free but they didn't have a grand ready to go or they didn't have their offer ready to shoot so they would fall to a low ticket which is just like a white label GSL ghl but we ended up inverting it because people were like what the hell does this software do and you had to go and explain the whole damn thing instead we just sold the Mastermind uh later on and then gave them this as a gift like hey and you also have the software and then it just went through the roof where people just kept signing up so inevitably we had free low ticket High ticket and it's
(41:56) just been wonderful having that and it's just this flywheel where people Bounce Around within it and they of course that gift of the software that gives them the incentive to go up because they like I want you to just do this for me now I know it's here so so I guess they've got the extra piece on the end of that simple funnel they've got free low ticket and high ticket which it sounds like that's what everyone eventually wants to achieve from what we've heard at all of these events but just balancing the the traffic Source
(42:26) the free and the paid first is probably everyone's first step in this fourth clip we talk about something that I made tons of mistakes on early either you've got entrepreneurs who are really good at retaining customers and don't know how to get them or they're really good at marketing and sales and don't know how to keep them if you're one of those people who's really good at Marketing sales and doesn't know how to keep them this is all about making sure that they stay with you and I'll tell you now as an investor the number one thing that I
(42:47) look at in business is how many people from last year are still paying you it gets way easier to grow when you don't lose 100% of your customers every year that's a promise if we want to talk about engagement we did it I just spent weeks analyzing this and I what I found was honestly shocking like that's a hook yeah video ends so what's really interesting is classroom content doesn't really matter um first of all you do not need to make a monster course in fact that just overwhelms everyone right we have
(43:23) an hour hours is less than an hour right yeah anime shreds launch with no class um and no post more than one sentence some posts were just like six emojis and they had thousands of comments um so it's the things that really work I've seen in and that are very low E low effort too is you you get your community to share something about themselves right so the it the CU I've seen these posts that always rip really well like they get they get more comments than like a wellth thought out article post by the
(44:08) Creator who pinned it so that's like you know um one that always works is like what's your favorite book have you ever seen that one just keep popping up in your communities even if some random asks it it just keeps getting comments and it have you seen this that one because it's just asking members to share something about themselves and then other people are curious what's your favorite movie if you want even the most simple one what's your favorite GIF that one that one's popular that one just guaranteed like more comments than anything else and it's kind of a little
(44:44) bit more fun it's not too much effort to think about um or this one I found is really good it's like um sheer three things you do share something you do for fun where you're from and a photo of your workspace right cuz people want to share and so they're like okay I'll take a photo of my desk and workspace I'm from Germany and I like to play golf right that's just sharing themsel and they do a comment or a post like that and then everyone looks at the image and they notice other things they're like oh you've got this desk or oh you're into guitar I also play guitar and now
(45:26) they're making friends you're connecting the community together like we actually do use that one on the course and we tell people if you see someone's introduction post with that comment a gift as well and it works amazingly and it's like the culture of the gift that they post let's say they put a wolf for Wall Street you like gift on their post now everyone will start putting them in yeah and so these This I Swear is the key to like cuz when someone comes in they all you just need a simple way for them to engage and once they're engaged and if they meet someone
(45:56) they like if now they meet someone they on DMS and then that moves to like a hangout in real life or on Zoom they associate that value back to your group right can I just add something as well hen can I just add something yeah go for it yeah so if you want people to engage you can do like all these like little tricks or you can just tell them to engage as well so like what we've done is we've just like indoctrinated people to engage with each other essentially right like in a good way though so we talked about the pr The Mastermind Principle from thinking Grow Rich we
(46:26) explained it to people and said this is why you should engage with each other and then now everyone's just hosting calls with each other communicating like that kind of thing so sometimes you just need to tell people it's the same with the Q&A recordings as well just tell people to watch them give them a reason like tell a story that makes them want to watch it and then they'll watch it so it just works with anything it's just sometimes you just have to tell them why they should do it yeah this is huge like
(46:49) especially on the Q&A calls people sometimes have a question like does anybody here no blah blah blah and if there's like 30 people and there's 600 in the community we like well have you made a post and always no so we like make a post we'll pin it maybe if it's good one and like just telling people that they can make a post they almost feel like they don't have the permission when they join the community but like no you can make a post you can ask if somebody here knows this or does that and just you know doing that especially if something more advanced that you can't really answer in 5 minutes I think that's huge yeah
(47:19) that's that's good for like the regular conversation I think you need to imagine a blend of like sometimes you need to share like something you did like you need to always pay attention to problems your community has and you as the lady it's your job to like find the best solution and you can kind of crowdsource it but sometimes you have to go and explore your on your own and then you find it and you bring it back and you share it you're like hey we found we know this is a problem we did this we found the solution and here it is that
(47:50) that's like good leadership then you need but you need some fun stuff in there for sure I'm honestly shocked at how much of a difference it makes if you have it it I honestly would go as far as saying it's more important than the value like cuz I've seen s figure people join groups that are purely for entertainment um but with other seven figure people so it's like the value happens as an accident um and members contributing like I think one of the most common problems I've seen is people say I've got members in my community I'm posting five times a
(48:27) day but no one's commenting right that have you seen people say that yeah and it's because the people that have engaged communities aren't posting five times a day their members are commenting it's a difference and when you write an article this long that's just an opinion piece what is someone supposed to say like really like and you're putting a burden on them to read that thing like who wants to read that another follow you can do to get more engagement too is uh I like to never answer anything in the comments I always ask questions so everything gets
(49:04) answered with a question which follows a red for every person um and and and you get the research you get to find out those problems you can yeah asking a question it's just that always works so well it's crazy yeah I think um a really good idea too is if you have something that's like a community review like for example we have music money and a lot of we tell a lot of the artists to post their new music post their new beats and then the community members will review be like oh I think you should tweak this
(49:31) I think you should tweak that and then we have another Community where it's mainly about like content making good content and people will post their content or post a link to their content it's almost like I don't know if you guys remember like the engagement groups like back in the day where like they'll post it and everybody goes and comments and likes on their post on Instagram and that increases a lot more engagement around the community too absolutely yeah and just one more thing to add on to that like I think people underestimate like how well information travels in the
(49:56) form of a meme right like a meme can communicate like a 45 minute video worth of information to the right person right if they're a sponge and can soak the information out of it and so I just think like whenever I see like the videos Ryan post right or like something like that I'm like oh that's funny did you see the Fast and Furious I was dying bro I watched that like 400 times yeah and so like I I think people just underestimate like all right like you know like what Goose does is like you know he makes it fun to read a post I
(50:23) think a meme just like sucks your eye in and so it's like if you can figure out how to Comm unicate something through a meme then you're killing it you know yeah I just watched this movie last night it's really good dumb money anyone seen it it's about the gme GameStop vers the hedge funds and it's it's a W Street bets for they have a they had a very good culture you know they invented Diamond hands and like they were making memes of like the Wall Street bets head spanking the hedge funds like you know
(50:56) and everyone just felt like they were in this David verse Goliath like thing and they were all part of something and that's the most powerful thing you can get is when you get that culture there I think school community in the last month has finally found something there's like this culture cuz people are contributing these parody videos that must have taken them a long time if you've seen the Harry Potter one I made the I made the friends one took me like 4 hours the Harry Potter one must have taken a dude that was intensive
(51:27) you've seen the Harry Potter one right yeah yeah um I seen them all them wisely too but the power like referencing that dumb bunny thing that guy just tweeted out a picture just the other day of a gam of a dude leaning up to play games and GameStop uh GameStop stock shot up again from dude just tweeting a picture right just to like no no words attach nothing people are like oh it's back on I need to you know buy into this GameStop and so that's what the power of mean guy posted that yeah yeah he just did got to watch this movie write it down Dum money
(51:59) not only is it an amazing movie Just for straight entertainment but this guy who led that GameStop thing is probably one of the best community leaders we've ever seen on the internet cuz he bought down some hedge funds and up with with memes nothing but memes and he wasn't he wasn't promising the world to people either at first he wasn't telling people GameStop was going to go up 100x he was saying this is going to go up 4 or 5x and I feel like that's another thing people can do is not overpromise whenever and then people are like yes I believe it can do what
(52:31) you're saying it's going to do and then everybody believes in it and then you know yeah yeah that that is perfect exactly what happened in that movie and that's what we're starting to see happen in school like people are making these parody videos and then people laugh and then we started seeing people posting like this is the most positive place I've ever seen on the internet like that pretty powerful so people want to go where the energy good right like if you scroll your Instagram and you feel bad
(53:04) and you go to Facebook bad twitter World War something then you go like you know you go to school and there's some funny videos and someone making a million dollars that is the ultimate right like people winning and people laughing yeah we've seen two outstanding ways that you can drive culture especially if you're like trying to Pivot one of them categories it's super passive this like the thing that's right above your feed where you can sort of when someone comes in they get a pretty good idea this is
(53:36) actually Sam's idea um they get a good idea of what the place is for so even if you don't actively use them it's just kind of a good foundation we've got a lot of good feedback back from that even though I hated them at first they're super useful in like a level one sort of way and this then the more important one is your PIN post does anyone rotate their post actually I learned this from you did you all right that was the first thing I ever saw who's this dude long hair clicked your post and he's like rotate two pin posts a day I I do that myself and I do that with uh with
(54:08) Justin as well rotating pin post it's overpowered actually and so you how long until you saw results immediately immediately yeah you rotate pen post and and you my my favorite thing is when you see people typing like way everyone's like oh what are they typing about yeah so what we what we did with them is ex L this uh the pin post when you first start a community your first uh thought is oh I need to start here so that everyone knew knows exactly where to go which actually kind of you after a little while because the people that are
(54:40) coming back seem the see the same every single time they come back and so you kind of want to speak to them more so you post the pin of the start here Post in a classroom module or you know whatever you need in the start here classroom and then the pin posts are just the stuff that's going on day to day you got a crazy idea or if you can't post that day you take one of your community members and you post them up there and they're jazzed to we pinned oh yeah that once if you pin your members stuff that's key I think you should always aim to have at least one or two the ultimate is all of the pin
(55:14) post from other people that aren't you it just shows the community that if they they it is possible for them to make something that you're willing to pin at the top and then it it's it's like creating this incentive for people to do that um the other thing I would say is you should always be just sensing and on the lookout for who the most valuable contributors are in your group or in your community so like you know when Goose when Goose kind of started to take off I sent mm and I said now that you've proven yourself
(55:53) School hardcore like what do you think of this upcoming feature right so I started to bring him in and give him like access way more access to me and and then you know he's been at the office all week helping design screens for the next 3 months that's s so I mean Ted Carr who's hosting a school meet up right now in LA with 100 people um he is a key to our office so he can just and the alarm pin code he can just up whenever he wants and we just talk about sensitive things in front of him it's like he's a member of our team but what I'm trying to say
(56:34) here is when you see those people you need to reward them because all a group needs to keep it engaged even when it's big as 10 true regulars people like it's like a sitcom right like how many people watch friends but it's just like five people right but it's those people that get everyone else to to come cuz they like the vibe and they like it so you know we've got people like Ted we've got people like Goose um there's Max P there's Evelyn right all of them contribute a different piece this Ryan guy with GIF is adding a new kind of
(57:13) flavor Kirby was adding something now he's on the team Matthew was adding something now he's in charge of our podcast and so and there's a lot more people but you've got to find those when you do see those people you need to like do something to make them feel like they've they're a part of the leadership in a way of of the community what I did is I hired one of the best guys to do a weekly call so I just pay him 100 bucks and he does one of the weekly calls so he's like a professional software engineer and he just helps with like the technical questions so he was already
(57:49) posting a bunch but I asked him hey do you want this because he already was attending every single call so might as well get you know 100 bucks for it and literally for 400 $ a month I get like a professional software developer that just hosts a weekly call in my community yeah this is how you find your team by the way like honestly everyone we've hired that's on the nons software engineering side is from school users like when someone applies I look I'm like where's their link and I look at their activity chart and I'm like this person doesn't use skill like why if
(58:19) they don't care about school I don't want to hire them so like if someone literally cares about your community and is contrib without getting paid then they're going to obviously believe in what you're doing right well this is changing topics from um engagement which I don't know if we should do yet but that is how you find great people yeah I want to hit on one thing with engagement so we we've tossed around the word culture and we haven't defined the word culture and so I'll just share mine that might be helpful which is the rules that govern reward and Punishment in
(58:50) organization and so if you think like we have either spoken rules or unspoken rules but there are rules of how you act and so if you're with your buddies if you say hey I got my girlfriend flowers they just might all of a sudden say like oh you like sucking dick too you know like you're like okay that's the rule that's a rule of behavior right like if you do something that's nice for your wife or girlfriend you're going to get made fun of um but it's because they like you right and but like if you said
(59:12) that to your parents or your you know whatever at the dinner table they would be like oh that's really sweet or that's really nice of you right and so it's different rules so there's a different culture at the family dinner table than there is when you're out with your buddies and so fundamentally trying to what are the rules that govern what gets rewarded and what gets punished within my community will dictate what the quote culture is within it and so just kind of thinking about that in terms of those terms will probably make it a lot easier
(59:40) and so to your point G I actually think this is uh the category piece that you're saying really really important and the main reason I say that is cu like if people are about to make a post when you see what the categories are this signals or this tells them this is what we want you to post about and so this is like this is an an innate rule to this community like we want you to post about winds we want you to post about traffic we want you post about mon monetization we want you post about whatever so it might be like you might have like gifts like they'll imagine the
(1:00:07) community like same identical Community uh internet marketing right just something like completely generic and the categories in one are gifts memes right like something that makes money or like money- making uh wins and uh Just for kicks right and so like that is one community the other one is um conversion rate value post uh question whatever right and so when you see the two of those like you have a very different feel for those communities before you even engage and so like right off the bat that's the that's the banner literally the the subcategory of all the
(1:00:45) topics that are going to get discussed and so like if you want to shift the conversation that's going to happen within the culture of or within the within the community that you have telling them what you want them to talk about with the categories feels like one of the most most important things that you can do to do that and you also by by very nature of having those topics means these are what we reward yeah and what we actually did is um we like gamified the categories as well so when it's like um I think Sam
(1:01:10) did it with like son.com is he made people like ring the bell so we got like a clip from a game like a GTA 5 where Trevor says show me the money and every time someone gets a win they post that but rather than calling it a wins category put haha show me the money and every time they got win they' post it and it would just make it way more respons if everyone would come show me the money every time someone gets a win and it just goes insane yeah and you can have it be wins or you can have it something be funny the way you have it it's still ACC same thing but one of
(1:01:35) them's like I'm I'm more inclined to post this if I don't feel like I'm flexing you know what I mean um so yeah I I think this was like a I like would double star that personally and then I think that the pinning your members feels very important like think about like what's that's like a jackpot reward like this is what we reward in general and if you pin pin certain posts then that's a super reward this is like let me let me put this guy on the on lit a literal pedestal and tell everyone in my community this is what I want you to do this is me doing a big reward for
(1:02:05) somebody who does this and so it orients the behavior of everyone in the community and then I'd say what I do is like pinning is probably the first or saying this is a great post or this is amazing right that's key like you see me do this I do it all the time tell people then pinning them but also sending them a DM and then the only people I DM are the people that are like the most School hardcore basically and that I talk to them all the time and then the next level of Hardcore is every now and then
(1:02:36) will be on zoom and then the next level is they'll be at the office right it's literally what I do not by Design or deliberately this is just how it happened but bring those people closer and give them more cuz by the way they also give me the best feedback that they're helping design Skool literally um and you can use them to help you shape the future of this of the thing you're building and when the commun when a new member comes in and they see that you're really tight with members like that they're going to be like oh if I can get my way up there I can have
(1:03:16) that too do you get what I'm saying if you if you do this it'll work it'll work really well and it's not exhausting at all is the least exhausting business I've ever run because I don't have to talk to any like everyone there's no I'm never promising that I only talk to the people who I think who I want to talk to really yeah was a point a few days ago the school games Community was really dead no one was posting I like I'm going to get fired all I did was I added a category called banter and I messaged Ryan who's
(1:03:52) the gift guy who's top of the school community and I said made this for you and immediately he made a post there was 300 comments in like 2 hours from one post and also on the reward punishment thing whenever Evelyn posts every single time she posts I'll comment Evelyn overd delivers again just to like reinforce the good behavior and the DMs I probably send 10 a day if there's ever a good comment I DM and I'm like this was a great comment that was a great post and then bad behavior if someone post bad stuff don't like it message them and say
(1:04:22) here's our rules here's what a bad post looks like reward good here's what a bad post look like your post see screenshot I got a quick uh a quick tactic that's been like working wonders for our culture true um I have all my guys when they join put like in their bio in school I put like a 15-minute calendar link and then I'm like always referencing it so I'm like I'm mentioning like hey guys like book The 15s I put it on my road map I have like a little road map like book 315s with these guys and I'm doing all the closing
(1:04:53) right now so like I'll like go on my live calls and I'll notice that two guys who are across the country from each other have so much in common and I like reach out to them like yo you should book a guy with I feel like you should book a call with this guy because of why XYZ and then I follow up with that later like how' that call go and then I get a ton of like Insight on like all my members and like what they're communicating outside of me cuz like there's like a little like a power Dynamic where like I'm the I'm the head coach I'm the the CEO guy right so I don't get like a lot of like
(1:05:17) vulnerability but I can get the Insight from my community members through each other and the concept actually came from when I was a frat president cuz we would have our top 10 exec guys go on constant 15-minute lunch breaks with all the new members and then that's how we collected Mass information and connected guys like pledges together before the recruitment process so that they would have friends before they even joined the thing and so like the result of that is like I have like buddies like flying down to like
(1:05:39) Dallas to meet Gladiators who I didn't even like like they're doing it on their owns now because the reward is so high they're getting like brothers so I'm going to I want to say back to you so the users in the community you tell them to put like a calend link for 15 minutes so and then whenever you see people that you think make sense and they already it becomes an innate rule of the community which is like hey if you like someone just like click their Link in book of called they might just segment out you
(1:06:02) know one part of their calendar where they have you know opening to just banter or whatever maybe they do it for their lunch breaks and they meet new people every day whatever it is I tell them like an I do I do like an hour for three days a week that's just open yeah uh and it crushes so a lot of people do use that almost yeah so I tested it with like five or six guys and they they all loved it and so I'm I'm making it mandatory for everybody now who's using the map are using the map the map it's not a School feature um this this R are
(1:06:29) you using it we have members meeting up constantly in person that they've met through music money and doing like Studio sessions and stuff and that's honestly like like you guys said like they they equate that their connection to being a part of Music money and so I feel like they've you know people have I just saw the school games not pop up but they just people just share their location who's in Atlanta who's in who's in Detroit you know yeah it was interesting I was in I'm in Ham's group and he did the post like
(1:06:57) what's the most valuable part of the community and he's trying to remove some stuff and and emphasize some stuff and what could we what's one simple thing we could do to improve it I was the most common answer was get more people to plot their location on the map I was like what we we actually took that idea just a little bit further we're not sure if it'll work yet but it's incredibly popular it's been our most popular piece so far which was setting up a system system that the community could engage on so that it continued that flywheel sort of perpetually and what we're calling it is
(1:07:33) it's uh it's based off the school games and we're just calling it rainbow games and we just have a pile of things at the end that you can win and the structure is uh you'll be assigned teams between three to five you have one team captain they uh coordinate with our community manager and the objective is to compete based off of three metrics where they are on the leaderboard from um and these are all based on a 30-day time span so it'll basically be one to one with school games where where they are on the leaderboard um what their own personal
(1:08:09) uh score is on how much they've grown in their own relationships and health and then the last one is how good their offer is based off of where they started from before so we're using those three different metrics people were super jazzed about it and we had uh I think like 30 sign up to do this thing that we'll probably do this next week we don't know all the little intricate details but I think there's a massive opportunity there whereas previously like when you're starting probably most of us have run into this you really want to get a few Community managers to like
(1:08:40) lift up from the bottom and help comment and stir up conversation but at a certain point when it's feeding itself you can sort of just give that momentum by doing top down where they are in teams or some form of competition and reporting to to the community manager so now the manager is doing less time but having more impact yeah and the more you reward the Top members versus trying to dig up the bottom members those Top members dig up the bottom members so it actually is less it's like your model and it could
(1:09:13) be something super stupid we the biggest request that we've had recently is I I designed a few profile pictures cuz they wanted more color in their thing so I was like all right if you're on the leaderboard I'll go ahead and do it and now it's one of the things that we offer in there because people really want it and it's silly and it's didn't you guys design a whole Suite of gifts for school yeah he made like a library gift forgot about that yeah Sid said he was going to implement them to that'd be a sweet like level six unlock like if you get to level six I'll
(1:09:43) make your profile thing for you one more question for you um and just for the context right you said if you go back in time make gym launch 10K a year so I'm I'm kind of in this this new building phase of like I'm I'm going to make my product okay you're honestly go big head long tail with it so like what were like the two to three like specific things that you would like definitely Implement into gym launch's model back then like with your knowledge now to actually make people like renew year-over year yeah
(1:10:07) okay I got to figure out where my cont for bringing this up because this is what it was something that I wanted to talk about so what everyone in my opinion what you want to do and school's going to very quickly be able to facilitate this so I'm really excited about that you have onetime value and then you have ongoing SLC consumable value all right and I think the big issue it's my opinion um in the information education space is that we try we have one we have one thing here that we try to build for both and so we're like okay well I can get someone to say yes to $3 $3,000 whatever and
(1:10:43) because they can't pay that today I'm going to spread it over a year and I'm going to deliver all the onetime value up front and then they're still making payments of 25,000 you know $2,500 a month uh month three month four5 six but the problem is the value so think about like this value is going like this but this is price and this is where people cancel value and so when you when you sell them initially they're like 2500 bucks which is my first payment look at the difference between price and value I'm stoked this is great but the day after you learn how to run Facebook ads when
(1:11:30) you buy something to learn Facebook ads the value of the content teaching your Facebook ads descends to zero there's no additional value right and so this is why in my opinion this is where I think the industry should go or will go and or if I start it over again this is what I would do is you have one type value that you need to be really clear about so this is a lot of times this is going to be the education right um for the most part this is this is the entirety of this right this is the education the checklist the tool the blueprints the whatever right now this usually has a
(1:11:59) lot of value because you're teaching someone something a skill that's very important and they're going to have that skill forever it's one time payment for an ongoing permanent value increase for that but all this stuff so you've got community right people consume that on a monthly basis there's uh calls right that they consume on a monthly basis uh for us like for example we did a boiler room which is something that we did uh for gyms which was um we would train their sales staff and so we would drill them every day so we'd basically run
(1:12:27) their sales meeting for them every morning to increase the close rates at the jet they didn't want to do it nor were they good at it if we could increase the closer to the gym they'd make more money they'd stay right it's consumable um uh we had ads which for us was consumable because I would spend 50 Grand a month testing ads in like 10 representative markets I would take the winners and then I would give I would license those winners to a th000 locations so there's zero cost on that besides the 50k then everything after that was gravy right and so that was why it was such a High profit margin business where still is um and so the
(1:12:59) idea here is if you put on a on a sheet what's the onetime value that I deliver and then what's the ongoing value and if you were to only do this only price this in a way that most people are like wow just these things alone are worth X this becomes your ongoing price and this becomes your upfront and so that is the concept of big head long tail but what you want to do is you want to make sure that what is being built on a regular basis that is ongoing value is ongoing value the things that you build one time are one
(1:13:33) time value and so then then you can create that described so ra so so probably for most of these qu you know the coaching education businesses instead of saying okay I'm going to sell you something for $30,000 it's $2,500 a month it might be it's 10K up front than $500 a month but then no one cancels right and so then you just play with how do I liquidate you know cost acquire and the thing is this is where the patience if like if I did this all over again like the the business model that gets fastest to 20 million isn't
(1:14:04) necessarily the one that gets fastest to 100 million because you might have this price the old pricing model which skyrockets to 20 million a year or whatever but then like you have a really hard time passing because turn starts eating away at you and so you're like shoot I need to sell more I need to sell more but it's really tough especially in a nich to sell more right whereas if you're not losing the customers then the first year you do you know eight the next year you do you add another eight on top you're at 16 third year you're at 24 you're like oh actually by year three I'm a little bit above what the other one was but the first one you're at 20
(1:14:34) and you think you're hot because you're beating the other guy who's lower ticket right but year four all of a sudden this guy's now at 32 and you're still stuck at 20 you're questioning your life and everybody hates you right but this guy's like man the price to value for my stuff is is through the roof that makes sense and when you want to sell something else you have this massive distribution of people who love you and your brand your reputation are all great because you delivered something really valuable and you charged for it and then you deliver something let's be honest less valuable
(1:15:02) but then you charge appropriately does that make sense yeah so this allows you to have basically price here price and then it drops to here for your ongoing and so you still always have the Delta this this is how I think about it yeah that's super helpful I never had like the discrepancy between the one time and the ongoing value I would try to Bunch the ongoing with the 6K ticket price but now I'm going to go right and so one thing I think is again a mistake that most people make I mean myself included I made this mistake um I think
(1:15:41) it's the vast is how most people do this in in this business is um they they take it and they spread the the payments over a year or some arbitrary amount of time I would rather say like I want to be very clear you're paying this for this and that for that and so if you need a payment plan we're going to front like it's I'm not spreading over year like you need to pay this off as fast as possible because that's what you're paying for and I maybe doing you a favor like I'll split pay it I'll three pay it
(1:16:04) or whatever and that might mean that the ticket price like and here's the funny thing is that everyone here knows this who's in in the high tiet world you sell something for $30,000 you're not collecting 30 you collect however many payments your turn is times 20 it's like okay yeah but we turn at 25% a month and we're our price Point's 2500 bucks so really it's 10K that's what you're actually making so whatever you claim versus what you make are two very different things and so if that's really what you're making then maybe you just charge seven and you get way more people to say yes because the thing is is when
(1:16:35) you have a 30k price point you still have to make the 30k sale but you're not even collecting 30 it's like the worst of both it's like you have a lower conversion because the price is high but you're even collecting on the low conversion and so it's like sell at seven maybe and then let's say that churn on the 500 is I don't know whatever 4% right and so now of a sudden it's 25 you're getting 25 months at 500 so you get 125 on the back seven on the front now you're at 195 in LTV and because you charge seven up front instead of trying to confront uh a 30k price point you might sell two or three
(1:17:09) times as many and now your epcs go up 6X because you had you trip you doubled LTV but you might also one and a2x conversion or double conversion so now you Forex epcs in terms of your earnings per click or your conversion what each each person is worth to you this is in my opinion the better way to run the business most people just don't do it and maybe in 5 years they'll find this video and is that what made gym launch cable no what made gy launch cable was that um I did nothing in it and it was very consistent and we had multiple forms of acquisition and so I had to
(1:17:44) basically paint the picture which was that did you know that 30% of gims go out of business every year and I mean they're like oh I didn't know that I was like right so no matter what structurally a third thir of gyms got a business because it's a tough business in general and so the good news of that also is that every year another 30% enter the market and so we can stay at this place and we can sell all the new gyms that come in and that means that this business will just you know continue to maintain and then the opportunity for growth is going to come from you know some of the other things that I had already like planted seeds
(1:18:14) for that were going to be down the line to increase L TV great I just want to say that's beautiful that's like exactly what I needed so thank you I'm ready to like go home and work so yeah see you guys for real yeah that was clutch thank you cuz with a coaching business you answered my question that I've been asking for like six months what is the end goal me yeah you've been asking me for 6 months no not you check your myself he's like I have tagged you every single day every day story Post Yeah than you oh good okay great number five
(1:18:45) we talk about how to build a community within any business and every single business has a community they just have bad ones and good ones but every business has one and so if you're doing it the bad way there's not consistent the second worst way is when it's just dependent on you having a relationship with every single customer the ideal way is that every one of these customers has a relationship with one another so that if your break with them breaks they still stick because they've got five other connections to other people in the community and that strengthens the bond that's what creates a network within a
(1:19:15) community and then it will always be bigger than you because one person can only have so many relationships and that's what allows your business to grow bigger than you this is just how I would explain it it's like each one of these people on the right this is the traditional way that most people are doing it which is that they try and become more and more interesting themselves model that's literally Guru model yeah this yeah here I'll just write it Guru model doesn't work well for Community by the way if you just post it doesn't work and if everyone wants to
(1:19:44) talk to you you're going to be exhausted yeah yeah and so think about this so like this is what it looks like visually and with your eyes you can almost immediately see the difference but the point that I would highlight is look how many tie-ins these people have to the community versus those people those people only have one tie and so likely like if this if this breaks right this breaks this guy leaves right he gets out but if all of a sudden this breaks right he you know stops talking to that guy he's still he's not going anywhere right
(1:20:15) or this breaks like nothing happens and so I think a lot of the things that we're talking about here are trying to get to this which is like we're talking about the maps we're talking about 15minute thing we're talking about encouraging the engagement between them like the whole point of all this stuff is to facilitate that like why do we want them to share things about themselves and take a picture of their car take a picture of their workspace or or share themselves on the map it's because then they can start orienting
(1:20:43) themselves with one another like that's that's how they connect with each other because they can find similar things and so it's like how can we create a space that rewards them sharing things that they can find similarities because fundamentally they have a shared interest but until they know the rules of engagement they're just going to be like okay well I do I want to get punished for doing something and so by having the categories by pinning exactly what you want people to do by dming those people afterwards like those are
(1:21:08) all things that then encourage more and more of this which then creates this and then this I'm actually really pumped that this is the direction that the the conversation went in because in a past you know uh probably one or two ago we went really deep on retention right and so there's lots of like what I would like the hard side stuff of retaining the community and I'm glad that goose you're here for like to basically have this the other side of the conversation of retention in the community which is the whole experience right what are the rules of how this community works and what do we reward
(1:21:38) and what do we punish and I think like I'll bet that the people were watching this and probably you guys too you might be able to cut your turn even more by doing this stuff somebody at her hand yeah shoot yeah I have two kind of questions how do cuz I I resonate with this a lot um how do you go from Guru like once you already are operating on the right side how then would you go to the left you don't decrease you you increase them that's good yeah okay that answers that the second one is for Real it did uh okay how do you sell because I think a
(1:22:15) lot of the conversation is pre-framed so I used to work for a lady uh she had 4,500 members and then what she would tell them is if you cancel you can never never come back for a year right which was awesome cuz people would never leave like it decreased turn and then the second thing was they would have requirements like for them to do um like what what are your thoughts on that I've seen the the you can't come back thing have zero effect in some businesses because they're like yeah I never want to come back anyways I don't
(1:22:47) really care um and so like it's like it's kind of one of those chicken egg things where like if you have a valuable Community then people fear losing it and so then they don't want to cancel but at the same time if you've a valuable Community then you've already won and so it doesn't matter okay well just one more point on that question would you sell an outcome different than you would sell a community um I wish I could just sell a community yeah right people have a hard time ascribing value to community I mean like in the gym world we used to say
(1:23:18) sell the bikini they come for the bikini they stay for the the community um and like the way that you you have the offer in terms of the outcome that they're going to have is going to be the thing that that's going to bring them in right but then all of this is the stuff that's going to get them to stay and so I would say there's different objectives like to get someone to convert you talk about the outcome to get them some to stay they're going to like you you want to reward as many times as you can within that community and basically it's too arduous for one business owner to reward
(1:23:46) every single person as many times as they possibly can to get someone to stick and it's so much easier to create the system that allows the culture that allows people to reward each other at a way higher frequency than you ever could as a guru cool and I really want to like like what's the word emphasize like The Leverage here on this left side like if you have a lot of client knowledge you can connect guys and it will exponentially increase your leverage on how valuable your community is like for example like like Justin right here like you should Network I think you should network with um other Justin over there
(1:24:19) and maybe Pablo because you guys both have like this commercial construction experience right like I don't know anything about commercial construction because I know like one detail about that you guys can get like a quick 15 and then you'll like associate that connection with like the value of my community and that connection and build go like that so like I can like almost like increase my leverage into like that construction space for example even though I don't know much about it but it'll add so much value to the community as a whole and it make you guys level up too so it's like a win-win yeah this is
(1:24:44) huge I actually sold a few people that way somebody asked me like if I have something on sales AI agents and I didn't so I searched up um school and it loaded up a few members that specialized in this so was like if you join today I'll connect you to XY Z who is doing exactly this and they join for that and then I connect them you wor about it's Greatful no it's good it's good I feel like this is the visual like I feel like this is the the main difference like this is what all the tactics that we were talking about earlier this is the end result of good culture like what happens is when
(1:25:21) community members start getting known like the leaders of the community kind of get get jealous and they like they remove them or like they punish them so you need to work on your internal side as well and be comfortable with people leading your community as well for you does that make sense like we have yeah we have Champions side of the school I mean good like all the all the names that say reference earlier like you bring the people closer to you who you want to encourage and create distance for the ones who you don't want yeah I literally
(1:25:53) never even think about that like we're building you guys up literally like we're trying to give you guys the fame and then the more we do that the better the the community is so like it I I don't what you're saying though I had this realization all of a sudden but yeah the PE if you have that mindset you'll never have a good Community because the moment there's someone that has anything good to say you're going to like kick them out yeah exactly I'm not saying I have it I'm saying don't have it I'm might happen it's kind of natural with humans you know I mean kind of get jealous of each
(1:26:34) other you've got to be mindful of things that might be not what they don't align with your vision for the community like oh everyone this thing is just way too complicated and I think this is a dumb idea even if people like it I I'm not a fan of this it's not for a personal reason I just it doesn't align with the vision of of the thing so you you you can't let it just go out of control you have to shape it a little bit um but that comes in who you reward and who who you pull closer and yeah yeah I mean when we we talked about this before even thinking like when we were coming with the idea of the school
(1:27:11) games overall was we wanted to have as many like school games champ like it's the games like we want school games Champions like that was the whole the whole point was to elevate it cuz we already like I already have the clout you know what I mean it's like our to like get as many other people so we have lots cuz think about it this way is like you want to have as many different walks of life and like avatars within the community that represent success like within obviously within you know the wider the Box the more buied the community the the Champions can be but like like I would love to like this
(1:27:42) isn't planned this just happens organically but it's like I'm glad that Evelyn is a girl who's you know really really awesome inside of the community and there's also black guys and white guys and older guys and young like we had the grandmother who hit you know a million bucks like it shows that like anybody can do it U obviously we're super super Broad in terms of what we're looking at but even within the subs segment of whatever Niche you're you're going after you're going to have different psychographics different demographics that can be represented and
(1:28:06) that's that only increases the amount of people like this guy or this let's call this a lady right these might be lady people right and then this might be a dude right and these might be dude people but if this person can't find connection then there's no no ties and then she leaves right so having different people that represent even kind of slightly different flavors like chocolate and caramel chocolate and coffee like it's like you have you have chocolate is your community but it's like different type different Flav subf flavors of chocolate
(1:28:36) yeah we can definitely see those circles in school Community like the ads people yeah the like creators and there's the creators guys all the like the YouTubers then there's the there's definitely the girls and there's definitely I call them the Chads Like We call we joke around at that about that like oh that's the Chad Network um and then there's the like the Boomers like for sure and by the way that's a massive population bigger than any other generation the largest business that we have in the portfolio crushes with Boomers so they
(1:29:17) have all spending power was that it's the largest generation in the world with the most money with the most n and spending power like you both like sell to them um and yeah you can start to see these different things it makes the culture more interesting then I'd say the goose and GIF people like they I honestly for a period we were seeing posts like how do I how to Goose instructions and like did you guys see all of these Goose posts it was like it Goose was taking over at one point and then when Ryan came in with GIF I'm
(1:29:57) not you the amount of our GIF usage on across our platform spiked so much that gify called us and said we needed to discuss a paid Enterprise plan and now we have to pay them a grand a month CU we're using 500 terabytes a month it's a testament of culture yeah and it's like but then everyone saw that and they were like oh can use gifts in my community I can use polls I can be more like goose and they're learning these different elements that they can play with yeah in their Community yeah the other one I'd say is calls calls is getting getting some the moment you take someone from just an avatar and some
(1:30:40) text to being on Zoom it's like it now you've got a a voice now you can see a face now there's some expressions and it there's more depth um so if you're not doing calls this is I'm sure everyone here is doing calls but I bet you there's people at home that are thinking they need to make a lot of classroom content no I swear all you need to do is have three posts that like introduce yourself and share a photo of your workspace what's your favorite book what's your favorite movie what's your favorite gift there's four posts that
(1:31:12) are easy and then one call on the calendar that could be just called coffee hour and there's no agenda you just hang out on zoom while you have your morning coffee maybe once a week three times a week whatever done then let it happen first right and then you can figure out okay I'm going to make this little module cuz this is what then you can start serving your community but it has to be there before you know what they want right and then you start serving and you keep adding things and curating and then it's more
(1:31:43) valuable so now maybe you charge and now maybe you increase the price over time and do you see what I'm saying like that's all you need to start we're actually going to hide the class tab when you create a new community H well we looked at retention making a course has no correlation to retaining as a customer in fact it's one of the reasons why people turn right cuz they say I don't have a camera right I don't have a lighting setup and I will come back when I've made my content yeah no  so it is and it has no correlation
(1:32:23) with retention so we're like okay let's just hide that Tab and let's just get encourage people to make a calendar and do three simple posts and then bring people in down now the engagements happening and then you learn you don't have to write article posts you don't need to this isn't substack like you don't have to sit down and like invent these articles all the time you're not a writer you're you're bringing people together it's it's a there's a difference there but it's very hard for people to grasp for some
(1:32:57) reason there was something that that you were mentioning before about um I I'll take it to to take it one step further it it's come up once but a lot of times the offer that you have this isn't for everybody but it's quite easy for an offer to be hard to to sell um and the person that needs it can't recognize it when they see it but fundamentally you can kind of always understand something like a Mastermind or a coffee hour and so if you sell that and you give them what they need you almost always score like I think we have like 98% retention for across all of
(1:33:36) them just because we reversed everything so that we're we bring them in on what they want but we give them what they need and it it just works every time and it's something that maybe you guys couldn't could also run with because it's a I mean it's it's a showstopper for sure and by that you mean they come in for the funnels they stay for the fun no they come in for the Mastermind they stay for the funnels all right bit stickier yeah we started the other way yeah it just worked better the the fun is just kind of like a cherry on top like it it's it's sort of I mean you'll see it in kind of like the
(1:34:11) Captivate branding I literally analyzed every little pixel and I was like how can I get more attention from one glance and so it was colors it was um bizar it was cussing whatever whatever it had to be it was just like just be whatever came naturally not like forcefully and then from that point the fun was like a nice introduction and a good tone a good cultural tone but everything else was just yet trying to situate and that was where our big roadblock was and when we reverse that like almost on accident it completely
(1:34:43) changed everything else yeah how many people here are teaching someone how to make money or do something to with business what I think you'll find fascinating is that most people don't want to start a business no like really I learned this after talking to Big YouTubers they're like oh but now that's a business and I was like yeah and they like I don't want that so like most people don't want a business what they really want is they want to like feel good and have fun that explains the whole world how many people how many people are at the
(1:35:19) Library ver vers versus playing computer games or like you know watch watching movies or like going to bars right like how much money gets spent on like going to bars and video games and everything versus everything else um it's it just that shows you that's what people want more than anything but I think once you become an entrepreneur it's even harder to see once you become a hardcore entrepreneur as you think everyone's kind of like you but most I can tell you most people aren't and no one is yeah like I mean 9% of people have a business and that like that means literally like
(1:36:00) own an LLC so that includes like hair stylists who are Solo prur so 9% so if you cut out solo prur and then just go people who have employees you're looking like one out of every I I don't know what the stat is but I would imagine it's probably one out of every 50 people actually has a a business with employees like it's not a lot of people this is why I think the fun element is really important cuz I've seen a lot of people say this they were like I never wanted to start a business or be an entrepreneur until I knew it could be fun right like it's I think that's how
(1:36:35) you make the market bigger for sure like if you want to get more people people to buy your thing and all of that I think a lot of it comes from not just more training or more like explaining or more like logical Concepts and Frameworks I think it's trying to make it more fun and interesting to people does that make sense yeah that's why I was excited about these recent breakthroughs that we've had because it's it directly translates to the actual thing you want which is retention sales Word of Mouth by the way
(1:37:14) like all of the things that we dream of but it it comes from tapping into this slightly different thing I love that we had classroom done it yet I think it's a great idea this next clip is about strategy which is my fancy word for prioritization fundamentally we all have a certain amount of time money effort people that we can allocate across a million different things and so the idea is the people who move the fastest in business make the Best Bets because they choose to allocate those resources to the
(1:37:44) things that get them the best returns and this is how to pick which ones you should so we're we were selling before we built the program okay so as I'm actually using time to create the content and get the program out there's less time to get more people in so the revenue goes down as we're building so how would you fix that aren't you guys Partners you you're not solo are you you split the responsibilities maybe one on growth one on building that's a great way yeah okay thank you nailed it and also you're going to
(1:38:24) work a lot it's as a side note like you're just going to work a lot yeah we work all day already yeah oh we also have one more person Kirby who does like Community Management so we divided it even more like I'll just think about making it better Kirby will run it operationally and hosi will bring people in do you see mhm that makes sense so get like potentially more people if needed if not just split the work yeah for everything's going down because you're like you the point I was making earlier about the
(1:38:56) classroom thing is like I would not want you to overproduce content for the classroom since the vast majority of people they quote want to buy it but they don't actually consume it um and they consume the community far more than they consume the content and so I would like try and make it as paired down as you possibly can to increase the likel that they do consume it and get value because if they see a ton of videos they just say like nah but if you say like guys the whole thing you can cover in less than two hours then the likely that they're going to watch it goes way up does that make sense so I would just not
(1:39:26) don't kill yourself on it try and think what are the actual few things they need in order to be successful just make that so that you can still focus on basically keeping keeping the business going yeah perfect thank you um how to revive a dead Community right so one of our partners um they got in school very early on and it just grew very massively before we had buil out our infrastructure they have 14,000 members just dead Community is just dead I think a lot of people in the school community haven't even been in there probably in weeks months um I think one time there
(1:39:59) was a lot of like Bots and stuff and we hadn't gotten that system in place and that kind of probably like wasn't good and then um so yeah how to revive that community so it can be more of a nurture to the paid so this is your free community uh into into music money no this is so yeah we we work with a lot we have a bunch of different communities okay um this is one of our free communties it's called Kingdom Minds okay yeah they have like 14,000 members and they're paid community is doing well cuz we do webinars right and we just sell that but the free community itself is just yeah like not 95% of people are
(1:40:31) like at level one essentially like you know they may do an introduction and then that's all they ever do so like just well is there anything you guys have in mind like to bring that back to life makes sense did you do the same thing that Zayn did where like the people went into the free thing you sold all the engaged people no and I think that's definitely part of it but even the most engaged people in the free group of that one are the people from the paid group they stayed over there and still engaged but it's like we can't
(1:40:55) elicit more engagement out of people they they're like oh I want to join you know they join make a profile and then they're like you know we don't know how to make it like a part of their every day kby do you have anything they you've hurt yeah I would like launch for something exciting like a challenge or something that is going to get people excited but why reactivate why do you want to reactivate what problem does it solve well it's just 14,000 members and I'm just like you know I feel like do a
(1:41:22) few broadcast post and there then move on do you post in that much um so yeah we have a school manager that's making posts in there um are they good posts it's okay post you know about like content nothing honestly a lot of the game that we got in right now about like you know making it more funny and entertaining will definitely like you know add that in there's been more value based and more like hey we got a free training which is the webinar so it's probably a lot more CTA what problem does the group solve um it's about social media you know no like why no no
(1:41:51) not not not for them like why does it exist for you uh as an upsell as a as a funnel to go to the paid community and to so it's the lead magnet it's the lead magnet well really the webinar is so here's the thing so the webinar is the lead magnet but we have a web hook that takes people to the free community so people were just getting into the free community after the web webinar so we don't even have their data on like phone numbers and stuff so all we have is their email from schol let me ask this if you just didn't have the free community would everything still work fine yeah so maybe maybe maybe you just
(1:42:20) have a paid community and you just run ads to your webinar sell people into the paid community and that's I just I think the only reason we'd want to get it better is just for discover you know be on the Discover yeah one point we were top 20 the community was top 20 cuz it was growing so fast and then now it's like I don't even know it's like up there so it's just kind of like we have this a bunch of members in there like I mean we could deactivate it but do you have any super users no yeah they they've already upgraded the paid members essentially they're still over on the free community but yeah it's just you know our our only point of really
(1:42:50) getting it back alive would be to get on the Discovery I think you know overall like raising engagement to get on Discovery page would be the ultimate goal I want to add something when it comes to the post so you have a community manager right mhm do they have their own accounts or do they use your accounts they they use the the person's account the yeah the owner's account okay yeah because if somebody else makes a post but they're a community manager nobody will pay attention because people join because of you are the artist right so yeah great point though I me think I
(1:43:22) think if you were going to try and engage it I think doing basically doing something exciting that is valuable for those people will get them to be excited and then I would just I I would I'd balance that with Sam's question which is like why do you even bother well if you do re-engage it one thing that we did that was quite successful when we were doing the rainbow games thing was One requirement was you had to tag people that were less active than you that you'd like to compete with and it was actually surprisingly successful yeah that's interesting sweet
(1:43:55) any of else come up questions St mind otherwise I'm going to grab out of this bag of of there was some that were interesting cuz all the ones left we've pretty much covered at previous ones right yeah they're like standard topics but there was some that were kind of unique this time around like um and I I think this kind of relates somewhat to what you just said which is what is the next lever to pull mhm it's like cuz you know there's a million things you could do like reactivate this dead Community but I swear you your time
(1:44:30) would be better spend doing something else yeah like how do you find that next live at a pull yeah so this is like so that question fundamentally for everyone here like if you could walk away with that being correct would be in my opinion the most valuable thing that you can do to walk away from here cuz you're going to have two pages three pages of notes from today and what's going to happen is you're going to get on a plane and you're you're going to have a fresh piece of paper and you're going to go
(1:44:55) through your notes and then you're going to write like a list of like three things that you're actually going to do and then that's actually what you're going to end up doing from today that will be the output of this day and so I just want to make sure that and then of those three things one of them will have by far a disproportionate impact on how much money you make and so most small businesses or even even midsized businesses don't grow as fast as they could because they spend their time doing the wrong things it's and the
(1:45:20) what's what's deceptive about it is you you can make an argument that reactivating this group can make the business more money there's a lot of things that can make the business more money the question is just which of these things will make it the most money and so by doing that we have to reverse back into we had those four levers that I had earlier we've got traffic we've got conversion we've got price and then we've got churn so those are the big four things and so if we want to grow the business those levers have to change or the business will not grow and so for many of you it might just be you
(1:45:53) need more traffic like the business model is fine the economics are fine and you need more traffic and so basically at least my thought process that I have with this is I try and scale as much as I possibly can until something breaks and then when it breaks we fix that thing and then go back to scaling the out of it again I mean fundamentally that's what we do and um I mean I I teach this at at for for businesses but I'll I'll I'll walk you through it uh so what is going to go to these four levers that we talked about earlier right which is going to be your
(1:46:37) traffic your 2f there whatever conversion which is you tweaking your about page making a vsl that's better adding Carousel images tweaking the bullets that you have on your landing page uh you've got the price which you can test and then you've got churn right which has a big list of things that you can do so these are the four levers the things that you're doing have to Lad up to one of these four if it doesn't lad up to one of these four things why are you doing it all right so like if we were to translate your objective with the free group you would have to say okay I think that the US reactivating
(1:47:06) the free group will increase traffic that's fundamentally what you're doing you want this traffic source to make you more money from your to towards your ticket High ticket thing and you say okay how much work will it take me to reactivate this group okay is there anything else that could get me more traffic than reactivating the group of the things that I have available so right now could me just spending more money on ads or making better ads make us more than me spending the time to reactivate the group if so forget reactivating the group make better ads or spend more money on ads does that
(1:47:36) make sense so once you figure out and when we're picking which of these three things or four things that you're doing the thought process is what which of these is the biggest constraint in the business and so if conversion rate let's say for example on the on the landing page is super low then it might mean like hey before getting more traffic I'm I'm going to I think I can double my conversion on this page cuz I haven't really spent any time on it at all okay well then it makes sense to spend a day
(1:47:59) or two like can I really clean this up and make it as crisp as humanely possible with the language that I use can I grab screenshots that are more meaningful that like you probably had more testimonials things like that you haven't updated like can I put that on there can I make an actual 3-minute vssl that that is more compelling than the one that I just like tossed up there okay that's probably a day of work well it's probably high leverage because I can double the growth of the business by just improving this conversion metric
(1:48:22) pricing like well if everybody just pays you more we already went through that example over here um this could obviously make you more money and then you have your big list of things that you're doing for turn and so cool which of these is the biggest uh thing that's going train in the business you pick the one that you're working on and then for me I tend to think through this more better new and I tend to do it in this order most of the time so like I will just ask when portfolio to is like why can we not just do more of what we're currently doing like whatever we're doing why can't we just do more so you'd have to make an
(1:48:59) argument to me that we should reactivate the group rather than just spending more money on ads and you have to make an argument that it's easier and it will make us more money than spending more money on ads and if you came out the argument they' be like well then forget about it if we can't do anymore for whatever reason we have some limitation like we can't post more than twice a day on Instagram like we just can't or we can it just like we've seen that when we post three times it doesn't doesn't yeld the same performance so two is kind of The Sweet Spot fine all right then what
(1:49:22) can we do to make it better right okay cuz if we can make those two posts just higher quality overall can we like really think through the hooks can we make sure that they're take that they appeal ideally to the audience that we're looking for if we do better then the quality of the traffic will go up the more views will go up does that make sense now if we can't do any more any better then we need to try something new and you notice that most of the times you can do more of what you're doing you can do what you're doing better which is why I so rarely do new things once you
(1:49:48) have something that works that's the hard part once it works it's like how do we scale the living crap out of it and the reason that most entrepreneurs in my opinion especially small ones get stuck is that they find something that works and they stop doing it and then they get distracted by six other new things and they get completely spread thin and it's and like what's ironic is that the small business owner is the one who has the least amount of Leverage and you have the basically your your contribution your time contribution
(1:50:12) to the the income of the business is more direct than anybody else's especially at this level and so like you like saying okay I'm going to take a third of my time that might just be like decreasing your business by a third um it's have a very strong argument for why that's going to make sense and then for who once you have a team then that becomes the the next thing it's like okay we know we going to increase traffic the way that we're going to do that is like we can't do more posts on Instagram so we're going to make them better and this is the process that we're going to focus on getting better
(1:50:36) which means that uh once a week I'm going to take three hours and I'm going to script out I'm going to look at other people's you know content that have really good hooks I'm going to write down all the hooks and then I'm going to make content that I think is going to appeal to my demographic in a better way cool now who's going to be you know if it's you then you're the who in a lot of these if the business gets bigger then it's like okay Jeremy you're running this and then we just measure to make sure Jeremy does his job that makes
(1:51:02) sense in terms of thinking through this and so we just want to make sure that what you are doing is going to map to what's going to drive growth within the business and I swear to God so many times people are just doing that does not map to this okay Red's over one quick question on that the the first four is there like a certain priority that you would recommend for like I'm a solo operator I'm doing like 50 a month BC offer is there like one of those big four that you would recommend prioritizing first you start here okay
(1:51:33) because this is how you have lifeblood in the business so you have to promote you have to acquire customers once this is relatively consistent even at a low level I then this is me how I think through this now not when I was younger normally I would just be like just do as much of this as you can forget everything else now it's do enough of this so that we can keep working on how do we how do we find the things that people actually want versus what we think they want and then there the things that we can remove like how can we delete things how can we make this
(1:52:01) simpler how can we make it more elegant how can we shorten the the modules that we have I mean we're hiding classroom for new people like think about this like we remove three calls a week like we're trying to take things away not because we don't want to add it's easy for us to add the value it's but we want we want them to consume it and so consumption should be the highest priority for everybody here in terms of making like how do they get value they have to consume value right so consumption should be the highest priority and so um we start here until
(1:52:27) you have enough flow going through the system that we can see what they really want and a lot of times these simple things like the last master I think we went through a ton of depth of all the things that you can do to reduce T right it's like so you experiment with that and this might be months while you're doing this I mean for context school didn't hit like a like let's go hyperscale until like recently and this was years right of getting the product right like obviously like there's people coming in every day and there was a enough promotion that we basically we could test and keep learning but it
(1:52:58) wasn't like we don't want the world to find out about it yet because we want to get all these pieces right once these pieces are right enough then you go back here and you scale living hell out of it boom y it's great so right now the question for you is if you have really low turn I don't know if you do but from what you were saying it sounds like you have low turn then then yeah do more traffic yeah do more do better of what you're currently doing so you're are you running ads yeah so you'd spend more spend more and Mak
(1:53:27) them better top 20% of my best customers targeted towards them now that I have that insight and then just keep making that better and then just more more better and then just spend 400 Grand a month on ads yeah sure I mean it's like an inside joke in my business like he's just going to say more better it's like y that's what we're going to do this quarter just like we did last quarter just like we did the quarter before we're going to do more we're going to do better and if we do both of those things we'll probably make more money and then if there's something
(1:53:52) that prevents us from doing more or better then we fix that and then we go back to more better does anyone have questions about what they need to do for this like like you need you're like okay am I should I be spending more money well if you're if your LTV is good in terms and you're and your and your CAC is low then yeah I just keep spending I guess for like low ticket communities you know recently you had a video where you went like seven things like a handwritten letters on boing exit interviews for communities on school like which one of these you go after it
(1:54:23) the first kirby I feel like you have even more insight with you the price sounds like the thing that's moving at say again the price okay because you've already experienced what that's doing right you know the average is around 20 you probably want to be on the good side of that so figure out why you're not like I would talk to your customers first like why did you cancel you want to talk to the people that cancered you want to talk to the people that stayed and you want to figure out what differences they have
(1:54:53) and then if you find the people that stayed did these things emphasize those things if you find the people that left did other things remove those and so it might not be price I'm just yeah it but you told us so um maybe it's price so like balance that and then you know with your traffic you you can drive more of that and then you can play with about page conversion you can play with that and then when you're both of those go back to retention CH I know I can drive like easily way more traffic it's just that I have a leaky bucket so I want to fix it so I'm like wondering if I should
(1:55:32) add the onboarding or you know events onboarding I think for sure is a good idea and how would you execute that for low ticket you do a group onboarding and everybody who signs up gets one group onboarding that you attend you do it once a week yeah I think people throw a lot of in their community and then they just keep adding and then they think they need to keep adding to make it better but it's not true like overwhelm is the main cause of churn think about the experience so how many things in the classroom would you say is like The
(1:56:01) Sweet Spot cuz like right now I have like eight maybe honestly the hardest part I found when improving anything is to figure out what's actually wrong with it that but I've been working on the school games funnel recently by the way homos will be happy about this um I figured out like what the problem to try to figure out what the problem was was actually quite difficult but in the was my it was this guy I knew from New Zealand who's a complete stoner that had text me when hosi when hosi launched the games he couldn't understand what it
(1:56:37) was and I was not going to try to explain it to him but when we came back to making this improving it I was like it turned out that he was the best signal for it actually what the is the school games I wrote it down that was the problem if you didn't know what school was you have and you see an ad from homos he's talking about the school games and some leaderboards and coming to Vegas people don't know what the that is so I wrote down what the is the school games and I was like that is the problem so but that took me a lot of
(1:57:10) research to to like find right I was talking to a lot of people I was doing this with Kirby it's quite an interesting process right and then we were like okay well how do we describe this damn thing in a way that is Mak sense to like a stoner dude um because it helps to use extreme cases like Steve Jobs tested products on children because like if they could understand it anyone could understand it right so like defining the problem and then coming up with different ways you could solve it I've been doing this with goose and Kirby and the office all week we
(1:57:48) probably designed we came up with many different ways to describe what it is many different landing pages many different bullets and we just kept talking to users getting feedback and kept iterating it we probably made 30 versions some of them were so wrong it was I wondered what kind of tangent you'll never see it but you know we actually at the end of about one week we landed on something and um and now everyone we show it to instantly gets it it's like we don't actually have to fully launch to find out out when you learn how you can use
(1:58:25) everyone to get like feedback and talk to people and show it to people and get their reactions you can do a lot of fast iteration Cycles without the harshness of like reality then when you launch it into reality you have a way B chance right um so that's how you improve anything like that that's not the games but that's what we were doing to the games recently we Kirby was doing interviews with all of the winners that was overwhelming not many people were showing up so we cut that we just did one hosy Q&A a week right attendance is up every viewing is up people are now
(1:59:04) saying that it's way more valuable and you know so it's we were unlocking the one day recordings after you got three customers we like why are we making it hard to get the most valuable thing now you just need three members they can be free right so like what do people value how do we make more people experience that what do people not value take it out what do people not understand reword it you see it's all the same but I I will I will I will emphasize what I'm saying is that there's a it's so much more work than you expect it to be and
(1:59:42) everyone wants like the one silver bullet that you're going to magically fall on it but if it were obvious you would have already done it and so it's like it's disguised and that's what I mean this is literally what makes business hard and so I'll have a business owner on a Q&A call say like what should my price be and I'm like I don't know I'll walk you through the process of how I'd figure it out but I don't know your avatar I don't know your traffic scores I don't know the value prop of your community and even if I did
(2:00:05) I would say I'll start here and I'm going to do the math and I'll move it and I'll do the math I mean with a portfolio same thing I was telling I was like we tested 50 35 25 15 we just tested it I was like I don't know we'll find out and then they were all the same and then I was like okay well which business would I prefer and then we go into that right and so just just in terms of thinking through things like the amount of effort that goes into it that most I would say that like as I've gone as I've G moved up in business the my understanding of the level of effort
(2:00:34) that's required to solve complex problems has gone up 100x it's just significantly harder to solve more complex problems and that's also why the biggest paydays are on the other side of those problems because if they were really easy to solve everyone have already solved it so it's like 4 hours and a cup of coffee and a bunch of data you're like all right let's try this there's a quote I learned from the software engineers at school they say you have to make every detail perfect but the only way you can do that is to limit the amount of details that you
(2:01:05) have so inside of the school games we have eight videos all of them together are less than 45 minutes one course we do one call per week and that's it and once a month you get a download from here the Mastermind that's it very easy to explain to someone one call one course one Mastermind a month and there's 13,000 people in there each paying 99 a month and they get the school software that a question yeah so there's a fine balance between because if you're a leader of a big Community right if you're showing up too much you kind of
(2:01:46) almost lose your power right and if you do q&as every single day nobody one it's not special so how would you balance Q&A calls making posts inside of the community and just showing up and like giving people attention like that I'm sure there's a data answer for this rather than me just guessing we can probably find it out of like what the the best you know Cadence is I'll tell you I personally I think post twice a month in school that's not planned I just I just kind of poke around and I see what people are struggling with I
(2:02:18) made that Niche post because I was really tired of people like what's my niche going to be about I was like here's how you find your Niche and so it's just like I just listened to what was the like there's you probably noticed this in your communities there probably like a pro like a problem dour it's like people just kind of glob on to a single problem all of a sudden and like I felt like I was seeing more and more of that so I was like all right I'm going to try and answer this and so then you make that and then it's like hopefully and if it does if you put the thing in and then that problem still exists then you didn't do it right so
(2:02:47) it's like you have to do it again you have to make it simple you have to make it easier whatever it is you keep doing it until that one goes away and then like the next problem will occur and the good news is that your customers will always have problems yeah and so you just solve them I can tell you a good thing that works for me um so I spend a lot of my time reading what people are saying like I'm trying to understand what things people are struggling with so I'm not in there just posting a lot I'm in there
(2:03:13) listening the most more than anything else most it would be like 90 it would be like a lot of time is spent listening trying to figure out what is going on what should I improve what problems is the community facing right then when I'm pretty sure I've got those problems I'll even talk to some power users and I'll validate do you think these are actually problems right and then I'll make sure I'm clear on the problems first okay now if I spend now prioritize them what's the most what is the most pressing problem okay number one now I'll just focus on that at least I know if I just
(2:03:50) fix that I'll add some value right yeah so now I'll try to fix that and I will try to fix that by research experimentation Etc and then I'll come back to my community and say hey I saw all you guys were facing this that sucks I fixed it here you go and that's how I like that's how you add value seriously no like I I have this little template on my wall for emails which is uh hey I made this thing for you here's what it does good afternoon enjoy like CTA like that's like that's my email template like it
(2:04:29) just makes it really simple like hey you guys were struggling with this thing I made this for you here's why it's important goodbye the hard part is finding the thing yeah like I said how do we make the school games funnel better well what's the problem with it that's the real question and it was some Stone a dude who had the answer yeah so you wouldn't have a schedule of like daily or second like every second day or definitely not that's like a Henry Ford production line for Community like we're not trying to pump out posts fast that's not what makes a that's robotic that's not that's
(2:05:07) not a good Community a good Community is something that understands your pain and experience and delivers Solutions and is fun yeah you're right yeah and isn't overwhelming and doesn't make me read five articles a day I like value Post Yeah cuz I don't want to read a bloody article that's a pain in the ass like I want a solution or I want to laugh one of them yeah so I have a question if you guys had to decide on building like a an Adonis school or an anime shreds which would be your choice I actually don't understand the question so the the model that they have like you look at Adonis school and he's got loads
(2:05:55) of um uh delivery in the calendar section like every day twice a day uh and it's a higher price point and then you got Anime shreds which is you know nothing in the calendar but loads of posts like just emojis and random stuff which is a better model for actually helping more people get in Greater scale and then eventually making more money with that well I guess we'll find out if you guys had to pick one which would you which would you pick well I've watched both of them the anime shoes one's super interesting because it broke a lot of like preconceived ideas like it had no
(2:06:35) classroom when it launched it was $1 and it grew to 100 Grand a month faster than anything and became number one on Discovery right like real fast and there wasn't a ton of posting in the from the owners it was mostly driven by the members right um plus I know their their about page conversion rate is one of the highest what I'm really curious about is their churn but I guess that time will tell it's new but I think the fact they started low and then increased higher makes it's a good move for churn and I
(2:07:06) also know churn is low when your price is lower so that will be quite interesting to watch over time and so can it scale I know hams is trying to scale higher in a donor school I I think animation R SK apparently want to scale more both people probably want to do as least work as possible right so there's that and then there's the retention and we'll like over time we'll see like how those two models differ I think what anime shs wasn't just the price though I think what they showed us is that if you if you have like some
(2:07:52) unique like the fact that it was called anime shreds and the artwork yeah that's that definitely added something um that's kind of what Goose showed us if you make something a little bit more unique and that's just like free performance right like if you can make your landing page conversion double by just theming things and making them a little bit more interesting that for sure is really good like I would encourage you everyone to think about that um but I can't say which model was better anim shs converts
(2:08:28) way higher but Adon school is way more expensive and they're both making around the same amount per month it'll come down to epcs earnings per click so fundamentally if 100 clicks go to Adon school and 100 clicks go to and this is this to be fair is purely contrasting the business and like the community because traffic sits outside of that because if animation R 10x is their traffic they will become 10 times bigger than than Adonis School independent of what they did inside of the box and so if we're just isolating conversion right price and churn then you look at what's the if I have 100 clicks how much are
(2:09:05) these clicks worth for this business versus this business and then that literally just gives you the objective measure of which one of these creates the most dollars because I'm kind of at a point where I'm like I you guys start the school games and great they've got that platform for us and then I said okay I'm going to copy what you guys doing with the school games and how you run things and I copied Adonis school and gang because that was the guy at the top right now anime shreds looks like he's
(2:09:29) going up there and I'm at a point where I'm like which which model is better and which one's actually yeah cuz I'm not that good at business I just see things that work and I copy it you're not bad well there's going to be more there's going to be more so if you keep switching you're going to get in trouble exactly that's where the stick the sticky honestly like even saying it like that me thinking about it is like it's probably neither it's probably the one that that is more like authentic I've got a feeling as to
(2:09:54) what it might be but you know all right what is it the feeling yeah what my feeling to do with it is it goes a bit opposite there cuz I'm doing 17 lives a a week in my paid at the moment so yeah but my my feelings telling me to put it in the free community but I mean that might be stupid cuz I'm trying to listen to what you guys are saying you're saying no we're just doing one now and it's like so I'm a bit the you know I think if you want to use all that like all that so last last games a ton of people I think it was last games
(2:10:26) it was like it was like the lives games it was like everybody was doing like Instagram lives it might have been maybe two ago um and that the thing is is like we have to separate promotion from delivery so from a promotion perspective you're doing lots and lots of lives you're making lots of posts you're making all this stuff oh no I understand I got you and so my point is is like I would take all that energy and put it into promotion so you get way more people into your community and and then the thing is is that you if you do 17 lives a week externally it's okay that
(2:10:57) people don't consume all of them because if they consume one of them then they might buy whereas if you're inside of the community and you're doing 17 they might be like Oh I'm missing out on 16 out of the 17 I'm not I'm not getting the value if it's free your cost is time and so as long as you deliver a return on the time that they spend consuming your content then they got they have a positive exchange with you and so you basically it's like you can never promote too much you can put too much inside of the community and so I would take some of that Juju and put it
(2:11:26) externally to drive more through the box I think H actually did like the opposite like when he increased the daily coffee to like nearly every day um his turn like reduced massively so I have no idea uh he's messaging me like every day and trying to figure out like all kinds of things around churn at the moment um I my answer to him he kept coming up with ideas my answer to him was talk to your customers I recently was pretty public about this is that like I widened my content for I think either 3 or 6 months I like started sprinkling in some other other pieces I talked about how I
(2:12:03) eat and like Lea you know how Lea and I run you know being married and things like that and the the the problem is that you do get positive reinforcement from it and so it's like he made some stuff on relationships and then people are like oh this is awesome but the thing is is like the wrong people were saying it was awesome and so what was happening is my audience was growing but it was growing with the wrong people and so I had I mean I had this moment where like sometimes you have these like I had a a friend of mine come into a
(2:12:29) friend acquaintance i' say flew in and was like um and he probably does 10 million bucks a year and uh and he was like yeah you know um yeah I don't I don't listen to to much of your stuff anymore and he's like yeah I was Hardcore for like six years um and then I I just kind of um I guess it didn't really apply to me anymore he's like I guess I'm not really like your avatar and I was like you're 100's Avatar like you are exactly who I'm going after and then I was like oh I'm a and I just basically it's like you you get you get it's a balance you like
(2:13:00) you want to listen to customers but you also want to make sure you're listening to the right customers and so um I reoriented all my my content which maybe some of you guys have seen um and it's been 100% back to business has been the the theme that we have internally my guys now um is that if it's not business we don't make it just very straightforward like it can be business adjacent so like if I talk about you know prioritizing like tasks in my day that can have some element of productivity into to it but it's like all my examples are going to be business
(2:13:23) related and so but by doing that when I looked objectively across metrics for site conversion opin Book Sales applications to the portfolio all of those metrics went up even though the average view per video went down and so it's like I'm not in this to get famous I'm in this to make money cool question um I wonder if anybody has I this might be for everybody but like has anybody done anything to when they do have a turned customer to get them back into to being a customer or send a funny gift you just send a funny gift in a DM ask credit perur you have you seen
(2:13:59) him yeah ask him for his message he's apparently got some message he DMS people with a funny gift and it gets people to reactivate it say it's like something like leaving so soon is kind of like the vibe is kind of yeah but you want to get the funny gift of course yeah and it's just within school yeah okay so no email SMS or anything like that our sales team has that for uh ghosted leads a Kevin Hart meme that's like I think that might be it I think that's what he's using yeah and uh yeah it like it gets higher response rates than any any message this
(2:14:32) next clip is about growing the business even Beyond you meaning who are you going to bring on your team to help you get to where you're trying to go and if the people that you're bringing on keep being dumb and making stupid mistakes it's not their fault it's yours and the good news is it's a skill that you can fix and in this part I'll break down how I get the best talent how we recruit them how I hire them and how we train them so they can win hiring related stuffing delegating low stuff just delegating low leverage stask so I can focus on like be specific well for me I know that if I spent 100% of my time on
(2:15:05) just YouTube making YouTube videos I can get to like 100k or even 150k a month but right now it's like 15 to 20% of my time so just everything else but what is that well building the modules delivering the product um calls appearing on calls everything about Community because you kind of need to do all of those things yeah yeah but like there is a lot of stuff like you know maybe emails like sorting priorities like calendar all of those things like could be outsourced so like I'm wondering in what order like do I hire so I can basically spend 100% of my
(2:15:41) time on the thing I have the most expertise in well building out the modules is Mo mostly a one-time thing and then once that's done that'll be off your play the emails are 100% Outsource they're plenty of copywriters who can write emails for you and I'd recommend taking somebody who's in the community who knows your voice and can give you like a good V1 draft and then you just tweak it and send it the calls you want to basically just show up like that's I mean more or less that's kind of how we run this like I show up we do the Q&A
(2:16:14) and then I move on with my life and I treat it just like it's a meeting and I do it on my meetings day cuz I do meetings on Mondays and so we do it on that day cuz it's the lease disruption for how I work and so if you have so I I'm I'm going to have a really big piece about this coming out soon but basically the difference between maker and manager time so if you have deep work that's what I consider maker time and a lot of people in any organization you got copywriters video editors coders like they have they have to just like get really deep into a project and you want to minimize time on meetings as as much as possible so that they can work
(2:16:44) basically when they're on a meeting they're not working there are managers which is the opposite which is for them being on meetings is working right right uh and coordinating between things and talking to vendors and uh I mean like sales guys customer support like those are those are people who like when they meet is when they work and so those are both fine the problem is when they intersect and so managers start interrupting makers uh from making and the problem is that makers only have 14 time blocks a week you've got one morning block and one afternoon block
(2:17:12) and that's it like I'm sure when you're making a YouTube video it's not like you can't split it between two meetings right like you need a whole big chunk of time managers though can spread their time in 15minute increment and so they have 20 time slots a day but a Maker only has two and if you take one maker slot up it's like you just killed one 14th of my week right and so there's a disproportionate cost for a manager compared to a maker when it comes to calendaring now you're the entrepreneur because you're like how why is this relevant for me is that you do both and so what's been I me like if I had to bet
(2:17:40) like my single greatest return on time habit that I have was that the first 6 hours of my day since I was poor has always been zero meetings and it was just that well shoot but people started calling cuz I had Rick and mo
(2:18:00) rtar you know gym people started walking in at 5:00 a.m. right so I was able to take you know like lock my door to my office um and I just was like morning sessions I don't I don't participate in but as of 10:00 a.m. I would then start working and being out there so from 4:00 to 10: was my 6 hours every day and then from then on I just knew it was just fires but that still allowed me to move the ball forward so I only got a maker like basically five maker slots during the week but then on Saturday Sunday I got four more so I got nine blocks of time throughout the week that I could do like major big work and so if you can look at orienting your calendar so that I mean now I only have
(2:18:32) one day which is Mondays where I do any coordination or any calls or anything and the rest of my week is truly empty like truly I can show you my calendar it's empty and that takes time to get to but that's because that's like the team knows that if I have an empty calendar we make more money and so for you you have to try and push as much into that one day as you possibly can and that also means that if someone's like hey I've got this person that you should meet and it's on a Wednesday in the afternoon and it's one meeting you just say no yeah I think I honestly have to
(2:19:03) do but that's the only time I can make then you're like then I guess we're not going to meet I think I have to do the time study you suggested like the timer every 15 minutes cuz like it's you know it's kind of hard to go in retrospect like where did the entire day go like but like you're working all day but like what was achieved right maker time like when you have a maker block you know exactly what you're going to be doing you have the one thing that you're working on and sometimes it takes five blocks in a row to get that one thing
(2:19:28) done like what the is the school games like I'll bet you it took more than one maker I know it did but I'm saying and in terms of the people you're hiring like especially at a small business scale like do you is it better to just hire somebody who can get the job decently done or should I wait like until there's like a killer um that's a that's a tough question um I it's a it's a super tough question I would say that it's going to basically you can you can see the Arbitrage between how much more you get back for the time basically so let's say we take let's just do an
(2:19:58) example let's say you bring in a mediocre email writer if the defici the discrepancy between how good your emails are versus their emails but the time you save not writing the email goes into YouTube for example if you can make up the trade then it's worth doing does that make sense I think you would benefit the most from just a generalist person so someone who's hardcore fan of yours already emerging in the community is already doing the stuff kind of for free probably would be stoked to work with you won't cost you
(2:20:28) too much money and we'll learn everything as you go with you and they'll just do everything that doesn't make sense for you to do probably like you probably have a few customer support tickets or emails they'll do those I mean M already does that for me but oh you already have someone the issue is that he's still in school so it's like part-time basically so I probably need one more person quit just get him to quit yeah get him to quit he's 16 yeah get him to quit is that legal is that legal um D you're going to learn so much more doing this but his mom would kill me I think well don't don't say don't
(2:21:04) blame it on him yeah don't blame it on him that's all fight his mom David y'all definitely need group on boarding though ASAP bro that's like the next thing up for y'all that's I I learned group on boardings from the first day one recordings y'all need those ASAP bro yeah another thing is uh you could get an EA like if you have some like tedious tasks like when I got my executive assistant it like saves So Much Time on My play if it's just like tedious things are a little bit simple I don't know if you you probably have like a bunch of stuff that's like simple stuff that you have to do that you could
(2:21:34) just pay somebody like you know like offshore Talent like you know anywhere from like six to eight bucks an hour to do that yeah David do you have a Setter like anybody in your DMs no bro you need that ASAP too bro a Setter in your DMs and group onboarding calls and your your community is about to your turn will go way down and you'll get a lot of would I give somebody my school password to go I mean you'd probably set up a mini chat account or G like one of these other people you're talking about yeah we're talking about in your uh social media yeah yeah like drive like everything
(2:22:03) from YouTube to the page cuz it's YouTube oh okay sales do you don't have any following on social media well everything go on YouTube basically like no Instagram no nothing like that I mean not really are you collecting any phone numbers oh no so even in you're free school you don't ask the most simplest funnel possible he's he's younger generation man they don't do this I mean like people are telling me to add email right and like eventually I probably have to add it but like I like my simple funn you know so dude I didn't
(2:22:32) send emails for 9 years Jim said no emails wow I I I say that to point out at the extreme of like whenever people are like you have to like you don't have like there's no col them hm did you collect them yeah I mean I collect them cuz I like I felt like I had to but like I I did nothing with them like truly nothing that eventually I hired someone and they just send an emails and I just like was like I don't want to read them like I'll kill everyone how many more years do you have in school uh two in high school and
(2:23:03) then I mean well he's your bottleneck cuz he's school is your bck okay school is my B neck for school yeah your constraint yeah for sure pick one if you're going to get if you're going to get into entrepreneurship then like whatever you know I mean I mean I I I try not to to tell people to quit high school but like I just don't think it like so your fingers worth it to quit just it's just the system is so like what are you learning yeah I mean right not much yeah right you're like so I want to not learn a lot of stuff so that I can learn not
(2:23:40) much for most of my time I get it like I mean I it's very tough I get that but it's still like yeah if you're going to go to Mid school or like be a lawyer or be an investment banker or work at Goldman Sachs or like maybe you were going to do computer science at Stanford then sure stay in school but if you're not going to do that it's useless yeah if you going if you're going to entrepreneurship then like there is no degree that's required okay yeah just a thought even a business degree is crap oh yeah it's
(2:24:09) irrelevant yeah I have a I have a similar we well we have a similar problem with delegation so for the promos and for all the engagement that Justin has to do in the community it's hard to find time to like balance both of both those two both of those things and really the big bottleneck is deciding if we're going to have a videographer with us all the time or like hire someone on a project for project basis where do you think works better out of the two um honestly I think he just needs a videographer that he likes a lot I got Sam laska there that's right and know he's with me all
(2:24:47) the time yeah it's it's been the most difficult part like we've been searing for a videographer for like I mean basically years at this point yeah probably year it's not that hard of a roll feels like feels like new yeah but um but yeah it's it's cuz all them they just they end up dropping off really really quickly I don't know they just they they don't like maybe it's a culture fit thing could be that but like it's been really difficult to find all the roles for sure someone who's going to stick with us travel with us who made you want I feel like anyone in this room would want to do
(2:25:22) it said there's so much value just being with Alex every day they'll be people in your audience but does he not want someone following him with a camera no no I mean we we definitely would prefer that no but him it's him who yeah he he wants someone following us but like it's it would be Thomas but like Thomas isn't he he's not a videographer like he's he's a he's a different role entirely so he wants someone to follow on he wants someone who like can like have good ban or will push him sometimes like someone
(2:25:54) who's like a friend gang yeah has you made a post about it oh yeah we make we do do hiring post basically every single month why doesn't he just learn how to use a camera oh that that's actually what I used to do at won't point so why the  you don't you pull out a camera I could yeah yeah you're already friends if that's the element and you know how to use a camera I mean  you I mean the only thing that's I'm still like thrown off by is like zillions of people have come in and I'll bet you that many of the people who've applied would have been a fit so I just
(2:26:28) it might just be a weird hiring process you guys have I mean when we when we run our things actually how did you come in I applied for Leela's videographer and I was like you're with me yeah um yeah should he had Jason I agree on the feeling P though if someone's going to be following you around all the time like the vibe is more important than the skill yeah than anything the skill is not the thing it's just the like Vibe of having them with you all the time Daniel asked me on the last question in the interview he was like well what's what's like cuz I was
(2:26:59) telling him I was like listen I'm going to be like hey we're going to do this big thing and you're going to set up and then I'm going be like nah just kidding and it's going to happen all the time and then also uh like you're going to have plans and then you're going to have to cancel them last minute cuz we go late and like basically it's just going to be chaos and I can be in a bad mood and I can be tough sometimes and I just like painted that picture he was like God it I'm here for it but um he's like what do you like
(2:27:25) I'm really experienced I think you were like I'm a really high caliber videographer what do you need a professional for yeah what do you need a professional for is what he asked me and he's like what's the most important thing for you to me and I was like like I really thought about it and I was like you like me that's really it did did you uh start off sorry what was your name Daniel Daniel did you start off like absolute Pro with the with cameras no I had to learn how to use Cameron when you started when you
(2:27:56) started started with Alex I'm referring to when you started with Alex were you already good oh yeah no so I I say that because like I'll bet you that there's like people in that list if you have had thousands of people apply who are videographers like there's definitely somebody in there who's an exceptional videographer and so for me I honestly like I am I am grateful that Daniel has a skill that he has and can like edit bangers and do all sorts of like he's a weapon he can do lots of things but like for me if his skill was half of what it was but but I
(2:28:30) like him as much as I like him that would have been enough this is just like your skills are just bonus for me um but it was just like we have such a sick Vibe on the on the media team I think we have a sweet like the team's awesome um and so like I've had a videographer in the past that I and nothing wrong with the guy I just like wasn't I didn't like look forward to you know what I mean it was just like work like okay sit down and like every Court stop and it came out in the came out in the footage and
(2:28:55) so like I have to look forward to there should feel I should feel no friction or no hesitation to having Daniel around like I'm not worried if he's around if I'm saying I don't have to edit myself um and like that is number one you've got he's got to like me and I've got to because it's both it's both ways cuz he like if you don't like someone you can capture it very differently like on some level like you can make someone look very different if you don't like like them and um and so it has to be both
(2:29:23) directions like both people have to have to get along with each other that that's probably something we ever really looked at we cuz sometimes we want like really really nice stuff it's like mov level you know with the SC motion shots and whatnot and obviously when we look at the application I prioritize liking a person and the thing is is like I bet you if there was something that we're like hey can you learn Adobe something you'd be like sure I like it'll take me a couple weeks but I'll figure it out and like if you have that type of person it's like I just it's so much harder to find someone you
(2:29:55) like than it is to find someone who has the base skill at least in my opinion with this role so I would just I would prioritize someone that Justin likes and then that's it and then from there like the other skills I remember where you mentioned this I was watching some of your content you said you been kind of made a system for how when someone was filming you they're nodding they're bringing you your nicotine and all that kind of stuff y so y all the I mean Daniel's always got Nicorette caffeine water Gatorade he's got he's a full full
(2:30:28) full service um at all times he's always ready I was putting that up there yeah yeah no it's super awful and like after every every recording session it's kind of like on a foul shot for basketball like everyone everyone pounds afterwards like it's just like we always do that like w like you guys can't see it cuz you guys are looking at me but I can see them and like they're nodding the whole time while were're filming because they know that that cuz when we thought activities right what are the things cuz so Caleb who runs the whole team he was obviously Higher One and so he had the
(2:31:00) camera first and um that was the first time I had a vrf that I really liked and I was like oh man like Caleb's cool as like this like this feels this isn't this is easy right and I was like what makes it and then so then Caleb obviously moved up and then he stopped being at the filming session so we had you know two or three guys there at the filming sessions and I was like man this feels heavy like what's like why does this feel different and so then we had to backtrack and be like what what does he do that is different than what other people do other people were like the vibe is like Vibe I don't care what
(2:31:30) does he do and what he did was he would nod while I was while I was going and after every filming thing he was like that was awesome like sick that was so dope and then he also listened and he had really engaging questions that he'd be like so how does that relate to this or how does that so the followup questions were great and they could slice that up and that made for really good content because the the questions he had was questions that the audience had and so it's just looking at like what are all the little micro things and then you make that into a
(2:31:59) checklist and that's why I think most people can't teach anything is because they don't get it down to like what are the behaviors and so now the team I mean the whole team knows that when they film it's like a whole thing did you like buy out a bunch of people or like no we do so we so I'll tell you the quick process and then we'll we'll move to a different topic but um we do the big application gave a big raw file told everybody they had 48 hours to submit uh the raw for that way everybody's work off the same thing cuz
(2:32:27) if everybody can just pull from whatever then the quality of the content is going to be a huge Factor whereas if everyone pulls from the same raw the quality of the editor is going to be the thing that shines through and so um this is from the editing perspective if we're doing videographers then yeah it's going to be way more about Vibe like in terms of our our Dynamic um but for editing uh then they would submit and so from 1,200 we got 60 subm just to give you Ana like 5% of people actually submitted Riley did
(2:32:53) you come from from one of our contests uh no I was reached out to but it was pretty similar process like applied gave me W file edited yeah and so then they turn it in and then um you know Caleb would look at all of them and be like these three guys are sick and then they'll interview those guys and then however many of them are cool we out that's fundamentally how we do it like we test for skill for editing we test for skill and then we test for Vibe because it's way easier to go like from 1,200 down to a much smaller with from
(2:33:25) skill um from a Vibe perspective um what was the process for you for videographer stuff I did like four interviews actually five interviews um one with Caleb two with Frank and then one with you and then one with you was intense I was like this is a test everything's test you had like one really tall chair and one small chair is's like pick one I was like I'm s a small chair hilarious that wasn't a test yeah yeah that's funny um so yeah hopefully that give you a little bit Insight yeah the sure yeah it's really all about the chair sizes this is what matters yeah but Al like I needed somebody who wasn't
(2:34:07) going to be trying to compete with me you know what I mean um I just like I don't I didn't want that energy I wanted somebody who's like super laidback and Daniel's as laidback as they get when you didn't did gym launch you said that you don't do emails like you didn't do emails how did you nurture your clients then or like kept in contact with them um you mean leads yeah I just got more of them okay I'm being dead serious like I mean like there were there many things I probably should have done I just every time someone's like do you want to start emailing I was like h no and I didn't
(2:34:41) want to give it to somebody else until eventually they were like can we please hire someone to just do this and I just didn't look at it I'm just I'm so particular with written withu written word it's the it's my primary way of communicating it's like my like people despite the fact that everyone on the internet sees me on video like my books are better in my opinion than anything I create but it's also because I spend more time on them than anything else and so when I see someone write I'm like this makes no
(2:35:05) sense this is completely unclear why do like why do you exist yeah but also I think I kind of understand your question a bit and I'm kind of like horos in this way is if you've got something that working if you've got something that's working that isn't email and you can just keep increasing the volume of what you're doing then who cares and that was it we just kept spending more money kept making more money so I was like I could do that or I could make more ads and Crush yeah I mean honestly I think Sam
(2:35:34) and I are so aligned with this which is just like find something that works do it as much of it as you possibly can and eliminate everything else in real life that's not that and that also includes all your personal life stuff like like this was a theme of the whole last talk if you guys all heard it we talked for like an hour maybe more on this one topic of like everything that you have like cooking cleaning laundry getting your car filled up with gas like all of this stuff if you know that you can make more money with your time than
(2:36:04) it than it cost you to get someone else to do that then you should do that and then you'll be amazed at how much extra time you have if you're cleaning your house or preparing your meals that's going to be the best thing you learn from this event is to to get someone else to do that cleaning and meal prep and groceries is like the lowest hanging fruit so I calculated this ship on based on us averages so just the big three which is laundry cleaning and food related those together are 96 hours a month on average it's like I just found
(2:36:36) you two and a half full work weeks of time but and also that doesn't include switching costs of like the cost of time of like cleaning up like cleaning up after you eat and well thinking about when you're going to do it and what you're going to eat and groceries and what you're going to buy and putting them back in the shelves and taking the bags like all that I really want like emphasize like the whole like personal chef like housekeeper stuff like I haven't been a coach for long my first 6K pay in full I got like an in-house Health team which is like a housekeeper a chef and like a dietician and stuff it's crazy but they're not
(2:37:07) that expensive like I pay my I had a maid and I pay her 150 bucks twice a week to come over and I have a meal plan I give it to her and she shops for the food it's all Whole Foods they come over they make it I have like 20 meals in my fridge at all times they're like amazing good like like Latino whipped up food it's great and uh I was able to take like three more sales calls a day and that's a big reason why I Haven won the school games like that was huge and you also feel amazing about it it's like it
(2:37:31) was like it seemed like it's like super luxury investment like oh shark has a private chef but it was it's 1,500 bucks a month like if you do the math it's 96 hours it is $1,500 a month that's literally like I have a big presentation on it it's $15 and like 16 cents per hour if you can make more than $156 per hour with your time you should do that it has nothing to do with luxury it has everything to do with like what is my return on time and like you can just ignore every poor person who says otherwise this is kind of for both of
(2:38:01) you probably you Sam as well definitely Sam um but I guess like when you're building you know a startup um obviously you know you might have sometimes you might have a little bit lack of capital A little lack of resources I guess how do you get a players to work for you and with you and how do you like structure comp structures and all that so it like you know go for it when you don't have any money no no no no not we no no no you maybe you're trying to get somebody who's you know making decent money you know already or you're wanting to get
(2:38:34) you know we're making money but like you want to get an a player team um but you're still a startup you're not you know yeah well it's really hard it will probably take a long time you'll probably want to quit but but eventually like something you'll just there'll be a chemistry I think and a perfect fit with someone and you just kind of have to give it enough time until that thing happens and it and you also have to offer something unusual like for me it was offering the like co-founder title to Daniel cuz I knew
(2:39:15) when I found him that that was what I needed to use so programmer yeah might yeah um and you know when I found him it was like the perfect balance because he just wanted to code he said I love to code I can build anything all I need is someone who can dream and he was like if we've if you've got some like money and you know what to build and you can help us get customers and and well I needed it was code like then we're good and we we had like a good chemistry how did yall meet if you don't mind me asking I did 600 interviews did you have a like a a hedg
(2:39:57) hunter so all I did for a year how did you find how did you get the interviews did you work with like a I worked with many different recruiters hacking news like I tried honestly bit of everything plus I had to hire five of the wrong people too so it's not like I just got it right like it was the most brutal thing I ever did do you do you have like I I hear people talking about doing more interviews do you feel like there's ever like a sense of uncertainty like after you get to a certain point you're like damn option number one two and three are good or whatever like what
(2:40:27) do you think yeah like some people I swore were great and they weren't at all and I'm sure some people were great and I didn't see it and I missed them but how can I know about those um but in the end like Daniel my co-founder he was like there was chemistry and I think I didn't I ignored I was too logical back then but I think I've come to realize now that the chemistry is really important and I pay way more attention to that now ultimately you're not going to know until you hire them right but you just have to talk to a lot of
(2:41:06) people too I feel like there's there's been this case where I feel like everybody wants to be an entrepreneur you know so like when I'm trying to you know hire people it's almost like they ra they're like i' rather do that myself or rather do what kind of person uh just you know uh I guess like high level people for a growth partner agency so like somebody who can like be a growth partner essentially or be a you know I think I think me and Chris's problem is we're unicorns and and we provide our people with like we cover all the bases so we
(2:41:36) need more people like us yeah and then yeah so we even we've even talked to some people that we know aren't making you know that much money and like hey man I'll pay you triple what you're making right now you know I'm like managing School communities and they're like I'd rather do my own thing and it's just like wait what you know what I mean it's like a disconnect I think sometimes so I don't know like it's like I can't yeah the money is not the thing right right absolutely cuz you know when with us we're like competing with Google NASA SpaceX Tesla so everyone's trying to
(2:42:10) throw money at them MH and they show us their DMS on LinkedIn and stuff it's insane like the amount of recruiters right um so money can't do it like it has to be something else right in your case do you think it's like the environment well what when I got my co-founder or when we get people now like everybody well the hardest one is getting the co-founder in the beginning because you don't have anything so right that's the hard one but with time now the way we get it is through internal referrals so if we have great people and they've worked at places like coin most
(2:42:48) of our talent comes from coinbase and riot games because we've got some of their best engineers and they know everyone and when they tell they're like hey how you going over Riot or coin or okay burn out dude this place is badass where I am and they trust that person because that person isn't a recruiter they're the probably the best software engineer these other people have worked with and so the word means a lot what about people like that aren't cerss though like what about like you know Andrew or like Matt you know oh that that's a different side of the business so that comes from your
(2:43:24) customers so Matthew who's running our podcast he came from the community and like he showed he was making podcast episodes for free and then he flew to the first school games he paid for it himself he's from Ireland like who on indeed is going to do that I don't know if you've ever tried indeed it's so bad but yeah but you look from them within I think like Kirby was in my Mastermind and then he made this free community called synthesizers he was one of he was on the leader boards for school Community right so's like okay he's
(2:44:09) committed then Kirby hired wictor where's wictor there he is because he was his most engaged member in synthesizers so you see and then wcta hired this guy called Nas cuz he was someone who connected with him on school too and now Nas is referring someone I love it yeah I think that's what we're hoping for right like whenever you're like don't like with that being said we don't have the best people in the world but we're we're kind of rooting through internal it starts with one yeah but if you don't get that one you'll never get anyone else we have a few good really good people I'd say
(2:44:44) but yeah have you pushed them for referrals um yeah but I think I think the big thing is get getting the high level people so we have really good like um executors not really good leaders that's one thing that we we have like I'm I'm literally I'm managing like I feel like I have to run like five meetings a day almost you know for our team so it's just like excessive it's a lot yeah it's excessive so I would challenge the structure then the vision for the business has to be big enough that smart people can fit their dreams inside of it and so if you want break
(2:45:20) then you need people who like they need to be able to believe that their dreams can come true within your vision if it's again if it's like yeah we've just got a couple groups that we're running and we're making money then it's like that doesn't like really get me motivated if I'm intelligent I'm CU like the best people have there's no lack of opportunity for the best people they have tons like you have to think about this is It's a totally different game like you're if you're accustomed to taking people who like I really want a job all of those people are irrelevant
(2:45:46) you have to be people who are like in some ways you're competing for them so the more you're competing for a prospect like selling them and so if you feel like like I'll tell you the funny one is like if you're interviewing people where you're like sell me on why I should take you if you say that to somebody who's actually really talented they'll be like I'm good like they just like they just don't like I you have to respond to this offer within 12 hours it's like okay well I think you hit the nail right there for me like their Vision has to be our vision needs to be big enough for their dreams to you have to be able to say
(2:46:20) like what we want to do is we want to make music money into the standard for this and then they have to believe with a decent amount of certainty that it's possible and so like how you guys present like you are absolutely selling them and so like I think Drew this about on on a past one but everybody here understands you know lead generation lead nurture sales onboarding and then you know retention Ascension right that's the how you do with customers right this is the exact same process for an employer you generate applications
(2:46:50) you nurture applications the sale is the interview you onboard the employee and then either retain them or Ascend them it's the same thing and so you basically have to understand the acquis like this is when we get into scaling because everyone's like two or three people are like what's scaling is it's just where the inflow of talent into the business matches the inflow of customers into the business and you have to have an exceptional conversion process for attracting Talent this is where brand counts double it counts once on the front end for customers and again on the back end for talent and it becomes
(2:47:21) either a virtuous cycle or a vicious cycle either destroys your business you have a bad brand because what do you think what like what um like great talent will look at your reviews and be like oh yeah never mind they would work at a good place so I guess and last question I guess what what would be the best way to like acquire Talent is it just building a personal brand like in our field of work cuz I don't think it's necessarily like I can't I don't feel like I can find the right people on LinkedIn or something like that you know for what we're trying to do it needs to be people who are kind of like already
(2:47:53) kind of entrepreneurs or people who are in more of like the sales or manager manager field it really depends on what role you're looking for but I can promise you that very smart people are on LinkedIn do you know how I um I I looked I got invited to speak at something and I looked at who else was speaking there and I saw hor mosy was speaking there and I was all right there's my opportunity that the first time we met in person yeah honestly so cool was that one year before I spoke about doing a deal but you have to like be strategic sometimes
(2:48:30) yeah and then so you have to kind of do this old school networking thing which I  hate because it's like the only time I've ever done that the deal is like the one deal to never do that again um but yeah you kind of have to do that I had to start going to like these software things I had to start to meet some software Engineers I had to learn about their world I had to ask people about why does what do you hate as a software engineer what do you like what makes a good company what makes a Bad Company you have to like learn everything about
(2:49:07) it and network and do that it it really sucks honestly but if you're serious about it I knew there was no way I could build school without this person so I delayed starting it by a year just to find the person yeah so I was like I'm not even going to start until I find them like that's how essential I knew they will that's why I tell everyone to not do software it's just because the scale of how difficult it is to actually do a right is so hard that like no one basically no one does it right even when you know even if you know what you're doing most people can't do it and most people who are quot in
(2:49:43) the info world are like oh my info thing is INS sellable so I'm going to build software and they just think that like white labeling high level means they had a software company um like but I mean right and or they create some widget that someone else can duplicate in 5 seconds that they did off with an offshore developer that like if it actually did work then that developer would hold you Ransom and then what like they just don't play it out two steps and the code anyways and it's all it all sucks like yeah don't do it yeah
(2:50:13) and someone were like you're just you don't want us to succeed that's why cuz you're you're doing so I was like no man I saw that Sam put five years in I was like great okay I saw the metrics I was like okay this is legit I spent all my money and it still wasn't enough yeah I had to spend like twice that again yeah thank you guys for that too by the way that that's going to help a lot I apprciate this for real yeah I mean the personal brand thing is just good for recr like if you have one it's great it helps a lot um but at the end of the day if the if the if the business that you're trying to build solves a
(2:50:44) real problem and you really genuinely care about the problem if you find someone else who also cares about that problem they will be more likely to work with you like that's fundamentally it what are you sorry last question fun what do you think about creating a an offer to train people to do what you are trying to eventually staff for like how I'm growing yeah like you know like in training there was a point there was a point in time I had a closer program I was training closers and I was Staffing them you know what I mean and then I was I stopped doing that cuz there's so many
(2:51:16) closer training programs but right now I really need grow Partners people who can lead and manage our clients and kind of oversee everything what do you think about like I know there's a growth operator thing but they're not you know like in my mind like they don't have all the skill sets necessarily what if someone you know created a program to train people I don't think you create another business of software role okay depends if it's like I know with a software engineer no one's going to be any decent in 10 years maybe a prodigy in six or
(2:51:45) seven but like there's just no shortcutting it like I mean my co-founder's done 20 so the years matter and the same is true with a lot of things like there's just years so like but some other things might be different like setting okay yeah you can teach that closing yeah you can probably teach that but these more high level strategic things yeah that ain't happening like it took me 10 years like so are you going to wait 10 years is no yeah it's it's like fundamentally every skill is trainable the question is
(2:52:23) whether it's worth the return on effort and the resources to train someone with it if you break things down enough you can train someone to do anything it's just that if someone lacks has zero meta skills they don't know how to read they don't know how to write they know how to talk you could teach someone to do all that stuff it's just why bother so I'd rather take someone who's already here and then just nudge them if I can with you know proper training that just Bridges the gap between all the skills they come in with and then
(2:52:49) applying that to my business you got it cool appreciate it yeah always I mean the people is the reason that most internet marketers in general can't make money I'm sorry they they make money but they don't make like big money is that they just can't they can't they don't know how to operate people and that's usually because they need like a right hand a true right hand who can who's as good as them and like Lea will never get the credit that she deserves and that's fine um but like the reason that all of our
(2:53:18) stuff is so big is because she's so good at at building like she's an unbelievable Builder and so like the culture of the team is Rock Solid I mean the guys will tell you like Lila really runs the like Ila runs acquisition. comom like I I really like she really does she does like Lea runs everything like I I mean I told you I have an empty calendar I can't have an empty calendar and and also have a business that's running unless someone else is actually doing it Lela takes 15 meetings a day she operates she's she she's
(2:53:49) coordinating things between different departments she's checking on portfolio company she's having you know one once of people who having some sort of emotional breakdown about some craziness whatever um she handles all that with a smile you know what I mean and so but like I I I was we were talking earlier like I capped at $3 million a year and then when Lela came in 24 months later I took home 17 million in income net and so the difference was that she liked people and I tried to avoid them and that was the problem and so she
(2:54:23) her like Lea's genuine Vision in life is to build a company that people love working at that's her whole like the whole reason that she like she gets up like her internal mission is to build a company that people love being at every day and so her vision just fits within my vision and so I recruited her to do it but like if we didn't do stuff that she liked we'd like she wouldn't build it so I very much like especially the more talented the people that you bring on the more you like like they don't need pushing like they know what they're
(2:54:55) doing you just need to make sure that they're doing it in the direction and you kind of do this yeah the amount of training that you have to give someone is inversely proportional to the skills that they come in with so the more spe basically the the less skilled the person the more specific the instructions so like Sam could basically just be like hey can you just promote school a lot and I'd be like yeah he's not like hey could you make make these posts and write this copy and send these emails and run ads and make the hooks
(2:55:24) like this like that exchange has literally never occurred like I don't even know if Sam sees the ads before before they they go out Moi takes me the other day he was like when does the activation stuff come out and I said last Thursday no like for real like I already did it and then he was like I've seen this and I was like yeah I've already been thinking about that we've got something coming like we don't even I've already thought about the next four things and we've got things ready so by the time he has the idea I'm like yeah we got it don't worry do your thing and then I'm
(2:56:01) like cool let me tell you what what I'm doing on the media side it's like oh  great like these are all the things that I'm ramping up this the system we're putting in place like we changed our Cadence like things like that it's like oh dope I don't even want to think about YouTube so like if I had to tell him stuff oh my God like yeah but it's good to divide it like that cuz I can just focus on this stuff he can focus on that stuff Kirby can focus on his stuff we have very good like division like that yeah the amount of Direction you need to give someone is inversely proportional to the skill they
(2:56:33) have yeah someone could just be like hey can you build this company and be like sure people will complain like if people it's always a sign of noticed when people complain there's no communication have you has anyone had this as an issue um like with teams maybe a lot of you don't have teams yet but bad communication communication sometimes it's always the complaint yeah I found it's interesting that one because you don't really need to communicate a whole lot when you get the right people like hosi said like a couple of words and I was like don't worry I got it like what happen like
(2:57:10) right but sometimes if you hire the wrong person there's no amount of communication that can ever make it work and it's exhausting and just still doesn't work and I think I understood this I think I told this at one of the previous ones but how you know what a good culture is is this story of Google in the early days so Larry Page searched for something in the ads that showed up were not relevant to the words he typed in he took a screenshot he printed it off he got a red marker and he wrote These ads
(2:57:42) suck he walked over to the engineers and he pinned it up on the wall and he tapped it and one of them walked over and picked it Off the Wall stayed up all night that night and invented AdSense which is their which has made them hundreds of billions chill so he didn't sit down with them and be like look I think you need to do this and this and this and maybe this he just said these ads suck right is that clear communication I mean to him it was no but that's what good talent is you can just be like this thing they do this
(2:58:20) yeah you don't even have to say do this you can say this sucks sort it out like and then they'll they'll be on it or they might have already preempted what sucks cuz they've already been thinking about it so I always remember that when people say oh like you need more meetings or more communication like there wasn't a meeting first of all right there was there was slapping something on the wall yeah one of the most difficult things this is like I think this from an entrepreneur perspective in terms of development is like has anyone here had
(2:58:52) another business before this yes okay did you achieve in this business what you achieved in your last business like in like from how long it took you to get to that level in your the business before versus how long it took you to get to that level with this business was it way faster and so a lot of the reasons is because you already beat the bosses up to that level so it's kind of like you're quickly retracing your steps and then you get to a level that you don't to your level of incompetence the difficulty the the thing that takes the longest in entrepreneurship is figuring
(2:59:22) out what good looks like at each level and it's one of those things that's really hard to translate like you see the billionaires on stage and they're just like I you know get great people and you're like sure but the thing is is that connecting what great people to them looks like in their mind and what you think great people are that is an ocean apart and so I mean I tell this story and same when I was talking about this last time but like I when we started meeting with private Equity firms uh to to to look at transacting with gym
(2:59:51) Lodge I we'd have these super long tables that were these boardrooms and I'd see their team all the way on this side I saw my team all the way on this side and I would just kind of sit there and listen to like the questions that they were asking and the responses that my team had to be fair the team that we had had built $100 million plus company pre covid obviously I sold during Co which actually hurt my valuation but not the point um so they built a $100 million company which is cool but when I saw this the town on this side I was like oh that's why these guys are going
(3:00:20) to make $3 billion over the next 5 years this team and it was such a stark contrast in terms of the level of talent again not disrespecting my team it was just such a difference that it was literally like after that immediately I was like my whole bar was just reset in terms of the caliber of the people that even existed in the world and everything was like how on Earth do I get those people to work for me and so like right now some of you have like one person who's like man I couldn't live without that person there's somebody who's
(3:00:51) literally 10 times better than that person that exists right now and it's just trying to figure out what you need to do to get them on your team but the problem that takes so long is looking at what good talent in general looks like but even when it gets R specific like Sam had to do all this research to figure out like how do good software Engineers talk like what do they like what do they want and so some of you guys are at a point where you need to like start hiring a sales director something like that like what happens is like this is the entrepreneural journal
(3:01:17) it looks like you bring someone on you talk to a bunch of people and then you're like I think this guy's good you bring him in and he sucks and that takes six months away from the growth that you would have had because your sales team drops and this guy sucked you put bad processes in then you got to fix the process you got to fire the people that guy hire cuz he sucked anyways and then you're like shoot I'm going to try again you bring the next guy in and then sometimes it happens again and you're like wow this sucked and then the third time and sometimes this takes a year or two years and then you're like I now
(3:01:41) know and you get lucky and you get one who actually works and you're like oh this is what a great sales director looks like and so the next time you go through your entrepreneur JY like you go right to there and then you're like shoot I don't know what a good customer success person looks like and then you try again and so it's like however quickly you can work through that so you can start recognizing the pattern of a what good looks like in general and then B what it what good looks like for a specific role that's how quickly you
(3:02:04) move through the levels that's been my experience with this and I wish I try and do everything I can to try and translate that into the stories that I tell with the content but sometime it's really tough because people like nod but like that is that is the secret sauce like that is it is being able to recognize like what a good growth partner looks like what a good even a good agency I've have good I have good agencies that we work with now the vast majority of them 95% of them are dog  some of you guys run [Laughter]
(3:02:35) them so you know what I'm saying so like that's that's that's that's the pattern recognition that's the highest value thing that you end up learning as an entrepreneur is what what good looks like so obviously like I'm I'm doing a lot of the management for our community and that includes like making posts from from as Jus and obviously Justin has like lots of businesses you know like construction he's going to be like on helicopter soon like shooting whatever so and how how could we maximize his time within the community cuz right now he's doing two calls two calls a month I mean I mean if
(3:03:13) you if you modeled what I mean what my contribution right now is I do one call a week and we do this once a month that's my contribution and then I ad hoc look at you know I poke around and I see what people are asking and then I end up usually just like I haven't committed to anything I just write one or two posts a week sorry a month that are just whatever is kind of top of mind you said like on the calls that you do right like you treat it like a meeting like a on the calls for the school games like the
(3:03:44) weekly or the monthly call you just kind of sit there and just like treat it like a yeah they're Q&A they're like this when he said like a meeting he batches it on the day that he does all of his meetings yeah I do my school call on my day where I have all my meetings so it's not as disruptive as if he was like I don't know writing a book and then he had to switch gears to do a zoom and then switch back into the book that's that's going to take more than an hour or like I can't record like if we're
(3:04:10) going to go record you know some YouTube videos or something and that's my whole warning I can't like start recording YouTube videos and be like hold on guys and then like go take a call and then go back to record like it just doesn't work and Kirby's there to make it less taxing on hosi so hosi doesn't have to scan the chat or pick the questions yeah so like if you're going to do a call have someone like Kirby on so you're Kirby in this like I would just literally model what what he what what Kirby does on a regular basis and just just replace
(3:04:41) roles it's same same setup and you record them and it turns into content yeah I also record them too so I so so Daniel's but you got I mean actually shoot you guys have probably seen some of them me yelling at the at the laptop I don't know if you see him on Instagram but um some of them done really well um but he's right there I've got my webcam here and so those get clipped into content for me so it's like I'm doing delivery for the people you know for the school Community but I'm also getting clips for marketing and those get those get hammered out so
(3:05:17) it's you get double do you record your course yeah and I post them in a call recordings with time stamps as well in the classroom page you make content with it are you guys recording it with another camera like for we we could make content with it we we haven't done it yet I'd recommend it because like you'll get the I'll bet you you get the most heated yeah you get like super heated I get I mean I get heated on the calls cuz if you can use it for many purposes it's a much more efficient use of time yeah cuz that 1
(3:05:45) hour made content it bought in customers it delivered value it made a recording do you know what I mean and then people also ask like if you think about this publicly if you're promoting a snippet people are like how do I get on those calls MH and then he just yeah people really like when like Justin gets really passionate about like things that he's just interested in on a daily basis so yeah those those those probably those moments will probably be the best reals or whatever yeah all my best Clips are just moments where I just freak out at
(3:06:14) someone so this next part's super important it's about client and Avatar selection so one of the big reasons a lot of businesses suck to actually operate is that you have too many different customers who want too many different things and so you had to promise lots of different things to everybody to get them to buy but now you got to deliver on all those different things to all those different people and so learning to sell and specifically learning how to sell the right people and say no to the wrong people is a
(3:06:38) skill that will absolutely unlock growth and profit in the business because you'll get more of the right people because you'll talk to them and you'll Ward away the ones that suck I have one little question how do uh how did you and kale meet or you know how did CL really same story that's so cool man he had a clay his gym was losing money he was working a 9 to-5 job he would work from
(3:07:04) 5:00 a.m. to 9:00 a.m. at his gym teaching sessions he'd go to his job at 9:30 or whatever work from 9:00 to 5 go back to his gym teach all the evening sessions 5 6 7 8 his wife had just had a baby she was pregnant with her second child all of his income from his primary business went into the gym that was losing money and they had nothing left over and so he called me up or he didn't call me up and like he responded to an ad and I got on the sales call and and um I was like all right it's whatever it was at the time he was like he was honestly the first 10 customers I sold um and he was like I I would buy this I
(3:07:34) need this um but I just gave my last 10 grand or my only 10 grand to this coach that was going to teach me how to have an online Fitness business and I was like do you have an online Fitness business and he was like no I it didn't it didn't work or whatever I was like well what if we just made your gym make money would that be more he's like yes I'm fine with just making my gym make money and so um I asked him put 1,000 bucks down and he like put $1,000 onto a credit card or something that's so beautiful bro that's so that's sick he made $38,000 in his first 30
(3:08:04) days I I think I think that's the coolest story in the world whenever you give some like give somebody the chance to buy an at a thousand knowing you you probably never even let nobody buy anything no everybody started a th000 bucks for the first three years wow cuz all gym owners are broke all gym owners are broke and so it's a th000 down th000 a week so the thing is is that and this is what everyone in the entire like the entire infos space still doesn't get because everyone's like my programs it's like no it's not it's not it's not the average gym that still to
(3:08:34) this day goes through gym watch makes over $20,000 in additional new Revenue in their first 30 days average average first 30 days we track it because it's such an important metric for us and the reason that we have to do that is because they don't have the money to pay me what I want to get paid and so it's was like I know that the system's going to on average on average triple your profit will go from 36,000 to 112,000 in profit net of our fees is in after you've paid us you'll make 112,000 that's the average over a
(3:09:06) year but when you're broke it doesn't matter because you're still broke and you can't buy anything so it's like put 1,000 bucks down and I still needed him to have money for ads so he had like $3,000 I like keep two for ads give one to me and you're going to run this ad which is a video of Ila you're going to run this ad to this landing page that I've made you're going to put your logo at the top and then when these leads come in I was like you're going to call them like you need to feed your family which you do and so it's exactly what he did and so um once
(3:09:37) the you know the second payment came in and I'd give them like a 14-day delay because most of them didn't have any money and so they would pay it they collect cash from the people that were coming in and they could make the payments and then I gave them incentive in the first 30 days to prepay the rest of the thing at a discount and so that way it turned $1,000 down into 16 Grand in the first month and so my LTV to CAC and my cash flow in terms of acquisition was super strong um and then like we ran
(3:10:02) that we ran that for very very very long time I think like a year and a half ago I think um after after I sold and Kel took over he switched it from a front end and back into just selling a year for 36 I think is what it is um and so that's what they do now and it's just uh they bill every 28 days and I think it's $29.
(3:10:22) 97 or something like that a month so it's you know 3K down or whatever and um and that's and that's fundamentally what happens but like I'm just saying like the reason the niching is is useful is that when you Niche down you can productize the delivery like there's no generic business quote Consulting that can ever deliver as consistent of an outcome as a very Niche business can because imagine if you had to do it generically you'd be like okay come up with an offer make something free and you'd want to run it to a lead gen page and then when the leads come in you want to call them quickly you have to talk in generalities whereas I was like here is the ad this is the landing page this is
(3:10:58) how you set up your lobby when they walk in say these words this is the price you're going to sell at and by the way here's the delivery for it here's the mail plans here's the cookbook here's the eating out guide here's all that stuff you can put your logo on it you can make it yours I already spent all the time doing it and the sales training they went through was the sales training I put my trainers at my gyms through which by the way my sales training was less than 1 hour and so there's all this closure training out there that's
(3:11:22) hundreds of hours long but when I needed to get guys to close it was 60 Minutes it was like this is what you say to them it wasn't psychology it wasn't like so we want to increase their demand I was like when they walk in the door say this and then after they agree say the next thing and if they don't agree you don't move on until they agree then you go to the next thing and then here's where you ask for money that was it cuz I wasn't trying to make a course to impress people I was trying to make a training that op one a result and again I did turnarounds for 2 years and so like I had to give stuff
(3:11:53) that to busy gym owners who hadn't paid me cuz the the turnaround business they didn't pay me so I had to make the training for them like how do you do nutrition was 130 minute video that was it I was like this is the color template weigh them in divide their weight by 10 which means you just move the decimal I like had to break it down I was like okay so means you have 21 food units put the first eight over here this is all their protein then you can tell them you can scatter the rest between carbs and fat you just do the yellow list got it
(3:12:18) great have them take a picture with it in front of them that way their numers there put it against a wall like this like there's just there's nothing they could mess up and because of that because all the variables were controlled they all got a consistently good outcome and they just took a long time to do cuz I had actually done it at multiple locations and then 30 plus turnarounds in different markets so also when I get the customer who is like this won't work in my market I'm like I've got five other gyms on your block but people are very limited you
(3:12:48) know I had a I had one of the gym turnarounds that I did I launched the gym this is important just for your customers I launched the guy's gym and when I decided to switch to licensing I called back all the guys who hadd done the turnarounds for I was like these will be the easiest Sal they literally saw me crank 100 grand out of their gym in 3 weeks called one of the guys up and he's like how do I know it's going to work I was like I just did it in front of you like I you saw me meet with 250 people and he's like well I don't know
(3:13:17) if it's going to work worked for me and I was like you will never win but like some people are like that and I was like it's not worth the time just move on it's a really specific situation so like so I started as a BDC offer right but my top 10% of guys who like really kill it are the existing agency owners usually stuck at like a certain range and I install like the closer infrastructure and all that stuff how if I wanted to explore that and make that to 100% how would I deal with my existing 40 guys who got in at a BC offer who have this like expectation
(3:13:45) that I that I could like the B Toc offer is what a make money like a generic how to start an agency offer yeah yeah I would get rid of those yeah well same thing with this way just like again LTV to CAC like how much does it cost to acquire them how much like when when people were trying to decide between avatars which by the way the concern you have is the probably the number one most common concern that people have in business it's also one of the biggest leverage points that you can have is picking the right Avatar so you're in this overarching space of agency but
(3:14:18) if you like almost always when you go up Market you make more money almost always and so when you deal with somebody who's a higher quality Prospect they pay more they're lower maintenance because they already have more skills coming into it um and so forth right and so if you just look at CU I had a I had a hair salon uh lady asked me this question so she was like I have I'm getting 17 to1 um or sorry 24 to1 uh selling uh um hair stylist on my extension technique so she had some extension technique that was like extensions are like two grand and it and if you and she had a technique to
(3:14:55) do it in like 30 minutes so they could make a ton of money in a very short period of time and she's like and I have business consulting or coaching or whatever which has like 11:1 um LTV toac she was like so should I focus on like my business coaching offer or should I just sell this hair extension just like teaching how to do hair extensions which is not really a business offer at all it's just like how to it's like a hair thing right and so I just boiled it down to LTV to cak times Tam so it's like if you have crazy
(3:15:25) LTV attack and you have a massive Market which she did there's way more hair stylists who don't want business coaching and just want to learn more about hair so it's like you have both more customers and a bigger discrepancy between what it cost you and what you make and so then the only thing is just n and if there is a massive market then you can crank n as in the number of units sold by a timeon and so I was like and from there you can cross sell the coaching thing if you want to the business Consulting but stop running two
(3:15:48) two front ends focus on this one that you have the greatest Arbitrage on smash the out of that and then all your focus becomes on ascension and cross cell does that make sense so for you I would probably like you're going to have to Sunset the the 40 guys over time if you are better at delivering a result like go where the value is as in whoever you can help the absolute most is who I think you should sell to so if you're like I have three different people I help it's like well which of them like this happens in um I had a lady who had tile business so she sold tiles like a very generic business she's like I sell
(3:16:22) to homeowners I sell to uh designers interior designers and i s a home builders three completely separate avatars I was like okay which one's worth the most to you she's like well homeb Builders are pretty much just only care about price I was like okay well then maybe you don't sell to them interior designers she was like these people um they're they bring me customers all the time like they come with their the person they're doing the living room for whatever and then you know the people who just own homes he's like they're you know they're kind of
(3:16:50) like oneoff sales but they have the most margin I was like okay I was like which one do you like doing the most she was like the interior designers I was like how many people does an interior designer bring you on average per year and she was like 30 I was like okay so she was calculating it at a transactional level rather than at the res at the interior designer level I like so how much does it cost you to get I was like how do you get interior designer she's like I do Outreach for a week once a month and I get like three to five more interior designers who come in I walk the facility and then I
(3:17:21) showare them what we do um and this I mean this business was doing 7.6 million Topline and like 5 million in iida murdering it um and so I was like cool so you now are the the interior designer is now your avatar so you need to become the interior designer de you need to make their life amazing don't sell to home builders don't sell to home home owners just interior designers that are people that you've got on your roster and and then all you do is you go from having 30 interior designers that send you business all the time to 300 and that's it and there's 300 interior designers every setting and so all she
(3:17:56) has to do and she already had a way to acquire them I was like forget everything else so it's like you want to just like sake through that and a lot of times that's where this massive unlock happens in businesses like in most businesses go through this because you start throwing stuff on the wall you start selling stuff you start looking at the customers you have and then you're like huh I'm really good at these people I suck at these people these ones are okay and then you start making your delivery you make a decision
(3:18:18) strategically to say no to this money and this is where people can't do it this is why everyone fails they can't say no to money so you have to say no so when the 41st person comes on the phone with you and it's like hey dude I like really need this like I'd love to have a way to you know make money online or whatever you're like you should just watch for most these videos for free and then start a business and when you have a business call me okay so like I know my I mean what I'm what I'm best at is the acquisition
(3:18:42) fulfillment and the operations of existing agencies like my two best clients your course away for the money people give it away for free okay give it away for free it'll me and then you'll be like look I've had 40 people pay me whatever they sold you know you paid it's like and I just want to overd deliver in value and I'll give it to you for free and so use it because I really just want to work better with agency owners because the 0o to one stuff you can just just do it just do the work it's not that hard once like that way you can self proove that you're legit and then I will tell help you scale it from there and then like tangible items
(3:19:13) to like actually Sunset them like what does that even look like how long was the sale for the 40 how long did you sell them for was the duration it was like I was starting off it was like an inner circle just like 6K like Lifetime right so this is the problem with lifetime deals yeah you have a onetime onetime income with a forever delivery um like right so the the real real the ethical way to do it refund I think pull the rug refund so if I make the decision just hard conversation refund Integrity restore that's going to suck but okay
(3:19:46) how many of them are what's up how many 40 I am send them to someone else maybe but wait are they still how long has it been it's been like two months oh okay I mean I would like this is the like this is the tough part you know like you either I mean the alternative is you like the thing the thing I don't like cuz if you had said it's a 12we program then i' would have been like fine live it out like finish it out but you're like lifetime you're just going to these people forever ask months in yeah yeah cuz that's at least going to be 12 months you got 10 months so you got to trade off like you could probably
(3:20:25) get away with it if it had been a year yeah but you were only just starting yeah to go all in on school I had to re I had a calculation of how many of my Mastermind members I had to refund I had to refund $2 million to go all in on school that was losing 700 Grand a month how about that did he say losing yeah losing is it I refunded 2 million to focus on something that was losing 700 Grand a month damn why why I don't know RIS n it's worth it like if you do all the math it it was a Nob brainer yeah PA steal yeah it's just you want to
(3:21:12) play in the big league I mean the things these are mistakes like people make mistakes in the beginning lifetime is easy to sell but just cuz you don't think about ramifications but saying no to money is always what yeah is the biggest thing that makes you like that after I did that I had a massive jump cuz I could focus on school right um and you know people offer me like a lot of money too to go and like speak in an event probably nowhere near as much as hosi but 100 Grand in first class flights you
(3:21:43) just say no no no no no no no no no then you don't even bother saying no you just don't even imply yeah and that if you don't have the discipline to do that then you'll get pulled in a million directions also when you feel that sting of the 240 Grand you have to give back it'll help you say no to everything else cuz you're like I just refunded all these people I'm definitely not going to mess that up now like I just spent all this money to to get this attention back like why would I mess it up yeah it does something too for your like personal
(3:22:14) power or something when you're say no to money you don't need it yeah you're like you show you it does something to you it gives you some kind of power there's no better feeling than turning money down I mean making money is also pretty good but especially with clients you don't like anymore yeah right I would prefer to never see you again here's your money yeah really I got like a little taste of it cuz I was like I'm like the gatekeeper of the main closer so if I didn't think I could coach the guy I'd
(3:22:40) be like no but refunding is a whole different kind of thing right there yeah totally but you'll feel super super convicted and when you get on the phone with people you'll be like this is for agency owners and I'll help you scale or whatever you know whatever you're good at and if you're not then you're like that's why I have this thing I used to sell it I'll just give it to you man just follow the steps realistically though you're probably not going to do it so at least this way you can save your eight grand which I probably could have sold you it's big conviction that's sick
(3:23:10) sweet I like I have the same thought as him cuz I have a a program called start and then scale but uh sell to the scale people if you're better at them and you like them better and they're worth more 100% um I did have a question if it's better offline that's cool how do you for instance like somebody joins at 30 gets to 200 how do you Market that testimonial without uh a financial claim so how can I actively share these stories so getting into the like nitty-gritty with FTC is beyond my scope but for the most part it comes down to
(3:23:45) timelines that's the thing that like most of these platforms hate it's like X in y time but if you just say x I did I thought about this quite a bit Yeah and I've noticed that the only people that ever get in trouble they did way worse than make a claim right cuz I know the people that got into trouble and I know what was going on and I'll tell you how it happens every single time yeah it's they don't give refunds their disputes go up they piss so many people off that enough complain to the attorney general that eventually so many complaints go to the attorney general that they investigate
(3:24:25) them and then they find everything like the first thing to go is always you get kicked off of stripe yeah way that's slate the canary and the comine no one that doesn't get kicked off stripe never they never get in trouble even if they're making wild claims on ads but then when these people get panged they've got to like say oh everyone's doing it everyone's breaking the rules because they're trying to show like that they're not a criminal yeah we just cross we just stepped on this Little Rock the the refunds thing is Bar None for sure like I there was a guy I'm
(3:24:59) sure we both know him but who um who got dinged by the FTC ding's a very nice way of saying it um and I knew for like I I I was in a room like this cuz I was was in the back room and he was speaking at the same thing as me so like kind of funny um and he was like how do you guys like stop all these chargebacks and I was I was like what he was like yeah all these people like they're just these  are charging back and I was like well I mean I was like we don't have we just refund people if they ask for it he's like oh no we don't do
(3:25:28) refunds I was like I mean at all he's like we say no refunds I was like but you you you actually don't give any refunds he was like oh no I also I mean Sam said this I think like three ago and I just love this it's like you don't want to become someone's project like you don't want someone waking up thinking like how can I destroy shark today like how can I ruin this guy's life cuz cuz that six grand was the last six grand he had and it meant a hell of a lot more to him than it does to you so just give it it means more to him back just go get another customer bro it's
(3:25:58) always worth it you just give him the money back and they come back too like we noticed that they a lot of people come back when you didn't make a big deal about it or they'll buy something else yeah cuz you know what it's like your self you buy something you ask for refund you're like how's hard's this going to be and if it's easy you're like damn I'm I I like this company right yep so Planet Fitness believe it or not I obviously a fitness example CU I know a lot of the the big businesses there but Planet Fitness figured this out which is
(3:26:28) so you might not know this but a Planet Fitness to make money has to have 10,000 members like a brick and mo has to have 10,000 members to to make money and they still crank and they can do that in a market that only has 50,000 people in total which is insane to think about but they don't have like zero turn they have like five % monthly turn which is you're like wait a second how would you do that they cycle through the entire town over and over and over again and so what they figured out was rather than being like the dicks on the way out they said they
(3:26:58) call the friendly goodbye and so it's like they they're like oh you want to cancel no problem Steve no worries let us know when you're you know when you're want to come back like we we'll get you going like very friendly on the exit and so then Steve when he like gets the next gig or gets to the next job or feels fat again or whatever it is he signs back up because it was no big deal it's also crazy how many people don't actually use the membership they like pay for it and then oh 92% don't use the
(3:27:24) membership yeah it's the only it's the only way the business model works if they did they'd have to charge $200 a month it yeah wouldn't be room yeah I mean the reason micro Jims are priced that way is because people use the membership it's the same SC footage so like like the worst thing that and so like I mean I can talk about planus Fitness but I'll stop how would you choose between the friendly good and then the one that he mentioned where it's like if you leave you have to pay the entry fee to come back those are
(3:27:53) different one is a refund one is like someone trying to cancel which I see is separate things one's saying hey I want to cancel your service one is like I hate you please give me my money back it's not very friendly to say you can't come back ever again and it's also not really true I think cuz someone can just make another account how are you going to know well for high ticket I can imagine but like I just whatever I mean I've all the the people that I know who have done it and don't have good communities it does nothing if you have a great Community then it matters but then doesn't matter
(3:28:22) at all because the great Community is the reason that it happened so tldr I don't know if the tactic does anything remember I had this on a way smaller scale it was like my second clo like 10K I was all excited and he he's on the coaching call and he just wouldn't knock on doors he said he tried it for 30 minutes CU one thing he teach is door to door marketing to book jobs so I was really hesitant on what to do and I he just bring down the energy so I let him out of the group I refunded him and then I posted in my free Facebook group hey
(3:28:46) had a client wasn't really ready to knock on doors you know if any of you guys are are actually willing to do this we have a spot open and it brought my ideal clients actually B close four off. post you're like in every week you're like I had I had a spot open up because yeah no mean being telling the truth yeah I got I got one question about like um I've heard you guys talk about like offboarding interviews or like you know like taking you know somebody wants to you know wants to cancel their membership or wants to ref refund you're like yeah for sure just do
(3:29:14) an interview right is there any way we could maybe get that going on in school like whenever somebody churns like obviously like it's hard to get them on the phone right you know at that point um but I'd love to like figure out maybe that at some point like oh yeah you want to cancel cool press this button schedule an appointment after we talk I think they have to be able to cancel easily but I think yeah they have to be able to cancel easily but I think you could encourage them to take a call after the cancellation try and resell them could we do a zapier integration for the cancellation this is we were
(3:29:43) just thinking an auto an auto DM would probably be the be Auto DM yeah I've noticed uh the zapier integration the zapier integration feature on School Is Amazing by the way but um we started doing this in one of our communities where people join and we immediately send them like a welcome call and then we just like immediately upsell them it does really well are the new customers Z yeah oh yeah that crushes just for everybody by the way if you if you let people come in and just give them an onboarding call it's I mean think about
(3:30:11) what an onboarding call really is it's like what are your goals what have you struggled with where are you at currently what do you like why haven't you succeeded so far oh I think we might have some things for you it's just like it just lends itself naturally to a sales call and you can do in autod DM as well if you have a strong referral offer can put it into autod DM when they join and like who else do you know blah blah blah you'll get this if you refer somebody so that you know you set it up once and you can have literally like extra 10% for free if you have a strong
(3:30:39) referral offer and once they affiliate things it'll be even more just going back on that single stream or yeah um what you're good at one thing we have is we have that physical Academy so um what I was one of my questions earlier was about how would you integrate School platform into the physical you know what just random thoughts um but then because I think our the school academy has done by far you know mostly yeah better than physical um what are your thoughts on integrating ditching I don't I mean I
(3:31:23) think the in-person members joining I mean you could if you want to give a a a gift to the in-person members you could actually I don't know if they can have a different membership so no um they probably just join like anybody else would and it would just be a benefit to them to because they know you in person is the digital already making more money yeah the the P academ do kind of like how we're doing this and school HQ so we've got homos HQ we've got school HQ for the power users in the online world we bring it offline and we let them come in like this and that can
(3:31:57) produce content back for the like online so you use it as a a reward yeah yeah you can either like you can charge for it or you can use it as a reward for like what we do here right we're not charge for it but it's it's a reward but you Absolut like as a side note if you wanted to make even more like if you wanted the inperson to generate more money and leveraged kind of like both together give them an offer to have a weekend with you I mean like when I had the you have it's not it's martial arts right yeah so I would do like weekend workshops where I'd be like we're going to do a deadlift um you know prr we're
(3:32:29) going to do the big three lifts for powerlifting this weekend so anybody wants to come to that cool I do like big booty boot camp for girls and they always want I teach them like eight different like moves for butt stuff because they always want to noteb stuff I would do um I would basically just bring in Specialists for stuff and then I would either and I would just Market CR to my community and say that they could pay you know a grand or two grand or something for the for the weekend I mean you'll know the price point better than me but Pro I mean you could
(3:32:55) probably get away with between $300 and $2,000 in terms of two days um for them to to come in and you spend two days with them and you get a ton of footage you literally make money for it you can get ads for your local gym you can get ads for online all from that one event I actually think it's a huge advantage that you have the inperson component because you can do stuff that no one else can do level seven in school Community is visit School HQ the the prize like once you get to level seven in school Community you get to visit School HQ that's cool and then in the games it's
(3:33:30) get in the top 10 and you get to come to a MOS HQ it's the best prize on both leaderboards it it creates this cuz in the digital world everything seems kind of fake so if there's some HQ that people get to visit and you start to see photos of this play it gives people like something they can visualize like I can eventually go there right and it works really well and you can use it in your marketing and and all of this I can guarantee you that if you make a post in your community saying that you're doing a workshop that you're limiting to 30 people how many people do you have in your community free ones
(3:34:07) well the paid one paid one 23 yeah so um I mean you could do it on the free one if you wanted to cuz then you could just sell them at the event if you felt like it but but I think it makes more sense to do it to the paid one and just do a higher ticket thing from the paid and um so if you have 23 that's perfect so that'll probably you'll probably get like 30ish people who'd be willing to do it and so do you 30 you know between 300 maybe I mean it's meditation like 300 to a grand probably feels about right you can pick the price you can start low on the first
(3:34:36) one and move it up if you want to if it's like people are like that was amazing blah blah blah blah blah um it's like you can just do that like once a quarter so every 12 weeks or so and just like that you can pop an extra like 80 or 100 Grand a year in like and but like you're not just doing it for money you get all the other stuff

Transcript:
(00:00) so i've been looking to having this conversation for a couple months and it was just sitting on the schedule and i kept looking forward to it and i found myself you know a couple minutes into the phone call and i said hey just out of curiosity how much are your companies doing a year in revenue right now he said well i think we're doing over a billion dollars a year now and that's when i was like man i have a lot to learn from this guy so hi my name is alex romosi i'm the owner of and ceo of allen gym launch prestige
(00:30) labs and five other portfolio companies you know there's a lot of people out there who struggle to make money and are struggling to you know grow their net worth and i made this channel to make sure that you are not one of them what i want to share with you is some of the kind of excerpts or the private conversations that i had with a man doing a billion dollars here in revenue that's privately held so his company or companies are privately held he owns um 50 of them and uh he's probably in his mid 70s for the security
(00:55) of that individual i'm not going to reveal his identity but what i will do is give you all the lessons that i wrote down as a result of this conversation all right the first thing that i think before i even get into it that i'm going to get asked from this video is like well how do you get access to guys like that and further along this video i'll explain how he went from 100 million dollars to a billion dollars a year in revenue uh his process around that i also talked about how he organized his personnel and
(01:20) did his incentive programs uh where he was allocating his capital um that he felt like he got the best returns from so jam-packed lots of good stuff for you from a man who has done it and lived it and so the first one is about how do you get access to something like this and so one of the things that i think i hear on like the entrepreneur channels and things that i cruise around and snoop around down is i hear these big mass market people say like just go buy a millionaire a lunch or just say you'll go work with a millionaire for free um i
(01:50) don't think that's realistic because you have nothing to offer that person and so i think the first step is self-awareness of understanding that like you only have x amount of value now your intention should be to increase that value you have in the achievements that you have so that you can gain access to higher level people so now i've gotten to the point of my career where you know he knows that we're doing just under 100 million a year and so i had real questions that i wanted to ask him and the person who made the
(02:15) introduction was like hey this guy's legit you know he he loves all your all your content and all your books and things like that could you would you know would you mind helping him out or taking a call and so he agreed which was crazy for me and i was really really thrilled about it but you know if doesn't matter where you're at you can probably just add you know a zero or multiply whatever you're doing by five and that's probably around where somebody where your cutoff might be so if you're making a hundred thousand
(02:39) dollars a year then you know gaining access to making a million dollars a year is probably around where the cutoff is going to be for what your you know achievements will give you access to and that's kind of the the reason that i think a lot of these coaching programs and masterminds and things like that exist is because people can't gain access to that level of person uh without some sort of you know a prior achievement and if you haven't achieved it then you have to compensate that that person with money in some way right we
(03:02) got on the phone call and this was layla and i and playlist my wife she runs these companies with me she's co-ceo she actually just started a youtube channel if you want to check that out but the the first thing that i asked him was i said hey ben uh i had been stuck at you know mid 30 million dollars a year between 30 and 40 for three years and you know i just from listening to some of the stuff that you had really understood the breakthrough of how to get to 100 and right now we're we're pacing probably about 85 but i think
(03:27) that that breakthrough um was was key which was understanding to focus on people now you might be like well duh i have heard that everywhere alex why are you so dumb great question i think that what i did not understand was that as the entrepreneur we believe that we are source of everything and at a certain point there's only so much influence that you can have and maybe i'm just not influential enough that's that's possible right but your ability to influence people one level two level three level four levels of management below where you're
(03:58) at you know dilutes over time like you are potent but you become disseminated as levels of manage and get introduced which is natural when you whenever you grow an organization right the first thing that he said that i thought was really powerful was understanding what levels of talent exist and so he said there's really just stars and superstars and one of the things that he said completely shifted my perspective about how to view those things and i'll tell you what that was in a second but the key point that he said is that every
(04:26) business that is going to grow and be self-sustaining must have three superstars and i was like huh that's really interesting and where he divided the superstars out was actually exactly where i would have divided them out as well which was you need to have somebody who's in charge of acquisition you know have someone who's in charge of delivery and someone who's in charge of operations and shared shared services right that means one person gets new clients one person delivers on promises and the third person keeps the first two
(04:52) out of jail by making sure that bills are paid and payroll happens and legal and i.t and all the lovely things that come with running a business that no one ever thinks about he was like if you have three superstars then that business can grow on its own the second thing um was layering on the incentive packages appropriately and this is something that you know charlie munger warren buffett you know and this guy i feel like i see this common theme around the guys who make the most money in the world is that they are not afraid
(05:19) to give up a little bit of the pie to make more people wealthy so that the pie itself can grow it's easy to say it's hard to do and i think one of the biggest mistakes that i made for the vast majority of my early business career was not understanding how to align incentives and you know i think charlie munger says like show me the incentives and i'll show you the outcomes and so when i started out in my career i thought that i just had to partner with everyone and that wasn't the right call for me at the time
(05:43) because i ended up partnering with people who had the same skill sets as me because they seemed cool and we liked the same things but the reality is that i should have been partnering with people if i was going to partner with people who had different skill sets so i might have been the acquisition guy because that's probably i would say my my skill set but i should have partnered with somebody who was really good at delivery service product etc and had somebody who really owned the operational you know portion of the
(06:07) business and so that's what i should have thought of now mind you i had a mentor early on in that time in my life who said listen you might need an accountant it doesn't mean that you have to give them equity in your company right you just pay them as a vendor and that was again something that i did not understand when i was earlier on and so just if you're starting out your career you know you don't need to give away equity in your company to get things done you can just pay for them and that's okay in fact it's encouraged
(06:30) because the most expensive equity you typically give away is in the beginning and so being mindful of that and leveling up your skill sets so that you don't have to i think a lot of times can yield disproportionate returns and in the companies that i have grown to you know eight figures multiple figures and now knocking on nine have come from companies that i that i own right and have very small percentage of equity that i allocate to people who are star performers which leads me to one of the things that he talked about
(06:56) that i referenced earlier which is understanding the difference between superstars and stars and so um he said something that really stuck with me um and after this i'll tell you what he said about how he allocates his money and whatnot because i think that was really cool but how he identifies superstars he said listen you we all want superstars right and we know him when we see him but what i have noticed is that i've never not thought someone was a superstar and then later realized they were he said now i've had people who
(07:26) came in and i thought they were superstars and then they they it turned out they weren't superstars but i've never had the reverse happen where someone comes in i don't think they're a star or a superstar and then they become one and so i took that as a key learning for myself which is once we're bringing in high level talent we're bringing in leaders we're bringing in drivers that if we don't immediately think that they're a superstar then it means that they're probably not a fit for that role and that can be hard because one of the
(07:50) biggest things that gets in the way of excellent is good enough i can tell you as somebody who's hired so many good enough people and i think later now um hired true superstars the difference is is is uncanny it's night and day that they're able to solve problems bring solutions to the table and implement them without your input oftentimes what you know you have to end up doing which is why the gap between 30 to 100 million is about giving up the next level of control which is kind of the control around high level decisions right you have to
(08:22) give people the autonomy and the power because a superstar wants that kind of power right they want that kind of authority they want that responsibility and they want they want the responsibility because they want the credit for the outcome right and so this was something that took me a long time to understand and the way that he incentivized those people that he shared with me and i will share with you right now so you guys don't have to get a billion dollar a year entrepreneur on the phone is he said he would set up
(08:45) profit shares for those ceos and he only did it for the ceos of his companies he had so many beliefs i'll share one of them with you right now he said i don't believe that businesses should make a profit and so this man is clearly a philosopher at this point in his career just fyi the guys mid 70s peaceful as can be salt of the earth and i was like i don't even know what that means he said i said can you clarify that he said i believe that profits are unnatural he said i don't think that they're naturally occurring i
(09:10) think that a business if left on its you know lift to its own devices will pretty much break even and i thought about that and i thought and i thought more and i thought more about it i was like i guess that's true he's like it's unnatural to create profits and it takes willpower to create profits because you have to create outsized returns compared to the marketplace because everyone else most of the time is the same resources as you do or you know they have the same 24 hours they've many times the same access to skill and talent that you do
(09:37) and so if you have the same access skill and talent you know when you have the same resources or similar resources then then how is it that you're going to out-compete them it takes something unnatural it takes something above and beyond and so for him he believed that creating profits is a natural and is the sole responsibility of the ceo which i thought was interesting i'm not sorry 100 agree it might not i just might not be at that level yet i don't know um but he said he shared uh five percent of profits with those uh entrepreneurs and
(10:01) he also gave them the opportunity to buy in truly buy-in not just like giving equity but buy in bigger and bigger chunks of the company he said i think one of his biggest companies that he has the ceo owns like 30 something percent of that company now and started at five or ten and so the reason i'm sharing this is that like at a certain point the company becomes a conglomeration of companies of of of drivers who are driving growth across channels right across individual profit centers that all roll into one larger conglomerate
(10:31) and so just just fundamentally shifting my understanding of like what business will become instead of like oh i'm going to sell you know a hundred doors now i'm gonna sell a thousand dollars and i'm gonna sell ten thousand dollars right and i say door it could be pens or ball caps or it doesn't really matter but the point is that we're selling a widget of some sort right instead it's it's you might have a a business that sells a hundred you know doorknobs and a hundred doors and a hundred door frames and door
(10:54) insurance and all that type of stuff around and each one of those things becomes a profit center for the overarching conglomerate and has a driver who has specialization within that industry and has done it before and so i think when he shared this to me like it reinforced one of my core beliefs which is advanced people are advanced because they never don't do the basics like so many people you know myself included i would see people on stage and they would say what they were doing and i was like there's no way it's that simple but
(11:21) i think the reality is it is that simple it's just not easy finding good people is hard it's the number one issue all businesses have it's like because if fundamentally every single person who's listening to this right now is three amazing hires away from all the growth you've ever wanted like think about that like we're all three hours away from all the growth we've ever wanted and our time back and i feel like i'm just beginning to really experience this as an entrepreneur and i'll tell you it's trippy it's weird not being needed
(11:46) and i would encourage it and i think that there were multiple times throughout my career where i thought that i was not needed and i stepped away and then things crashed and then i had to jump back in and so maybe you've had that experience too but when that happens sure there's process issues etc but most times it's because there's a lack of talent and i'll share one conclusion that i made from this thing and i'll tell you what his investment advice was but one of the conclusions that i have is that the size
(12:11) of the corporation is directly proportional to the amount of superstars that are present and so when you think i'm like superstars i'm not talking stars stars are great you need a players right but who are who are the people who have that x factor that it fact that something different that can really drive right and um as a company gets bigger he even shared this too he said you know you need fewer drivers and you need superstar tenders you need people who are not hunters but but farmers who can just tend to the company overall and
(12:40) make the incremental improvements because a lot of times companies grow in a stepwise fashion so it's huge growth plateau huge growth plateau huge growth plateau and then we as entrepreneurs think we're you know breaking something when in reality that's just oftentimes is how growth occurs because there are bottlenecks there are constraints that are on the business and then you de-bottleneck them and then you experience the next level of growth and usually you de-bottleneck them with a person who has experience or who has
(13:02) talent in that specific area who can solve the problem for you and has done it before as promised what i'm going to do is i'm going to wrap this puppy up with um his advice on investing and so he said so i'm just giving you straight from the horse's mouth this is what he told me so he said you know we've done really well in real estate we have a couple hundred million dollars in real estate and we've done it all through the company and so he and his partner share share the equity in the deals that they do and they buy all multi-family real
(13:29) estate so big buildings with lots of apartments he said when i buy he said i'm more concerned on return of capital than return on capital so i'll say that again he said i'm more concerned when i invest with return of capital than return on capital and i thought that was it just consistently reinforces what i keep finding with the people who are worth so much more who are worth 500 million worth of billion dollars is that the high risk stuff everybody who's poor wants to buy the lottery ticket but everyone who's rich
(14:00) just wants to own the lottery game and make 10 a year on it right and so he said that for him he just wants to invest in things because he realized that he's like no matter what he's like the tenants are paying for the mortgage for me he said sure you know some of them we did better some of them did worse he's like but overall as long as i thought all the fundamentals were sound um then i was going to just have a great store for my wealth and he's like and sure we lucked out a few times uh but for me this is him
(14:28) saying this he's like but for me that has been a really uh great vehicle and i was like okay well do you have any rules of thumb you know just off the top of mind of of uh of how you pick those spots and he says you know in general i never i never passed a a cap rate of eight he said so if it was below eight i wouldn't do it um and that's that's how he picked his deals and i thought that was really interesting and so you know laila and i have looked at that in terms of rules of thumb for the purchases that we're looking at and what not he would
(14:54) rather have slightly higher value buildings that he thought there was less risk in that he felt more guaranteed that his capital would come back to him than trying to you know maximize his internal rate of return and i think to a certain degree that goes with the leverage that he might employ like how much debt is he gonna take on to buy this facility because if you get more debt then you're gonna get better returns but you also increase your risk and so um coming from a man who uh obviously doesn't need anything else in
(15:18) life um i thought that was also valuable because i think as you as you grow as an entrepreneur it becomes so much more about downside mitigation because you know adding you know doubling your net worth doesn't really change anything about your life but cutting your net worth in half does and so it's really about like what are we what problem are we solving what are we trying to accomplish here and making sure that the way that we make decisions is aligned with that these were some of the notes that i had let me make sure oh and i'll
(15:40) tell you the one last thing they told me i said all right so we followed your advice of getting you know from 30 million to 100 million this is this is really good you're going to want to listen to this one um i said okay well then how do you did you get from 100 million to a billion and this is stuff that you will never find anywhere all right you'll not find this anywhere written down because there are so few billionaires and there's so few people who are doing a billion dollars here in revenue who can actually share this with
(16:03) with truth and his answer will crack you up or at least it cracked me up and so he said he said well i'll be honest with you man he said you know when we were we did a hundred million a year for for four or five years and he said and honestly we got so burnt out because we kept wanting to go you know wanting to grow we just couldn't grow it anymore so we couldn't get past 100 million he said so we pretty much just gave up and we we took the company we broke it into 100 little pieces and we gave um you know profit sharing and
(16:31) small equity pieces phantom equity to our our superstars and our drivers and he said me and my partner pretty much kind of checked out he said and here's what's crazy five years later we were at 500 million and five years after that he said we were at a billion and i was like wow and i was like so so i mean what would you what would you say how like so how do you how do you go and he was like i think the way you get to a billion is not trying to get to a billion and i was like man like that's like it was it was that i
(17:00) felt that i was like really he said i think it was luck he's like i think there was a lot of things that happened and that that you know things were aligned a it showed the humility that the man had but also that you know he said there was a couple key decisions that were super important uh for our development within those companies um and he said and i oppose them but it was it was decisions that were made by the leaders of the company and they did it anyways he's like and they were right i was wrong and so i think it just underlined
(17:26) a huge humility but the reality that for most of us entrepreneurs like we don't have all the answers like we have a lot of answers but we don't have them all and i think that seeing how he did that going from 100 million to a billion dollars a year and that he was like it's luck and it was basically incentivizing a lot of people and he was growing the pie it was making other people wealthy and allowing you to participate in their creation of their own wealth i think that makes a lot of sense because the drive
(17:50) i will say personally as an entrepreneur to make more money after a certain point at least for me in my current chapter has has diminished significantly and my desire has shifted far more to making things like this and helping other people out because i think i think the world needs it so anywho i think that the reason that his company was able to grow and this is just from my perspective is that all these other people were getting their kind of first nut for lack of a better term and he was able to capitalize on them getting their
(18:20) you know grow driving so hard uh because he was able to give them that incentive uh to do so and so hearing him say that was really cool for me um and i think that for me as an entrepreneur hearing that it was much more like well the way to go forward is really finding the superstars putting them in the right places giving them incentive not being greedy and being humble enough to to accept that we don't have all the answers and so anyways i hope this private conversation with a billion dollar year revenue uh this was revenue right what cash
(18:50) collected uh per year uh entrepreneur had to share about his investments about how he saw business in general about how he thought profits were unnatural i hope you found value in this because i um i definitely did and i hope you did the same so if you like this hit subscribe and i'll see you next vid bye

17 Life-Changing Conversations I Wish I Had Earlier - YouTube
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULGT0Qpglek

Transcript:
(00:00) these are 17 conversations maybe millions in my 20s number one I was going back and forth between quitting my job and starting a gym or starting my entrepreneurial Journey another early Mentor he sat me down and said man I've been listening to you waffle for months now he said at some point you're not going to know anymore you just have to jump he said it in a way that made me feel like a pansy I realized I didn't need more information I'd already done all of the research I just needed to decide the definition of decision comes
(00:24) from the Latin decadari which basically means to cut off or kill off question was which future was I deciding to kill off was it the future that I was in currently that I didn't like anymore or was it the future that I had the potential to accomplish the dreams that I had by not deciding I was actively killing off the future that had my dreams and then I needed to choose which one I wanted to kill number two very beginning of entrepreneurial journey I didn't know how to sell anything man a mentor just said do you want to know the
(00:46) secret to sales I leaned in I was like yes please I like had my notepad out and said the secret to sales is making an offer so good people feel stupid saying no and that obviously became the subtitle of my 100 million dollar offers book I kept thinking that I had to learn how to like try and manipulate going through sales scripts and building Rapport and sure some of those skills are useful to have when it's so much easier to just find things that people really want Chick-fil-A doesn't need to sell you on chicken sandwiches they just
(01:08) have amazing chicken sandwiches and people go buy them and that forever changed how I created new products created new Services was I started with how do I get the most people to say yes and then work backwards number three my next mentors was a 10 billion dollar Co he always said you got to go slow to go fast he kept repeating it to me over and over and over again you only unlock the compounding which later on grows significantly faster than the erratic activity of small thing here small thing here new thing here new thing here then
(01:32) just doing the same thing for an extended period of time and so what feels slow in the micro looks fast in the macro when you look at the trajectory over a long period of time but what looks really fast in the micro is usually really slow in the macro because people can never get that compounding start harnessing because they're always starting back over at Ground Zero whenever you change something the one cost is guaranteed is that change will have to get paid for and what isn't guaranteed is that it's going to work you know you have this
(01:54) fixed cost which is how you should see it is that whenever you change something you have to pay a price number four the next lesson I learned was in level of effort one of my really mentors who told me about flyers I thought I needed to go put a lot of Flyers out to get business put out 300 Flyers so I called the mentor back up and I was like hey this didn't work and he said you know what was your test size what do you mean by test side and I just put out 300 total you just laughed 300.
(02:12) you're not gonna know anything with 300 he's like we test with 5 000 and then we do 5000 a day after that five thousand a day 150 000 Flyers a month I might have been doing the right thing all along but I was just doing far too little of it and at that point I decided that whenever someone gave me advice I wouldn't let the volume of activity to be the reason it failed but I just hadn't done enough of them or I hadn't done them long enough I see so many smaller younger entrepreneurs who do something for Too Short too little time not enough volume that they might
(02:34) have been doing the right thing they just didn't wait long enough or they didn't do enough of it number five I was at actually a mastermind and I saw a guy get up and he seemed so disorganized and he said yeah you know we're making three or four hundred thousand dollars a month it's like we've been stuck here for a few years Layla and I were actually together at this point we both looked at each other and we're like if this guy can do it we can do it it was one of those moments that beliefs are broken because what you find out is that they
(02:56) are made of the same thing as you rather than write off this guy's such an idiot despite bite him being an idiot he's still more successful than me imagine if I used my work ethic and my intelligence and when I shifted my perspective from that way I was able to start using other people's successes to fuel me rather than to make me feel bad it switched from wanting to cast stones at people to being inspired by them and thinking if they can do it so can I within six months of seeing that conversation happen we were already doing a million a
(03:20) month number six at a different event I went up and I spoke and I told my whole plans if I wanted to build this national gym chain be America's next gym the guy who ran the Mastermind said you know what Alex I don't think you should do that at all I was crushed and he said I think you have a level 10 skill set and a level two opportunity one of those simultaneously incredibly encouraging things and Incredibly heartbreaking things so it's a very like emotional moment for me he was both encouraging me to say that I could have been doing more
(03:42) and this person from the outside put a bar up that was significantly higher than what I was shooting for and that stretched my Horizon for what I was capable of and I think getting around people who can do that for you is one of the most valuable things you could possibly have in your life what he didn't say was a level two opportunity as he was defining it an opportunity that has low leverage there wasn't a very good compounding vehicle for Capital the fact that I was successful in what most consider a shitty
(04:04) opportunity he saw as the skill sets that would create a much bigger win later if you are in a lower level opportunity I wouldn't say be upset about it I would say you're learning with extra resistance against you you're getting stronger now and then when you go onto the moon where gravity is lighter you just knock it out of the park number seven it was a private event it was ten people everyone was doing eight figures or more a year and I got invited a guy came up to me and this guy had done 27 million dollars in a single
(04:26) bag holy this guy's made more in a day than I've been my entire life he said fat pitches in life don't come very often when it gets easy is when you need to go hard otherwise there's someone who's 10 times bigger than you who's going to take everything you have and not even think twice about it that was literally fueled by that one conversation if you're like wait how are you doing three or four hundred thousand a month taking over 300 I had like no employees and I was making it all myself you do have one of those opportunities
(04:46) that comes up in your life when things start working really well that's when a lot of people ease off the gas that's when they go easy when it gets easy is when you go hard because you don't have that many fat pitches in a lifetime you might get two or three and you just gotta crack the out of it when it comes and expect that you're going to sacrifice some short term for some long term later number eight the same event a different guy came up to me he said you're scared well you're like doubling every month with this current thing like
(05:09) why do you want to start a supplement business what if you just spent three times as much on marketing and didn't start us up on the business I didn't start the supplement business I actually delayed it for 18 months in the next three months we tripled the ad spend and went from 400 to 780 780 to a million from a million to 2 million just the next six months because of that piece of advice and I think the underlying part of that advice is that when something is going well oftentimes entrepreneurs think great I won how can I get another
(05:33) win but the real win is just doing 10 times more of that thing the hardest part is getting product Market fit it's getting people to want to buy The Thing Once you have that you don't need to innovate that anymore all your innovation has to go through how can we do more volume number nine the next lesson was from a guy who had a big e-commerce brand so he was doing like 30 million a year at the time and I was like oh my God this guy is God he gave this huge presentation that was like two hours long he said so pick a percentage
(05:56) whatever it is 10 20 of your marketing spend and put that towards new ideas expect to lose it but when you're losing it you're gaining the lesson you're gaining the experience and what happens is he's like you know four out of five times my crazy ideas fail he's like but one out of five they crush and become the Leading Edge Innovation that pushes us to the next level I immediately took a number and I wrote down what my new learning budget was going to be and it gave me permission to spend money without a return immediately you think
(06:19) big picture he just extended my time Horizon for a return and so rather than saying I have to make my money back immediately within 30 days of me spending this I said if I extend my Horizon over my lifetime if I spend this money I will learn and be better and I will learn faster than somebody who doesn't I just gave myself a budget to say it is acceptable to lose this and then I committed to that and that was a huge pivot point for how we were able to scale and try new things and I looked forward to spending on my learning
(06:43) budget every month and it just gave me permission to be creative knowing that it would be okay to fail number 10. the next one I got from a pastor between Layla and I he gave us a single piece of marriage advice that we have taken today we have used countless times in our lives both in our marriage personally and professionally in the business he said if you don't agree don't move forward it was such a simple piece of advice because we have always made our decisions together and if we don't agree we slow down a lot of times we impose
(07:08) this false sense of urgency on ourselves when there's almost nothing that is urgent like unless you're going to die which is the only real urgency then a lot of times taking an extra second to think okay is there something we're missing is there a frame that we're not seeing if we don't agree first question we always ask is what information are you using oftentimes one of us will have data that the other person doesn't because we have the same values and same Mission we do ultimately come to the same decisions that has saved me so many
(07:30) mistakes number 11. I went to a big half a billion dollar Mastermind so there was like 10 of us there and the total sales of everyone in the room is about half a billion dollars but I was still among the smaller ones I think we were doing 30 or 40 million dollars a year at the time and plenty of guys there we're at 100 you know 200 Etc what do they have are they smarter are they working hard are they sacrificing more like they had a bigger total addressable Market they had a bigger Tam they were going after
(07:51) just a much wider audience so you start small so the riches are in the niches but at a certain point you do need to open up the aperture so like Facebook started with you know college right that the niche and then slowly spin it over time I had to open up my eyes and say you know what maybe I can go broader in some way number 12.
(08:07) this was one of the first billionaires that I ever met I'd been stuck at 30 to 40 million for like three years there was a lot of learning that I was trying to do in this period to break through that wall I was telling him all these things that I was doing to try and grow my business and he just laughed he said it's not about you it's about everybody else and what he meant by that wasn't like me versus customers or anything like that he was like all you've been telling me is what you're going to do you need to have a stable of
(08:27) stallions you need to give people a slice of the pie and let them get rich too and up to that point I had hoarded everything I was like you know what got me from a 100 million dollar Top Line to 500 million dollar Top Line doing less and getting really smart people to help me out and giving them a Big Slice it's about Talent it's about people you have to get other people who can make decisions on your behalf and you feel not only that they were as good as your decisions but even better because the beginning your jack of all trades master
(08:51) of none but you need to have Mastery in every Department of the business in order for it to scale and you can either see that as I have to learn everything or the faster way which is I can go buy it through through other people who've already given 10 years if I can get 10 people who've all spent 20 years in their respective departments I basically have 200 years of experience and if every person in the organization has learned everything from you then it's only one brain and one lifetime that is the limit of the organization that thing
(09:16) is what got us past the 30 to 40 million that was a huge breakthrough for me number 13. the next conversation I had was really the one that pushed me over the edge I have a famous friend I was at his house and we were sitting at the kitchen table and I said don't you get tired of all these weirdos like messaging you stuff and like sending you threats and like three people a week stopping by your house like trying to climb your fence like it's not like not fun he said if that's the price I have to pay to make the impact I want to have
(09:38) then I would pay it every day of the week for whatever reason it just like stabbed me in the heart and it made me feel like if I want to spread a message if I want to help more people that there's a cost to it having now been a little bit the other side and having more recognition and whatnot is that Fame has pros and cons there are cons but I believe that there are more Pros than cons are there things that are inconvenient now absolutely you get stopped every time you go to dinner like you get distracted it's harder to be
(10:00) like private public if you have a bad day you can't do it because someone says hi and it's the one time they're going to see you there are things that are gone but the pros outweigh the cons you get amazing people who will come and want to work with you you get amazing teammates who otherwise would never know you exist who also have the same Mission have the same values and it creates significantly more alignment and real world value in terms of economic value how much money you make by having people inbound coming towards you I used to
(10:22) talk about people make guns I was like you know do cold Outreach and run ads like don't talk to me but now having been on the other side of it I can tell you that it was mistake number 14 big influencer I said hey you're way further ahead of me like how do I just shortcut this thing and so he said hey start making content on every platform so I did that and then I came back six months later and I said hey look we went from zero to you know 200 000 people in our audience in six months and you noted the progress but I was like what's your
(10:43) blueprint what's the what's the model give me the flow chart he said dude we don't have a flow chart anybody's trying to tell you that is trying to sell you a system you just need to do so much more volume than you currently are he said just pull up your Instagram and pull up my Instagram so I pulled it up pulled it up he had posted five times I had posted once he's like pull up your LinkedIn pull up my LinkedIn get posted 7 in times I'd posted once platform by platform you get pulling one up and he was embarrassing me with the amount of
(11:05) content he was putting out compared to me so in the next six months I put 10 times the content out and we grew 10 times faster the interesting lesson I learned from this is that there are principles that are ubiquitous the more work you do the more you get so the boring work applies to everything in business whether it's relationships whether it's cold calling whether it's making content the more you do the more you get number 15.
(11:25) the next one is about investing I was actually a pretty big pansy when it came to investing and this was the Breakthrough I had I had all this money and people were like I've got this real estate deal I've got this crypto thing when you have lots of money deal flow is not a problem what I didn't have was a set of rules or parameters and you have to make those otherwise you get too much decision fatigue you waste too much time doing diligence on deals reading having multiple phone calls having lawyers come in and then deciding not to do it this one conversation I had
(11:47) changed my life he was telling somebody who had a lot of real estate experience if you were to put a circle on this table what percentage of your brain knows real estate he was like I guess 85 okay what percentage of your brain knows stocks and stuff he's like 10 or 15 he's like that is your new capital allocation parameter 85 of your net worth should be in real estate 15 should be in stocks and it was so simple for me I know business and so what do I invest in now only businesses only risky if you don't know what you're doing I can write a
(12:14) five or ten million dollar check and be fine if I know if it's a business because I understand I know what pitfalls are going to come up like I get it sticking with that just forever made my life simpler because now when deals come to us I'm like that's just not in my wheel and I can just immediately say that so the amount of time and effort and lawyer calls and conversations that that saved me has paid so many dividends and now are investing doing significantly better because it's what I know and I feel comfortable with it and
(12:35) I can move way faster number 16. leverage behind a product Naval has said you only sell because you know how to Market you only Market because you know how to build a product an exceptional product is a quadratic relationship with your audience good marketing or good sales is a linear relationship if you make an exceptional product something that's so unbelievable that people cannot help themselves but tell other people about it one person buys the product and they sell two two tell four four Tel eight how do I do that you work
(12:58) on it and you keep work on it and you don't make new products until the first one's right and if you're like that might take years that's why good takes time 100 million offers that book continues to sell more copies every month with zero advertising dollars actually less work in the long run to build a better thing than it is to build a shitty thing and then have to spend the rest of your time marketing and selling it you want to have leverage in every aspect of your business and the product is the strongest one number 17.
(13:23) the last one I learned from Uncle Warren the power of brand brand was always this amorphous thing that I thought was complete BS I was like you can't quantify blah blah blah but the thing and quantify brand and that is what I learned from Uncle Warren he said the amount that you can charge above the commoditized version of your product the Delta there is the power of brand if you have a t-shirt that can sell for twenty dollars normally and can sell for a hundred dollars with your brand on it all of that pricing power goes to bottom
(13:45) line which is why Warren Buffett invests in Brands it's one of the strongest ways to retain pricing power the brand itself becomes a huge compounding vehicle because the audience and the awareness around the brand compounds

Transcript:
(00:00) mossy nation the other day i was approached by service-based brick and mortar business and they have a very profitable single location model and they wanted to figure out a way or what path was going to be the best vehicle for them to make the most money and so we had a really good conversation about this and they broke down the different paths they could take um and for them it was really valuable and they were very happy about it and so what i wanted to do was break down this exact same process for you so if you have a service-based business
(00:26) or something where you have labor of some sort that you rent out at a profit to other people to provide value then this video is for you and if you want to figure out a way to package those services in a way that is that is uh that has a lot of enterprise value that has a lot of cash flow while you're growing then this video is for you okay so i'm gonna break down the only four ways that i know of that you can package your service and the labor and knowledge that you have into a profitable business now some of these
(00:55) have pros in terms they provide more cash flow have higher margin or lower operational drag others provide more enterprise value but a little bit more difficult to create so i'm going to show you the pros and cons of each of them i have businesses i own businesses that have three in three of these four categories right so i feel like i can speak to these with a decent amount of knowledge and not with a bias towards one or the other all right so the first is a privately held chain all right so i'll put private chain everyone uh you
(01:20) know keep your pg hats on so a private chain is basically like you have one location and then you open a second and a third and the specific business i was talking to was a person who had a salon concept so they did a concept around hair uh and he was doing very well and they were like man you know we're thinking about opening more locations and we want to figure out the best way to do this or ultimately make money with this model all right so the first is is just you open another location then another location another location you
(01:43) return you return retain all the ownership rights you take all the risk you front all the capital you hire all the labor you control the brand um but you own everything end to end all right so this is a privately held chain all right this is the first of the four vehicles that you can use to ultimately build your wealth all right at the end i'll show you the pros and cons of each of them the second some of you may be familiar with hopefully you've definitely frequented one of these businesses as a franchise so subway
(02:07) mcdonald's you know jiffy lube you know all of these are franchises right they are they are a single model that has been franchised out people buy in investors typically so this is a different person here an investor who's outside who just wants to find a good return of capital will buy into a franchise model and typically because franchises have far lower uh failure rates than starting your own business and so that's the advantage of this is that in theory there's lower risk now i could talk about the actuality behind that which is very
(02:35) different i could also tell you about the tons and tons and tons of franchises don't actually make money i think it's like 90 or 95 of franchises never get past 100 locations which candidly if you're doing a franchise model you need to get past 100 to make any real money and you were like how is that even possible i'll break it down in a second all right so that is the second vehicle that you can use in a service-based business to make a fortune now number three number three is a licensing model and i'll tell you some of the pros of
(03:00) this one a licensing model you might not be as familiar with the businesses that use licensing because depending on how they structure the license to you have to differentiate from what a franchise is a franchise has three components you have name business systems and fee all right so if you have all three of those things and people are using your brand your business systems and your fee then you are a franchise and if you're operating as a license and you're using those three components then you are an illegal
(03:24) franchise all right then you can get tat you can get fined and you can shut down and all that kind of stuff it's paying the butt i'll talk about the pros and cons of licensing in a second but that is the third vehicle all right so in a licensing vehicle you're typically gonna have two of those three things so you could have for example crossfit is a licensing right they give you the name and they have a fee but they don't have business systems a different version would be let's say you had a model that worked
(03:46) really well you license all the stuff but it's white labeled all right so you have a fee and you have business systems but you don't have a name or a brand that they have to adhere to all right that would be a licensing model so there's different versions of this um but that is essentially what a third way that you could package your existing knowledge or ip uh in a way that scales to multiple locations and ultimately make an enterprise that is very valuable the fourth and it's felt worth mentioning is software and i and i bring
(04:11) this up because it depends on the type of service you offer now if you're cutting hair you probably can't replace it with software right but if you are providing some sort of service that software can do um then this would be software attack enabled service all right hopefully you can read that tech enabled service all right so i'd say number four is is either of those for most people who have a service based business it will probably be one through three and the reason i bring that up is because if you're not already really good at
(04:36) software and have a software co-founder who knows how to code knows user experience knows how to build engineering teams if you don't have something like that do not try and outsource it to a third party team i promise you it will probably not work all right now you i promise you it won't work all right just please just two million three million dollars of development later i've made the mistakes let me give you a three million dollar gift don't do it i told you that i have three of these four and so let's go
(05:00) through the advantages or disadvantages that i walk through with this particular business all right so a private chain is gonna have the highest costs of opening each location so there's incremental cost every new location you have to do the build out you have to negotiate you have to find the location you have to negotiate the leases you have to you have to build everything out and then you have the risk of the lease for the duration of the time on top of that you have to staff it you control the employees etc now when is a private
(05:24) chain uh something that is worthwhile so i would say i'm looking at two main things where a private chain would be worth considering first is that they have low costs of build out right so if it doesn't cost a lot of money to build a new location so let's say if it costs less than you know forty or fifty thousand dollars to build a location now that's an absolute number but relative to the income that it generates let's say it generates four hundred thousand a year in profit if it costs you i should probably put a percentage on this but i
(05:48) would say if it costs you less than six months worth of profit in the first year to open a new location then it would be it would make sense to open a private chain so a great example of this would be insomnia cookies all right these tiny little locations they just had i think they were like 800 square feet on average they're tiny they just have to put an oven in there and a front door window and they have lots of delivery and for them they had tons of margin because it was cookies they were selling flour and sugar for big margins and the
(06:11) amount that a location could make it was tremendous compared to the cost all right and so here it's very low to build very high profit and so it's worth owning the entire thing all right that's a private chain so some of the biggest brands in the world start as private chains and then they go direct to consumers so chanel louis vuitton christian dior you know i mean all of these are brands they had brick and mortar locations they owned everything because the amounts of to build out a store compared to the amount of profit
(06:34) it made was almost nothing now that is a product business not a service business but i'm still at least explaining the point the third piece is that um it's low service requirements so the more specialized you are in terms of the types of skills that are required to do the business or provide the value the more difficult it is to scale in a private setting all right and that is because it is inconsistency of service will be a problem so if you're very good at your thing and you have your location and it works well if if you are required
(07:01) to make that level of value provided to the end consumer that it's not going to be a scalable model all right the reason that subway for example works is because anybody can make a sandwich that tastes the same way if you use the same recipes and use the same process right now if you can productize your service in such a way that you minimize the variability and you can decrease the skill requirements of the labor that is is required to work that system then you have a very scalable model which is the goal so private chain
(07:27) so for example for us just as a side note we have one of our businesses that is a private chain and they were actually they were in a licensing model right and when they came in as acquisition.com portfolio company i actually moved them over here because candidly their licensees were making so much money using their system and it cost so little to open new locations that i was like we should just be owning all this revenue it's not worth just giving all the revenue away and giving all the trade secrets right and
(07:50) so we transitioned the business over and in the last uh 14 months took it from a half a million dollar your business to a 12 million a year business pretty cool right so that is number one the second is franchise right so pros and cons of franchises cons very very litigious very expensive to start it usually costs about 750 000 uh to start a franchise just in terms of the setup fees and legal and and filings and all that kind of stuff that you have to do in order and that's just if that's just to get started that's not even to
(08:18) get it going and to really build a franchise the right way most times it takes one to two years to really start seeing profits because you'll sell locations but the cost of selling franchisees that franchise upfront fee will typically only cover the cost of acquisition all right so what it costs you to get franchise leads from franchise brokers or people who want to buy investments it'll usually cost you almost the entire upfront fee which is usually about 50 grand for many franchises and so you're only going to make money
(08:45) once they open off of royalties from top line all right so it's a very slow model but the enterprise value of a franchise is extremely high so enterprise value the ev on both of these is very good all right for private chain and franchise both of them are very good but the franchise multiple only comes off of the corporate franchise revenue because technically you're selling llc's to other people so other people are the owners of the vast majority of the profit of the business right so you're only making your money off of the
(09:12) royalties that are coming in and then you still have all of your costs of running your actual franchise helping the franchisees succeed etc now when you would start a franchise would be something where you have very very high build up costs right if a new location costs a ton of money like mcdonald's right costs whatever a million bucks to open mcdonald's that's a lot of capital right and so you would want to give you want to give that risk that capital risk to other people you basically crowdsource for lack of a term the ownership of these
(09:39) new locations and then you take a piece off the top now mcdonald's obviously owns the real estate too because they're very smart cookies that is uh the franchise model in a nutshell right you're running on a very small percentage of top line and you have to have lots and lots of locations and if you guys want a rule of thumb you usually need to have 100 plus locations for a franchise really to make sense and here's a fun fact for you 90 to 95 percent of franchises don't hit over 100 locations all right so as much as people
(10:04) have service-based business and think that the ultimate goal is to build a franchise so that someday they can franchise their business the franchise is not the end goal it is the beginning of the next journey all right you have not yet succeeded you might impress your parents and your friends but you will not impress your bank accounts or the players in the game who really understand how it works all right so number one private chain number two franchise opportunity number three licensing all right the advantage here
(10:27) is that it it it's the lowest cost so almost no cost to license out a model typically you have super high margins just like franchising does the margins are high in franchising it just costs a lot to start so high margins now the problems with this is that it's not that defensible it's very hard to defend and there's very little enterprise value so very low multiples when you sell unless you have a ridiculously sticky licensing agreement all right so for you for an idea if anyone's curious you would want to have
(10:56) 80 plus yearly retention on licensees for for you to get a real really attractive uh exit multiple right so we're talking you know six plus multiple on the exit all right and so now the advantage of licensing is that it doesn't cost you any money it's very high cash flow throughout the process and you can pretty much make money day one right and so when you're newer sometimes licensing makes the most sense right so uh gym launch that business is a licensing business right and it was my first business i didn't have tons of money um you know to get it
(11:27) going and i wanted to start generating cash flow sooner and so that was why i did that the business that we have um i won't i won't sure what it is because we try not to get people to copy what we're doing um but in uh in one of our niches uh like i said earlier we went from having a licensing model to owning a ton of locations right now we have 12 locations and we open a new location every month which is pretty cool number four software so if you have a way and this requires a ton of cost to build lots of time very
(11:53) low cash flow you're like why would i do software it's because the enterprise value on the exit is usually the highest but again everyone likes to hear that oh i heard you can exit software for a ton yeah but the same requirement of churn is still 80 or higher yearly uh retention right and the higher you make that retention it's got to be above 80 percent or no one's even consider you a software they're just going to consider you a normal service that just has some tech element to it all right and so each of these has pros and cons and so if
(12:21) you're thinking about scaling your service based business i'll think of which of these four buckets do you fit in and which of these strategies makes the most sense for you all right and so this is how i look at service-based businesses if i'm going to come in as an investor and i want to help them scale or triple or or 5x in you know five year period i'm going to say which of these vehicles is going to make most sense for the ip and the value that we're providing based on the model that exists the cash flow that i require the amount
(12:48) of upfront investment the time to go and a lot of times just the appetite risk of the entrepreneur and how unbel and how structurally sound the return is on the model so if we know beyond a shadow of a debt that when we enter a mark we're gonna freaking murder it and it costs us not a lot of money to open it then we're gonna own the whole thing privately now same thing if we know we're going to kill it but it costs a million bucks to open a location then we might franchise right and if it costs no money right and
(13:13) we don't think that it's a really protectable ip right let's say it's a more offer based business like jim launch for example in the beginning was a very offer driven business offer is very easy to copy right and so it was how quickly can we take as much market share as we possibly can so for licensing it's speed right you can you can you can absolutely outpace anyone else in the market on speed and you make lots of cash flow but you're going to sacrifice a lot of money on the exit right and so with licensing you make
(13:36) money throughout the process rather than having a big lump at the end and probably the exact opposite with that would be like a software type thing so if you take the time develop the software you put the cache up front to develop it you figure out a way to do it and then ultimately figure out a way to make it as valuable as as you have to achieve this 80 or higher uh yearly retention on the customers that you are selling or it will not be valuable at all and it will be valued like the other ones except you just wasted a bunch of
(14:00) money and time so i hope this uh provided value for you if you're if you're thinking about how to ultimately create your enterprise in a way that has the most value then i would think through each of these four different vehicles um as monetization structures uh for the opportunity all right so lots of mozzie nation if you don't know who i am my name is alex from mozilla and acquisition.

Transcript:
(00:00) over the last 13 years I've personally closed 4,000 sales and these are the six elements of The Ultimate Sales blueprint so let's begin with sales multipliers these things right off the bat will make you more money first sales multiplier sell 7even days per week now the reason this is so important is that a lot of business owners want to make more money in their business a lot of sales people want to close more sales but they only choose to close days a week but the interesting thing is that and depending on the industry sometimes the off hours from
(00:36) like 5:00 p.m. onwards is when the most of your prospects are available so like in Fitness where I came from I closed all my sales from 4: until 8:00 p.m. and so if you're like well I only want to work between 9 to 5: it's like well guess what no one's going to buy during that time and so you can probably close more sales in the back at the day uh and on Saturdays and Sundays than you would during the normal 9 to5 so is especially true in like retail and businesses where you sell to Consumers who work normal jobs and you have to sell basically on the times that they're available so sell
(01:10) during the weekends the other piece of selling seven days a week is like there's actual math behind this and so there's 52 weeks a year and so if you have 52 weeks per year times two days right is 104 days of sales extra per year which is 29% increase over just selling 5 days a week and so if you want to immediately increase your sales by 29% sell on weekends and I know I've tried to sell you on this but I'm going to give you one more really good reason to sell over the weekend if you've ever tried to book sales and skip the weekends so you've got Friday here and
(01:48) then you've got Saturday and then Sunday and then Monday right and so you skip these days and so then this Monday gets stacked right you have all these people who are saying like oh man um I'm going to show up so your sales guys get they're like oh dude Monday looks big but as soon as Monday happens it's no show no show no show no show reschedule and you're like what the hell well you didn't make it available at the time when they wanted to actually come which is Saturday and Sunday that's when they clicked on the ad that's when they actually made the booking and believe it
(02:18) or not from a lot of our portfolio companies we get more people who actually schedule on Saturdays and Sundays for Monday which means that they are available right then to buy cuz they've got time and so when you do it this way not only do you sell two more days per week which is 104 days more per year which is 29% increase in Revenue that assumes just a flat increase but if you pull up the appointments from Monday to Saturday when they scheduled and Sunday when they scheduled you then get same day next day showup rates which your showup rates also go up on those days so not only do you schedule more
(02:54) people because it only works for sat them on Saturday and Sunday and they didn't want to do Monday you also get higher show up rates on Saturday and Sunday for the people who wanted to schedule then because that was when it was convenient for them and so you get a multiplier effect across the entire business of sales by simply adding two more days in a year so it's minimum 29% sometimes more next up respond to leads in less than one minute now you may not know the stats on this some of the more experienced salespeople do if you can contact a lead within 60 seconds of them showing interest or opting in or giving
(03:28) you their contact information you have a 391 per increase in the likelihood that you can close the Prospect and so that means that if you did nothing else but simply put the processes in place so that you can contact leads within 60 seconds you could 4X your business tomorrow and so then you have to ask the question what are all these other things that I'm spending my time on and do those things have an immediate 4X increase in my business if the answer no then you should probably stop doing those things and do this one obvious thing that can increase your business to
(04:07) such a large degree also 50% of prospects will go with the business that response to them first not the one who's best that they did the most research for simply the one that responds them first and I remember when Lila was we were out of town we were scheduling some or she was scheduling something for her hair or whatever and she went to a salon and she called them and she said hey are you available right now to take me and they're like no we're only appointment only and she said cool hung up called
(04:33) the next one she's like are you available to take me now they said no hung up next one they answered and she and they said yes we can take you in right now they're the ones who got the business and here's the crazy part is the first two owners maybe they're like I don't know why customers aren't com you didn't make it convenient for them right and so the thing is is that people have huge motivation for a tiny period of time and when they knock on the door in that tiny period of time you want to open it and welcome them in and like okay Alex but you know one minute's a lot well totally and if you do greater
(05:05) than five minutes the likelihood that you close them drops by 80% which means four out of five times you would have closed now goes to 20% close rate on those leads and so the whole idea that people think that the lead quality is go down is not really true it's completely dependent on how well you work the leads now a lot of people like to talk about follow-up and follow- Up's important right you got to make it personal you got to make it fast you want to do it multiple times over multiple days for sure but one of the most important follow-ups is the first followup which is how quickly you can show them that
(05:43) you have received their interest and are ready to help them and customers will make a judgment on how good your business is how buttoned up you are by how quickly you respond so if you reach out to a company just imagine for a second you opt into something and then within 5 Seconds your phone rings and someone's like hey saw that you asked for more information about this how can I help you right and right there you're like man these guys are on top of it it makes it judgment that you cast over the entire business that first impression it's the tip of the spear and most people are missing out so all the data
(06:14) that I will cite in this video will come from two sources so one is there was a Harvard Business Review uh that did a huge case study on different sales metrics across massive Industries and then me personally won Allen and so a lot of the lead nurture stats are related to Allen which is a software company that we own uh which is like 4,000 plus appointments per day and so we could see how changing scheduling and changing hours per day and things like that affected overall throughput because we could see from click to close and so we could see house opening up calendars
(06:43) was the single strongest correlate to overall throughput more than increasing closing percentages by you know 10% 20% because you couldn't get 400% increases in closing like you can by putting these sales multipliers in that I'm talking about right now these are all the things that happen outside of the sale that affect your sales more than anything that happens inside the sale now the next one in the spirit of all this speed of response is it's good to have someone have the option to schedule but you know what else you can give them call now and
(07:18) so when someone clicks down your funnel and they click over to your schedule or something if you can add a dropdown that says call now because now they're calling you and now the intent could not be stronger now if you're in a business where you're like oh man we have to qualify leads more fine put the call out thing after you've qualified the lead duh right and so just think through how we need to do this and if you're like man I don't have the sales team to support it think about it like this if you can 3x your business or double your
(07:49) business by simply hiring one more sales rep if the relative increase in revenue is significantly greater than the cost of onboarding one more sales rep then you should make that investment so that you can have the coverage for your prospects to call you to give you money all right so let's talk about the next one which is time slots so if you are going to have them Book on a scheduler then how do you set up that schedule a lot of people don't put any time or thought into this now we already covered the seven days a week but what about the
(08:18) actual day layout itself now most people say okay I'm going to have these one hour time slots 1 hour uh you know 1 hour whatever now what we found out with Allan is that we could increase the overall schedule rate and show up rate by simply changing how the times appeared on the calendar and so we set this up so that we would have 15 minute slots so you might be thinking how am I going to sell in 15 minutes you're not you allow them to start in 15-minute increments and then we know that the next three blocks are used up and then somebody else books
(08:52) here now some of you might say wait a second that means that some of my sales guys are going to have awkward times in between well there's two solutions one is hire more sales reps number two is you need to have something called an off-the call sop and so you have an onthe call sop which is standard operating procedure which is what do you do when you're on the call of the prospect but if you have a no-show or there's off the call or you don't have somebody on your calendar then you need to have step- by-step of what they need to do when they're not actually on a
(09:21) call and most people only address the on the call and don't address the off the call which is why their sales people aren't nearly as productive and so by doing 15-minute time slots people pick a time that is more convenient for them and so I think on one level because it's more convenient for them it's more precisely convenient they show up at a higher percentage I think the other reason and there's this big misconception about the idea of like no I want to make it look like I'm busy and not have full availability completely
(09:45) dumb it doesn't do anything to literally take up slots that are not true to show that you have traffic it's dumb it just it's dumb I just stop it we've already looked at it it doesn't do anything it just makes it less convenient for your customer to book with you now in the offthe call sop all right what should they be doing then I'll give you the next hack which is you start pulling up appointments so you remember I said we had the Monday Sunday Saturday whatever and people are booking on Saturday for Monday right
(10:17) they're booking here because you didn't put any availability well if you do have your salesperson working and they have an off-the call block where they don't have anything on their calendar what they should be doing is they should be let me see if I can draw a phone here there you go calling these leads and then pulling them up and so when you have that conversation with the prospect the first thing you're doing is qualifying them which you should do anyways with any leads that are on the calendar that are going to take a full sale slot but secondarily when you call them to qualify them say hey I had an
(10:47) opening later today that just opened up do you want the slot and so it takes a three-day out appointment and makes it a same day appointment and anyone who's been in sales knows that same day appointments have way higher SHP rates than future appointments next is is the actual uh person if they can't move it up for whatever reason you still have contacted them within just a few minutes of them opting in so they know that you're legit you've already qualified them and by pulling them off and moving them up if you do have that situation you increase the salesperson's utilization because now their whole
(11:19) calendar has more sales appointments that are stacked fewer Open Spaces which is good and we now have opened up this slot right here so that somebody else can find it convenient and then book in in the future and so by simply changing what people do off the call you increase the sales utilization you increase booking rates and you increase show rates by adding this one thing to what your sales people do when they currently weren't doing anything waiting between calls so the next one is very controversial and a lot of bad sales people are going to be against it but the killers are going to be nodding their head so what you want to do is you
(11:52) want to feed the killers now what does that mean is that the best leads should go to the best closers and the worst leads should go to the worst closers and so you're like wait a second what do you mean my my worst leads go to my work yeah because that means that you have the lowest amount of net waste within the business the people who are the most closable who are the most qualified who have the most money go to the people who have the highest likelihood of closing them for the most money and so I'll tell
(12:23) you a story when I learned this so there was a guy who lives in my building he does like 3 million a year in personal income and he was the number one sales rep or still is the number one sales rep for a time share company that's a multi-billion dollar company he the number one time share company he was the number one sales rep and he's won the best sales rep of the year out of 3,000 sales reps five out of the last six years and so I had dinner with him and I was like so give me give me your give me your strategy he's like you know I won the first year when just with the existing
(12:50) system but then I got to have one hour with the CEO as kind of like the prize for winning best salesman plus you know a check or whatever and I was like okay he said so when I sat down with the CEO I closed him on basically changing the way they allocated leads and he said so they used to just round robin all the leads to all the salespeople and he said when I went to the CEO I said listen you're just throwing money down the toilet you're giving me people that no one has a chance of closing and they're completely unqualified and you're wasting my time and then I see some
(13:20) really qualified person go to a dud closer's office and then he misses it and it's like shoot you should give him my terrible Le is not going to close them anyways and give me the good one and I'll close him and so the CEO decided to test it just with the location that this salesman was at he took his income from $250,000 a year to $3 million a year for him as a Salesman personal income but what was more important is that it 5x the company when they rolled it out Nationwide he increased the total output for that one location by so much that they then rolled it out and so this goes to show
(13:54) that if you're like wait I feel bad about this this is a business decision but if you are worried about your worst Sal people turning out why are you worried about your worst sales to people turning out now the other side of this which is really nice a lot of people don't think about is if your top sales rep can make a million dollar a year or $500,000 a year or $3 million a year do you know the amount of people who will work for nothing for the opportunity to make that kind of money and so what happens is salespeople will come in and work for way below the the normal wage
(14:24) for their skill because they want the shot the opportunity to be top dog and the other piece that this trains for or helps the business out with is that if someone survives this churn Factory of down here where it's really hard for guys to get started because they're getting the worst leads they learn on the hardest people to close and then when they survive and they can still make enough to move up then they get better and better leads but now they have qualified themselves as closers who are worthy of those leads so the next
(15:00) hack actually has again something to do with things around sales but is not sales itself which is most times it's harder to get an entire team to go up by 30% in close rates unless you just absolutely suck at sales but there's usually massive opportunities on show up rates and so one of the things that we do is we give kudos or shoutouts to the closers who have the highest show up rates and so by calling those people out we draw attention to how show up rates are very important to the business because if I had to give
(15:34) you an option hey would you rather increase your close rates by 20% or increase your show rates by 20% Which would you choose well if you're a smart business owner you'd say Well they're the same thing yes so then the followup question is which one's more likely given the stats you're at if your guys are closing at 35% for you to get a 20% boost might be very very difficult but for you to just simply remind them to work their leads and follow up with their appointments might be very easy and so you shout out the closers who have the highest Strow rates every week
(16:04) not just highest close rates and then you ask them what they did and they're probably going to say I just followed the process and then you're going to say that's awesome great job and if you want you can give an extra kudos for the guy who has the highest show up rate you can give him like you know a $500 flat thing per week whatever something that makes it material enough that it's worth showing off for but I'm telling you this can increase your overall sales in your business more than sales training can sometimes and so if you're listening to that you might be like okay well what is
(16:34) the best reminder sequence for people to show up now the first thing is is you want to have your automated reminders set up right those have to be done and the thing is is and I think a lot of people make this mistake is you want to to look automated don't try and pretend that automation is a real person everyone knows and it looks like [ __ ] so don't do it all right but on top of automation you layer manual now manual you don't have to nearly as much to make it effective and hopefully I'm spelling manual right all right and so there's three times that we have S this is from
(17:05) Allen that we know that gets the highest show upates all right very simple 24 hours before all right then am and then 1 hour all right and so think about it like this it's like you have your automated ones until the night before and someone says hey just making sure that we're on for tomorrow very excited I did this personalized thing for you and so you want to show that you did some sort of prep for the prospect so they know you've put some effort in and so they would feel worse about not showing because you show that you've got a whole bunch of work that you want to show them on that call and so whether
(17:37) you're a weight loss you know business it's like hey I set aside this t-shirt for you what size do you want or what color do you want for when you come in would be something that you could do for a weight loss customer if you're a B2B customer it's like hey I already I looked over your site we already uh I talked to my team about it it looks like we've got three things we can immediately help you with very excited to share what we found like it takes 5 minutes to do that but if you can increase your show up rate by 30% because you do that makes a lot of sense
(18:02) right in 60 minutes you can increase your closure your total sales througha by 30% once a day feels like it's worth it now that's night before morning of you think you're a prospect right you're like okay yeah sounds good morning of you start and your whole day is blank because you forgot everything from the day before and so the morning it's like hey just reminder again I'm seeing you later this afternoon and they're like yep I'm in cool and then one hour before they're busy during the day and you're
(18:25) like yo a meeting with you in 60 minutes just making sure now for these I prefer to have uh blue messages is what we call them but basically the IM messages whenever possible rather than the green ones because people still don't entirely believe uh that it's a real person and so this is where having uh voice voice memos uh and video work really well for those reminders in addition to the things that you're doing at the 24-hour Mark that show personalization so it would be something like this hey John really excited to meet with you tomorrow we outlined six things for your business
(18:54) that I think would really help you out I'm very excited to share them with you these were things that I pulled from my team and just from looking at the site uh before we get on the call so stoked we're at 4:00 tomorrow hit me up if there's any issues or you have any problems getting on otherwise I'll see you then next one is Logistics in terms of how you schedule Andor your policies which is we like to do same day next day period in terms of our availability now the reason for that is because show up rates are higher same day next day
(19:24) and so if we constrain people to those days we increase the show up rates now the key and this is where most people mess up is that they're like well if I did same day next day I'm not going to be able to book all my appointments that means you need to hire more sales people and when you do that you'll get more shows which then means you close more sales so those are some immediate things that you can do to multiply your sales without even having to learn anything more about what you have to say on the
(19:46) phone or even getting good at sales itself these are all the things you do around sales that still close way more sales than anything you can actually do on the call but once you do get on the call you should make sure that your guy or you yourself don't suck so let's talk about sales training so now that we've covered sales multipliers now let's talk about sales training making it happen so I'm going to cover daily huddles one-on ones gam tape review role playing and CS gam tape weekly reviews all right you're feel like I don't know what any of those are that's why I made this video and I'll break them down so number one is
(20:19) most people have no idea what they're doing when they're training sales so the vast majority of sales organizations don't even know how to train them at all and simply just run shurn factories so they say you know we'll bring 100 people in we'll see who survives which fine but if you know how to train sales as a business owner you can compensate below Market because you can take someone who's not good and make them good rather than relying on people to come in with existing skills and so that is the Arbitrage opportunity that you get to
(20:50) have as a business owner and so if someone comes in with no skills and then you give them a lot of skills they come in at that Baseline right now I'm not saying that uh sales people shouldn't make make a lot of money they should uh but it's all based on the marketplace if you have 10 times bigger audience that you can take sales people from then that's an advantage that you have compared to your other businesses on the marketplace of sales skills so the first thing that we do is we like to have daily huddles and so daily huddles are
(21:17) where we do role playing now role playing is probably the single greatest skill that you need to learn in sales and the big thing I'll give you as a caveat is every entrepreneur or sales managers always afraid of looking bad or not being able to close something uh in front of their team and so they they shy away from doing role playing but you need to set the frame up front which is no one's perfect that's why we practice and so I'm going to mess up you're going to catch me and it's fine right because if you have any ego around this you will
(21:47) not do it as much because you'll be afraid of looking stupid in front of your team so just get over that as fast as humanly possible now when you're doing these daily huddles you want to do the role playing so the role playing the important part of role playing is you actually have to get into it with them and give Fast feedback now here's how not to do it so and this is how most people do it which is someone goes through the script and they give not real answers anyways and then they say okay at the end of the 30 minutes or 20 minutes they say do this different do that different do this
(22:20) different do that different so two massive problems number one is that you have to give one piece of feedback at a time people can't handle multiple piece feedback so it's not going to work second is that the trainability of a person or really an organism because this actually happens across species is inversely correlated with how fast you get feedback and so basically the number of times that you have to uh give feedback to an organism is inverted with how quickly so one second 2 second 3 second whatever now this is an exaggeration but this would be number of times so that means that if I say Hey
(23:00) try it like this and then they can't do it again and then I have to say try it like this and then they still can't do it and then I say try it like this the faster I do it the fewer times I have to repeat myself before they get it and so this is why speed is so important for training this actually happens across human you know across the entire organization but specifically for sales so when someone does the role play the sales manager or the other person's only working on one thing and when they begin the sale they say this is what we're working on and then they start the role play and
(23:31) then as soon as they mess up or do a good job which both those are happening in real time all the time you say great keep going great keep going and so they keep talking and they can see you nodding your head they can see you giving thumbs up and you can hear you saying great and so you have three or four different ways that you can give positive reinforcement in real time so that you can train them on the right thing to say now when they do mess up you also set the frame beforehand saying listen I'm going to probably stop you 30 or 40 times times during you just trying
(24:00) to say this one script that's okay that's to be expected that means we're doing it right and so if you set that expectation people aren't thrown off guard if you don't they're going to think that they're just doing a horrible job which is not what you want to do and so they go through and you're like awesome great job M keep it going pause say it like this try it again great try it again great try it again and so once someone properly does the right way of saying it you don't just say great they did it once you have them do it two
(24:31) three four five six times in quick succession so that it drills it in so that when they actually are on a sales call it's like this little mini recorder plays and they remember when they to drill it so many times in a row and from a sales training perspective you want to be working with them on one thing sometimes for a week or two weeks all right so it's not a big deal now daily huddles you're usually working with the team on something like as a team we're struggling with this and so as a team we're going to be drilling this on
(25:03) 101's it's one thing and it's going to be specific to that person now the reason that most sales managers do a bad job sales training is because it's a full-time job like you have to listen to sales recordings you have to see what they're messing up you have to take notes and then when you meet with them one-on-one you have to see all 28 things you think they did wrong and say which of these 28 things is going to create the highest Improvement in their close closing rate and then say we're only going to prioritize this one thing so it
(25:34) may be like they just don't know how to ask for the card smoothly it may be that they don't know how to set the agenda well on the call it may be that they lose the frame somewhere during the sale it may be that they're getting lost in the weeds when someone asks detail based questions that they don't know how to zoom out like these are all different skills that a good salesman should know how to do in a sale and you can only focus on one of them so I'll give you another one which is your best closer usually
(25:59) isn't your sales manager all right and so this is a mistake that I've made multiple times in my life and it's because typically the best closers are very like Hunter type person um and there's nothing wrong with that I mean hey that's what makes the world go around um but often times they're not like super like leadership oriented patient willing to uh continue to invest in teammates like they just want to close deals and so most times most closers that I've had in our businesses before I explain this to them they're like I want to be sales manager somay and I'm like do you know what the day-to-day of a sales manager is because
(26:36) it's not just like oh this makes me more money it's your entire activities that you do all the things you love about this job are now going to stop and be a whole new set of things and so sometimes the best closers it's kind of like coaches it's like it's not the best players who sometimes make the best coaches sometimes it's like mediocre or bad players who just learned how to be decent or good not the best best who actually make the best coaches and so I set this stage what I said earlier which is like the sales manager has to have no egoo and can set the stage which is like hey some of you guys are better than me
(27:09) at sales like and so for example Phil Jackson is not better than Michael Jordan or kobby Bryant at basketball but they respected when he gave them feedback on their work and so I would even use that as a sales manager to set the stage was like I hope that you guys are better than me at sales because that's what you have to do every day you just make not be better than me at helping other people get better at sales and so these are different skills and it's totally okay and so when I roleplay with you if you smash me that's awesome
(27:36) that's fine if Phil Jackson went one-onone with MJ he's gon to get destroyed every time that's fine my goal is that this team crushes as a team the next one that a lot of people don't understand is about competition all right now I think competition is very good but not in the way that you think it is so I used to be really hardcore and Cutthroat about I wanted all my teams you know the guys to compete like you know let the let the winners win losers lose Etc and I do but in a different way so I don't want it to be us versus ourselves I want the
(28:07) competition to be us versus them so you need to pick a big enemy and it doesn't even have to mean that you actually are enemies with this person it could be a rival or friend ofy whatever you want and say listen every customer that we're not selling they're selling and so we want to beat them right the reason that you know the us could get to the moon first because we were trying to beat the Russians right like having uh a common enemy is a great thing to align the troops towards achieving a big goal and it kind of quells the inner conflict of
(28:38) the team but if everyone's trying to Edge each other out it creates a culture that in my opinion doesn't actually make the most total sales you'll definitely have people who thrive in those ultra competitive environments but you will lose people who otherwise would have been good closers in a team environment another amazing sales training piece that we like to do in our companies is gam tape review so first off you absolutely need to be recording every single call that happens to the customer across the company across the life cycle of the customer if you're not doing that you should do it please do it now stop
(29:11) the video go do this now all right now assuming you are recording all calls this is something that completely changed my business forever was getting sales and Cs on the same call every week to review the game tape and so you're like why would you review sales game tape with customer success on the call well because then you can say hey guys when you say it this way they expect this and it's really bad for the business and so what it does is actually elevates both teams to a larger perspective so they understand that like when if you ever have conflict where CS
(29:48) is like sales is over promising and sales is like CS stop being such babies and just do stuff right like we're the ones who make the money like everyone gets it we've all been there and so the idea is when you get the them both on the same call one of the other nice things is that you then review an onboarding call most salesp people have never seen an onboarding call they've been selling for you for three years five years and they literally have no idea what happens after they click submit or they run the card or they send the invoice over to finance and then they get the car you know the approval
(30:16) for their commission they're like all right next Prospect and that's fine but they have to understand kind of the larger life cycle of the customer and so this is what ends up happening the first time sales seeson onboarding they're like oh dude this is awesome this is so good oh I'm going to use this in my right they actually get way more data that arms them to be more knowledgeable in the sale and increases their conviction as a closer for the business because they believe in it and CS is can look at the sales and be like hey now I
(30:46) understand why they're coming in with these expectations and they can give sales the feedback of like hey do you think if you sit it like this it would change the sale a lot of guys like oh no I don't know I just said it that way I didn't know that they were coming in that way and so what happens is you create this really seamless process between sales and Cs and you stop having those drop offs and cold feet where you're losing 5% of your sales or 10% of your sales for people who close and then back out and so that in a very real way
(31:09) will increase your sales by decreasing a negative I learned this from my software days so when I started with Allen which is the first software company I ever owned um I learned from the software world that they started doing these CS to sales gam tape reviews and so we said okay well if all these really big companies that make more money than us do this we'll give it a shot and as soon as we did it and that first call happened where we had the whole sales team and the whole customer success team on I was like oh I get it now like
(31:34) everyone got a holistic view of the customer Journey sales expectations were better and cleaner uh they were more knowledgeable about what the customer Journey was going to be uh CS stopped getting upset at sales for making promises and it also helped because then the Cs side was like Hey would it help you if we did this one extra thing and the sales guys are like dude everyone asked for that they're like oh wouldn't even be that hard for us to do and then boom both sides get better they're setting better expectations and they're
(32:00) giving customers what they want more and the Cs team didn't know because the sales team said they couldn't do it because they weren't communicating now on recording sales which of course you should do and you promise you'll do no matter what after this video is done for sure that's Pinky Promise that's what you're going to start doing all right now the next thing is what sales should I watch all right and so this is my big tip is there is no mysticism in sales there's a lot of like you know it's kind of like baseball they're like these are my lucky socks or like I always touch the phone here and here because uh I
(32:31) close when I do that thing right there's a lot of superstition that starts to happen in sales because there's such fat feed fast feedback loops so people learn because they change their behavior uh because it worked before and so they try and do it again but they end up adding all these rituals to their sales processes that end up longterm actually eroding uh their ability to sell all right so they start adding all these appendages to their sales process and actually gets really cluttered and it starts sucking all right now the biggest hack that I can give you as an individual salesperson is is that there
(32:59) are times when you're hot all right where you're like dude I feel like I could close everyone today right you you know it you're on fire when you're hot record the living hell out of that and rewatch those game tapes because you aren't on fire you're doing things slightly differently it means that your Tone's a little different how you open's a little bit different how you transition to the Clos is a little bit different and all you want to do is you want to look for the details because the big difference between good closes and
(33:29) great closers is that good closers try and get hot great closers never get cold and it's because they've systematized every single thing on their monster checklist that creates the hotness of their closing and so if you ever do get hot know that you now have the potential to close at that closing rate and then say cool I'm going to analyze the living hell out of what it looks like when I'm hot how I say it where I pause where my tone shifts where I ask my questions how like when I transition to the sale how I
(34:04) frame my overcomes how I'm punching back and pushing back earlier in the sale to overcome objections earlier before I asked for money that is probably one of the biggest RI tactics I can give you either as a sales manager for your teams or you as a sales professional just record everything and when you're hot analyze the living hell out of it next one is also big team management stuff which if you're ever in a slump so this is for sales managers specifically or entrepreneurs is that if you're in a slump one of the easiest things to do is start drilling
(34:34) everything and sure you can do all that stuff but in my experience reading testimonials can be one of the biggest things that you can do to increase the conviction of the team and so you can get someone's tone to be correct by lots of drilling and lots of training but if they are convicted they will always have the correct tonality because they genuinely believe in the product and they genuinely believe it will help the customer and so I like to train competence in tone emphasis pacing I like someone to understand all of those things so they know what it looks like
(35:07) when it's right but there's nothing that replaces A salesperson who's actually convicted because either you have a team of sociopaths who don't care at all but know how to say everything the exact right way or you just have a team of people who really believe in the product and by believing the product they say things the right way and I will tell you personally it's way easier to find these people than these people and so read testimonials and then give kudos to the salesperson who Clos the prospect who
(35:37) got the great result and so imagine this you closed Sandy you know four weeks ago and you had to arm wrestler into closing she was super you know worried or concerned but you overcame that and then four weeks later you read a testimonial from your manager who's like hey here's Sandy saying like I'm so grateful that I signed up for this thing it's completely changed my life it's changed my business I've lost weight whatever it is and and you then as the salesman say Tom I know I saw this call and I saw you arm wrestle Sandy to get to get this deal like awesome job because if you hadn't
(36:07) done that if you hadn't stayed in the pocket she wouldn't have this outcome and so I learned this because I figured out that my sales team had the highest absurd closing percentage like 100% like absurd closing percentages on one specific day of the month when I had my gyms and I was like what is it about this day do you want to know what day it was it was we out day and so when we'd run our challenges every week we would have people who'd be weighing out from six weeks earlier and so on Friday or Saturday we'd have way outs and so it'd
(36:38) be people coming in for 15-minute appointments and weighing out taking their after pictures weighing out taking their after pictures and after someone saw 20 people lose 20 pounds 30 pounds whatever it was in that time period when someone would come in between those weigh-ins or after those weigh-ins and they're like I'm thinking about signing up they had absolute conviction in the fact that it was going to help them because they had just recently that day hours or minutes before seen 5 10 20 people literally demonstrate results in front of them and so that conviction they passed the Prospect and so I just
(37:10) like to remind you of this if you are a salesperson is that sales is passing conviction from one person to another it's an education process over a bridge of trust and so fundamentally if a prospect knew everything that you know about the product they should buy now if they knew everything that you know and then they wouldn't Buy and you get them to buy it means that you deceive them which means that you are an unethical salesperson so don't do that and so the idea is that you want to just basically fill in the fewest gaps you need to in order to get them over the bridge they say yes I know enough to make this
(37:39) decision and now I want to buy now that we've covered sales training let's talk about what happens before the sale which yes is absolutely part of the sale so the first thing that a lot of people Miss up is that the sale Begins the moment the customer engages with your business not the moment they get on the phone and so how the interaction and communication happens between click and call Will massively change your close rates on the team independent of what you say so for example if you're a local business and when you call to book the
(38:10) lead you say hey uh before you get going did you hear about us on uh you know local City's best boot camp list or that we won this thing three years in a row is that how you heard about us now if they're like no I heard about you from a Facebook ad you still asking that question will influence what the customer uh perceives about your business and then we'll be like oh wow I I didn't know that they won that stuff and so the questions you ask can still be educational and frame how you exist in the marketplace to a prospect before
(38:40) you even beun selling them because you have begun selling them and so the thing is is that the sale starts at the click all right so the setting script the ad they see all influence whether they're going to buy and so this is where having continuity and having a seamless experience between this whole thing is what will overall increase your closing percentage as a team again prior to even talking to them for the main sale so the next thing is like okay what else can I do before the sale that increases the likelihood that someone closes and so the big obvious
(39:25) one and ke de talks about this in his influence book is edifying the closer so if I am setting a call and I've already edified the business by saying something like hey we were on you know so and so's list now a lot of people want to get on those lists because they think the list is going to somehow get them business no the list isn't going to get you business but telling people that you were on the list will get you business and so that's where and let's be real you usually just pay five grand to the magazine so that
(39:49) they put you on the list of best boot camps in local area or best accounting firm in local area or state whatever then that edified the business now when I'm qualifying the prospect I say oh I'm going to put you on with Shawn Shawn's unbelievable he help 400 people just like you get to thing that you just said you wanted in your specific circumstances recently for example he helped someone just like you achieve this and this someone else like you achieve this and this and so you're going to love talking to him he's a
(40:20) great guy and he's going to help you out oh you know what I think he has an opening this afternoon let me see if I can get you in hold on two seconds making noise in the background yep he confirmed we're good to go four o00 Works awesome and so if you have that versus yeah uh I got you down for four one of our team will be reaching out imagine the difference in terms of how that Prospect has been pre-framed to talk to that closer now the closer when they start the call have to maintain that frame that the set are set but
(40:52) again this is all creating one seamless experience of we are on top of it we are a legitimate business and we are someone you want to do business with the next thing is the qualification process so a lot of people have said a lot of things about qualification but the nice thing is that IBM did this massive study and then came up with bant and bant is an acronym that stands for Budget Authority need timing and so they said that for a lead to be qualified for an account rep or close closer the setter had to make sure
(41:30) that they had ban they had to make sure that the person had the budget they had the authority to make the decision they had the need they had the problem to solve and they had the timing meaning they wanted to get started soon and so those fundamentally are the things that are required to close a sale and so you can do this on the call you can also do this on the application that you have prior to the call and even if you did that on both you'll still probably have to say yet again on the closing call but you want to say it before you ask for money and so fundamentally you're making
(42:03) sure the problem the person has the problem to solve the money to spend the time to do the implementation and the authority to make the decision and people will say yes to it and then change their mind when you ask for money but we'll get to that later now this section isn't about outbound per se but I couldn't help but give you one of my favorite outbound scripts I've ever heard which is hey business I'm calling about competitor period give me a call back so think about this imagine you have a dry cleaning business and it's Tom's dry cleaners that's you and you've got Jones uh because you're keeping up
(42:36) with the Joneses Jones dry cleaning across the street and you get a call being like hey um this is Alex I'm calling in regards to Janes dry cleaning uh give me a call back when it's convenient you're like so incredibly curious that somebody has left a message and they want to talk about your competition and so imagine that versus hey I'm calling from 123 Financial wanted to see if you wanted to work like no one gives a [ __ ] right but because you have this personalized uh message that you're sending which works via email it also works via uh voicemail uh
(43:10) the likelihood that the respond is way way higher now when the person comes on and they're like hey what about whatever it's like oh it looks like they're kicking your ass and so or hey I see that they're in the same industry as you and we've reached out to them as well and then so like it's it's a very easy Bridge into whatever you want to say when you get into your when you actually get into the conversation but the response rates from hey x uh calling regarding competitor slays and while we're on the topic of how to work leads let me give
(43:49) you my favorite scripting for calling up leads for local business when someone opts in and so the way that I do this so this is local leads so when I call a lead or called a lead and I called many of them uh I wouldn't say hey John this is Alex I want to see when you want to come in for like no that's not going to work all right so even though they already showed interest they usually don't even know who you are when you're calling all right so the way I would do it is this so I would call and I would say John not
(44:28) is this John I would say John question no my tone goes up pause and then he's John is gonna be like yeah uh who's this like this is Alex pause he's thinking who is Alex who like how like and I'm acting with the way that I'm I'm toning toning uh that he should know who I am all right that's the tone that I'm that I'm bringing this it's Alex pause and during the pause I can hear them it's like I'm calling you because you opted in on Facebook for our promotion and so I just wanted to make sure that one you weren't a crazy person on the internet ha and if there was a
(45:12) time that worked well for you to come in and obviously to make sure that you knew that we weren't crazy people either right and so just in that little opener we have we pull them in we pull them in again then we quickly like you steamroll this you go as fast as you can and say Hey you opted in for that thing on Facebook this specific promotion it's like I'm giving them three different kind of mental cues around what they opted in for because people don't remember the things they opt in for and especially if you don't call your leads within one minute then you call them two
(45:39) days later they're in a different Universe at this point they have no idea what they opted in for and they might have opted in for 10 things so they have no clue what you're talking about and so then you can then bring them in and schedule time I wanted to figure out a time that would work well for you to come in I've got 2:00 and 4:00 today which works better all right and so by doing that I'm also giving two options and saying which do you prefer rather than saying asking them to pick a time I look at my schedule I see my openings I present two openings that both work for me and then they pick and if you want to
(46:09) hear a little little little little early Alex story um when I started my gym I used to pretend that I there were multiple employees that worked at my gym and I would be like this is John and then when they come in be like oh you're G to love Alex Alex is the amazing he's totally going to help you out he's helped out so many people just like you at same same edification script they come in and they'd be like you sound a lot like John be like we get it all the time and we go into it um but alternatively uh you cannot do that if you don't want to I was young and uh I thought it was fun and uh to me and you
(46:40) know what I was deceiving people and so that is wrong uh but to me that's a little bit of a white FIB of a 23-year-old gym owner trying to trying to make it happen and the last one and this one is so unsexy and because it's so unsexy no one does it which is why you make so much money doing this which is you prep for five minutes before the call looking up stuff about the person or the business and so if you're a Setter you can do this for the closer or closer you can do this for yourself prior to the call but you would be
(47:12) amazed at how much of a genius you look like with five minutes of prep people are like wow this guy really did his homework and it's not because you really did that much homework it's just because everyone else is so lazy that any level of effort looks amazing all right and so the five minutes of prep in addition to and this is clear all the notes that the setter sets should be in the CRM so that when you go up with the prospect you want to say Hey so uh you know Jimmy earlier was telling me that you're X Y
(47:40) and Z and that you've done this and you've done this got it so it's this is it fair to say that this is where you're currently at right now this what you're trying to achieve great well this sounds like this would be a good call for you and I think we're we're going to we're going to figure something out together whatever right and so the thing is is that you never want a customer to repeat themselves right that's not a good experience experience overall and the flip side is it's kind of like binary like repeating is really negative but you repeating to them what they told you
(48:05) is exceptionally positive and so it's this really binary swing in terms of like this can hurt the sale this will help the sale and so it takes five minutes and most of the time you should be taking notes on your sales calls anyway so that you can look like you're actively listening which you should be and that way guess what happens to those notes after the closer closes they get passed on to customer success and then they say so I you talked to Steve you talk to Jim and these are the things that you decided on I think we're going to be able to help you out with insert goal and the way that we're going to
(48:34) help you insert goal is by following step one two three so let's get started right and so by setting this seamless experience from click to close from Setter to closer to to onboarding you create an amazing process for prospects to go through and again you can solve so much of this and blow prospects Away by just preparing for 5 minutes and either you do the research or you at least read the notes before the call the next one's a small one but we have one in our sales room which is uh a mini trampoline and so I used to take 20 25 in-person sales
(49:08) sales consults per day and so that could be very tiring and on my really Hercules days I would see 4850 people oneon-one or one on two uh every 30 minutes right and so I would get exhaust so one on1 102 for 12 hours is 48 um is what I would do is I would do little mini J trampoline jumps between sessions to kind of keep my energy up and mostly to keep my mood up because I would start to get beat down when you have your 25th or 30th conversation that the exact same conversation of the day it starts to
(49:39) drain you and so what I figured out was you cannot be in a bad mood and jumping on a trampoline at the same time so try it like seriously you can jump on a TR like you can't even do it and frown it's ridiculous but it really works and so I did it and I highly recommend it if you're somebody who struggles to keep your energy up or keep your tone positive uh when you have like a long sales day now that we covered what happened before the sale now let's talk about the actual sale as it begins opening up the sales
(50:04) conversation you need to as quickly as possible set the agenda of what's going to happen so I actually think a lot about proof promise plan just like we do for YouTube videos just like we do for short content because humans are still humans their attention still works the same way and just like the opener to a piece of content can dictate how well the entire video goes or How likely someone is to pay attention the same thing is true about how you open a sales call and so think of every single thing that I'm going to talk about for this whole portion about as things that
(50:34) increase the likelihood that someone purchases and so fundamentally it's my belief that the way sales work is that we have 100 golden BBS we have a 100 tiny things that each of them increases the likelihood that someone purchases and so I will share this one perspective with you on sales then we'll get into it which is BF Skinner who's a behavioral psychologist said this quote he said people say you can lead a horse to water you can't make a drink he said I wholeheartedly disagree he said if I dehydrated the horse bled it out and salted its mouth and I put water right
(51:05) in front of it when it's on the ground on a hot day he said I can veritably guarantee that it will drink and I kind of see sales the same way which is that if you control every single variable you could in theory close every single Prospect and so I like to think about it that way as though all of these things are under my control so I start sales the same way that I start content which is proof promise plan and fundamentally I do this because I believe that humans are humans and if you want to gain someone's attention and have authority and have them want to
(51:36) wait until the end then if you can do it that way when you're not there to reinforce them or force them to stay on the call and you still get people to stay to the end then this absolutely works when you're also there to reinforce them on the call and keep them going to the end and so I actually think this is one of the easiest ways and proof promise plan only takes 15 seconds maybe 20 so you can absolutely get to the point and so when you start on a sales call it works more or less the same way which is John decided to get get going with you on this thing this
(52:05) big promise that we're working on uh we've done this with lots of other people who are just like you and so this is the process that we're going to do and at the end of the call we're to see if it makes sense to move forward if not no sweat I'm going to still send you on your way with stuff that could help you with the problem overall right and so by doing that we still set out our proof promise plan right at the beginning and what I have found in my opinion one man's opinion is that you actually gain more report I actually got on a sales
(52:28) call uh yesterday with uh a banker for one of the portfolio companies and they were trying to bring our business over and uh he said hey if you don't mind can we just skip the foreplay and I was like I I just immediately was like I love you for saying that and he's like let's just get right to it and then he set the agenda and it was awesome and so I could tell obviously he was a super you know very very hot multi-million dollar preyear salesperson because we have big counts uh and so the same thing is True
(52:52) For You especially if you sell B2B like get to the point and when you set theend that way you actually control the frame because you told them how this call is going to go and if you don't know how the call is going to go you don't know what you're doing and then it looks like an increased likelihood that you waste that person's time and so you having an agenda also shows that you have done this before that you're a professional that you know what you're doing so the next one is follow the script so I
(53:16) actually asked my sales team uh to tell me I said what are the things that I shout at you guys that uh that have helped you a lot so some of these isms are directly from the horse's mouth via other horses horsing it back to the horse uh but I I say follow the I'll put a little asteris here follow the [ __ ] script now the reason I I want to highlight this is that if your team does not follow the script there is no point in having a script and so script adherence in my opinion is the first thing that you drill I would rather have 100% of my team saying the script word for word and Us close no one because
(53:51) then I could then close change the script and then get everyone to close because if everyone follows the script and doesn't close you have a script problem if people aren't following the script you can't change anything because then you have to do it all onesie TWY all over the place now to be clear a the script is basically up to the ask after the ask you have the loops that you're going to do the overcomes that you're going to drill with them and sometimes that leads you down a different Christmas tree but the first part of the sale the first two-thirds of the sale should be pretty much word for word the
(54:22) same their answers will change but the actual scripting Remains the Same so there's different levels of following the script the very surface of that would be actually just saying the words but there are a lot of other things in communication like if I slow down what I'm saying right now it sounds really important and if I speed up what I'm saying what it sounds is going to be really like interesting and I'm very excited about I'm transferring that to you and you might increase the speedo as you're approaching the close but then when you go for the ask you might slow down you might lower your voice again and the thing is is that you can also
(54:51) change the meaning of a sentence by changing how you say it so I got this from Jason F FL was a good um and he said and I love this one I didn't say he hit his wife which implies that I wasn't the one who said it I didn't say he hit his wife I didn't say he hit his wife I didn't say he hit his wife I didn't say he hit his wife I didn't say he hit his wife I didn't say it his wife each of those sentences are all the same exact words but mean very different things and so one is you can change the meaning of a sentence by where you emphasize the next is your ality so me going low or me going high
(55:29) both of those things can change what a sentence means so if I say a statement like you're doing 3 million a year versus you're doing three million a year those are two very different things one is a question asking somebody to respond back and the other is me just making a statement and then moving on and so you can increase or increase the tone of your voice at the end of a sentence which then implies that you're asking for a response from the Prospect and so one is you have emphasis which is where am I going to
(55:59) pause the second is that you have tone which is am I going to go low am I going to go high and how is it going to change throughout the sentence and then finally you have pacing where do I slow down when I really want to make sure that you hear every word that I'm saying because it's very important and this is a matter OFA tone to increase trust with the prospect because what I'm sharing is something that I haven't told other people or whatever right and so pacing can go slow and fast toning can go up and down emphasis is where you pause and so when you're following the script or
(56:30) making the script you want the script to have a tone guide with it and so you could have XY z w as the words and you can use the things on a word processor AKA Google Docs or whatever you type stuff on and you can say if I underline it means slow down if I put this in all caps then it means emphasize this if I put this in italics then it means create space whatever so so the nice thing is that on word processors you have underline italics bold and caps and so those things give you four different kind of cues for the closer so that when they're reading the script they know how they're supposed to read the script and
(57:11) so when you're drilling the first thing you're going for is actually saying the right words once you have a team that can breathe the script which they should do very quickly because it's not that many words you should only be looking at you know 12 questions that you might be asking maybe one follow-up or two for the questions not something that's like the Gettysburg address here right which you still memorized when you were in sixth grade anyways and so and you did it for free rather than getting paid for it all right here the 2011 version of following the script is saying the words
(57:39) the way they need to be said in order to increase the likelihood that the person buys all right so now that we have okay you have to follow the words we emphasize tone and pacing we can write the script in a way that helps the closers uh have the right tone at each portion of the sale then we can move on to the actual scripting itself now I have used something called The Closer framework for a long time I don't think that this is magical it just is an acronym that people remember more than anything um and if people remember it
(58:09) then it means it's been effective at teaching them because if they remember it then it changes their behavior they have learned and so there are probably more complex ways we have a different scripting process that I call the diagnostic script I've made a big video about that but for the vast majority of sales calls that are specifically transactional so it's one call two call closes I usually follow this structure and so the C stands for clarify why they are here all right and so if you get on the phone and someone says I just want to have more information people don't get on the phone to get more information
(58:38) no one wants to learn stuff people get on the phone because they want to solve a problem and so we need to get really clear we clarify the problem that they're like why are you here this is that the question that we're answering now it's like why'd you take the time to hop on the call today what made you reach out to us what made you op on the site and what you want to ask in these types of questions that are clarifying the problem are reminding them of actions they took to show up on your call and so the thing is is even if you're outbow no matter what every lead
(59:05) that you talk to is engaged meaning they've taken one action towards you so hey what made you what made you comment on my post what made you respond to my email what made you set a call on my calendar no matter what it is what made you pick up the phone and and keep listening to me like they've always done something to uh now obviously if you're in a close you're probably not closing on on a cold first Outreach right um they've done something at this point to indicate interest and we will remind them of the interest and then tie that
(59:29) to a problem they're trying to solve all right then we label them now I this is like the shortest part of the script but it's incredibly important all right which is you label them with that problem so you've clarified it but you said okay so just to make sure I'm clear you are here you want to get here and this has been the issue that's been holding you back what you're essentially doing is establishing the gap between present and desired and sometimes the obstacle that they believe is standing in their way once you have that you have
(59:59) now set the table for making a sale because now you have this is where you want this is where you are this is where you want and we've got this big dragon I think I can give you the sword to slay it or I can slay it for you whatever the next part of the sale is overviewing past pain now the reason the overview of the pain is so important I call the pain cycle is something that I've actually only learned about I I learned this while I was selling I just knew that talking about people's pain and what they done before got more people to buy I didn't know why I just knew that that
(1:00:30) ended up always being the case now later I know a little bit more about sales uh and more just human behavior and deprivation creates motivation and so if I am hungry I am motivated to eat if I'm tired I'm deprived of sleep means I'm motivated to sleep if I am if I haven't seen my wife in a few days I might be motivated to do other things you get the idea if you're deprived You Are by definition motivated to end the deprivation and so what we want to do in the sales call is basically expand the deprivation we want to bring their state of deprivation to top of mind so that in
(1:01:13) the moment we can increase their deprivation which then rubber bands back to increasing motivation to solve it and so if you've probably seen you know political polls where they're like what's the topic of this election what they do is they specifically choose topics to deprive the population of so that we say this is now more important for us it's not that education isn't important but for apparently this election it's not no one's talked about education right but in different elections they've been like this is a big problem and so then that becomes the thing that everyone talks about and then that's the main reason people choose the
(1:01:45) people that they're going to elect and so this deprivation motivates a change in behavior and within the context of sales that means taking the action to move forward in the sales process or taking the action to buy this is why the pain cycle is so important and so I have a little ISM that I have in my sales team which is the pain is the pitch like the pain is the thing that often it's the Gap we have to make sure that they have it's like well I tried this thing and I tried this thing and I tried this thing and so we want to quantify how much they've spent so far in time and
(1:02:18) effort and what the impact that's been on their status within their community and how much it's costing them to not do this every day so this is the cost of inaction or the cost of failure every single day that they don't achieve this thing whatever it is that they want and the reason we highlight those pains is because it creates urgency it creates an increased likelihood that they act so the pain cycle that I ran with like weight loss for examples what have you done so far to try and lose weight and then when someone would say I did Weight Watchers or I did you know whatever it
(1:02:49) didn't matter I knew what my pitch was going to be because I had a three three-pillar pitch which we'll get to in the S we which I would always try and highlight the good things of the things they did and the things that it was missing when they brought it up and so if someone said hey I did you know Weight Watchers I would say great so they gave you nutrition I was like but I'm guessing you kind of bounc back now remember everything they've done is an advantage for you because they are here in the sale which means it did not solve the problem and so I remember even having somebody came in who's like I already have a personal trainer and I'm
(1:03:18) like yeah he's obviously not doing a good job but she just looked at me sideways I was like you're here and so she was like fair right and so then I closed the sale but the thing is is that so you know Weight Watchers was they had nutrition and they had accountability but they didn't have Fitness right and so you lost the weight then you gained it back because you lost muscle when you did it oh that's why it didn't work six from gold all we have to do is fix this one thing and then we can get you success uh oh I did the gyms before but it didn't work for me well did they give you a personalized food plant well you
(1:03:43) know what they did okay did they hold you accountable to doing it no they didn't okay so you had Fitness and Nutrition you didn't have accountability because if you have Fitness Nutrition and accountability you can't fail fundamentally if you eat the food you work the work the working out and this actually makes sure you do the first two you're going to lose the weight right and so every business has I call a three-pillar pitch that's buried inside of it so I was making I always tell the story because it's a fun one but I was making a sales script for a marketing
(1:04:07) company that was selling leads to mortgage brokers and Realtors I spent the whole morning being like what are the three things like what are the three things that makes an amazing lead and so it's like okay well you want and I came up with you want leads to be timely you want leads to be uh qualified and you want them to be exclusive right and so basically it's like it's basically going through b it's like you want them to have the budget you want them to have the timing and you want them to have uh
(1:04:32) the authority and or need right and so obviously the need was established because they were leads in already indicated interest right and so was really just controlling for the other three in the three-pillar pitch and so when we were talking and so when we scripted it out it's like oh have you ever done have you ever bought leads in the past and if they had and obviously they weren't having a good experience because they were on the phone with us be like oh what was it and all we had to do was pick out oh you you were getting
(1:04:55) leads from Zillow but they weren't exclusive to you right and so you had to compete with 20 other guys so you had good quality leads they had the budget and they had the interest and presumably the authority to make a decision right but but they weren't exclusive to you and so that was the problem and if You' had leads that were exclusive do you think you'd be able to make money they're like oh my God if I had an exclusive it would been great you're like awesome boom established the Gap figured out the poll in between boom we
(1:05:17) can pull him over we can help you out right and so every pitch usually now to be very clear I'm not saying that it's always three things that triangulate a sale I'm saying that humans tend to think in threes and so when I make a sales pitch I try and chunk up to the three big things so you might be like well we have a seven-step process it's like fine Chunk Up Until It's three so nutrition I could break down into like okay well we've got calories we've got macronutrients we got micronutrients we've got meal timing we've got meal composition like I could get it I could get as fancy as we wanted to to create
(1:05:52) more components but you just want to chunk up to three because people tend to remember it now when you get to the S which is the sell the vacation which I've already kind of gotten into we want to talk about the vacation we want to talk about Maui we don't want to talk about the plane flight we don't want to talk about TSA we don't to talk about taking shoes off going through security you know getting padded down uh how how bumpy and you know it's going to be on the on the plane the food you're going to have to eat the person sitting next to you is going to smell bad like we don't want to talk about any of that
(1:06:24) we want to talk about Maui we want to talk about the experience of what it will be like when they've accomplished the thing the the transformation that we're selling whatever it is now when we have the three-pillar pitch I like to make the statement of what you need like exclusive right or it needs to be nutrition you need to have whatever the pillar is you make the statement and then you give the metaphor all right and so this is how I do my three-pillar pitches and normally a three-pillar pitch shouldn't be longer than 2 minutes
(1:06:55) and so if you're like wait a second so this whole sale I'm only going to be talking about my product for like two minutes yep because you want to be talking about the prospect not the product and so if I want to get into a new organization and I want to figure out how to sell I'm going to spend 90% of my time trying to understand the pains remember for motivation the Pains of the Prospect and once you know the Pains of a prospect and this is me just you know taking my ethical disclaimer hat on you can sell them anything because fundamentally if you know where someone is and you know where
(1:07:24) they want to go and you know the things things they've struggled with if I wanted to sell supplements you just sell that as the bridge between where they're at and where they want to go or you sell nutrition coaching or you sell Fitness or you sell all three it doesn't really matter you could sell your piece of equipment either way you're going to have where they're at where they want to go difficulties they've had and then you just Bridge it with the product but most sales teams spend all their time trying to train people on the product and not
(1:07:49) the Prospect and so then they sound really ill-informed and ask stupid questions that anybody who knew more about the prospect would already know the answer to it so I'll give you three of my my favorite kind of metaphors um that I used to use around uh accountability uh and so I had the three-pillar pitch one is I would just the fact that I would call it the three-pillar pitch I call the three legs the stool and so I was like you can have if you have two then the stool Falls over right you can maybe balance it for a little bit maybe you did do nutrition and accountability for a little bit with Weight Watchers you lost 50 but you G
(1:08:18) back 60 and they like yeah like right so you had it it balanced but then it fell over right but if you have all three and I could use my hands and I would show them that then they'd be like oh I get it it's like yeah this is what you need in order to be successful this so I make an analogy or metaphor of what the three pillars that we have and how it relates to something that's a strong structure now does the Dynamics of how a stool stands have anything to do with SEO or how we get leads from mortgage brokers no but it helps people understand and so
(1:08:50) fundamentally what a metaphor is is it Compares something they don't understand your thing that you sell with something they do understand and you make parallels fundamentally by the way this is what teaching is and so if we want to have a metaphor so I use I use these two for accountability which absolutely slay one I got from Alison Prince the other one I got from Tom Miller so I'll give you the toothbrush one so you say hey uh when you were a kid did you hate brushing your teeth right all of a said or if they have kids it's like do your kids hate brushing their teeth yeah of course but you know and so every night
(1:09:19) you're like hey brush your teeth they like brush the teeth and they go to bed and now you're an adult do you brush your teeth now and the answer is yes most people do if you have a weirdo then maybe you shouldn't sell them anyways so you brush your teeth now of course okay so what happened was in the beginning you had external accountability your parent was your coach saying hey kept reminding you kept reminding you kept reminding you and then over time the positive reinforcement of doing the behavior became the internal motivation to stick with it and so what we're doing
(1:09:48) is we're going to artificially become that external motivation that you need in the beginning to create the Habit so that you can do this long term right now that's I would sell accountability and so me saying that notice I'm not saying hey we're going to reach out to you this many days and we're going to be on this channel of communication these are the the response times I just say big picture you didn't brush your teeth and you hated it and now you brush your teeth and you don't miss a day and the big thing that was the difference was
(1:10:12) this thing and that's what we're going to provide to you done then a different version of this was uh The Amazing Race in The Amazing Race uh they actually had to change the rules because there was a couple that won too many times that they had had to say they had to dismantle their advantage you know what the advantage was well what they would do is whenever they get dropped off this new area they would find a local person put him in the back seat pay him for the day and say hey help us get to this place
(1:10:36) and because they had a local they beat everyone else who tried to do it on their own and so what I want to do right now is I've been to where you're going and I've been in the backseat with a hundred other people just like you and I can be your backseat driver because it'll give you an unfair advantage that makes sense done you've already moved on from the pillar right and so that's how you explain that's those are two metaphors to explain something right and if I sold supplements I would give metaphors around uh you know protein or
(1:11:01) whatever right and so the whole idea is that you want to know what your three pillar are and then you want to know uh an analogy that makes it more relevant if I was selling SEO I'd be like hey well think about your ads as your paycheck that you get every month you have to put you have to put work in make new ads put money in but you get money out immediately think about SEO like an investment account you're going to put money in but it's not really going to be much for a while but eventually it starts compounding and then within one year or two years it's going to be bigger than anything you could do
(1:11:26) actively right but it just takes time so it's just like an investment account right and so that's my analogy so you've got SEO and paid traffic it's the same as income and investment right and so whatever the three things that you're selling are you just want to have a clear analogy that someone can just say got it because if you start getting into details you get into the weeds and that's where you die and by the way if you're working leads because you didn't work them fast you didn't work them enough and then you get ghosted at any part in the sales cycle just send them a
(1:11:53) meme just send them a meme like there's the Kevin Hart meme where he's like where you at um and it actually has the highest response rate out of any messages that we've sent just sending the meme and so uh that that Meme has made a lot of salespeople a lot of money and so you can just send that to your cold pipeline send it to 200 guys uh and you'll probably get five to 10 that just re-engage off of that and they'll probably laugh and then you're back in the saddle and I'll explain why closes die in the details when we get into the closing section all right now the last two pieces are actually around closing
(1:12:25) which is is if you've sold them at this point you've said hey does that sound good you're ready to move forward ready to get started ready to get some traffic to your site ready to start losing the weight ready to start getting back to that High School weight whatever it is ready to ready to insert goal that's how you know you can ask for the sale great let me get your ID or whatever let me get your information start moving forward then if they don't say yes you explain away concerns all right this is fundamentally closing this is objection
(1:12:52) handling which is the perfect thing to get into right now now that we've covered the open now we have to get our money we got to close before I dive into to the tactics one I'm going to be bringing in audience objections so we pulled my uh YouTube audience and said hey what are some of the objections that you guys are struggling with so I'm going to be uh overcoming some of those now live and on top of that I want to preface with the fact that you should train sales back to front so what do I mean by that you want to make sure that
(1:13:21) someone knows how to collect payment and process as the first thing that you you teach a closer why because if they don't know how to do that they have a 0% chance of closing and so the next thing that you would teach someone is how to ask for payment and how to ask for someone to get started because if they don't know how to do that the likel that they close a sale is zero and so a lot of people start at the top of the script when they start teaching a closer but it's my preference to start at the
(1:13:46) bottom of the script because that is what's required to close that being said where does closing begin closing begins once someone says no and to be very clear just be because they said no once doesn't mean they're saying no forever or they're going to say no over and over again and we have to train and expect no that is the job of sales if every person immediately says yes honestly you're not really required we could just record the video put it in front and then just put a buy button and to be fair Tesla does this and they they do a pretty good job
(1:14:16) of it right and so depending on how good you are at marketing you might not need sales at all but under the assumption that you're not the perfect marketer and people come in with more questions or more concerns when they say no is when closers Step Up So before I get into all the things that we can go for I want to break down the one time where you shut up all right which is if someone says yes and says yes I'm in shut up and close the sale do not sell yourself out of a sale and this is something that a lot of beginners do they get excited when the person says yes and then they
(1:14:49) start bringing up more details and then those new details increase the likelihood greater than zero that they take a yes and turn it back into a maybe or take a yes and turn into a no the moment you have agreement you shut your mouth you ask for payment information and you close yeah it's like you're you're at the bar and you're like hey you want to go back and she's like sure and then you're like oh yeah I'll show you my Star Wars collection she's like actually just kidding it's like no you wait and then you show her the Star Wars collection because it's sick but you don't say it until you're back right
(1:15:19) that's the idea save your Lego Star Wars lightsaber for after she gets back the next one is that if someone says anything that you aren't prepared for it's because you are underprepared and so prep equals smooth meaning you should in one breath know exactly what you're going to say back to the person when they have any kind of objection if someone says I got to think about it or hey you know like give me a day or two or hey I got to talk to my spouse or um you know I don't really like this particular thing about the product you should already be like take
(1:15:58) inhaling to begin the next part of your clothes now to be fair or to be clear you don't want to make what you're about to say sound like an obsolute overcome or sound like a pre-recording and so I made a whole video about the AAA method which is you acknowledge then you associate and then you move on in the sale and you ask your next question that is what gives the appearance of a more natural sale meanwhile the whole time there's nothing they can say that you should not already know the answer to because it is your literal job to have
(1:16:30) this one conversation 10 times a day for your entire life and so the fact that a prospect can say anything that surprises you just says that you are underprepared that being said once we are prepped we expect and plan for no and no is not a failure it's to be expected so what happens as soon as someone says I'm not sure I need to think about it whatever so what I want to do is give you my rapid Fire series of questions that I ask prior to get into anything that's real closing all right and so the questions that I ask are in order first
(1:17:06) off what's your main concern all right so if I'm early on in the sale and this is the first no I get I'm like hey what's your main concern because they say I need to think about it you say cool what's your main concern and then you're right back in the sale it's not like oh I need to think about it the sale's over it's what's your main concern let's talk about it together let's figured it out now if you're further on in the sale then I like to ask a little bit harder questions so would be like hey what are you afraid of having happen right like dude I just need to think about it's like dude what are you afraid of right what do you what
(1:17:29) do you think's going to happen what what's the big thing that you're trying to avoid right I ask that question because it gets to the heart of the issue and what you hear after that is usually the real obstacle and that you cannot overcome rather than I need to think about it which you can't right and so all of the things that uh get around stall overcomes all basically try and tease out why they're stalling and how to make a decision and so from there what's the concern what are the variables you're using to make the decision and my my final two that I love
(1:18:00) very close to my heart is what makes this a yes what makes this a yes and if they can't answer that question then you can say well can I share with you some of the the decision-making variables that I often hear when I when I ask that question sure now what makes this and this is a really good one if they're like I'm just not sure then you're like totally understand what makes it a and so people are so afraid to ask what it would get someone to not buy the thing is is that you've had this conversation more times than them and so
(1:18:32) sometimes they're like I you know I don't really know you're like that's amazing acknowledge and then we associate it's like well it sounds like you know believe it or not you're a totally normal person because anybody who'd be making a decision like this really fast would be crazy we wouldn't want to work with them um but it also sounds to me like this is just that you're nerous about making the decision which makes you just like all the people who end up buying and getting amazing results and so now I Associated their what was once I need to think about it
(1:19:05) to I don't know what makes this a no which then you circumvent by saying oh it just sounds like you're afraid of making the decision which makes you just like other people who get amazing results because it shows that you care if you care you're going to follow through and you're going to do amazing if you don't care this is going to be awful and so it's actually better that you had this fear and so now we've Associated and then we ask the next question which is ready to rock and roll and no like there it's like you can even feel feel my tone change in how I'm saying like you ready to go ready to rock let's do this right
(1:19:36) and so that's how I like overcoming lots of stall uh stalls which is what you're being concerned what are the variables you're make using to make the decision what would it take for this to be a yes and what makes this a no right all great ways of segmenting around it without even having to get into more of the uh standard closes around uh I have to think about it to give me some more time so one of the big things that I like to train with our team is something that I call allpurpose closes and so allpurpose closes are the are the
(1:20:06) 8020 um of closes so these are closes that uh pretty much work in all situations so you have to know price overcomes you have to know stall overcomes you have to know decision maker overcomes you have to know preference overcomes so that's when somebody's like I don't like this particular feature or I don't like it that you do it this way um you to have overcomes for all those things but the allpurpose closes uh work in pretty much all scenarios because all of them basically chunk up and get yourself out of the weed so you can just make the big decision overall so an allp purpose
(1:20:37) close might sound like do you think the reason that you're on the phone today is because you've struggled to make this decision in the past and so that works no matter what thing that they're they're bringing up whether it's their spouse it's money and you just call it the reason so it's like oh do you think like I think it's a lot of money say do you think that uh the fact that you hav't invested in the past is the reason that you're not successful right uh I need to talk to my spouse do you think
(1:21:00) the reason that you haven't been successful so far is because you've needed to talk to your spouse for all these things you've always needed to get permission do you feel like the fact that you struggled to make decisions in the past is why you're on the phone with me today so like it doesn't matter what it is is whatever they say you say you think the reason like you just take their objection and add do you think that's the reason that you haven't succeeded because they haven't succeeded yet that's the thing that you have to your advantage they're on the phone they have the pain and so you just say
(1:21:23) whatever their thing is that's the reason right now there's another one which is just the the 1 to 10 Close which is hey on a scale from 1 to 10 uh 10 being you know Fair let's do this one being like let's let's never talk to Alex again your breath stinks I hate you uh you know where we at now it doesn't really matter what they say you just say after that well what would make it a 10 which is another version of like what would it take right but just framed differently so what would it take now if they say a six then you can also say why not a one and they're like well because you're great and you're awesome and all
(1:21:53) these things then you have them say it not you and you're like awesome so what would make this aent and sometimes they just give you the one or two things like oh I must have done a poor job of commun that we'll totally take care of that for you so sometimes they bring up features that they specifically wanted or some element that you can reframe your existing stack and just saying oh we satisfy that problem for you I just didn't communicate that well are we feeling tennish is how I like to say it we feeling tennish awesome let's get go
(1:22:16) let's get going right so allpurpose closes you should know like the back of your hand there's a bunch of other ones I'll just leave it there otherwise the whole rest of the video would be over overcomes with allpurpose causes the next one is a big big big one which is details are death traps all right and the reason that deals are lost in the details is because not for what you think the reason that details lose deals and that they are death traps and let's see if I can use more deal iteration is because you don't get to pick whether
(1:22:47) your answers are correct or not so if someone says hey how many days a week are you open if you answer I call that a blind answer so it's basically you rolling the dice that whatever you say is the right answer which you never want to do as a Salesman and so whenever someone's asking a question about a detail what I train our team to do is ask a question about their question and so we say oh well how many days were you looking for or what days a week were you do you need it to be open right because now based on their answer I can then hedge or frame my answer in a way that
(1:23:19) increases the likelihood that we close and so kind of like lawyers when they're cross cross-examining uh you know uh somebody on the stand they never ask questions they already don't know the answers to and so you as a Salesman should never answer questions you don't already know the answers to and if someone really presses hard on something this is where you appeal to the authority of the business rather than yourself and so you say hey totally fair question I would say it's kind of like asking the secretary at the heart surgeon's place like what's wrong with
(1:23:50) your heart without having seen the heart surgeon yet or the alternative this is the mechanic close which is like hey I totally get this is super important um I can't ethically answer your question right now because we haven't brought your car into the shop yet right so be like you asking you know a mechanic hey what's wrong with my car before you brought it in like we got to look under the hood before we can tell you what's going on with it and I used to use this whether it was hey I can't I can't tell
(1:24:14) you what's wrong with your diet they' be like hey well what kind of diet are you going to be giving me I'd be like honestly it's going to depend and so it's going to depend on these things and this is where you close it you say and if anyone ever gives you an answer before looking at that stuff run the other way because they're just trying to sell you stuff they're not trying to help and so as soon as you say that you have the moral High Ground done you're out of the details you're out of the weeds and you zoom out right and again a lot of these a lot of these allpurpose
(1:24:38) closes zoom out because people get lost in the details they try and find something to nitpick and every salesman's experience knows that like you die in the details one because it's not your expertise two they get to tell you what's right and so you want both of those are terrible things that you want to avoid and so this is where hey sometimes you have to to say I'm be like hey before we get deep you know deeper in this fundamentally you want this outcome we sell this outcome what's get in the way here all right and where we
(1:25:06) get into details and this is the theory behind this that you should understand is that a detail obstacle is actually a preference obstacle meaning I want to have my cake and eat it too I want your results but I want them my way you can't have that and so one of the ways you can overcome this is this is specific to a a detail CL close you say Hey you change the variables you change the outcome I can tell you that if you do things our way we'll get this outcome and I also know from what you told me earlier pain
(1:25:33) cycle that you've tried a lot of other ways and what you have been doing hasn't been working for you see I'm lowering my tone I'm seeing really reasonable right um it hasn't been working for you and so like if you're willing to give this a shot I know that these are the numbers that we can do if you follow this process does that sound fair right and when you say it like that you sound very reasonable and then you can close and so a lot of times when you get caught in the details it's because they want things their way and they want your outcome and you can't have both I'd have
(1:25:58) people say hey uh I I see this meal plan can I just eat what I'm eating uh on the challenge I'm like no because I was like because eating what your eating's got in the body that you got I was like and you want this body which doesn't come from that food and if you're talking to a business owner now obviously like I have to have poor to make that joke um but if it's a business owner it's like no you can't keep doing what you're doing right you can hear my tone change no you can't do it keep doing what you're doing because doing what you're doing is gotten you where you gotten right you
(1:26:21) got to change to change right and so that's like it always usually levels up so you got to change to change you got to change the got to change the variables to change the outcome right so don't get lost in the details and the first response to any detail question is asking why they care about the detail and so you want to ask specifics about the detail so if someone would say hey uh you know what what certifications do your trainers have i' be like which certifications you looking for and they'd be like uh I don't know it's like right and i' be like it sounds like you just want to make sure that you're making inform decision what I can tell
(1:26:49) you is right and so I was always what I can tell you is and I I it's like it's muscle mus memory uh what I can tell you is is that each of my trainers are certified in three different ways and they're master trainers because they've done over a thousand sessions because I'm guessing the reason that you're trying to ask that question is because you want to make sure that you're safe does that sound fair yes well let me tell you this we haven't had a single injury in the last two years does that make you feel better great boom right and so you want to Chunk Up the reason
(1:27:13) behind the detail and so if they say hey how many you know how many emails can I send to your support team let's say you had you had no emails for your support team you'd say well one how many questions were you looking for right and then they're never going to be able answer that question but even if they did you'd say well it sounds like the main reason that you want to again reason the reason behind the reason that you want that is because you just want to make sure that you fully understand things if you fully understood things
(1:27:37) hypothetical if you fully understood exactly what to do would you have questions well no great well then if we just make sure that you understand exactly what you like you don't leave the sessions with our team without knowing exactly what you're going to do you understand every single one of those points that you'd feel okay great well that's what we're going to do ready rock and roll right and so you can you never want to get in the details you either question the detail or circumvent it by trying to guess the reason behind the
(1:28:02) detail and then chunking up and closing that way but details are where you die and finally of course you can mechanic close or secretary close your way out of it and say hey I can't ethically answer that question because we got to bring your car in and look under the hood before we can actually give you an honest answer and it's going to depend so the next one is the AAA system now I made an entire training on this because it's so important but I'm just G to give you the high level on it which is whenever someone asks you uh a question
(1:28:28) or they give you some sort of objection you want to follow the Tria framework and I realized this only years into teaching sales that this is what separated my top salespeople from my mediocre sales people and they did it naturally and I never caught it which is that they first acknowledge what the person said so the reason you do this is twofold one is because it buys you time to think about what you're going to say next because uh they say something you repeat it back to them it's like oh so it sounds like right it's you basically say the last phrase back to them so it buys you time
(1:28:57) and when someone hears you rephrase what they just said it builds Rapport because it looks like you're actively listening which you should be and so one you keep Rapport and you give yourself a little bit of time a little bit of breathing room then you associate what they said with either something positive which is like hey that's a smart question or that's amazing or uh totally understandable like those are just I would say generic neutral associations or you make an association with someone that you just talked to earlier that day somebody who
(1:29:26) used the product and loved it and got amazing success or some Authority in the business who gave you Insight that they don't know so it's like that's an amazing question I actually just talked to our senior engineer earlier today and he actually told me this can I share it with you right that allows you to sell a harsh truth to somebody without actually attacking their character and so if someone says something uh that's way off I'd be like totally understand where you're coming from uh I think it's a super fair question do you mind if I uh
(1:29:50) share something that I talked to someone earlier this morning had the same issue as you and it helped them get over it now again I'm not now saying this to you I'm telling you what I told them and I just happen to be telling you so I'm not insulting you I'm telling you my harsher truth that I told this person and then you can connect the dots and so by having those associations it creates foils for people's egos so you can have more direct conversation indirectly and then the last part is obviously just ask
(1:30:14) so you acknowledge you associate then you ask the next question and that's how you move forward in the sale because this is a law that you must understand about closing key who asks the most times gets the most sales this is a law he who asks the most times gets the most sales and the reason that this is so important is because asking when you ask wrong usually loses you sales and because they don't want to talk to you anymore and so if they get into a bad mood they don't buy and so how do you reconcile asking a lot of times closing the most sales with when you ask wrong people stop wanting to
(1:31:04) talk to you therefore you can't ask more times what Bridges this Rapport and so the reason this is so important is because it gives you unlimited shots on goal you stay in the saddle you stay in the sale rather than getting knocked off and you can tell when someone's complete demeanor changes they close off you've already lost the sale right you lost them you lost Rapport and so by ackn ning what they say associating with something positive or someone positive someone like them who got this big result it allows you to say harsher
(1:31:31) overcomes that allow you to move the sale forward two three steps rather than just kind of like for lack of a better term [ __ ] footing around it and so this is what allows the best sales people to ask hard truths because closers ask hard questions so In The Same Spirit as this in order to keep this whole tone I like to remind my team childlike curiosity and the point of this is that you want to understand not win and so if someone doesn't immediately buy it should be your first instinct to not be like screw this person I'm going to hard close them because it probably won't work instead
(1:32:09) being like huh that's interesting I wouldn't have expected that can you tell me more about that or hey so all of these things are different ways of acknowledging and so I even taught this to uh our team and I you can even see it with my head when I say huh I always tilt my head up because that's how I naturally am curious and so when someone does this you're not like oh this guy's going to try and be combative with me it's like huh that's interesting and so that one buys you more time it also isn't competitive it's not you attacking
(1:32:38) them it's you not trying to prove them wrong because if you prove them wrong you make no money so you want to be right not rich the classic ISM you become rich by making them right because they believe nothing about what you say they believe everything about what they say and so the reason that sales people ask questions because we need them to say it not us so within that context because closers ask hard questions and because we are curious that means that we ask more questions and so what a lot of people don't know is the person
(1:33:09) asking is the person closing so there's a reason that when you're in an interrogation they're like I'm asking the questions here it's because the person asking the questions is the one who's in control you're the one who's leading the sale because the questions guide the conversation the answers do not and so you want to be the the spirit guide who's letting your questions guide the person to the Natural conclusion and so fundamentally sales is an education process and so our goal is to Simply figure out what pieces of information they need in order to make a decision
(1:33:39) and act on it and so if we think about sales as teaching because teaching is same conditions new Behavior then we want them to now have a new Behavior which is buying which we've motivated them to do by pointing out the deprivation they've had in their lives and presenting our solution as the thing that will Bridge that Gap and so if someone asks you questions it's like hot potato that's why we ask a question back because we Take Back Control the reason the details are death is because they are asking you questions they are in
(1:34:09) control not you the other reason that questions are so powerful is that no one can disagree with a question all right so it doesn't matter what what they say if you just ask a question about it there's they can't disagree with the question question which makes you like smoke and so this is my little ISM that I like telling my team is that you want to be like smoke like they can't catch you like any any statement that you give is an opportunity for them to disagree and we want to never disagree with prospects now some people might disagree
(1:34:38) with that and I don't care uh and so the thing is is you don't disagree with prospects because the likely that you lose Report with the prospect super high you can agree with the reason behind the question you can agree or say that it's understandable for them to have a question but you don't want to disagree so there's very different saying don't disagree with agreeing with everything they say very different you just don't want to create a competitive environment and so questions allow you to have that Gap and so statements are bombs that they can then blow up in your face and
(1:35:09) so if we are ever going to answer things we check to see what answer they want and then say it and so they say hey what kind of food's on the plan I say what kind of food you looking for hey what are your workouts like well what workouts you looking for right like and then they say well I was hoping you do some sort of cardan Weights well that's exactly what you do you're in luck right because they just told me the answer and so it's amazing at the end of this they're like dude this sounds exactly like what I want I'm like yes because you told me what you wanted and I told
(1:35:34) you that's what it was now again you want to be ethical and making sure that you're not deceiving people but I think it's way more about how you frame the solution right if I say hey what kind of workouts you looking for and they say uh I want to do a lot of cardio and if I know that there's no cardio in our thing for example I might be like why and they'd be like uh well I heard that that's what I need to lose weight and I'm like what if we could help you lose weight and you wouldn't have to do card you would still want to do it and then
(1:36:03) they probably like well yeah and be like awesome well let's focus on that because this is what I can help you do do you care a lot about how we get there and a lot of times most people are like no as long as you get me there and so this again Loops us out it gets you into you want cake you also want to eat it let me just get you cake and then we can I don't know what you do with cake if you're not eating it but that's where that and then we can throw it there we go all right so even though we're point being is that you either question questions or you ask the right
(1:36:34) answer from the person before answering it and so if you think about this as the decision trait someone ask a detail question you then ask a question what's the right answer to this question they then tell you the right answer if you have the right answer you say great that's what we have if they if you don't have that as the right answer you ask why they have that and then you chunk up to the reason behind it and then say if we got to that same solution either way would you care about how we got there both of those note got you out of the details and you never answered a
(1:36:58) question you didn't already know the answer to as we're going through these closing things right rather than make this an entire thing of just obstacle overcomes um I I really want to tease up to the the the strategy behind this rather than just heav you know shout lines at you all right and so we talk about killing zombies early another way of thinking about is like you want to diffuse the bomb before you get into the cloth um and the reason that we do zombies is because if zombies get close to you they eat you and they bite you right so you want to kill them from a distance before they get close all right
(1:37:27) and so you handle zombies earlier on in the sale and so if you recall from bant these are typically going to be your zombies right budget Authority need timing hey is there anyone else that needs to uh be on the call or involved in this decision hey uh just to be clear the reason that we do the labeling up front that gives us the need right timing like are you good to start now when would you like to start if we were to move forward right budget some of these things you can ask in the application you can ask them the qualifier but when you ask them in the pain cycle for example and this is where
(1:37:56) you can actually collect all your gold for this is when you ask what they've done in the past you can get an idea of what their need was what the timing was what the budget was hey was your husband involved in that decision right and so you can collect all the data you need around B before getting to the close and so if you consistently have a few things that come up in the close and blow up in you then you want to just load those earlier in the sale before you ask for money because anything that you ask for after making money is when you're in the very very uh tight RPP area if if you're
(1:38:27) asking to overcome those things before money there's no Stakes on the table yet I like to tell my team literally in person you always want to be on the same side of the table if you're via Zoom or phone you want to figuratively be on the same side of the table they want to feel like you're an ally you you going to be shoulder Tosh shoulder you be across the corner of the table not across the table overall and so when you're in the beginning of the sale you want to be a FactFinder you want to be a guide right
(1:38:50) if you're positioned as a helpful guide throughout this whole process then you'd asking these questions are things that are going to help you help them if you're asking them after you've asked for money it's a way for you to extract money from them and so it shifts the frame when you ask these questions and these are all answerable prior to asking for money another one is just a little ISM which is a when in doubt repeat it back or one in doubt say it back uh and that's because if you're like Oh shoot what am I going to say you can just always just pause be like so you want to
(1:39:18) know which certifications our trainers have and they're just going to look at you like yes okay I was just thinking about the stuff that we have which ones are you looking for specifically right and so that gives you that time to to come up with whatever your answer so if you get into into ghost mode you can always just slowly say back what they just asked you and you'll still stay in the sale and keep report rather than having a long awkward silence so when in doubt say it back all right so the next one is before
(1:39:57) getting real get permission so I would say that this depends on your frame within the sale and so if you're seen as an authority then you can say hey can I be a coach instead of a friend here hey can I put my uh can I put my real hat on hey do you mind if I get real with you for a second before before we move on so these are all ways to uh gain permission before giving someone a harsh truth now if you're in a sale let's say you're a 20-year- old guy and you're closing you know 40-year-old business owners that are doing $20 million a year that's probably not going to work right and so
(1:40:33) that's where the other three foils that I brought up in the associate part of that sounds like somebody else just like you because now it's using the authority of somebody else like them which is their own authority uh using again Someone Like You Who Saw success it's just a different version or if there's an authority in the business or the product that you can lean on so hey our senior engineer oh our founder those are things that as long as your founder which presumably if they're coming to the business you Le they have some Authority if they're thinking about
(1:40:57) working with you um then that gives you some Authority that the salesman can then transfer in giving a hard truth um and so but this that's the common language before you're going to say something harsh if you ever heard a close or read a close and be like dude I don't think I could say that it's usually because you didn't triaa beforehand right you didn't acknowledge what they said associate with what they said reframe it uh and then ask the question with some sort of like can I be a coach and said of a friend here uh or
(1:41:22) would it be totally overstepping for me to uh share this harsh truth with you and I say not harsh truth so be like that thing hey would it be totally overstepping um if I shared something with you that might be uncomfortable uh right um can I tell you what I told somebody in your exact same position right now that's that's an example of the foil Association rather than the first two if I'm selling consumer weight loss you can get away with the first two if someone's coming to you for weight loss coaching you can say can I be a coach inside of a friend it makes sense
(1:41:47) you're starting that relationship if you're just a Salesman stick with the foils that I was mentioned earlier next one is uh learn to stack closes all right so something that you'll notice or at least me in my my career um selling is that some it's like it's sometimes they're like on the fence they're on the edge and they're like teetering that's where you want to like right hook jab jab ja like you want to just like ah and then and push them over um so I don't I don't know if I subscribe to the uh whoever talks first after you uh mention
(1:42:17) money like money maybe but um I can tell you I've closed plenty of sales where like I could like hey seems like you're hesitating right let me like let's let's let's close this up more um but in the vast majority now obviously with a price drop uh sometimes you do want to wait but the vast majority of other times when I have a big pause I'll just insert more closes from different angles around the same uh obstacle so if someone's saying hey for example I don't have a lot of time right now then I'm going to
(1:42:48) know one I'll Attack on the fact that hey the first thing we're going to do is cut out 90% of the stuff that you that's not working because that's why you're here so that you will be spending your time doing the stuff that matters I also know be like hey at the end of the day this is a question of priori it's not time right because everybody has it and there's other people in your industry who are growing faster than you and they have the same resources so we just need to allocate them differently right um and then I could go from a a macro busy
(1:43:11) perspective which is well I understand that you're totally busy I think it's really reasonable that that you say that um so let me ask you a question do you think that you ever going to be not busy again in the future this is a trap they're going to say yes and say cool do you ever think you'll be busy again in the the future and now they're like well yeah it's like okay well if you can't succeed when you're busy then it means that you'll fall off when you're busy again and so if you want this to be permanent then we have to figure out how to make it work during all seasons does
(1:43:35) that sound fair does that make sense got it and so now it's like I just had three different ways and so whichever one I said first if they're like still thinking about it I like if I just said the seasons one I'd be like hey and no matter what we're going to cut out 90% of the stuff that you're doing right now so we're going to save you that time so you can start doing the stuff that matters right because it's going to be ities not how much time you got right everybody's got the same amount of time right okay cool right and so I just went
(1:43:59) three closes in a row after as the after making the first one and so learning how to stack closes and weave them together will make all your closing more effective and this is why knowing the theory behind the close is more important than trying to memorize what close it is which kind of brings me to this um the next one is I think there's a lot of guys who say to memorize closes I couldn't even tell you uh I don't think I've really hard poor memorized any clo I know the gist of almost all of them word for word not really uh so don't don't
(1:44:33) memorize understand and so let me walk you through the big understandings that you have to have all right so if someone comes with a Time objection they're too busy then it's really understanding that's a prioritization thing that's all it is so we have to allocate the resources differently that's all the closes that are going to be around time are going to be around that a decision maker close is going to be around you want support not permission right so they're going to ask for permission you're going to try and empower the person saying hey we're going to rely on past behaviors this person has said we're going to fact find
(1:45:04) to say oh you know what it turns out they've done all these other things that would indicate that they're already okay with you making this decision and so I think you want to go for support not permission it's better to ask for forgiveness than permission ha right and so you can make those make those little isms but all of those are going to circle around that that main thing if someone's saying details it's going to be preferences it's going to say want your thing my way and so we need to overcome the fact that if they change the variables they change the outcome uh
(1:45:28) and all the closes around details are more or less going to be around basically that fundamental line of reasoning um if someone says money then you're going to basically zero in on value because nothing is ever too expensive it's just not worth it right if I was giving you a Ferrari for five grand you would find a way to come up with five grand of course which then leads to the second underlying one which is about resourcefulness not resource ources because if you really thought that this was going to be the thing that was going to change your life you'd find a way to make it work right if I were giving you the keys to my Ferrari for
(1:46:01) five grand you would call 10 friends and get the money together which means fundamentally you don't see the value and so every one of the obstacles that people will throw at you you just need to understand the fundamental fallacy of belief that they're presenting with so that you can help overcome it and stall overcomes the last kind of category are stalls link back to decision avoidance so it's typically either fear uh of making the wrong decision which we reassure them that is the right decision and not knowing how to make a decision
(1:46:34) so then we walk them through how to make a logical decision what questions they should ask and we just lead them through it that's it and when I go through the uh objections that my audience came up with um whatever I respond with I'm not saying say word for word I think understanding the argument behind it is what will help you close more deals in that same vein you really only need to have two to three closes per obstacle that you really like all right and so that's why I'm saying like you don't have to memorize them but you would you would want to know the two or three that you're usually going to bring up when it comes to uh a Time overcome or a money
(1:47:07) overcome or a decisionmaker overcome or a stall close uh or an avoidance thing right all of those are you just want to have two to three that you know like I could give you a hundred but which one you're going to use on a regular basis it's going to depend on the ones that you feel most comfortable saying in your own language in the spirit of the allpurpose closes uh earlier I said when in doubt say it back another thing is that if you ever get lost in the details or you're just like you're like where am I right now lost question zoom out all right so this is where you
(1:47:38) say whoa whoa tot okay I feel like we've got we've got all the way to Pluto uh and back together so big picture right this is how it you always phrase it like big picture or let's zoom out for a second this is where we say hey best case worst case right this is an allpurpose close so it's zoom out out best case worst case best case we get you this thing worst case you get six weeks of free service from us and you get your money back if you hate us all right and so again getting best case worst case closes um especially strong if you have any kind of guarantee um
(1:48:09) that's associated with whatever it is that you sell hugely valuable mostly just because best Cas worth Cas clothes just murders because you can say listen at the end of the day you have two options both are risk-free you canot do this go home and that's guarant aned to get you in the exact same position you're currently at or you can take a shot here also risk-free but you've got a chance of getting what you want so one is guaranteed to not the other one's got a chance both are risk-free which one you want right best case worst case and so guarantees help you boil the decision
(1:48:38) down so low that it's just simple yes no and so uh whenever you're lost zoom out so finally you have reinforced the decision so you're like wait a second where is that coming from so the closer frame has c l o s e r so everything I've talked about has been e which is explain away their concerns the last step of all of these is that you want to reinforce the decision all right and so when you reinforce the decision it's actually what happens after you've gotten the money so you've explained explained away their concerns they now buy and then
(1:49:13) post swipe post purchase that's when you do the handshake all right now I'm not saying a physical handshake I'm saying that you pass them off instead of a hand off you do a handshake with customer success so if you've ever seen you know from this whole you know video so far there's the through line that all information should get passed like a baton from the person to the next person in line and so I like using this concept of bamfam which is book a meeting from a meeting and every interaction with a
(1:49:45) customer they should know exactly when the next time they're going to be meeting and with whom and the with whom person should know all of the conversation they've had up to that point so they know a lot about the Prospect and what the salespeople have said up to that point so that they know the goals the aspirations the fears the pains so that when they talk to them they can talk in those terms and it will be unbelievably more compelling now we've we implemented this one of our portfol companies I made a case study about it just switching from a handoff
(1:50:11) to a handshake handoff is like good luck right and they pass him to the Cs team and the Cs team is like oh I'm trying to catch it right rather than John this is Sarah Sarah's going to help you with your XYZ problem so that you can accomplish goal and she's going to walk you through with the next steps look like you know it's been a pleasure talking to you she's going to take care of you she's cured cancer six times and someone said she walked on water once I can't confirm it but she's amazing Sarah
(1:50:34) gets on and says John we're gon she's we're going to help you take care of this thing and the way we're going to do that is then lays out the proof promise plan but specific and personalized to the pains and the and the and the aspirations of the Prospect and so we want to reinforce the decision because this video is about making more sales and just about that is about keeping more sales and so if you reinforce the decision you'll get a lot fewer drop offs back outs cold feet first 30-day refunds things like that all right so
(1:51:04) now let's get into FAQs from the audience and so these are going to be real examples of real objections that you guys are getting that I'm going to do my very best uh to help overcome so the first one we got is a cheap competitor so the good news for you is that we have one that we literally just call the cheap competitor close so uh this one you can smash so you just say hey um if ours was the same as theirs which one would you do then they're going to say well I would do yours and you're like why and then they'll say well you have this thing
(1:51:35) that seems a little better you got this thing my friend referred to you you're like right that's why we're more so you let them tell you all the things that make you better rather than you telling them what makes you better and then you say yeah and the thing is is usually when you say it like that most people laugh like you're like right and that's why we're like and that's why we're we're more right because we're better and you know it that's why you're here also by the way that's usually a uh it's usually a buying question so that's good
(1:51:56) it means you're pretty close to the sale so that's called the cheap comparison close all right so the next one you guys had was uh the ID close because I do this in person so if you don't know what the ID close is is that I prefer to close sales rather than asking for form of payment when I'm in person for asking for their ID first the reason I do that is because someone takes their wallet out usually they put it on the table or they take their purse out and they pull out their wallet that has all their cards in it and so when they do that a lot of little things can't happen after
(1:52:22) that point they can't say forgot their uh wallet they can't say they forgot their credit card at home because now it's right in front of me right and because I didn't ask for their payment yet I asked for their ID and so we asked for the ID and I also like to do this because when I get it there's always a little bit of chitchat that happens there so I'm like oh you should see my picture it's terrible oh so you're from you know blah blah blah oh that's amazing you know I got a friend who's out there and you're filling out and also make sure that you fill out all the information correctly which one of the
(1:52:49) one of the ways that you can lose a sale is that you put the wrong payment information in or you tie to the wrong uh uh ZIP code and you're like oh by the way this how you can lean into like the ZIP code that you have for this is this the same zip that you have for the form payment you want to use right and at that point then you say awesome you put it between your fingers and you gesture towards the wallet wherever it is on the table say I'll trade you for whatever one you want to use right and so it's cute it's easy you trade like this but
(1:53:12) it's clear your line of sight it's like they can't say now this just eliminates a lot of BS so that you don't have to oh I forgot my it's like well I didn't ask for that yet and so if you're on Zoom so that's what this is about how do I do that same close you just say awesome can you put your ID next to the camera is to make sure that we associate the right account profile with the right payment and this to make sure that you're you listen nowadays we just try to be careful we try to be PCI Compliant I just made that up it doesn't matter the point is like I asked you and like if you're really not true you just say
(1:53:41) that's how we've always done it they'll be fine with it don't worry about it all right the next one uh is just generic uh decision maker which is I have to talk to my spouse my dog my grandmother my business partner my emotional partner partner whatever right fundamentally they're saying that they don't have the authority to make the decision and so first off if you know that whatever you sell is something that will materially affect a business or household then you want to give the opportunity for them to talk to their spouse in the setting process right and so either it's uh you
(1:54:10) either bring both of them on the call uh if you're like selling B2B or you're selling B Toc uh so especially like I have a friend of mine who sells really high ticket weight loss stuff they ask the partner uh to get on the phone this is specifically women and then they end up just closing both Partners they're like ah you know you should join to and then they sell they make two sales out of it they sell the husband and the wife because you get better results when you do together cool it turns the negative into another sale opportunity if you're
(1:54:34) in a business situation having the business partners on the phone beforehand helps now I also understand that there are times when it's like you've got one shot and this is your this is your opportunity so I follow process which is number one I say what would happen if they said no and if I'm talking to a more egotistical guy I would say what happens if they don't give you permission because it makes them sound like a [ __ ] uh and so by doing that they're like oh I don't need permission then you're like awesome let's get you taken care of then right done over it now this is very crazy but one out of
(1:55:03) three times when you say what would happen if they said no they're like I'd do it anyways you're like so what are we waiting for let's get started now the two out of three times they'll say something like well then I wouldn't do it now some people say oh now that's where that sale ends [ __ ] no we got tons of questions left so you say oh well what do you think would be their main concern so now all I'm doing is just shifting from okay okay you're not the decision maker now let's talk to this hypothetical person they've used their
(1:55:28) partner as a foil the same way we use this hypothetical person we talked to earlier today as a foil for what they want it works the same way it's just in reverse and so you say so what's their main concern even though they have no idea and haven't been in the conversation then what they're going to do is they're going to tell you what their main concern is through the mouth of this hypothetical person they've made as their business partner and then you can actually follow through the same well what would you think would make them say no what do you think would make
(1:55:52) an absolute yes for them what would it take for us to move forward right and so those are trying to isolate variables and if you can offshoot there into whatever that person says would be the issue then you're out of the decision maker frame and now you're closing the obstacle now if they still say you know they would be concerned with this or that or whatever then I rotate into um past agreements all right so past agreements is like huh well do you think uh like what would you think would be a good indication that they would be okay with it like from the stuff that you've
(1:56:21) done already like do they know that you're here do they know that like have you bought things like this in the past do they know that you're in pain with the situation right now yes well if they don't approve of your current situation why would they not approve of you solving something they already don't approve of right so it's taking a reversing a negative and so here it's like sometimes you'll get they'll be like you know you're right I think that's fine if you still can't close then you resort to support not
(1:56:43) permission right and that's kind of like the final kind of final straw but I try and offshoot I really focus a lot on that trying to break the foil and say what do you think their main concern is make it a no for them because now we're isolating issues and we can tackle them rather than getting around decision maker but if they insist on decision maker and you insist on having to close the sale right now then you go to hey I think that you're asking for permission when you really should be looking for support right because at the end of the day if we play this out let's say your business doesn't grow uh like who are
(1:57:13) you going to blame is it fair to the partnership that you don't get this outcome because you rely on this person person no right because all this is going to do is that if you to not get this person's permission 5 years down the road where you going to be right and who you going to blame because fundamentally if they're the one who are in charge then they're the ones who also get all the blame which means that you're not in any way control of your own life and I don't think that's fair to you I don't think it's fair to them I don't think it's for the relationship and so that's the support not permission angle and so that gives
(1:57:44) you a lot of offshoots to uh close prior to getting to that the decision maker is the hardest one to overcome of all cloes is because it's the only one that the person says I can't make a decision so doesn't matter what you say I have no Authority and so the whole point like the reasoning behind this is you see if they actually do have authority and they're just using it as a smoke screen that's like the one out of three right off the bat they say why I would do it anyways that's a smoke screen done you already closed the deal if they're using it because they don't want to say what their actually what their real objection
(1:58:15) is then they're using this person to tell you a hard truth because they're afraid of insulting you because you know it goes both ways and so then you say oh well what would the you know what do you think they would be afraid of having happen What like um what would make them say no and then you can overcome that because it actually wasn't really that they don't have decision-making Authority they just didn't want to say this thing but if they truly don't have decision-making Authority trying to then
(1:58:38) relate the fact that it's like oh you might not have authority but they have already agreed with you based on their past agreements and so if you think about each of these as arguments number one is you do you actually have authority and don't care uh two is you were afraid to tell me and have authority the third is you don't have authority but they already have agreed based on what they've already done and then the fourth is basically trying to get them to take authority of their own lives by asking for support not permission so that's the reasoning
(1:59:08) behind kind of that four-step close with that has offshoots all the way through but if someone's like I absolutely need must that's why we try to no matter what if we know that this is a common thing or it's an expensive you know if you're trying to sell houses you're not going to close the close the spouse and buying the house without the other spouse it's not going to happen right and so if you know that both people are going to be required for whatever it is that you sell just involve them in the process
(1:59:31) earlier so let's say someone says hey everything sounds amazing uh give me some time so it's actually there's like there's a false truth in there that's embedded which is it's actually not good enough here's why so if someone says hey you know this sounds amazing let me Circle back in a couple quarters you say awesome so what are you going to be doing instead and so then they're going to say X Y and Z and then you're like okay um zooming out and hey if you don't this is just a question I asked somebody earlier today and they it they said it was enlightening so you mind if I share it with you right because I'm already getting into hard territory here right
(2:00:03) so U at that point I'd say do you think that doing what this is is going to get you better returns than what we're talking about right because again time is priorities so all like fundamentally like I said earlier like you have to understand the theory behind this they're saying I have other things that are more important and so we have to say no this is more important which means we have to elevate the value of what we're currently doing or devalue what they're currently doing so fundamentally that's the that's how we're attacking this so
(2:00:32) it's like what are you going to do instead got it do you think it'll make you more than this and if they say yes then you'd say why if they say no then it's like oh then you should prioritize this let's get rolling right and so with each of these you'll not there's like there's offshoots like if if they say yes then it's done you've already closed it right if they say uh no I think this other thing would make me more money and the thing is is if there right then they should do that and so a big part of being an
(2:00:57) ethical salesman is that the moment that you feel like a prospect is better served not doing something you should stop but this is why you want to sell stuff that works better right uh but if you do have something that you know will make the more money then all you have to do is break down how it's going to make them more money and then cover cost of in action so that would be okay so uh let's put math to it and that's how I'd say like let's put some math let's let's put some numbers down so if we improve your conversion rate you know by 30%
(2:01:30) that would increase Revenue by 30% but you have uh you know gross margins of 90 and so and your and your current net margins are 30 and so if we do that we'll actually double the profit of the business so the things that you're working on right now um are those doubling the profit of the business and over what time period over two quarters well if we could double the profit of the business would that allow you to make those things happen even faster okay just asking so I can understand right and so again when you're getting into those situations it's always the seek to understand frame right that's
(2:02:00) the that's where we're coming from and so if you have elevated yourself to a helpful guide then it shouldn't feel combative it's like totally get it just so I'm clear you're saying that because the stuff that you're going to do is make you more money than what we're talking about and if they're like no then it's like oh then why are you prioritizing it right and the thing is a lot of times whenever someone gives you an answer you can always ask why because then you can go chunk up to reason and then basically say oh my thing actually solves that reason even better so uh I'm really busy
(2:02:31) right now is different from the give me some time and it sounds similar but they're actually different uh different objections right which is I don't have time I'm busy right now whatever all right so this one is give me some time to make the decision like let me decide in a week that's when you go that's avoidance that's decision avoidance if someone says I don't have time and I could do this later that's the I'm busy which means that we're we're talking about priorities what else are you doing that's more important than this so let's say that you don't have a guarantee which is fine I don't have a guarantee
(2:03:01) around most of the things that I sawell all right um the anti-g guarantee is how I like to sell around guarantee which is oh if you're the type of person who needs a guarantee then this is definitely not for you because at the end of the day we can control we can control we can't control what you do so do you think it'd be fair for us to guarantee work I have no input in doing and so it really just comes down to basically the more control you have the more you can offer a guarantee the less control you have the less you can offer
(2:03:31) a guarantee if you choose not to offer them and so you want to basically do a takeaway sale on the guarantee being like oh this is really for people who are serious about doing it are you serious about doing it okay cool I can't control I can't eat the food for you I can't work out for you I can give you the guide and I can tell you that hundreds of other people have S succeeded but I can't do it for you myself it's one of the few things that I can't do right does that sound reasonable right and that's and that's where like reasonable is what we're going with is that sound fair so that makes sense uh around an anti-g
(2:04:03) guarantee for uh for not having a guarantee if they off if they say you don't have one all right so the next one that came from the audience was uh hey let me watch some of your free stuff or let me go through your lead magnet right so like if you've got some sort of resources that you put out there and then they get on the sales call and say oh well you know or this sales call was super helpful I think I'm just going to you know do the stuff that you said on the sales call what you do is you agree with them and say oh absolutely you
(2:04:26) should do that uh and do that before you come out or before you start our program or before you whatever before we start and kick you off so you just say you should totally do that because if you do that successfully then one of two things is going to happen either you're going to succeed in which case you're going to run into another problem that I can help you solve or you're not going to succeed in which case I can help you solve it to begin with but either way you should you should get started so let's get you moving and so again we have to take it from I want to do this thing we agree
(2:04:56) with them we're not disagreeing you should totally do that stuff because it will make you money and one of two things are going to happen you're going to succeed in which case you're going to run into another issue which we can help you solve or you're not going to succeed in which case we can help you solve that either way results in you doing it so let's get started if you sell to the government or you have very large Enterprises that require 6 12 month sales cycles and you need multiple stakeholders uh to buy in much of the
(2:05:24) stuff that I covered here is not going to apply and that's because these are these are transactional these are basically these fundamentally all of these force a prospect to make a decision now in a big Fortune 100 or a government sale things like that oftentimes no one has the ability to make a decision and it's a decision by committee and so you basically need to continue to stay in the pocket and in most Enterprise sales the amount of people that the customer talks to in your organization increases the likelihood of closing and a smooth uh
(2:05:56) transition and so if they talk to two or three people on your team and you talk to two or three people on their team it's like uh I'll give you a visual so if it's you and one person this Bond easily broken but if it's you and three people on their team and two people on yours then you have uh uh whatever I could draw all these connections but you get the you get the you get the point there you go so there's way more ties and this is much harder to break and so with Enterprise sales it looks more like this than it does like this so hopefully feel
(2:06:33) like I helped you guys overcome some of the obstacles that you brought up otherwise we could be here all day now that we forget out closing we just got to make sure that our heads space is right and we continue to do the right things over and over again so wrap up with mindset now I hate the term mindset overall because I'm like what does that even mean and so what I'm going to try and do is reframe some set things that I have into behaviors that they apply to all right so sales mindset number one the person who cares the most about the prospect wins the sale and so if they
(2:07:02) care more about themselves than you care about them they will win and so in terms of what does this change about your behavior the idea is that if you truly care about them you will usually not lose Rapport in the sale because you will always seek to understand and so then you will always your tone will change your conviction will change because because fundamentally it says keep the human first if this is no longer a good idea for them you should not sell them you should tell them I think it's a good idea for you not to do
(2:07:32) this and I promise you there's nothing more powerful than learning to turn away prospects which will increase your overall closing percentage because you will know that you are in this to help people make decisions to help themselves and so if you try to close everybody you will it will start to wear on you over time because you'll know that you're a piece of [ __ ] all right and so either you're you become a sociopath or you your sales will go down so instead make sure you qualify prospects Never Lie um and if you keep the person at the center of the sale then when someone says I got
(2:08:03) to think about it you're like Sarah I'm trying to figure out how to make this work for you because I know this is going to help you and I I want to help you make this decision because I I just genuinely believe that so what are the what's what are you most afraid of right now like what are you what are you afraid of having happen right and then you get to the heart of it and the thing is is if you keep that Rapport you will close more sales because they will feel that you do care so the next one comes from uh my team so this is one that I repeat over and over and over again so this is banged into their skulls uh volume negates luck all right
(2:08:38) and so the big thing uh with sales is that it is a num game it's like dating you just have to know what the pipeline is and the guys who become the best salespeople are the ones who do the most volume volume and so there's this relationship between volume and skill the more you do the better you get the better you get the more you do and so the idea is that you want to in the beginning force feed yourself through tons and tons of volumes so that you can get through the terrible period as fast as possible because a master in any
(2:09:09) domain has more ways to reward themselves if you're a master editor then when you look at a video there's a hundred things that you can do that you know how to do that you enjoy doing that you've been rewarded in the past for doing if you're a Salesman who's a master salesman you can you like pulling a sale out of the depths you love overcoming the details you enjoy being in the red zone and kind of navigating those conversations because it's a fun challenge for you when you're a beginner you're freaked out and you're paranoid you don't know what you're doing and so
(2:09:37) the idea is to you to follow what Kobe Bryant did so if everybody else is working out once a day if I work out three times a day I'm going to get better that much faster and so my recommendation is find the person on your team who's the best closer and do double the effort that they're doing and if you're like dude that's barely even possible great welcome to getting better right and the thing is is that I'll I'll draw this this visual that uh that we we introduce a lot of our our sales team with which is this is what your skill is
(2:10:09) going to look like over time so this is this might take you know two to three months and this might take you know a year and this might take you know two to three years for your skill so this is my skill here we go but what people don't understand is that this is your income and so in the beginning you just learn not to suck which is fantastic and very important to suck less but eventually you'll suck so little that you'll actually be very good and all of the best returns in life come at the very end of Mastery and so people give
(2:10:47) up in this period of time but they miss out this much where all of the gains are going to happen because they quit early and so you have to approach sales as a skill and if you hate it just understand it's not that you hate it because you somehow have some natural distaste for sales you just aren't skilled enough because I promise the best salespeople love selling the best editors love editing the best writers love writing and when the best editor started editing they sucked at editing and the best sales people started sales they sucked at sales I didn't close my first sale all right I'm just saying like but I had
(2:11:27) enough reward cycles and I forced enough volume down my throat that I started liking it and then once you like it that reward Cycle takes over all right the next one is sales resumés don't matter and I'm gonna I'm gonna I'm GNA explain what I mean by this so I have had two times in my career where our sales teams were not growing at the rate that they needed to to support the amount of demand that was coming in and that was very frustrating for me and once I dove in I wrote a chapter about this in uh my leads book on the uh employees chapter
(2:11:56) um once I dove in I found out that in both situations they were screening heavily the salespeople's resumee to qualify them to get interviewed and that is typically in my opinion a mistake because especially in a transactional selling environment so if you're thinking setting or one to two call closing so very short sales Cycles you're going to immediately look for other skills outside of what their past experience is that you can tell very quickly on a call and so I am more Pro Group interviews and so you can just invite everyone onto the call and
(2:12:30) quickly do one to two minute interviews with everyone who hops on because the star salespeople will in that environment where they need to speak up be more assertive be more social uh one they'll speak up two they'll be clear communicators three the really good ones uh will also encourage other people who are nervous so that's just something that we've noticed there they're going to be more team players at least the type of salesp people that we want to attract and so group interviews instead of resume screening as one of the easiest ways to scale a sales team that we've found now one of the things that
(2:13:04) people don't understand about this is the understanding between attitude and aptitude all right so you've probably heard the like hi for attitude uh not for aptitude all right so that is true sort of and so let me explain so so fundamentally the real truth is you should always hire for the lowest skill deficiency so it's just what are the deficient skills what is the cost of training these skills I want to hire people who have the lowest efficiency which means that I have the fastest ramp up or the highest return on investment for them becoming proficient
(2:13:39) in the business that's fundamentally what all hiring is in general not just sales and so the thing is is that we have these bundled terms like kind hardworking right uh uh uh charismatic whatever right but the thing is is that these are bundled terms that actually have many skills underneath of them and so when we say hire for attitude it really means you know there's probably 20 different examples of what kindness looks like within the setting of a workplace and if someone has zero of them that's 20
(2:14:09) skills I have to teach them whereas if they only need to learn how to call leads and work leads and say a script that might only be two to three weeks of training but training someone to be kind certainly takes longer than two to three weeks now where this flips is that there is some point in the future where if you have a very Niche expertise that's very very hard to find it might be easier to teach you to be kind than to teach you how to code like a level 10 expert or to be a transactional CFO that's done you
(2:14:38) know 50 transactions before for your type of Industry there might not be that many people who've done that and so it might be easier to teach them how to behave within your culture than it is to teach them that skill set and so this is more true the lower level the role that you're hiring for and less true as you get higher but the fundamental universal truth is that you always hire for the small skill deficiency so the next is that compensation attracts great salespeople but it does not retain them or get them to behave the way you want
(2:15:11) to so compensation equals recruiting compensation in my experience does not equal uh performance and I'm now you might be like of course it does I'm just telling you uh in my experience I have never had a compensation change really change the behavior of the team except for one thing uh which I will share with you if you compensate them off of cash collected you will in general get more cash collected but everything else in terms of like we're going to pay this for that and this for that most of the times the reward cycle is so delayed they're just going to
(2:15:48) still just try as hard as they can to sell and so the things that change Behavior are typically much faster uh and lower intensity meaning you were addicted to your phone not because it pays you but because it has a very fast feedback loop and so the reason that in general sales in Slack are overrepresented from sales that actually get processed is because people get rewarded for saying I closed the deal in slack and so they say they close deals more times than they do and so you by the way Pro tip on that is just create a zap between your uh CRM and a process
(2:16:26) sale that's been submitted and make that the thing that goes into slack that they get kudos on just a side little little tip ski there for you um but it's been my experience that you absolutely get better closers with higher comp but and when I say better closers I mean people who have smaller skill deficiencies that you need to train but then after that trying to like redo compensation over and over again it's very rare in my experience that it has has changed the behavior of the team that in a way that
(2:16:54) training and fast feedback loops can't do better the next is that sales and marketing are one Continuum all right so people see them as different departments and for me I've actually profited a lot um by putting them Under One Roof so I always have our meetings as basically Revenue generation uh and you can have a chief Revenue officer who really oversees acquisition overall and since I've done this and I've done this for years um there's basically been no conflict between sales and marketing they're working together to close as many deals as possible so if you ever have conflict where like sales is like marketing they G they're not giving us
(2:17:33) enough leads or the leads are [ __ ] and then s uh and then marketing's telling sales like why don't you close anything like you should be closing right like it's because they're sitting on opposite side of the table but when they're collaborating under the same roof especially if there's one leader ahead of it all of that disappears like I can't remember the last time that like Marketing sales had any kind of like weird weirdness in companies that I own uh and so you have you do that by unifying them and I explain it like this which is that they sit on one Continuum
(2:17:59) and so fundamentally you just have a certain amount of information that's required to get someone to buy and so in a hypothetical world if someone was perfectly knowledgeable they could make the buying decision on their own and companies have proven that like carvana that doesn't have salespeople or Tesla which you can buy a car on the website like if you have enough marketing people can get and search for enough information that they just make a buying decision on their own but whenever you have sufficient marketing to get people to start buying on their own there's typically an even larger pool of people
(2:18:32) who do need more selling to occur to close this Gap to get them to buy and so sales think about sales as personalized marketing which is okay you uh let's say that there's uh one two three four uh five six things that someone needs to know in order to buy if marketing covers 1 two and three then you the salesperson cover four five and six now let's say the next Prospect comes in and they have one three and five then you would cover two four and six and so basically it allows you to personalize the information required to get this person
(2:19:09) to make a decision I don't believe in any kind of mysticism around like oh over this price you have to sell over the phone I do think that there are behaviors in general that more people do but I don't think it's in any way a necessity but a lot of times there are opportunities because there's just more people who don't know as much as people who buy so having a sales team will almost always improve the overall Roi or roaz uh asend for any kind of acquisition process another good thing to understand from a mindset perspective is the difference between uh like belief
(2:19:42) and Trust not really the difference but belief and Trust actually exist because people talk about like oh you need to have trust from the prospect it's not they have to trust you because they are actually continuums it's how much do they trust you how much do they believe you and so when you think about it this way then it's not this binary of like oh they didn't trust you it's they didn't trust you enough which then allows us to have these little check marks along the way that we can say these things
(2:20:11) increase the belief of the prospect these things increase the trust of the prospect these things decrease the trust of the Prospect and the more things you do that get them to believe you and trust you the more likely it is that they will buy and so fundamentally seeing sales in these two frames allows you to think of sales as an education process which you then teach them in order to change their behavior and so one of my one of my little isms that I like to think of is that in general the trust and belief that is required to make a big purchase is smaller than the trust and belief that is required to make a little purchase and so basically
(2:20:45) the bigger the plane so if I have a little plane right that's a bad plane there we go if I have a little plane then I don't need a very long Runway to get this plane to take off if I have a big plane then I'm going to need a very long takeoff to get this to go up and so if you're selling a more expensive thing think about it like it's a bigger plane which means you're going to have more selling more information that's going to have to happen before they make a purchasing decision and so if you're getting a lot of two three four call closes it's usually because you're not
(2:21:18) doing enough education prior to the first call so the thing that change is you need to create more education materials basically you need to pre-market them more you need to warm them up which is just move them along this Continuum here you need to move them along the Continuum more so your sales don't have to take three four five calls but instead they get them to the 6 inch Putt and they can putt them in they get them to the 5 yard line and they can knock it forward the next one is what I'll call say less and so this is uh
(2:21:45) something that one of one of uh our sales guys said that I said to them apparently um and and really help them out a lot in terms of changing their behavior and so if you tend to be more talkative in terms of talk time you want to have roughly two-thirds of the talk time from the prospect not you now gong uh and some of these other sales tools have released different like ideal closing amounts but in general most closers talk less than the Prospect and so that's because they're asking they're answering your questions you're not answering theirs ideally and so one of
(2:22:16) the things that I noticed with the most compelling conversations uh that I've had and the podcast that I've been on is the m Master interviewers uh so uh Steven Bartlett when I was on Dio and Williamson the few times have been on on his pod they're very good at letting silence sit and people like to talk about themselves and people will expound on themselves if you do not respond so I would encourage you to try this so remember I'm changing this in terms of what does it change about Behavior if someone says something instead of immediately jabbing back sometimes just let them talk more just give them more
(2:22:49) time to talk because the more they talk the more Rapport you have because people like talking about themselves so they'll think that you're amazing without you ever saying anything all right the next one is a story that I got told to me by a Serial CEO seial private Equity CEO so when I was uh when I was interviewing CEOs of the companies that um had been sold or been acquired by the private Equity firms that we were we were recording at the time they introduced me some CEOs and actually was one of the most valuable things I got uh from the whole process outside of the the transaction so one of these guys he's
(2:23:20) from Long Island and I'll do my very best to butcher his accent um but I was like so what's the secret you know for you and he said don't be cute and I was like what do you mean by that he's like he's like a lot of CEOs try and get cute he's like they uh you know it's like backyard football you've got you know you got this super secret double reverse fake you know thing and then you try and do it and what happens he's like you fumble the ball you lose 50 yards it's a complete waste of time he's like but what what plays always work he's like two fat guys
(2:23:49) in the middle run to the right right he's like don't be cute and so I I actually took that to heart a lot which is basically like growing a business is a lot like backyard football and getting good at sales is a lot like backyard football the best salespeople say the script they follow up quickly they keep Rapport they ask good questions they listen and they allow the prospect to close themselves so the thing that separates the good sales people from the great people the great salesp people is that the great salespeople never don't do the basics they always do the fundamentals and when
(2:24:25) you always do the fundamentals you will sustain exceptionally High close rates they always prepare for each sales call they always do the warm handoffs they always refer to the notes rather than asking the customer to recap they always set the agenda with proof promise plan they always do those things and that's what allows them and then when they get asked what do you do they're like I just do the fundamentals man it's just that doing the fundamentals is doing a lot of things over and over and over again and
(2:24:48) never forgetting any of the steps and so that's what creates Mastery that's an exhibition of skill so the next one is that no isn't no forever no for Now does not equal no forever and so the big thing is think about it this way let's say uh you were in the dating pool and you've got this girl or this guy that you've got your eye on if they say hey I can't hang out with you I'm predisposed I have whatever and then let's say 6 months later there they're single that no for now doesn't mean you should never reach out to them again it just might mean that right now is not the perfect time because some of the obstacles they gave you might be
(2:25:29) legitimate they might have another opportunity that is higher return than whatever you're offering they might be going through a merger and their team is too spread thin and it's not worth the resources to bring on more people to do your implementation it's very possible that now might not be a good time but it doesn't mean that it's a no forever and so I say this as like okay what's the behavior that you're going to change as a result of this is that you should not be ashamed of reaching out every 3 to six months just for a pulse check this is where sending those fun memes or
(2:25:55) those on line emails can make you so much money because so many sales people are afraid to follow up one because it's work and two because they're afraid of rejection but if you're not afraid of work and you're not afraid of rejection because you believe genuinely which you should that you're going to help this Prospect because they are qualified for whatever the solution is then just circle up when they have a better time all right the next one is be a trash man all right and so this is especially for
(2:26:20) the younger closers uh that are you know just getting into this um and so I'll give you another one underneath of that which is yellow equals gold so in companies that we have we like to do something called lead scoring which is basically putting an approximation on How likely it is that this lead closes so earlier I told you the story of the salesman who was uh you know selling time shares became the number one guy and the way that he was able to become that super super duper closer was because they began scoring leads so we
(2:26:49) could say this guy who's got an 800 credit score and makes $500,000 a year is more likely to buy a time share than this person who's got you know six jobs and 19 Kids and is on welfare and whatever right like the likelihood is it's higher that this person's going to close so that person will get a higher lead score and so what happens is oftentimes you have a score Andor a color that's associated with that so you've got like greens yellows and reds and so a red would be a just unqualified yellows are like slightly qualified but like probably a lower quality lead and
(2:27:19) so if you're new salesperson you want to be a trashman you want to be willing to take as many calls as the company will let you take and so think about this way you are going to get free training from the hardest leads which are the best training grounds for you to learn how to sell and so you need to think of those yellows as Golds it's a reframe and so I remember thinking about this when I was selling in person that I had like some homeless people who'd respond to my ads and so they'd come in and i' you know I
(2:27:53) had people just getting out of jail you know after a 10e stint you know 30 days earlier coming in like no job whatever like I dealt with everything that came in through the door and I thought about it and I was like this is such a waste of my time but I was like what if this were amazing how could this be an amazing thing for me and I was like well man if I can close a homeless person if I can close somebody who has no money no job that would mean that I've gotten really good at the skill and so I just saw this is advanced level bosses that I
(2:28:16) got to go against rather than this is a waste of my time and so if you're younger in the sales or and you're not getting as many reps with the green leads then ask for all the trash leads because there's usually more than a company can possibly handle in unqualified now again if someone literally cannot benefit from the product don't sell it but if it's they are less qualified as in like they have less Financial Resources things like that then you can still practice closing and so think about it and we say this term sharpen the sword is that you want
(2:28:45) to just keep sharpening your skill sharpening the axe taking more wax at the tree and repetition is the mother of skill and repeating yourself when it's a hard Prospect to close just makes the easier ones that much easier so this next one sounds similar to things I've said in the past but it's different so objections do not mean no all right so let me explain what I mean by that so on one level obviously you can overcome an objection with whatever you're going to handle but a lot of times they just are voicing out loud
(2:29:18) their reaction this is especially true when it comes to prices so if someone says wow that's expensive it doesn't mean automatically that you need to start overcoming price objections you could say yeah totally it doesn't like there have probably many times in your life when you've been like oh that's expensive and then you still bought it you just it was expensive it was more than you expected but it doesn't mean that you're not going to buy and so a lot of times people just say things as they come out but it doesn't mean you're not buying
(2:29:48) and so an experienced salesperson is going to trying to start overcoming things and you're basically like Wasting Bullets on on on zombies that aren't there they were going to close either way that's not a real objection they haven't said no they just made an observation so unless someone says they don't want to buy don't assume that they don't want to buy next one is we don't negotiate with terrorists which is never change price to close a sale now the reason this is so important is obviously one because people talk and
(2:30:20) then customers won't like if you're changing a sale price between different customers now testing price absolutely you should test your prices but that should be done ahead of time premeditated saying these next time we're going to try this out and see what happens not oh I got to close this guy so I'm going to lower the price to do it all right and so my favorite overcome for hey can I do it can you guys do it for Less is we could do it for more and as silly as that sounds that has never not worked for me and I'm still like I
(2:30:46) have like a perfect batting average on that one and so the thing is is that it's such a high indication of purchasing intention when someone says can you do it for $500 less can you do it for 30 grand instead of 50 Grand whatever that just saying we could do it for more what it does is it actually re anchors so if you're familiar with anchoring so let's say you say price is this they say well I want to pay 20% off that you then say cool well I'm going to say plus 20% and so basically it re anchors above it counter anchors and
(2:31:17) then they have a fear of missing out because all of a sudden the one price now becomes even more and they're like no no no no and a lot of times they just say no no I'm good I'll buy I'm I'm fine I'm fine and so uh never change price to close a deal now you can change terms so if you want to change how much they pay today then you have a payment plan if you want to change the uh components of the offer then you have a feature downsell those are very very different than discounts that you give for no
(2:31:42) reason and so you never negotiate with terrorists because if they see you change your price for them once they'll believe that every price you have is negotiable and then they'll tell everyone it is too so the next one that we'll cover is the idea that people want to buy so think about this when you are perusing on a site you want the thing people usually want the stuff people like buying the only reason that they don't buy is because they have a history of being punished for buying in the past but they want to buy and so our job as
(2:32:15) sales professionals or entrepreneurs is to help them justify making the decision and so people want an excuse to buy you need to give it to them and so earlier I said closers ask hard questions but my team hit this hit this pretty hard for me uh in terms of it being a big one so I'm GNA I'm going to highlight it with a little bit more detail so the reason closers ask hard questions uh is because they genuinely care and the reason that's so important is that you want to be kind not nice because nice guys don't want to offend someone kind people want to genuinely
(2:32:52) help and if you want to genuinely help then you want them to change their behavior just like these things hopefully change your behavior in terms of selling and so that means that you sometimes have to call them on their BS and the tactful way to doing that is that you want to confront those hard questions one before you've asked for money and two through foils of other people like them this is what allows you to stay in the pocket in the sale and continue to ask the questions that genuinely can change this person's life and if you always come from the
(2:33:21) perspective of human first you will usually maintain Rapport if you don't then what you will get is something we call commission breath which is it sounds like you're not listening to them and you are prioritizing the closeth over the person and that's where you lose them completely because now they feel like your incentives are no longer aligned if you come at it from I want the best thing for you then you will always be on their side of the table your incentives as far as they're concerned will always always be aligned with theirs and you will be able to ask
(2:33:53) the questions that are actually going to change their lives all right so those are the behaviors that you can change as a salesperson to make more sales

(00:00) I have shed friends every season of my life my close Circle has always been very very small very very small very very small very small um I also feel like I grow really quickly because I don't hold on to things long the moment something doesn't provide me value I shed it I think about my life in three to five year Seasons first I was a high school womanizer for the most part and then I was also like really deeply angry I had high school friends that when I left High School I basically stopped being in contact with them and
(00:33) then I had my come to Jesus where my dad was like you suck as human you have terrible reputation maybe you should stop being who you are cleaned up my ACT I stopped drinking nearly as much as I was I started going to school and studying 12 hours a day present the fraternity and that was my college season and I had College friends and then when I left College I pretty much stopped being in contact with anyone that I went to college with most people suck at most things and aren't Bound for greatness because of who they are and
(00:56) the choices they're willing to make the stories about friends leaving the hometown and no longer remember where they're from is one that is told by Society because Society is the majority the majority of people get left behind if you look at the things that you want to get in life there's a price for them you don't buy everything you see in the mall why not because you don't want to pay the price just because you might think that a shirt or jacket is cool just because you think an outcome is awesome you might not be willing to make
(01:22) the trade winners and losers have the same goals the goal doesn't make you unique it's the willingness to pay the price that makes you unique because I'm like everyone wants to be rich one of the reasons that I cut people out sooner than most is because I do not like the labels they speak over me one of the big things with identity is the labels that we say about ourselves I am ex I am impatient I am angry I am whatever right I am poor I don't like saying it people in your past have the identity that they know you as and then they will speak and
(01:52) they will beat that label into you because you're not matching their pattern why have you changed you are X you are why and you're trying to not be that because you're doing something different than changing you're growing but they see it as change and that's why the best response in the world to someone who says hey you've changed is to say yeah you have it the amount you like or love someone is directly proportional what you are willing to give up to maintain the relationship for example if there's a piece of [ __ ] car
(02:16) right you work on it all the time you might say that guy must really love it because of how much time he puts into that thing this guy must really love his country because he's willing to give his life for it what are you willing to give in exchange to maintain the relationship if you're not willing to give up basically anything to maintain their relationship then how much do you love them I think it's been a very helpful filter for me to say not do I love my friends but which friends do I love the most which
(02:39) friends am I willing to sacrifice the most to keep the relationship and I am a big believer in utility there is an exchange in every relationship you get something and they get something back people don't like the idea that relationships are transactional but they are transactional just has a commercial vibe to it but if we just think about it as from a behavior standpoint you've got two things that can happen a behavior is reinforced or it is punished that's it when you have exchanges quite literally with people
(03:05) those exchanges are either reinforced or they're punished part of the strength of the relationship is how long you're willing to wait for the next time that relationship is reinforced if you have a long history of positive experiences with a person you're willing to wait a longer period of time if they're going through a breakup they're having a hard time to keep the relationship going but at some point even if you've been friends with somebody for 10 years if there's just not any positive reinforcement at some point
(03:28) you do cut it off the people who are surrounded with when we grow up it's very unlikely just from a population standpoint that they're going to be great statistically that they're going to be the top one percent or point one percent is unlikely so it would make sense that you change your friends over time why do people get so weird about keeping relationships that don't serve them I think it's just because we have a societal story around it that you're a bad friend but I could also think of me being as a good friend to my next friend
(03:51) that I just made room for there's gonna be a friend who's going to move in to my spot on my buddy's calendar who does want to do fantasy football who does want to drink with him on Sunday so it's not this like all right I'll go to the game with you but I'm not drinking oh dude you're not gonna come on man because the other guy's like yeah shots all around and they're gonna have a blast they would better be served with people who want the same things as them just because I'm not seeing them anymore doesn't mean that I don't wish them well
(04:14) but if someone only tells you the stories when you got [ __ ] up and while you did that stupid thing they're encouraging you in retelling in the story of who you used to be and you want people around you who don't believe the lies you used to tell about yourself the character trait shift is not a binary it's how patient are you how kind are you how loyal are you how honest are you and so you want people who encourage you in the behaviors that you want to be like and this is why I like shedding identities is such a core part of
(04:41) Entrepreneurship is that you have to be willing to say I am no longer this way I will no longer behave in this way and I don't accept that reality as truth many of the people I had around me hey weren't willing to pay the price that I was willing to pay for the things that I wanted but also wanted me to give them more than I was willing to and so I'll give you a story that will paint me in a bad light and that's fine there was a teacher that I grew up with in high school and he's the one who stayed with me after school for a year and worked
(05:08) out with me two hours a day and you taught me how to work out I got in shape got more confidence better at school from there that snowballed into me getting into fitness huge Catalyst snowball somebody heard that story and then found the teacher and they linked us he was like hey man I'm not asking for a lot I would love to just have like a two-hour quality every week that was like two hour call every week I was like I don't even talk to my mother that much I don't talk to anybody that much talk to my wife that's it the
(05:32) value of the relationship was in the past you may be like Alex you're a horrible person and that's possible maybe I am I was not willing to give two hours a week 100 hours a year for the rest of my life to pay a debt for somebody who worked out with me because we only have so much Juju we only have so much time we have so much Focus so much energy that we can pour into things and if you're not putting all your energy in One Direction it's scattered and then you don't move as fast my closest friend I spent one
(05:54) hour a week with every week my closest friend like clockwork it's my highest party meeting it is something that brings me joy and we get lots of exchange with one another he's the one who helps me write my book Dr Kashi Dr Kashi here I get a lot from that now if I didn't get anything from that over time slow down the communication between us I would make it every other week once a month if you slow down your communication cages with someone how frequently you see them and when you accept invitations it naturally Fizzles
(06:17) but if it gets to a point where if someone's like so close that it would be obvious and a conversation needs to be had I encourage you to just have it you want to be a kind person and the way you are kind is that you tell the truth and you just be honest and the easiest way that I can tell you to be honest is you know when you talk about somebody behind their back just say it to them it's like yeah Sandra's been like all over the place lately and she's like I don't drink it a little bit too much Sandra you've been all over the place lately
(06:42) you've been drinking a little bit too much I'm just not sure if I want to associate with that right now people just don't have the balls to do that but if you do that I promise you either have better relationships or you'll be done with this Mickey Mouse [ __ ] of not even being in a real relationship and not wanting to confront reality because you may have a shot at getting them to realize that they're not on the path that they wanted to be on because you were friends with him at some point and so either your goals have changed or
(07:01) theirs have if you listen to Kobe's interviews where he talks about his friends he says very explicitly that he's willing to put everything on the Altar for his dream now some people may make the argument that's not quote healthy the question that we're answering here is not how do we do healthy stuff question is how do we become the greatest people will judge you on how you spend time and their judgments are simply Expressions that they would not spend their time the same way you do hey you work a lot and I
(07:30) could say hey you don't to the same degree it's like you spend so much time with your kids right if I say it like that people like wait no I'm supposed to it's only the supposed to this the thing that gives all the emotional charge to these conversations otherwise it's just observing reality you can't expect to do the same thing everyone else is doing and somehow achieve a different outcome once you have the vacuum of friends because you'll probably have weeded people out then the best thing to do is join communities and then you'll make
(07:52) friends with people in those communities who have the same goals as you and then if you crush it because you understand that volume is the answer and time is the ingredient you're going to rise in that community and you'll gain more status and you'll start hanging out with people who are at the top of that community and then you can LeapFrog into other communities it's just lunch tables on steroids I've wanted to live a rare life and so I will have to be surrounded by Rare people and rare people are by definition rare they're not common My
(08:15) Hope Is that the people that I meet now are trying to go all the way with me I want to do epic [ __ ] if I die and don't do epic [ __ ] I will be bummed how much am I willing to endure or sacrifice in order to maintain that relationship that I have with my dream if I have many many friends over different seasons I'm totally cool with that thank you for that season it was awesome I I don't believe things need to be forever to be good and it's only the romantic story that we were told of friends for life Etc if you die with one good friend or
(08:44) two good friends like you've had a really good life

(00:00) what I'm going to talk about in this video is not fun but it's going to make you a ton of money and I'm going to explain why so many of you are leaving massive amounts of money on the table right now and not using your single largest competitive advantage and these lessons have come hard-earned from years in business I've founded and exited nine businesses my last one at 46.
(00:23) 2 million bucks our current portfolio is over $200 million a year and I make these videos so that you can make money and the big concept I want to talk to you about is scaling the unscalable and I'm going to give you some big tactics at the end of this video after I explain why it's so important why everyone gets it wrong and so just because in the beginning you can't see how it's going to scale doesn't mean it's impossible to scale I had this girl come up to me at an event ages ago and she was in the Fitness World obviously because that's where I
(00:50) was and she said I do outbound for my my business and we do $30,000 a month um but I want to have a more scalable acquisition system and I was like why can't you scale outbound and she was like well I mean it requires people and I was like welcome to business baby like how how do you think you're going to scale the deliverable if you had Fitness coaching I was like people is Fitness coaching unscalable no you hire and train people welcome to the service business which is culture and training that's service that's how it
(01:22) works and the fact that you don't know how to do it is what makes it unscalable not that physics disproves the ability to scale onboard boing or scale handwritten cards like unless you can prove physically that it's impossible that gravity exists differently in your [ __ ] world then it's not unscalable you have a skill deficiency it's unskill that's what it is it's not unscalable you are unskilled enough to scale it I remember when I was in weight loss I would have a lady who would walk in and uh and she would say something like hey
(01:54) uh I don't want to lose too much weight right or I'd have a guy and this is probably the more common one they'd say well I don't want to get I want to look like you like and I'm like don't worry you never will but the point is is they would look at me and say I don't want to get bulky like you you have too much muscle I don't think that looks good and I'm like you know you're not going to wake up tomorrow and just be jacked as [ __ ] and have trained for 20 years right it's not going to happen there's going
(02:17) to be a million days in between and at any point you can say I'm just going to stop here I'm going to try and maintain but the thing is is that people try and say that they don't want the extreme version of a solution so they're not willing to do take a step in that direction and so the same thing happens from a deliverability perspective they say hey you know what if I do it this way I'm not going to be able to hit $100 million a year this isn't scalable but the thing is is that you're not even making money right now and you're
(02:43) talking about scale you're talking about how you're not going to be able to fit in your clothes and you haven't even lost weight you're talking about how you're don't want to look too bulky but no one even knows you work out right now because of how you look and so the same thing in business is that like sure you think and here's the here's the real real is that when you start you don't have context and you don't have resources so with your current set of resources the unscalable thing looks unscalable because you have no help and
(03:08) you have no money and you have no leverage but good friend of mine Andy forella he has first form they do hundreds of millions of dollars a year in Revenue when he started the business he started writing handwritten cards to every single person who bought their products now in the beginning you'd be like you're the owner how could you write handwritten cards to every single person that buys the product that's not scalable Alex but guess what he still does it today and they get a zillion orders a minute at this point
(03:35) but what did he do well in the beginning he was writing the handwritten cards and over time he just signed the handwritten cards and then finally other people were writing the handwritten cards and the gesture still held and so the thing is there's a there's a 2.0 3.0 version that can still check 80% of the boxes that you learn from the unscalable solution I got on the phone this last week with a recent founder who exited exited a fintech company for $2.
(03:59) 5 billion some of you guys who saw my story um I've been trying to talk to people in that space so if you don't do know somebody in Neo banking uh payer processing uh who had a big exit uh please hit me up I'm trying to learn some stuff uh for one of our portfolio companies but anyways he was saying hey it's all about the unscalable and he and I had this great chule about this that so many business owners are unwilling to do the heavy hard work the one1 calls the talking to customers in the beginning because they say it's not
(04:24) scalable but there's always a version that presents itself two three steps down the road because you have the money and the skill to be able to say hey what are the key components of this of this thing that can make it scalable and so I would encourage you if you're starting the business and let's say you're selling because I'm obviously in the school Community right and so I see people who are trying to sell a a $20 a month community and they're like well I don't want to hop on the phone for a $20 month sale also first off guess what
(04:50) genius I was in the the large Fitness World brick and mortar what do you think gym memberships sell at do you think they have a person selling it at the front desk sure as [ __ ] they do guess who it isn't the owner and they can still scale that process and so again the idea that things aren't scalable is ridiculous now sure you're not going to be able to take 20 calls a day in the be you know at scale but you're currently making zero so what the [ __ ] are you doing all day you can't be busy and broke pick one
(05:20) right you're either busy and you're making money because you're doing the right stuff or you're broke but you got plenty of time like you can't have both problems and so if you're broke get busy and do some of the unscalable stuff and that means hopping on the calls with customers that are below your ticket price but guess what that happens is that you're learning more from them then you are earning from them and that's okay because you're going to learn the pain points they're suffering from you're going to learn the the hooks in
(05:43) the messaging that matter most to them you're going to learn how to alter your product and your offer in a way that makes it convert at a higher percentage you're going to learn The Things They Don't Care by the way you want have two magic questions here's some Pro tips for you the first thing you ask a customer is you say hey if I were to eliminate all of the things that I have in my feature set except for one what would it be and they'll tell you and if you ask 100 people you'll get by far a power ranking for what matters most in terms
(06:09) of value for the core deliverables you have now you can also ask the second the inverted version of that question which is hey if I were to eliminate one thing from my entire feature set and it changed nothing about your life which one would it be and you also get the least valuable thing and between both those elements and if you do this on a regular basis you continue to cut and trim and distill down the value they provide to the most amount of people by simply asking them and so I think Paul Graham said this and I believe this and
(06:34) I keep repeating it because I think it's so important is that you can solve every question and every problem in business by talking to your customer more you have a marketing problem talk to your customer you have a product problem talk to your customer like they know what they want and they will tell you how to address them and how to advertise to them and so getting on the phone and doing the quote unscalable writing the handwritten card onboarding every customer even though it's $10 a month that they're paying guess what happens
(07:00) when you on board those customers I'll bet you they're going to stay longer I'll bet you they refer more people and you're going to be able to make the product better and the marketing better and so even if you do that now let's say okay Alex oh my God I followed your advice and now I'm taking 20 calls a day well guess what now you're making money and I don't give a [ __ ] but if you're still like hey I want to make more money fine I'll give you the next step so when you go from 101 you go to semi-private you do one on six right you can still
(07:24) deliver a close to that experience but you 6X your output so instead of talking to 20 people a day you talk to 120 people a day now if you're like wow 20 people a day that sounds like a lot guess how Alex learned sales I did 4,101 closes not consults closes over a multi-year period for my gyms why because I had appointments back to back to back to back to back and I had two to three people that were scheduled for every 30 minutes and so that accounted for show rate so that no matter what I always had one to three people who were
(07:51) showing up every 30 minutes that I pitched the exact same thing to and guess what happened I got pretty good at sales the amount of people who asked me hey what sales training did you go to I didn't I went through the unscalable sales training of actually just selling a lot of people and so the idea is that you are going to learn more then you are going to earn in the beginning and that is okay because as long as you see entrepreneurship as a continual journey of educating educating yourself on your customer the problems that you're trying
(08:17) to solve for them why would you not want to FastTrack that and jam as much of that as you possibly could from the best possible teacher that is in the marketplace which is the market itself and so I get passionate about this because I see so many poor people trying to think that they're thinking like rich people when they're really thinking like poor people CU they're trying to be broke and not busy so get busy talk to the customers even if they pay you 10 bucks a month you'll learn more and then guess what happens after you do one on six you do
(08:45) group onboarding you do one on 20 you do one on 30 and guess what you can do from there we have a company right now that still does that did group onboarding and scale to 100 million plus a year all right and we still did it because we knew the onboarding was such an important Pro part of the process for sitting expectations telling them what was going to happen next keep setting promises and keeping promises over and over and over again and so if you have one on 30 fine guess what you can still do six those do 180
(09:09) people a day with just one person and if you train somebody and what happens like let's really think through this in the beginning you do the one-on ones okay now in the beginning you're just answering questions over time you say Okay most people have these same six questions and so then I'm going to create a little presentation around these six questions and so then you start using the presentation in the one ones and you're like you know what I think I can do this a little bit faster and so you get the one-on six there and
(09:30) you have the presentation and you're still seeing the same output with the one on6 as you were with the one-on-one fantastic now what do you do you see can I get to 30 and you do 30 and then you 5x again your 6X output and again now you're like huh I wonder if I can teach somebody else to go through the same deck as me and you know what you do and just like that you scaled the [ __ ] unscalable real quick if you're tired of being broke and would rather be busy join me at the school game so school.
(09:55) com games I take a call every every weekend there I'll help you build your business step by step we we have once a month a mastermind that I drop in there of all the people who fly out from the top 10 communities that are making money online right now and we break down all the tax that they're doing right now so that you can use them too and so the reason that you have to do the unscalable stuff is that there's a swamp in business where you don't have enough money to pay somebody else but you still have to do your day job and the next job and so you
(10:19) just have to work overtime and that means you work today's job and tomorrow's job so that you can get ahead and so the thing is is that every single business hear me out every single business incurs debt so the question is what type of debt do you want to incur so a venture back company incurs financial debt so that they can H lots of talent upfront they can get really smart people and pay them where they should be paid at Market rates now if you don't have that money to pay all those good people guess what kind of
(10:46) debt you incur management debt because you don't have the right people because you can't afford to pay them and when you have management debt what does that mean it means that you have to work the job of two three four people and that's what makes it quote unscalable but you have to go through that swamp in order to get to the other side and one of the big problems is that people look 10 steps ahead and then project that back to the present it's the same thing as saying Hey I want to uh get rich so I'm going to go start flying private it's
(11:11) like Warren Buffett wasn't flying private to get rich he has done that as a result of being rich it's not the path that got him there it is the outcome of being there and this is actually one of the big issues I see at large with a lot of the uh information that gets put out there is that what happens is people grind and they sacrifice a T and then they get rich and then they have a different Demand on their time and then they extrapolate and they give advice of their current setting to people who are not in their current context which is
(11:38) try why I try to spend a lot of time with people who are making their first 10K first 100K first million dollar a month so I can I can remember what it's like to be at each of those levels so that can make sure that what I'm saying is contextual to the current constraint of the business that you're in and I'll give you a super tactical example of this in companies that we still to this day who do tens and hundreds of millions of dollars in revenue is that I know just just like you do if I get a green textt that clearly is from a you know a
(12:03) chat interface for a sales rep or an automation I'm way less likely to respond if I get an iMessage I'm an Apple user and so I know that this is a real person on the other side and so what do you think I have our sales teams do do we use the interface or do we do the unscalable yes guess what we send a personalized voice note we send a personalized video we send it via iMessage from a personal phone now does it mean that they have to have a personal phone no I don't need use their phone I can buy them an iPhone again
(12:31) there's leverage there's leverage in the beginning you're like what am I going to do buy everyone an iPhone well eventually yes but in the beginning you don't have money and that's okay but you think that something isn't scalable because you don't have the context from which to scale it but if you had unlimited money and unlimited Talent you absolutely could scale it and so just don't use that as the excuse to not do the thing that you know would work better because you have to be more efficient per lead per opportunity when
(12:56) you're small and so you have to pull out all the stops Gary Halper has this amazing story about this he says whenever I want to write a sales letter I imagine that I can only write one letter for my life or I'm going to die and so he says if I he starts with that hypothetical Max saying if that's what I had to do what would I do he's like well first I would have a handwritten envelope that I'd handr write the name on it I'd have a stamp that I would lick and put on it on the inside would be a handwritten letter from me and then the
(13:23) words themselves would be all these things and I'd have some lumpy thing in there and he starts at the hypothetical extreme because if you only have enough money to send a 100 letters then [ __ ] handr write all of them right now over time you're like okay this worked how do I scale it but guess what now you've got the sales from you writing a 100 letters and guess what you have the skill of writing a 100 of those letters and all of a sudden you start develop a system for how you write those letters and you
(13:46) expand your capacity to 500 letters and you 5x your income and you're like okay now what are the elements that of my unscalable solution that had the highest effect or impact on the throughput well 80% of the stuff uh didn't have as much of the impact this 20 % did I can use cash from my earlier less scalable thing to create more leverage in the more scalable thing and get 80% of the effect and 10 times the output so it still makes sense and so you always are going to lose efficiency at scale but the question is in the beginning start with
(14:15) the absolute most efficient process and this is fundamentally the opportunity for all starting or smaller businesses when I say small business I'm saying 10 million and under all right so don't get your get your ego all up like I'm a seven figure ENT I don't give a [ __ ] the point is is that you're not you're not Apple you're not A3 trillion company you're not Microsoft right so you can do things that they can't that is the advantage of the small business and that is why there will always be small businesses because they can do things
(14:40) that big businesses can't because they don't scale but the fact that they don't scale 100% is 100% your opportunity to beat them if you're not doing this it's like getting dealt pocket aces and then choosing to fold because you're saying I can't have pocket aces on every single turn because my next turn I might not get it and so I have to not use them now you have them in this chapter so use them use what you've got the first rule of Entrepreneurship use what you have and if you have an advantage if you're the small fish then that's the advantage
(15:12) you play now become a midf fish then you have other advantages you have resources you have a little bit of reputation and you use those resources to leverage up so now that I've talked about scaling the unscalable hopefully you're sold on that concept there's two Frameworks that I introduce you one is the sales to delivery Continuum and understanding the dynamic between both polls and secondly the done for you done with you do it yourself pyramid so the first thing is is understanding something that I called
(15:37) in uh the offers book the sales to fulfillment Continuum and basically the sales to fulfillment Continuum states that the easier something is to sell the harder it is to fulfill in general now the only main exception of this is technology but when it comes to Services uh it's usually if it's really easy to sell it means hey I'll do everything for you no matter what very easy to sell very easy to make that promise very hard to deliver on that promise now the other side of that is that if I said hey you have to do it all yourself then that's
(16:07) something that's very hard to sell uh but very easy to deliver on and so what I find interesting is that the vast majority of people who are starting businesses try to start on the thing that's the hardest to sell and I think they have it wrong I think they have it backwards and in my career I've had basically the the exact opposite uh perspective or approach to starting a business or starting a new product line and so if you're a business owner I would think about this when you're thinking about selling a new product or
(16:32) starting a new level of service and if you're someone who's new then this is going to be starting from zero to selling the first thing now the second framework around this the first is the sales to fulfillment Continuum the second is the order in which you attack it and so the way that I recommend doing this is following what I call you know like the Tesla Model which is you start at the top of the pyramid with the most expensive thing first this is typically done for you so this is very easy to sell very hard to fulfill and that's
(16:58) okay because in the beginning you don't have that many customers you don't have that much lead flow and so you want to maximize the revenue per customer now in addition to that it also sets you up to go Downstream later because you will get the highest percentage of people the best results with done for you the difficulty is that it's more difficult to scale comma and that's okay because again we're starting out and when you do this you develop the Sops you develop the products underneath of that larger product that allow you to productize the
(17:26) service that you're ultimately going to deliver later and so imagine you take on I'll use an agency as a simple example here if I took on uh agency clients and I did everything turned Key Well I'm going to start developing Sops for lead maget developing Sops for ads I'm going start developing Sops for landing pages and upsell pages and email followup all of these things are things that I'm going to have to develop Sops for now once I have all of these systems in place guess what happens next you go from the top of the pyramid to the
(17:51) second layer of the pyramid which goes from done for you to done with you now done with you you can typically charge a fraction of or less than what you charge for done for you sometimes a third of the price a fifth of the price but by doing that you've productized a great degree of the service and then you switch from a service provider to a Consulting relationship where you're helping someone do it themselves but you're still there to assist and so that's kind of in between the total not even handholding it's hand doing to hand
(18:17) holding to No Hands touching right which is do it yourself at the end and the thing is is imagine the opposite version of this a branding perspective you've positioned yourself you've price anchored the most expensive version of your service that has the highest results with the best customers and so you already have this strong Association at the top of the pyramid which then allows you to go and say Hey listen I have you know 10 private clients they all you know pay me $10,000 a month to do whatever it is and I have a lot of
(18:43) you guys who are asking me but you don't necessarily qualify for my Private Client Service and so I decided to take all the stuff that I have for my Private Client Service and make it available to you and I'll help you walk through the process that I walk through with them but instead of me doing it you could do it for yourself but I will be there every step of the way and by offering that you are able to sell 10 times the amount of people because the amount of handholding in terms of support that you have to offer is on10th of you literally
(19:06) doing it now from there again you say hey there's a lot of people who know my private clients they can't necessarily afford that and they can't afford this thing but they have they're enterprising and they want to take things on their own and so I take all the Sops and stuff and I will give them to you so you can just follow along and do it on your own and that's one10 or you know oneir of the price of my done with you and so I prefer the top down approach to the bottom up approach cuz let's play it the other way hey I've got this really cheap
(19:33) thing right that I've been selling to everybody and I have you know everyone in their in their and their mother takes it now I'm going to start helping you through it now to be fair I don't think there's anything necessarily wrong with that it's just that if I had a preference between which one I would prefer to build I'm going to have the least operational uh drag at the top because I have the fewest number of customers and then I have more customers and then I have the most customers and as I move my way down the pyramid it
(19:57) gets harder and harder to sell but my skill in sales improves right because I'll know the customers I'll talk to them I'll spend time with them and so my messaging can improve and get better and better all right that's what I had that's my money message of the day is that scale the unscalable start there stop being stop being brok and not busy and uh get busy and you won't be broke for long and if you like this then I have a whole video that breaks down all my business lessons from 13 years in business which you can watch next

Transcript:
(00:00) every business needs to solve each of these four problems in in order to make more money and scale and the first of those problems is figuring out the customer that you're actually going to serve and in talking to many of you the issue is you have no idea and that's okay because in the beginning you need to sell everyone because you have no money and they have a pulse and a credit card and you only require one of those things and so you ask them for their credit card so that you can pay your bills so you can actually make your
(00:33) business work and that's okay and that's normal and that's expected but when you keep taking every single Tom Dick and Harry who can give you you know a third down today and I'll pay you when I get paid and and everything else they're like hey do you think you could you know give me the world and you're like I could give you two worlds and you're they're like awesome here's my credit card again Bill me on the fifth that's when I get paid right and you deal with all of these bad customers and you promise the world which is normal in the
(00:58) beginning because there's only you and you maybe can help this person in a completely unscalable way and that's what you should do because you just need to generate income you need to generate Word of Mouth you need to help people out cool but there comes a point and it's usually around a million bucks a year sometimes three million bucks a year where the operational complexity of the business becomes really tough because now you've got a lot of different customers that all have different needs that have different
(01:21) Promises at different price points that you've sold and they're still just you and so this process is the sticking point this this is sticking point number one what you have to do is you have to learn how to say no to people who are not the ideal customer and if you're like well I don't know who my deal a customer is that is the problem and so you take all of the customers that you have that you have sold over your entire history and then you look at them and you say which of these people do I love okay column one which of these people have spent the most money column two
(01:56) which of these people did I have the highest operational profit from column three column four which of these was the easiest to deliver on and so you look at these different list and you're like huh are there any common themes are there are there any people who are in two or three of those columns I really like them they made me a lot of money and it was really easy to deliver the thing huh well that's weird because that's not the main thing that I sell but I guess I have sold a few of those huh well if you were
(02:26) to then take that concept and say well if 10% % of my customers are in this really ideal bucket what if I had 100% of my customers that were just like that so you take the same amount of customers you currently have but they were all just that customer if you do the math again you usually make five to 10 times more money and the cool part about that process is that it doesn't require more infrastructure you already have the infrastructure to service that number of customers you're just servicing the wrong people because you haven't learned
(02:55) to say no yet and so one of the most attractive things in marketing and sales is saying I don't need your money because it makes everybody want you more and so what you do to harness this is you tell everybody you actually don't want to sell that you actually don't want to sell them and crazy I know and then you let the people who are the right type of person because they're like oh I'm not that I'm not that hate those people too oh and you say but if you just happen to be this perfect unicorn that has these two three four traits I can absolutely change your life in this very specific way that means a
(03:27) lot to you and they're like wow sounds like this ads just for me and that's exactly what I want and guess what happens now once you make that kind of change in messaging you attract more of that right type of customer you can now charge the premium price even at the more operationally efficient and product High service level because now you're doing the same thing for every single customer so you get better at doing it so you get higher percentage success rates you do it at higher margins because you both have higher price and lower cost for doing this and this is
(03:57) how you solve problem number one but you have to learn how to say no and most people literally never learn and so I get I have had this conversation so many times that I want to shout it into a microphone which is what I'm doing right now okay so that's how you solve problem number one problem number two that I see businesses get stuck at where they're in Rocking a hard place they're like I don't know what to do it's two sides of the same problem you either charge too little or you pay too much and I want to put caveats around this I'm a big believer in hiring great
(04:38) talent I'm a big believer in bringing good people in absolutely but if you want to have a frozen yogurt store and you want to pay the people behind the counter 20% of Revenue each your business will not make money if I'm lying I'm dying if you have a physical therapy where you at Physical Therapy Clinic and you give 50% of Revenue to every one of your people tough to scale that was somebody here you have to nail the individual model where you can make enough money at full capacity and so which is going to trickle into problem three but you get into this position where like wait I
(05:23) realize now that I can't give profit shares to every single person I specifically can't give Revenue shares to all these people or my salesman can't make more than I do right in the business and maybe they do in the beginning but at scale they shouldn't be able to more than the owners right then you have something that's that's mismatched and so you have to have these moments because otherwise business owners will stay in this Lane for years because they'll just say like well if I if I tell them I have to change their comp then I'm going to lose them and I'm like yeah and if you don't you'll never
(05:57) grow so which one do you want to do and so that the the the nefarious part about each of these problems is that they have a appearing impossible issues with each one of them with the first one you're like well I can't say no to money because I need the money in order to pay my bills but by saying yes to people who aren't the ideal customer then I will never be able to grow this business because I won't be able to charge the premium prices get the best customers have the operational margin that I need
(06:21) in order to expand and so all of these are Rock and Hard Place problems but you have to have the intestinal fortitude and this is why your lifestyle as your competitor's opportunity what you require to live on is what prevents you from being aggressive in the business to make the best decision of the business because the business doesn't care like the ideal perfect version of your business exists you just have a number of steps that you have to take to get there and the people who get there faster are the ones who are willing to stomach uncomfortable conversations low profit months and a
(06:51) hit on their lifestyle for extended periods of time and so you being able to be aggressive with your lifestyle when I say aggressive I mean being able to live on very little espe especially when you're in that 1 three 5 million a year range allows you to take bigger risks think longer because you're like okay we're going to change this thing well I've got 100 Grand saved up and so I can stomach a year if I need to take nothing out so that we can make this pivot because this what's right for the business now and more specifically this
(07:20) is right for the business for the next five years and so rocking hard place so if you're with the I have all these employees and they're all compensated in correctly you have to sit down and you have to say hey guys and this is how I deal with all really hard conversations I just tell the truth I messed up I said that I was going to help you guys grow with this business I said we were going to do these big things but based on the decisions that I made because I'm a numbnuts I mispriced your compensation and because of that I'll never be able
(07:52) to give you career growth I'll never be able to reinvest in you I'll never be able to the opportunity to open new locations or move up in this business because this business will not grow based on how this works but if you're willing to go on this ride with me and change how compensation works and to be clear I'm taking nothing so like you work every month and you still get a paycheck I work every month and I get poor that's the difference so I just want to be clear I'm in this ride with you and I'm Tak I'm not ask you to do
(08:16) something I'm not willing to do but if you're willing to go on this ride with me for six months maybe 12 months we're going to have opportunities to be 10 times bigger than this because be right for the business but you have to have that talk otherwise you will be stuck in this well if they leave then I won have a business and some of them will leave and guess what skill you get to develop now the ability to recruit Talent with your new compensation structure with your new vision of what's going to happen in their lives along with your
(08:40) business so that's the second problem and the second sticking point and each of these are just these levels that people just go around and they just stay stuck for years this part 2B of that one is not charging enough and so this is the this is how it presents hey my business is at full capacity my business is at full capacity and uh we're not making that much money and so I think I need to open a new location or I need to add another product line when this is the core thing of the business if the core thing of the business at capacity even at a small level of capacity like if you have one rep that
(09:24) can handle 10 people for your agency or you have one physical therapist who can handle 50 patience it doesn't matter there's going to be some ratio of of cost of goods sold and what you what you charge and then you have other costs associated administrative and fixed cost whatever and there's going to be a a point of capacity with that small unit where if you're still not making money the business model is flawed and so either you need to find a way to dramatically decrease the cost that you have to deliver which sometimes it's the compensation of the employee team if it's way off or oftentimes it's just
(10:00) you're charging too little and you just and there's all these ethical things of like I feel like an impostor and I'm like dude you're not an impostor you're broke you only get impostor syndrome when you pretend to be something you're not like I get this question all the time like I feel like an impostor for charging that much money you only feel like an imposter because you're lying if you like I had a an a agency owner yesterday who said I had an agency I got to 150 clients and I have a really good client getting system
(10:30) um but that that business stalled because I didn't know how to operate um and so it kind of like crashed and burned but I knew how to get customers for my agency really really well he's like but I feel like an impostor charging for that system and I was like why and I was like is it because you're pretending you were a really successful agency owner he was like yeah I was like well then why don't you just tell the truth and say I got 150 customers despite not knowing anything about running an agency because
(11:00) the system's really good I suck at operating and so for that reason I'm just going to give you the system and you can figure out how to operate the business I was like I still believe you and then you don't feel like [ __ ] he was like oh I guess I can just tell the truth and so the whole impostor Sy around charging if fundamentally if someone like you will only have that if you're misrepresenting something if a customer wants to pay you for something and you have the thing and they're willing to exchange it's voluntary not holding a gun to them it's exchange
(11:30) that's how capitalism works you have a thing they want the thing and there's a price that they're willing to pay for it if they're willing to pay for it phenomenal like that's capitalism we want and so we try and do it as many times as we can and so the idea of like having ethics around price is ridiculous if they're will and you don't want to sell out of your wallet either there if you're broke but somebody the thing that you provide provides a lot of value to a specific person then you charge based on the value not based on what's in your wallet if you're broke and you're like
(11:53) this really would help me it's like cool it'll probably help them even more and if it just happens to help you that's how capitalism works both parties say thank you so part 2B if you're at full capacity and you're not making money you often need to just charge more for the thing you have and if people say no fine guess what you get to learn how to sell better and that's a skill that if you want to build this big business you're going to have to learn anyways so you might as well face that boss now instead of just forever being in this like I guess I
(12:24) need to expand this business that already doesn't work but I don't have the money to expand because the business doesn't work right and so this is impossible place that you spend for years and years where's my phone I wrote them down I should know them all but um sometimes I forget things so let's see what do we think problem number four is or number three is oh that actually leads perfectly so I remembered it before I pulled it up for the record uh the third problem that every business has to solve is not getting over your
(12:56) skis not overexpanded okay so problem two often leads to problem three is that you're not making up in the core business so you say great I'll do more of this but more in that instance is more of the wrong thing like a little bit isn't working let's try a lot right you're scaling you're scaling the problems not the solution and so right glad that one hit um and so and so the idea and this H this happens most frequently I want to say most frequently with brick and mortar because it's such a clear unit where you're like I have one location
(13:33) that's doing mediocre but I want to have a big Fran like I can't tell you the number of times I talk to local businesses who have this issue and it's mostly because we have this ego thing around growing revenue and so a lot of you guys are like and I say what's your goal it's like I want to go from 1 million to 3 million I from 3 million to 10 million I want from 10 million to 30 million whatever it is right like everybody's got this big number goal and so what happens is you make the goal the thing that you focus on but when the
(13:56) goal is an output you then get weird about in puts because you try and make the output occur rather than thinking I have to fix this model where once I get the inputs clear I Jam as many high quality inputs into it and then Revenue occurs revenue is a consequence not a goal and so the inputs that we put in the system so when we make what we're going to do for Content we talk about how many pieces of content we're going to make what the schedule that content is what's the checklist we're going to follow that will increase the likelihood
(14:26) that these video views go to the right people and get the most of them to see it if we hit 100 million like who like not who cares of course we care but what will it change about what we do all we know is that it'll just give us feedback to change our inputs but if you make me hitting this number and not attach it to what you have to do then you start building really stupid things and so this is the classic internet marketer who scales too fast for their course business this is the agency who just takes on lots of clients because they want to hit this Revenue goal or the brick-and mor business owner who opens up a second location when their
(15:04) first one isn't even working and so it's like they want to get to they want to get to three so fast that they'll never get to 10 and so we did that little thing earlier where if you build you know a building as fast as you possibly can you can't add more on top of it it just breaks the foundation's not there and so often times the fastest way to $100 million business is slower to 10 but faster from 50 to 100 and so if you can actually have that perspective you won't care if it takes you three years to get the single location right because
(15:39) once it's dialed then when you copy paste it it works and so the big thing that's missing when you're doing the overexpansion thing I'll tell you what the core issue is it's who you sell too many people too fast before you hire train good enough people to backfill and then you get too many people in with not enough talent but you have bodies and not brains and so now you have to keep selling more people to manage your overhead of all these dumb people that you haven't Heen the time to train and they're dumb because of
(16:15) outputs and the reason that they're dumb is because you didn't train them and the real dummy is you because either you weren't patient enough to interview more people or you weren't patient enough to train them but both of them are your fault so you get get overexpanded because you have this arbitrary goal that was around growth and not Quality quality creates growth growth creates bloat so if you make growth the goal bloat is what occurs if you make quality the goal growth occurs as a result so make getting better the goal and then you will get bigger if you make bigger the goal you'll get bigger and
(16:51) you'll get worse and so when I hear the many problems that come here often times you're over your skis you over extended you have too many people and not enough smarts and so rocking hard place I have to keep selling these customers so I can cover this overhead but my reputation is getting worse and worse and worse because I can't deliver on the promises but I have to keep making the promises so I can pay my bills and that's where your lifestyle comes into play again you're like I made a goof up I need to decrease my lifestyle I'm going to stop taking money
(17:22) out of the business and I need to have some hard conversations and I probably need to work overtime for a while the thing is is that the over time isn't like a week or a month sometimes it's years and it's tough you know like it's it's tough you give up weekends over and over and over and over and over again it's not like you give up weekends you just have you don't remember the last time you took one right and so I say this out of care but like it you have to be like the hardest part of being in business is that you will
(17:56) always encounter these Rock and hardplay scenarios because you don't know everything and until you've been there you're like this is all going great until it's not and then you realize you're whoopsy and so I think your willingness to endure the pain of undoing your poor decision is what will get you out of the long-term pain faster but the short-term pain is way worse and so and this is where the Growing Pains come in because let's say you do pull it back you stop selling as many new customers so that you can focus more on training the team up interviewing new
(18:29) candidates maybe even having to pay them more because they're more qualified because they come in with some knowledge that you don't have profit starts to drip starts to dip so what do you do well you know that if you keep going on this path and you do fix delivery you do fix churn all of a sudden you can't get your head back out of water because now you're selling people in they staying and all of a sudden you're starting to get referrals again because word of mouth is picking up and then all of a
(18:53) sudden your profit goes back from negative to neutral to up to your previous Max but it just keeps going again and then you get excited and you make another dumb mistake and then you have to repeat the process again and so the thing is is like the entrepreneurial growth pass the pain of it is the big mess ups you realize you make that you then get into the Rock and heart situation and most people can't make a decision so they just straddle it and stay in the mediocre middle destroy the reputation and stay stagnant for years
(19:23) and so you have to like whatever that hard sticking place you're at is is you just have to confront it as fast as human possible and so it's like I always would rather have intense short-term pain rather than very long-term pain of not living up to what I think I can do so that's sticking point number three number four I will say this until I'm blew in the face but the fourth problem that every business owner has to conquer is focus and what is so nefarious about Focus it's so sneaky because we are rewarded as entrepreneurs for taking a leap of faith for taking a jump when there's nothing there and then something
(20:09) starts to work and so that's such a rewarding experience you go from complete control to complete Freedom well technically you go back to control again but I won't get into that and in that moment you're like this was the best decision of my entire life and the problem is that you should never do it again because what happens is you reinforce such a strong Loop where you're like man and then when this gets hard like my job was you then think oh I'll do the same thing I did last time I'll switch I'll try something new and
(20:40) then that'll be exciting and new just like a your relationship and then all of a sudden you get out of the honeymoon phase and you realize oh there's problems in this business too and then you're like oh I'll do it worked that other time it still worked half of the time and so then you jump again but the reason that it's so nefarious besides the fact that it's encoded in your DNA from being an entrepreneur from quitting your first thing to do this to begin with is that every time it looks different and that's why Focus is so tough and there's always a very strong
(21:09) argument for why you should do the new opportunity and that's why by the way as a sales pitch new opportunity is a great way to sell because it's so hard to have the discipline to be like nope I'm just going to keep doing the thing that I've been doing for 10 years and I know the good and I know the bad but I know them both and I know where I'm deficient and I just need to do these things better for the next six months and if I just do those things better we will grow by 50% and here's the fun fact about this is that once you get to a million a month 5 million a month 10 million a month 100
(21:46) Grand a month whatever going from that to 50% more a lot easier than going from zero to whatever number you were just at so if you have your current thing you forget how much you've learned about what you're in you're in there for 3 years 5 years however many years you've been in real estate right a lot and we forget about it but this other thing has all of these booby traps all over it right this lady in the in the red dress has chlamidia she's got Daddy Issues she's got an ex-boyfriend with with a gun who who stalks her right you don't know yet because she presents the same CU anybody in a first day can
(22:25) look good anybody on one sheet it's like hey my buddy's making a killing on this right and he's like oh yeah I married her sister didn't tell you about the baggage right it's that's part of it and that's why the focus part is so tough and I had to Define Focus for myself and I'll Define two words for you because it's helpful for me so one is commitment what is commitment a lot of you guys are like I'm committed commitment is the elimination of Alternatives very simple and so if you want to become more committed you
(22:57) eliminate alternatives and so uh there's an old story of this where the uh where the the football coach asks one of the kids on the football team uh out to breakfast and so you know they're sitting there having a good time talking about his game talking about his future he says you know I'd like to play college ball and he's like I think you could I think you could play college ball he's like but you might not too and he's like well what do I have to do he's like well it depends he like depends on what he leans in he's like are you interested are you committed
(23:31) he's likew I'm I'm committed he's like I don't know if you are he says you see your plate and he's got eggs and he's got ham on his plate he says the chicken the chicken's interested he's like the pig the pig's committed and the point there is that in order for that breakfast to occur the chicken keep having eggs over and over and over again but that pig only has one breakfast at serving and so the same way is that we have have to eliminate Alternatives it's what we like the the word decision comes from Latin diader which means to literally cut off or to kill off and so
(24:06) the idea is what are what are you killing today what really juicy incredibly sexy opportunity that you know you could crush you turn down today because you made a commitment and I've I've I've been thinking a lot about the decisions of my life that have had the biggest return and the more I thought about this the more I think that actually I'll read this I'll read this to you because I think it might it might come across better that way so I wrote this down um earlier today which is the best diet is the one you follow
(24:45) the best person to marry is the one you stay with the best business is the one you stick with the thing that makes it the best isn't the thing itself it's our commitment to it and so there 's a lot of different diets that work if you stick with it there's a lot of different businesses that will work for you if you stick with it but none of the diets will work if you don't and none of the businesses will work either and I think it's a very good framework there's a perfect diet for you that's perfectly measured and would get you the absolute fastest results but if you do not stick with it
(25:19) it won't happen ever and so it's not about the actual intricacies of the diet it's about your willingness to stick it out and so when you listen to basos and you listen to to Steve Jobs and you listen to Sam Alman who was in charge of YC before he started open AI they talk about this one thing and they're like you know the more I've thought about it it's just persistence it's just being willing to stay the course Despite All Odds despite the many shiny objects that come your way and just say I get it no so
(25:51) commitment is the elimination of Alternatives and I measure focus by the number and quality of things I say no to and so if you want to give yourself a r reward cycle which I like to do because the hardest of these ones that I struggle with is focus is that every time I say no I give myself a mental point it's like I I'm focused I'm making an active decision to stay focused because I know that if I just only stay focused like it's hard to imagine a guy or a gal who's an entrepreneur and does just one business for 50 years and consistently has the hard conversations
(26:24) and just says I'm going to get better I'm going to keep learning I'm not going to repeat the same mistake and they do that for 50 years and doesn't become unbelievably successful it's hard to imagine a world where that would exist and so we have this blank check from the universe that says I guarantee that you will be successful no matter what if you do one thing which is you just say no to everything else and so when I have these conversations the woman in the red dress always presents differently and that's why she's so sneaky and there's always a
(26:55) very legitimate reason why you could make money with it and the reality is you could but you can't do two things you can't be CEO of two businesses you can own multiple businesses but I'm going to be real with you you don't you're CEO of both and you're running everything right no no no I've skilled myself out of the day today so if something happens in the business what happens my phone rings right you're not out of the day to-day if you buy a share of Apple you're out of the dayto day all right you're an owner and so use that as your litmus test do I own this business
(27:29) or does business own me if it owns you then you're a CEO welcome to business right and so there's this big misnomer between I'm an owner and I'm a CEO and a lot of people say I'm a small business owner but you really don't own the business for a very long time like until you get to 1020 million a year very tough to own a business the business owns you comma that's okay because what else you g to do right you're G to work anyways so you have to be on the path but I think it's good to have Clarity around that because the amount of times
(27:56) it's like I've got this new opportunity vehicle and people always quote my story back to me they're like hey but you had the jibs and then you started doing the turnaround business yeah I was 26 and before that I had nine businesses and I made no money and so this was a big Improvement for me right but the real question is not did it work but was there an alternative that would have also worked which is if I had just stuck with gyms being super real at this point in my life I probably have two or 3 hundred locations probably worth the same amount of money I'm now and so there's the fallacy of
(28:32) success which is if I do this thing it will work and the fact that it works meant that it was the right call but you can have multiple outcomes that lead you to where you want to go but when you straddle multiple is where you guarantee that you'll never get there and I'm just saying this and I'm trying to beat this into ground because one I'm shouting at me mostly but also because it's probably a third of the conversations I have on a regular basis and the crazy thing is that all the problems I just said have
(29:05) nothing to do with I need more leads I need to learn how to sell better I need to follow my leads faster you know I'm not retaining customers none of that these are the things that get you stuck these are very easy problems to solve Market more do more reps on the sales reach out faster these are not complicated things but it's all this crap that we stay stuck in because we stay in these Rock and Har Place scenarios which are the real core issues and the last problem bonus that I see on a regular basis that walks through these doors is you have a
(29:40) product and you don't have a business so you sell One widget one time to one person there's no backend there's no upsell there's no recurring there's no Revenue retention that's from the strict definition of a business it makes money so it is technically a business but it is not an asset that is valuable and so that's something that you will consistently have to put inputs into rather than it be self- sustaining and so I've always been in the go you know in the world and probably you are too we're like I will solve any problem no
(30:14) matter how complex once but I don't like having to solve them the same thing over and over and over and over again but when you're in that business you have to just keep doing the same thing over and over again and the day that you stop is the day that it dies which really just means that it's an amplified version of you in terms of a job which again is fine but I would rather build an asset that I can own rather than just a slightly fancy or higher leverage job for myself if I can afford to do it and so when you're
(30:46) thinking about this with your business to be clear it's selling a better or extra version or recurring version of whatever your thing is so that people will buy again now there are businesses where it is reoccurring rather than recurring Coca-Cola doesn't have M subscription but they know that I buy and I will buy again and so if people are not buying your product again then figure out why and if your business is one that doesn't lend itself to that at all that's one where I would say look at the other businesses that are super billion doll businesses in your space that what have they solved that you
(31:23) haven't and then that becomes your path and if there is no business that is in your space that sells that one thing that's very big not all businesses are worth owning and you might think wait Alex I thought that I had to stick with the hard thing and so the fundamental this is the a different Rock and Hard Place is one of the qu essential questions of Entrepreneurship is do I push or do I pivot and so nine times out a 10 you have to push it just means I have a problem that I don't know how to solve and if you have a problem that you can at least Define the problem then you can try and solve
(31:59) it if you have an issue that the market fundamentally like wedding rings if you can only sell one wedding ring and you have no desire to create more wedding rings and you're not a jeweler then it's probably not the right business for you now the caveat there is that there's probably a jeweler who that is the perfect business for and loves doing all sorts of wedding rings and then also gets into the girls rings and gets into multiple rings and and you know expounds from that because they have a specific Avatar they can serve so there's a version of this business that
(32:30) could work but businesses don't die entrepreneurs fade entrepreneurs lose their Sizzle they lose their love of the business and so one of the things that has helped me stay in love with businesses that I have for longer periods of time and I've had to learn these disciplines because that's what it takes to stick with something for a very long time and if I know that sticking with something for a very long time is what's required to to build this very big thing that I want to do then I better learn that skill and so learning to relove new things in the business which I like to frame as what
(33:07) do I not know how to do and so I love personal development I think that entrepreneurship is one of the best paths to making yourself better because you have such a quantitative measure of saying did you improve and so simply saying I don't know how to rather than this business won't work because is a much more empowering frame so rather than say hey this business won't work because the market doesn't like my stuff you say I don't know how to Market my stuff this business won't work because no one can sell like I can no I don't
(33:41) know how to get someone else to sell like I can that's solvable and so simply reframing what I believe to be problems that I cast onto the universe is things that I cannot change where I plac the finger of blame you flipped to the thumb of accountability and say this is a skill deficiency and because it is mine I can change it and so thinking about things from that perspective has really helped me be able to fall in love with the game of business because I can constantly feel and see myself objectively get better these are skills
(34:12) I didn't have and now I do have this I couldn't focus on anything for more than six months at the very beginning of my career I'm more add than you I promise I have no direct reports zero can't manage people I don't have the skill the question is what return do I get on learning everything that ilila has well she spent the last decade doing it so that's not going to be a good return on my time and so but for her to try and learn all the acquisition and marketing stuff that I know is going to not be a good return on her time and so that's how we divide things up and so I can go
(34:42) deeper and better on mine and that's how you start filling out the holes in a business because fundamentally every business operates I'm trying to give a non- bodybuilding example um but you need every component of a car to work right like is the wheel more important than the engine you need both if you don't have an engine the car doesn't move you don't have wheels the car doesn't move you don't have a chassis there is no car right like there's there's these these core components that have to exist but once you have those things if you have better grip on the tires the car will go faster if you have more
(35:24) cylinders in there I don't know the car analogies but you get the idea if you have faster the car goes faster and so you can still have components that can get emphasized but for the business to work you have to have all the pieces to go from zero to one but from one to n it's how many of these things are we emphasizing and that's where you can double down on things but being able to say the problem with this business is that this is the issue we can't get this engine needs to be a 16 cylinder and it's an 8 cylinder okay so I either have to learn how to build a 16 cylinder
(35:57) engine or I got to find somebody who does or I got to buy a 16 cylinder engine from somebody else right but those that's how you have to approach it and so continually relearning that process has helped me stick with things because I don't feel like I'm in the same business anymore I feel like every six months I'm in a completely different business because the problems I'm solving are different and so I'll leave you with this one last thought which is that number one I genuinely believe if you love the business or space that you're in you can take any business to 100 million I like I want to challenge somebody to
(36:29) tell me like a business they can't take $200 million a year I think you can absolutely take any business $200 million a year the second thing is that when you scale any business no matter the market at the highest level your day is the same you manage a handful of very intelligent people who do their jobs on your behalf with lots of Leverage that's the end result of all of these businesses whatever business you're in and so if you're in that spot where you're like I don't like the business I'm in you're going to get to the same spot in a different business
(37:00) that you also won't like you have to beat the boss so that you can eventually get to the place where fundamentally you're going to have a head of marketing you're going to have have have a head of sales you're going to have an IT head you're going to have a head of legal you're going to have a head of Finance you're going to have a head of Ops and customer success every business has it different words for different Industries but fundamentally those are the components and so if you see that as the natural extreme that's going to occur in any business the idea of switching
(37:25) businesses because you want to avoid what the natural stream will be is ridiculous because if you succeed all roads lead there and so that is one of my antidotes for a weight I should switch because my day-to-day what I actually do will not change and neither will yours and so you have to push through you have to confront the fact that it will suck and you have to undo mistakes and when you undo mistakes it hurts extra bad but the alternative is you never fix the mistake you ever grow which I think is the larger mistake
(37:54) overall so those are the big five that people get in the rocking hard place for business I see these every single time I I have these conversations over and over again and everyone thinks that their situation is unique that they can't raise prices because their Market is special right they they can't change the compensation because everyone will leave yep and they're going to leave eventually anyway so you might as well learn how to fix it now and they think that in order to hit the goal like they have to keep selling even though they're overextended they have no one to help them you're right keep doing that
(38:29) forever tell me how that works right each of these problems feels in the moment less bad to keep doing it but what you have to do is confront it and that's the boss that you have to beat at that level so thank you guys for much for the ads hope you guys enjoyed the uh Workshop appreciate you and then

Transcript:
(00:00) this is exactly what I did to make my first $10,000 online and I'm going to walk you through how I got my first 10 customers what I did right what I did wrong so that you can copy me so I had always been into fitness from the time I was 13 14 years old I was already lifting weights and was really into it in college was the vice president of the powerlifting team and then I had my consulting job and I talked about Fitness all day long I read articles all day and so much so that the people I worked with were like dude if you don't get into fitness will front you the money to do this because you don't stop
(00:29) talking about it and so I enough people around me that I was like okay maybe I am going to do this and so that's what created the free training project and so the idea was I would ask people to donate $500 to $1,000 to the charity of their choice and an exchange I would train them for 3 months for free it was free because they didn't pay me but they still had to donate to something they cared about but the thing that really made it click for me where I was like you know I'm going to do something here
(00:51) is that there was this lady at my gym named Sandy Smith and she saw me working out and I was on the powerlifting team in my local area and I was competing and I had other guys who were competing there too and it was clear that we knew we were doing something well so she asked me cuz I looked the least intimidating because I was the most jacked that's why I looked the least intimidating she said hey can you help me with my food and I was like sure and she said well meet me at uh a pizza shop and you can talk to me about my food which is just hilarious I meet her at
(01:19) the pizza shop and we talked for like an hour and a half about you know it's like hey try buy these things instead of that you know maybe get more protein in this is the stuff that I like I walk through everything and I was happy to do it cuz I just like talking about Fitness stuff and at the the end of the conversation she reaches down to her purse and she puts her purse on the table and then she reaches in and she grabs her checkbook and she writes a $100 check to me and the check was literally this big it was
(01:42) a clown check and I was like why are you a clown why am I a clown is this a joke to you is this my passion something that means nothing no I'm kidding none of that was true but she wrote me a check for 100 bucks and she was like thanks so much and she slid it across the table and she gave it to me and then she walked out and I remember being like holy [ __ ] I can make money doing this I was like that's pretty cool and so that was like the light bulb moment for me to say like I'm going to actually go from this is a passion to I want to make this
(02:06) something I make profit from so there's four stages that I went through in order to get to my firstand customers so the first stage I started with was homies reach out to the people who know you and like you and so for me honestly all I did was I took out this amazing piece of technology which is my phone and then I looked through my contacts leads reached out to a handful of my friends and I got about six of them is to say yes I will let you me for free because we're friends and you need before and after pictures and that's pretty much all I did it wasn't really that hard because
(02:38) people knew that I loved Fitness and I just said I'll help you for free and be a homie and they said sure and so the reason I started with homie specifically was because I needed before and afters I needed testimonials I needed results cuz I figured if anybody was like me they would think well sure maybe you say that you can do that but why should I believe you and so I solved really over the top and this had it maybe I lucked into it the first time but I have done it with every single business I have ever started which is get proof before anything like if you have 100 pieces of proof and a terrible offer versus an
(03:10) amazing offer and no proof the guy with 100 pieces of proof is going to win you don't even need that many pieces of proof for people to believe you you need proof that is similar enough to them that they will believe that what you did for that person will also work for them and so the testimonials that I had I had one guy who lost 50 lb I had a girl who lost 50 lb I had a guy did like a recomposition he stayed the same weight but like looked crazy different afterwards and so that kind of like covered a handful of different avatars
(03:35) for me later now that wasn't on purpose that just kind of worked out to who responded to me and they all had different goals but it worked to show that I knew what I was doing after I had my homies this took me like six months so mind you it's like I will take three minutes in this video to explain it but it was six months of my life and if you're like man I want to get rich in six seconds that's amazing wait for stage four cuz I'll tell you how what I would have done differently to make this happen faster but the second step I did
(03:56) was I asked them for referrals referrals are the most important type of marketing for a variety of reasons number one referrals are free and so if you are poor great place to start number two referrals have higher likelihoods of buying at higher prices so that means you these leads are worth more than every other type of lead because they have a higher conversion rate and at higher prices which is Banger third reason that they're also more valuable leads is that people who come from referral are also more likely to refer
(04:26) and so the way that you come in is the more likely way that you will get somebody else to to come in for all those reasons referrals are sweet the big picture reason that referrals are so important when you're starting is that if you're not getting any it means you're not that good and so you don't want to let more people know you suck so instead you want to let as few people know that you suck until eventually people find out about how good you are which is the right thing then you can pour gas on the fire and do all the
(04:50) other ways of advertising and so for those of you who are starting out who are really just at the very beginning here then I want to give you what I wish I knew and believe it or not we're actually running this as a little experiment inside of school right now and the results are astounding I'm not going to share the stats yet but they're really really good we took the rule of 100 for warm outre and we've actually kind of like broken it down into something a three-step process that's really tactical uh they're calling it
(05:14) the rule of 300 and if you don't know what the rule of 100 is which I talk about in my$ 100 million leads book it's the fundamental process of applying 100 repetitions to any of these things so 100 warm out reaches means you need to reach out to people who know you mind you doesn't have to be your homies like you probably have 300 for you know friends on Facebook and 500 followers on Instagram or whatever all you know 300 people inside of your cell phone like those are all the people you know you reach out 101 to 100 plus cold prospects
(05:39) people who don't know you you spend 100 minutes making content and then you post that content to be clear you don't just spend 100 minutes making content and do nothing you post it and then finally you can spend $100 a day on ads at minimum all right that's how you get started obviously you can spend more on ads but you should spend at least 100 minutes making the ads researching looking at hooks recording Etc but if you do that every single day you will get customers because you will let people know that you exist now the rule of 300 it's
(06:01) really just taking the 100 the rule of 100 for warm Outreach and breaking it down into three steps so I'll break down all three for you right now so number one is you post content just make a post all right one piece on one platform very simple all right you don't need to over complicate this after you make the post you do 100 comments all right this is really big now the comments my recommendation is you do it inside of a group or Community now the reason that we do it inside of a group is that one it's going to be a pool of all of your ideal customers and the goal of the
(06:31) comments is to make the best comment all right so if you look at all the comments that are on someone when you make it as a comment inside of a group there's two benefits that you haven't might not have thought of one is that inside of a group you're not competing against everyone you're now just competing against everyone inside the group secondarily you're not competing against everyone even inside the group you're competing against everyone in the comments and so it makes you look like you're super good
(06:52) even though you're just this much better because you actually took a minute to make a comment rather than just like cool stuff or awesome right that's not going to do it you have to put out thoughtful response to each post now the posts that you do you should just use them as prompts so it should be a lot easier for you to come up with comments than to come up with content all right so that's the second step now the third step is that we now basically apply the rule of 100 to our new warm list you're
(07:17) like what's the new warm list so this is like a it's like lukewarm it's like right between cold and warm and so what it is is everyone who liked your post anyone who commented on your post and anyone who liked any of your comments now this is going to be a pretty big one or replied to your comment all right so that basically gives you four different sources to find the leads that you do your one-on-one Outreach so this should hopefully solve the big like who do I reach out these people these people and the reason we did this and this is key the reason that we go after these four
(07:55) people is because these four categories have all done one thing which changes them from strangers they have taken an action they've indicated interest and so the point of advertising which I Define in the leads book is to go from an unengaged lead which is just a person you can contact to an Engaged lead which is a person you can contact who has shown interest in the stuff that you sell or at least has shown interest in you with that this sounds really minor but it's huge you can then begin the conversation by saying hey saw you like
(08:30) my my content what about it drew you in or like what made you do that or oh that was so cool of you whatever hey I saw you commented or thanks for that comment and question right don't just say thanks for the comment that's not going to start a conversation you ask a question what made you do that are you looking to get in shape clean your house get organized whatever the thing your content was about hey I uh saw that you liked my comment are you looking to right and so anybody who's following the type of content that you're commenting on by the way duh comment on like if
(09:00) you're selling dog stuff comment on dog stuff don't comment on you know crypto make money stuff and try and find dog people now then again who knows but if I'm going to pick where I'm like if I'm going to pick where I'm going to make my comments I'm going to Target posts that already have the types of people that I want to sell to commenting and posting on it all right and then finally people who reply to your comment are going to probably be some of the warmest leads because they've already read the thing
(09:24) took the time to they already basically messaged you in a way by by replying to your comment so this if you think about this is like we only need a 100 if you make a post and you get 25 likes it's like boom there's my first 25 reach outs then I've got people who commented maybe I've got three or four comments okay there's another three or four then I make myund remember remember here so let's let's link these up so these two go to this and then these two go to this one let's see if I can cross the chasm
(09:50) here there so if you then do a 100 comments you're going to at least get a 100 likes or responses because if you actually take that much time the person who you even who made you made the post on will likely take the time to like your comment because they want to encourage other people to leave long thoughtful comments like that this is oneone Le gen for you not having any audience so it's gone like you have no more excuse this works and the results that we're getting are [ __ ] awesome which I'm really stoked about I'll share the stats later we're doing as a a big experiment and there's one more reason
(10:26) that I I think this is really sexy comments on a big post will get way more reach than your initial content especially if you're starting from zero because you basically get to piggyback on the reach that other people's content gets and so it's in a in a weird way it's almost like you running mini ads now to be clear you want to have thoughtful comments you don't want to say like buy my [ __ ] like that will one probably get you blocked by the person whose content it is but also you look like a shitthead so don't do that so you want to have a thoughtful response and
(10:56) this will take time to be clear like well how many hours a day will this take and notice I mentioned hours a day it'll probably take you two to four hours to do this every day but objective number one when you're starting out is let people know you exist because no one does so I asked my homies after getting them results so I provided Value First and I said hey man I've got your before and afters I need like a few more can you send me some friends that have seen your results and a lot of them had like
(11:22) people were telling them like dude you lost 50 lbs you look awesome or like hey you look you have a bikini now like you didn't even want to go outside without covering yourself up like this is great and so I got probably another 6 to 10ish referrals from those first six and a totally different thing happened here these people didn't know who I was they just knew that IID helped their friend out and these people cared way less about like helping me and cared way more about just helping them which unsurprising fine but the thing that
(11:46) happened was because it was free none of them really did anything and so that became a problem and so then I was like shoot that whole thing didn't work so then I moved on to stage three which was the free train TR in project and so that is the title that we owe this section to and so what I did was I said hey now when you refer someone just donate $500 to ,000 to the charity of your choice that way you still have skin in the game but it's still effectively free in that you're not paying me and so I was then
(12:14) public about it people were like this is awesome and then a lot of people came in to support the fact that I was kind of doing this for charity but long term I wanted to find a way to turn this into something that I can make money from and so the next phase of customers this gave me everything that I needed to then transition to paid and so from there I went to the skinny to swole project now publicly this was a year later and so this was where I asked new people to pay $200 a month for 12 weeks to go from
(12:42) skinny to swo and I had all these great transformation pictures from my friends from the people went through the free training project to then do skinny to swall and I was able to transfer and this is a key point I was able to transfer people from the free training project into skinny to swall Without Really losing many of them I just said hey you know how you paid for weeks to this charity want to pay me instead whatever you paid them and they were like sure I didn't really care because again all these people they came because their friends got results they were like
(13:08) this is weird that this guy's making me donate to a charity but I guess it's fine they just cared about getting in shape but that was me overcoming my own like fear of charging for making money and so that is when I got to my first 20 clients in skinny to swo which is me posting and then reaching out to everyone else I knew with all the testimonials from the first three stages to say hey I'm now officially launching this thing and I got 20 guys to pay $200 a month and that was my first $4,000 per month and that was for 12 weeks and that was my first 12 Grand now you might be like wait where's the so what what do I
(13:42) do if I'm you well let me tell you what I would have done if I knew everything that I know now so here's bonus number five I'll put little little stars around it what would I have done if I knew what I know now great so that's what this section is there are a lot of different businesses that you can potentially start the reason that I think for beginners starting an online service business is the easiest one to start is because it costs the least amount of money and it has a lot of good economics around it meaning it costs almost
(14:15) nothing to deliver there's low recurring overhead you can do it from any place in the world if you're watching this video you already have all the technology required and so like basically everything is there for you to start and you get to learn all of the mistakes that you're going to inevitably learn on a low stakes business first hey and I want to write you a check real quick and not just any kind of check but one that you can actually take to the bank and this is about starting a school Community the reason that I decided to
(14:46) become a co-owner and made a massive investment in school of the platform is because for four years I was looking for what is the easiest business online that I can help people get started because I have a massive amount of my audience are business owners that you do do one five 10 100 million plus a year and that's who watches my stuff and I have a lot of deeper content for really tactical stuff once you're at 20 employees 50 employees 100 employees 250 employees but if you're just starting out then it's like
(15:10) yeah that stuff's amazing but what do I do today and so I want to give you this check because this check is what the average school Community that's paid and monetized on the platform makes in recurring Revenue per month and so no this is not a bazillion dollar check this is not going to get you to be the richest person in your neighborhood but can help get you started and so the tactics that I outlined earlier about the rule of 300 we're doing this right now for people inside of school and it's murdering and so I recommend that you start because the coolest part of this
(15:43) whole thing is that you can start absolutely free and so if that sounds at all interesting I take a call every single Monday you can go there school.com for/ games I'm sure there's some link somewhere just let me know that you're new I hop on I answer questions we walk through through basically what we saw after studying thousands of communities that are paid and doing well and we just tried to reverse engineer and boil it down to like what are the actions they took and so the instructions are very much like
(16:12) do this x times per day do this y times per week and if you just follow the instructions you will get an exceptional result and so to be clear I stayed in this box for over a year I just kept reaching out to people asking for referrals cuz I didn't even know what the word advertising really meant I was just like I'm just going to tell people that I have this thing and hopefully they'll want to buy it from me but after a year of doing stage one talking to homie stage two getting referral stage three doing the donation Stuff stage
(16:41) four that is when I moved on to here all right which is that I actually made my first content post and so I'll read it to you because I think there there's a lot of actually decent parts to this post especially like being my first advertising post ever without being in this internet marketing world I was just a consultant in Baltimore everyone for those of you who know me you know two things one I'm terrible with all things technological not that much has changed for example I just heard about Spotify a few weeks ago seriously and people at that point have been had it for like a
(17:04) decade already two I love training nutrition and fitness more than well a lot so today sort of special because it marks a day where my love of training vanquished my fear of technology which by the way many of you should hopefully get to that day sooner which is that you should be willing to deal with some discomfort in order to get what you want so for the better part of a year I've been taking part in a free personal training project with the idea that I would give away free personal training to anyone who was willing to give some of their $500,000 to the cause of their choice this way they wouldn't have to be
(17:27) motivated with the same thing as me but be motivated to give their cause and benefit themselves when I first introduced the idea I was happily surprised with the amount of positive support I received so almost a year later for my first client I now have a website all right to formally show some of the transformation that have gone underway using my programming and as a formal means of contacting me about setting up basically saying I'm open for business all right so I put it in caps I'm currently have a few slots on my
(17:45) roster uh so drop me a note quickly if you're interested thanks so much take out a second to see some of the ridiculous transformations in record time check it out that was my post and that was the post that got me my first you know 20 or so customers I had been posting Fitness related stuff for almost a year but then when I finally was like Hey I'm open for business that pretty much like got me the customers I needed by the way you can actually model this post to a great degree the intro doesn't really matter but the main thing was just kind of want to say what do I mean CU I probably could have cut the first part of that post and just say for the
(18:16) last year I've been doing this which is just inherent proof and I would like to make that same offer to you and here's more proof so if I did it better I would have probably just been like the images of the Transformations cuz a lot of people are not going to make the click so I want to increase the likelihood people click or respond and so I probably would have made it an image post or a carousel with that and then the CTA at the bottom saying DM me or comment or whatever and at the end of the day we all know that anybody who
(18:40) likes comments or DMS we're going to respond to anyways I would just try and get as much engagement on this post as I could I would probably text the post and links to the post to everybody I knew as well because then that link would already have all the embedded proof and notice I didn't have an offer here I probably would have put an offer in if I wanted to do what I what I know now but this is a great place to start which is proof and some sort of CTA if you put an off in there it would do better if you do some sort of bonuses and reverse of risk you do even better if you say it's for a certain period of time it does
(19:04) even better only do that if it's true if you're if you're like brand new and you're like have no customers then probably you'd be willing to take customers whenever so maybe you don't say that at first but I said I have a few slots open which is true but I also had a lot of slots open I say this because I'm proud of that kid who decided to make that move and I think for many of you you can skip to this step much faster especially if you follow the rule of 3 which is just rule of 100 broken down into three things and you'll be able to get started a lot sooner than you think and you can do it
(19:28) for free like to give you context when this happened like Instagram was barely a platform it was like new and it was just like this image thing like all of this influencer world like didn't really exist and so the world's changed it's never been easier than it is now and in case you're wondering why I'm in this narrow hallway believe it or not this is the narrowest hallway in my 36,000 ft headquarters but this was supposed to be as close to as possible as the uh closet videos that I made at the very beginning
(19:53) of my YouTube Journey shout out to the ogs who have been there since those early days with a webcam so I told you at the beginning of this video that I'd be sharing the lessons that I learned along the way so this isn't like a how to start your first business obviously there's things you can model but I think the the real things are what did this allow me to learn so that I could move forward in my journey as an entrepreneur so the first one is walk the walk and this kind of always seemed obvious to me and maybe it's because I was born in the real world and not the influencer social
(20:23) media world but like if you're fat it's going to be hard for you to sell weight loss if you have Terri teeth it's going to be hard for you to sell dentist stuff it's kind of what I call the big obvious that a lot of people just like choose to conveniently leave out they're like hey people aren't buying my investing advice and it's like yeah cuz you're poor so maybe don't sell investing advice cuz obviously it hasn't work you want to be able to answer the obvious first objection before you even get it which is you should be the biggest walking billboard of whatever it is that you
(20:54) sell and I was able to succeed without knowing all the stuff that I know about offers now and guarantees and reversing risk and scarcity and urgency and how do you create value I just knew at least at the most basic level if I had gotten results for myself and gotten results for other people that people would believe that I could get results for them at least on some level so I'll also encapsulate that into proof over promise it's good to have a promise and it's good to have proof but if you had to pick one go for proof now the next thing
(21:22) that I did in terms of what worked was I lived cheap all right now the reason that this is so important in my opinion is that it allows you to go on the offensive right like I lived on I think $1,200 a month at the time and I was making a consultant's income and I basically spent no money and saved everything I had and I had saved up over the first two years of Consulting about 50 Grand which is not bad for two years of work like post taxes I was pretty proud of it and so with that money I was able to then say you know what I have the I have the cash to quit my job and actually go all in on this thing it
(21:54) still took me like 6 months to do it don't get me wrong like it was a painful process cuz I was so afraid but at the end of the day I had the money and I knew that I could live on 50 grand for at least 2 or three years if I had to saving money won't make you money but it'll give you the security to think further out and take bigger risks because if I had to make money the next month I would never have been able to quit my job but I knew that I had two to three years of Runway that I had bought myself through saving so that I could basically give myself more shots on goal at this point I was a consultant and
(22:23) made decent money I was able to save 50 after taxes with that income so like I was living pretty cheap but the big thing that I did did was I only bought food at Costco I meal prepped all of my food I never ate out I didn't go out which some people might see as sad or whatever I actually lived right above the bars of a college town and basically never went to any of them which was like weirdly sad for me but anyways that was it it's I I remember I remember going to a gym and they said the membership was $29 a month and I was like a month like what are you guys crazy and so I went to
(22:51) a different place that was like 19 or 10 just to show you like how I thought about money at the time and so I just didn't spend money like I guess I guess it was really it it's like I bought food and I paid rent and that was it it's all I did and I paid for gas in my car I didn't buy new clothes I just didn't I didn't spend money that was all like i' saved money but just not spending it that was it and I was working all the time because I was either working at my job or the rest of my time I was working on my next thing and so for me the
(23:19) biggest hack of all for saving money is to work more because working more makes you money in two ways one is you get paid for the work you do second you don't have time to spend the money you make so the next thing that worked was and this is a big one that a lot of people somehow like miss out on is start free all right so I I I did free honestly probably longer than I should have or needed to but I was one I didn't need to make the money yet so I wanted to give myself a lot of prep a lot of Runway I kind of haven't changed like whenever I go into something new like I want to be overprepared I want to know
(23:50) I'm going to win if I'm going to do it and so for me with the start for free most you guys aren't that good yet and so the easiest way to get proof is start free so that you have proof so that you can show that you walk the walk in that you have helped other people walk that walk too here's the cool thing with free is that there are many things that someone can do to make you money only one of them is them giving you money but if someone gives me a banger testimonial I will likely make more money from that
(24:13) testimonial than whatever they paid me and so think about it if I can guarantee that that will actually make me more money just over a longer period of time and so basically in the beginning you're stacking yourself with all of these things that are worth more than the price you could charge so that you can cash them in later for money and so testimonials are worth more feedback is worth more referrals oftentimes can be worth more and so all of these things are things that are non-monetary that someone can do to compensate you for the work that you did and so it's not that I worked uncompensated I just didn't ask
(24:45) for money I follow Chick-fil-A's philosophy with pricing it's either full price or it's free I never discount for a number of reasons but the biggest one being I don't negotiate with terrorists and so the price is the price they either pay it or they don't and I can make the decision as a business owner that okay strategically I'm not getting the take rates I want I will strategically lower the price but to lower the price to get someone to buy communicates to them and to every single person they tell that your prices are not true that everything that you have
(25:09) is up for negotiation and if you want the rest of your life to be a haggle by all means discount people and make one-off deals for everybody but in my experience I have a standard price that I have thought a lot about why I price at this price and that is what it is worth to me and if you would do it for less and you still make money then do it for Less don't do that but if you want to go for it I would prefer to say either our trade is non-monetary it's free and you will do these things or you will give me money and I will do all of
(25:34) these things for you and you don't have to do any of this stuff and if you choose to it would be great but I'm not going to force you to so one of the other things that worked is that I had a templated on to many solution so I worked for you know that year to figure out what everyone liked eating and so what I did was I remember spending like I want to say like 200 hours which was a huge amount of time for me at the time on this monster Excel sheet that I could type in someone's weight their goal Etc
(26:01) and then it would calculate out the macros and then the grocery lists for them for hundred different meals and so then I could do my consultation with someone and then like I purposely would take longer and send it to them like a week later but it would take me like 10 minutes to prep it and make you know format it make it look nice and only select them the meals that I thought they would like so I had 100 meals I could pick from and then I would just pick the ones that I thought they would be cool they like wow he like really thought through the grams of every
(26:25) single one of these meals that they would add up to my total calorie intake with the macros ET and so it was very valuable but it didn't take me a lot of time and so I think during this free period is where you invest in the future you're invest in the future to get referrals reviews feedback and build out the okay I keep having these same six questions okay let me give out really really like maybe I include that in the onboarding maybe I make I spend one time time now so that I never have to do it
(26:49) again I solve it right so I don't have to solve it twice I helped a couple girls lose a lot of weight I helped a guy lose a lot of weight I helped another guy lose a decent amount of weight way and then the rest of the guys were like recm or getting jacked now when I did my skinny to swool project which is where I finally monetized I can't tell you why but I can tell you that the thing that everyone responded to was people who looked like me and who wanted to look like me and so I ended up niching without trying into skinny to swole because that's what I also wanted
(27:19) to work on like I preferred helping guys get jacked to helping girls lose weight niching down can help just because your Solutions become more templated and so if everybody's going through the same goals and having the same starting position you can provide in real way more value to them that also Cost You Less and so it's a double header it cost you less because everybody has it so you can template out a lot of it it is more valuable to them because you're being way more specific to their problems with way more depth of solution than if you
(27:48) had to generically make or personalize it at a low price for many people you wouldn't be able to put that much attention to it it just you couldn't right unless you charge a lot more which I recommend and so the next great thing that I stumbled into was that this was a recurring business model all right and so this was something that would pay me month after month after month now again I didn't like think through this like oh what type of I just was like oh well Fitness a lot of people need to pay me
(28:10) this month next month and so I just made a recurring business model to start with what I made a mistake for was that I sold 12 weeks and then I didn't sell them again I went to go find other customers and so I didn't like have another offer prepared or say hey you want to go on maintenance like I didn't do any of that I was just like cool now I have to go find another 20 customers so that was dumb uh but but you love you learn so that's all the stuff that I learned that worked well in me making my first dollars so now we'll go over what didn't work so the first thing that didn't work is I didn't Ascend anyone so
(28:42) I didn't have a second offer or some sort of way for them to continue to pay so I would say number one have another offer now if you're like shoot I don't know what other offer I would offer them let me tell you what I should have done and that you probably should do offer them more of that thing they just bought so if they just bought skinny to swo guess what they probably still want to be skinny and swo or more swole than they are so I haven't met a guy who added 30 pounds to their bench and then was like I'm good they're like I'll add
(29:10) another 30 I could go for more right just make the offer and I just didn't do it so don't make that mistake the next thing and this is a big one I stopped for new so what does that even mean so I had a business that was making $44,000 a month in profit online no mad lifestyle 2013 before the internet even [ __ ] existed not really but before a lot of these online businesses became kind of like the Vogue or the norm like there were basically no like online coach like that's just was didn't exist and so I
(29:42) thought that the business I had was not legit and so I saw my online business which took me 4 hours a week to do that was making me $1,000 a week as not legit compared to me spending all this money signing a 5-year lease investing into a brick and mortar location to start a gym and so I knew that I ultimately wanted to have a gym because I didn't know another way that was legit so if I were coaching me right now I would have been like wait so you're making $1,000 a week working 4 hours a week what if you
(30:15) worked 40 hours a week and made $10,000 a week that would be not that bad and you'd immediately be in the top 1% of earning as a 20-some year old working wherever you want with no like no cost and why do you not want to do that but instead I was like oh now that this worked I should stop doing that immediately and do something brand new that I've never done before don't do that so the next thing that I did that was messed up is that uh I didn't have a good offer so I had no offer which was dumb if I had had an offer I would have been able to make way more money the
(30:46) next one is that I had no sale so when I did this I actually didn't like hop on the phone I just like literally just sent people links to buy which was stupid and I should have got on the phone because I would have then been able to charge more right I mean I was basically offering personalized everything for $200 a month and part of the reason that this is going to sound ridiculous to you if you're listening to this part of the reason that I I I probably didn't keep doing the thing it wasn't making as much money as I wanted
(31:17) so $4,000 a month like I was like I just made that doing a consulting job so I'd want to make more than that and so even though my first shot immediately matched what I was making before I didn't think oh I could just raise my price to make more money I I was like oh no I should just start a brand new business like just dumb but yeah because I didn't have an offer because I didn't have a sales script or a sales process I wasn't able to charge more which then caused me to stop something that otherwise was an
(31:40) amazing business I would say the other thing that I did that was dumb was that part of the reason that I stopped this other thing was judgment right and so I'll explain what I mean by this but basically you heard me say it like I didn't think this was legit right like this isn't a legit business if you sell a product or service if you exchange goods and Serv for money you have a business period so I didn't like Define terms and like a lot of that stuff came much later for me but I made really huge life decisions based on perceived Judgment of people who weren't even thinking about me like I was think I
(32:12) honestly was obsessed about thinking about what my classmates thought about me at the time the guys that I like went to school with I you know I was obsessed about what my dad would think and all of this kept me poor and so one of the biggest mistakes that I made is that there was no YouTube world that had all of these like courses and trainings and videos like this so I didn't get help I did this all solo which is why I think it took me a lot longer than it has taken a lot of people who follow my stuff and I mean and honestly that's the point like I hope that like every
(32:42) generation stands on the shoulders of the generation before and I hope that people who are younger than me make more money than I have made by the time I'm 30 or they're 35 right otherwise it means that I have failed like I haven't been able to transfer the knowledge successfully cuz I'll die no one will remember me it won't matter and so the only like real good that I think that people can do to leave a legacy is to to pass on the learnings and so that's why I try to do what I do but I didn't get help until later and when I got help is when my you know my income went way up
(33:07) so I got asked to give advice to a group of entrepreneurs who were doing this little test that I was telling you about on school and they said hey do you have any like words of advice for everyone who's starting and so I uh was in a a writing mood at the time and so I actually end up sending up this massive slack message that has now been seen by like four million people and so I will share with you right now these are the directions I told them when they were starting number one follow instructions
(33:32) number two When You Reach something you don't understand how to do Google first the amount of people who like post immediately the the moment they have friction the amount of people who message me and say hey where do I find your books I usually just respond where do you normally find books and then they're like well Amazon I'm like did you search people go for an easy button rather than just like take the Second Step take the Second Step do the one Google search before then thinking oh I will then stop working because that's basically what happens as soon as you send a message you I have reached a point that I cannot cross I've reached a
(34:01) Chasm to which no man has ever been over before Google it third when you figure it out post it other people may have struggled there too and so this is a way that you add value in content to whatever community that you're in four actually follow the rule of 100 daily and this is a big one because people get distracted really really easily and they're inconsistent and so the thing is is that their businesses become inconsistent because they are inconsistent so businesses themselves are machines for consistency if you have consistent inputs you have consist outputs but if you have inconsistency in
(34:29) your business it either means that you are not consistently putting the inputs in or you need to put more inputs in so for example if you do 10 reach outs a day then you might get your one sale every 10 days it will feel volatile but it just means that 100 inputs equals one output so if you want it to be less volatile then it means that you put those 100 inputs per day and get one per day and so really just means that you're extending the time Horizon on the results that you want to get so do more faster more consistently and you will
(34:53) get more faster consistent results five you will be excited for a week then the excitement will off that is when the work begins and so this is like a key point that has helped me a lot which is work starts when excitement ends not while you're excited I don't even count it as work while you're excited the work starts when you have to confront the reality that you have way more stuff to do that you don't know how to do and that's not fun because you will suck because most people doing things they don't know how to do aren't good but you
(35:18) being able to walk that bridge of discomfort is what will separate you from the mediocre masses who stop at the chasm and then just say I don't know what to do help me six your work works on you more than you work on it you are the product that's getting built more than your community remember this was for school people so remember that like you weree the product and so I had this tweet that got completely bombed and no one cared about it but I will tell you what it what it was so I have this really weird trippy thought the other day which is in prisoner of war camps
(35:47) throughout history one of the psychological torture mechanisms is that they would have people do manual labor and one of the particularly nasty ones is that they would have them dig holes and then at the end of the day fill the holes back up and so the point was to try and Drive the futility and the meaningless of Life the meaningless of work and it just breaks them down psychologically what I found interesting about that is that every day I go to the gym and I pick up weights and I put them exactly back where I was before and so in both instances there is physical labor that's happening and everything
(36:12) looks exactly the way it was but in one instance it's seen as psychological torture in the other it seen as self-care and so it really just means that these things occur and then we describe them as labels and so if you are the asset that is getting built everything happens for you rather than to you seven and this is a big one everything is unscalable in the beginning that's the point it's how you learn every single piece of it and when you learn every single piece of how something works predictably that's called Mastery that's how you learn a skill when you learn lots of skills put
(36:43) together people are like wow that guy's good at it that is how you describe someone who is more skilled and so the pain that you have to go through when you're reaching out to all of these colder prospects not getting responses what happens is you're like man there has to be a better way to do this and then as soon as you do experiment and do figure out a better way to do it you have gotten better and so that pain creates the Catalyst to learn better ways of doing the same stuff and that's how in a very real way you gain leverage skills give you leverage if two people start the same thing and one gets way
(37:17) more results that guy did it with more leverage they did it with more skill and the pain is the Catalyst to makeing that happen so don't run away from the pain run towards the pain learn how to deal with it by getting better better eight the pain of repetition is what forces you to seek Improvement when you figure out ways to get more for what you do you have gain skill nine if you complain you are dead to me not really sure what to add to that one when you complain you expend effort for no result And We
(37:42) complain because we have been rewarded for complaining in the past and so rewards typically come in the form of affection attention and approval meaning other people pay attention to you they give you affection say oh I'm sorry right and sometime they give approval which in this instance when you do when you go for pity parties approval doesn't come but you do get attention and affection which is why some people like to be sick because people pay attention to them they give them affection and so that's how those Cycles begin but I will
(38:05) give you a quote that papa heroi gave me in my Wei days he said it is better to be envied than pied and so when you complain functionally the command that you give your audience is pity me and I don't know about you but I didn't get in the game to get pied 10 literally thousands of people have succeeded you are not special repeat the same actions they took to get the same outcomes they got if you repeat the actions that they took and you do not get the same outcomes they got then it means that there is a variable that you have not identified yet it doesn't mean that it doesn't work it means that the way you
(38:37) did it wasn't the complete way and so if you build a bridge and there's 10 bricks across the bridge and you put nine in you can't say Building Bridges doesn't work you say I don't know how to build Bridges the way he builds Bridges I think he only did these nine steps but it's clear that he's getting people across this bridge and I am not so I have to further study what specific things he did that I do not do that is creating the discrepancy between his outcome and mine 11 write down every reason that you're going to stick with
(39:05) it put it in front of you tape it to your mirror put it behind your laptop put it wherever you're going to do the repeated boring work and revisit it when you need to remember to stick with it because motivation will fade very quickly and so having I love this term a big bag of wi is a great way to remind you why you need to continue what are you running away from just as much as what is your what you're going towards and in the beginning of this video I said use what you've got if you're not super passionate about getting started but you do know that you hate being broke you hate your current situation
(39:36) then write all the things you hate and say this is why I'm doing this because I I'm sick of this I don't want this anymore 12 business is shockingly simple but surprisingly hard the hard comes in the form of consistency the moment you don't want to do it or just skip today is the day that you realize what hard actually feels like and that's where you have to overcome the hard is not in the complexity what makes it hard is being consistent that's always like Fitness isn't hard eat less than you than you than you burn move more like that's it right like and add more over time like it's not complex it's just hard to do
(40:08) because you have to keep doing it and you have to keep doing it far before you see a result for the work you do and so this is a practice in being able to further disconnect what you do and what you get the weakest most impotent people on Earth are people that must be immediately rewarded for the work they do it's how how social media addicts the masses they get rewarded immediately for hitting the button for checking their notification for looking at their likes for looking at the comments they get immediate rewards and that is how they weaken you the people who are the most
(40:39) potent are able to do big things because they know it takes a long time to do them and they will have to work today for something that will happen a year or 5 years down the road imagine a competitor that you'd compete against where one guy has to get a result for what he does in the moment or he stops and imagine the other competitor who's able to do it for a year straight without seeing a result who do you think will win obviously the one who Waits a year be that competitor number 13 just win because once you win one you'll get addicted to winning second everything
(41:09) else that you did to get to there will fade and so I'll tell you a weird analogy if you've ever drank too much and had to throw up and had a whole night of throwing up when you think back on it you don't actually remember all the hours of throwing up you just remember it kind of sucked a little bit right like and it and the thing is is that pain fades in time so that's a that's something that is that is behavioral not just to humans it's across species so punishment Fades and so the reason that you get hung over and the next day you
(41:38) say I'm never drinking again but the next weekend you go out with your buddies and drink again is because the benefit of drinking stays and so the reason that you have a past relationship and you're like man I remember the good old days is because the punishment from that relationship Fades it's why people keep revisiting these toxic relationships they go back and as soon as you get back into you're like why did I do this I forgot about this stuff and so the pain that you are going through right now will fade but the result that you get will stay with you and so that
(42:05) disparity between pain and reward for me has been one of the biggest unlocks of life just simply understanding that this pain will pass but what I get for it will stay with me an achievement stays with you for life what it took you to get there only stays with you in your mind as long as you choose to give it attention so that wraps the lessons from the free training project of how I got my first customers made my first online business in the next video you can click here to learn all the stuff that I

I Reverse Engineered the Perfect Business - YouTube

Transcript:
(00:00) this is your business it's a masterpiece right I call it the mosey Lisa but it has a few imperfections let me show you like this one diverse customer base and when we want to reverse engineer building the perfect business or a masterpiece business we have to take all these pieces that something's missing and then put them back in the right place for example automated metric tracking High cash flow profitable and growing with a good story multiple rival acquisition channels and a lot more so you might be wondering how I know all this well a long time ago in a galaxy far far away I started a company called
(00:33) gym launch and gym launch basically turned gyms around and then eventually became a licensing business the license over 5000 locations but here's the crazy part we went from zero dollars to 4.4 million dollars per month in 20 months and it also sucked and that's what people won't tell you it got so bad that Layla and I and my wife were walking one day and she says let's just shut this thing down I was like wait hold on this might be worth something so I called an investment banking friend of mine and I said hey if I were to sell my business like do you think I could get anything for it and he's like oh millions of dollars
(01:06) I was like wow that sounds amazing he said wait but not right now there's a ton of things wrong with it that you have to fix in order to get an Institutional Investor to want to invest the kind of money that you would want to make an exit and that's what began this journey of figuring out how to take something that just makes money into an incredibly valuable asset that can change your life forever and your family's life from a financial perspective and everything about to show you in this video is something that we
(01:31) developed at acquisition.com called the value acceleration method now you've probably heard of big companies like Netflix and Amazon and Microsoft being worth two trillion 5 trillion one gazillion dollars how does that even come to be like how can something be worth a certain amount we talk a lot about value provide value to people make valuable content but when we're talking about value within a business the person we're providing value to is the investor who's going to buy a share of it so there's only three variables that are
(01:58) really going to affect how much a company is going to be worth one is increasing the number of customers if all else Remains the Same if you 10x the number of customers you will 10x the value of the business sometimes more the next is something I call Lifetime gross profit which means the amount of profit that you generate from these customers over the lifetime of their stay with your business and so if I want to make more money I'll either have to get more customers or make them worth more so then what's the third variable because this is pretty much all it takes to grow
(02:29) a business which by the way is what it is you divide that by risk How likely is it that this will continue in the future those are the three variables that you have to increase or decrease the value of a company and all these three things put together equal a term called Enterprise Value so take out your notepad because each one of these 10 things unlocks another level of Enterprise Value in your business and you when you get them all right you make a lot more money so let's start with piece number one leadership team in
(02:58) place running the day-to-day so for each one of the ten that I'm about to go through I'll explain what it actually is how I learned it and then how you can tactically execute and fix these things so you can increase the value of your business so a leadership team in place running the day-to-day means that the person who owns the business can leave the business and the business can not only maintain but also grow in their absence now the thing is is that most small businesses the business owner is the reason the business even exists and if the business owner leaves so does the business the problem is if you leave and the company
(03:29) goes down then it means that no one else can buy it and as much as this is uncomfortable for a lot of entrepreneurs many people own businesses that are worth nothing I mean that not as an insult but more so because what they did was they created a job that pays well that they have other people who help them and they pay those people to help them but they haven't created an asset and so always remember to say you get paid for what you do you get Returns on what you own if you want to become rich you increase your paycheck if you want
(03:58) to become wealthy you get wealthy from owning assets all right that's the big difference so let me give you a tail of two different businesses that we have in the portfolio that try to solve for this risk the first one ended up just saying hey I've got this buddy of mine in my network he's never run anything like this he's just run little like odd job type businesses and I'm gonna have him come in and be the operator of my significantly larger company than this person has ever run and we were very vehemently against that but we sit in a minority position and so we say listen if that's what you want to do I'll support you but I want to voice the fact
(04:29) that I don't agree with this but once the decision is made we will support it to the best of our ability now I'm not going to tell you what happened yet second scenario is a company where we've continued to grow it it had plateaued at a point where we saw we really needed to help the two Founders and bring in a more seasoned operator and so this is Brick and Mortar chain we took somebody who had taken a brick and mortar chain from 100 to 2000 locations open over a span of 10 plus years had a lot of experience opening locations negotiating leases managing build outs getting
(04:59) vendors in line on timelines managing Capital allocations so that we can actually roll out at the same Pace making sure profitability across all of them ensuring quality assurance I won't get in any more of that but somebody who knew what he was doing guess what happened so we've got our sad operator and our great operator who come to the business so with the first instance what happened afterwards the business plateaued costs continue to rise because this operator didn't understand how to manage cash flow manage profitability
(05:25) basically got more people into the business without increasing any kind of Revenue which then basically ate up all the profit in the business and this business was not profitable for nine months it lit it just broke even for nine months and this was a very profitable business prior to this in this scenario with the more seasoned operator this business continued to grow at the same Pace but the profitability increase expanded at a dramatically faster rate with this new person in there and so they even had a period where he said hey I think we should just focus for this entire quarter on making
(05:55) all of our locations just more profitable we don't even need to open more and dramatically increase the profitability of the entire business overall and that's the difference between having an experienced operator and an inexperienced operator and if I'm a buyer and I'm looking at the business and I say okay these Founders are going to disappear imagine the founder disappears here I'm like I have no desire to buy this thing right versus here I say well gosh I can see when this guy came in I could see what it
(06:18) increased based on his decision making and his experience wow I feel like there's way less risk which means this is more valuable so let's talk about what you can do number one let me tell you one of the mistakes that I've made so many times early on in my career is that I thought an operator was someone who managed systems and organization that's not what it is at all an operator somebody who can lead the business it has to be someone that you aspire to be like that you admire in different ways and it should be people that everyone on your team could look up to because that
(06:47) is what is going to allow you to step out of the Limelight a little bit so that they can actually take some of the load off of you and let me give you the litmus test for knowing when operator is good or not if you feel like you have more time now and you have way more bandwidth they have helped you if they try to tell you to do all of these new things that you weren't doing before they are arguably hurting you so the way that you have to look at this as a business owner is the difference between local and Global meaning if I tell the
(07:17) sales team that they have to put notes in the CRM that actually increased how much stuff they do on a local level but by them doing that I decreased all the work in the rest of the company globally and so if an operator comes in and says everyone has to do all these things you have to zoom out as the owner and say does this decrease work globally or is this just giving us more stuff to do and a good operator tries to use as few systems as possible to decrease work across the entire company whereas a bad operator will feel entitled in saying why aren't these people filling out their checklist
(07:53) they're not finishing the tasks that I gave them to do it's because they add things without removing them and so from low to high you'd have a manager you might have a director of Ops you might have a VP of Ops and then eventually you'd have a COO all of these fundamentally do the same thing just at different levels of an organization I would always prefer to start lower most people over title it's one of the biggest problems that small business owners have they over credentialize people and then people beat their chest and get their ego
(08:22) involved and then you don't have room to bring people above them because if you have somebody you're like oh this person's been with me since day one and something realistically they're probably not a COO right they're probably a manager or maybe a director of operations and one of the sad truths and this is just data is that if you 10x in size the likelihood that you have the leadership team you had at 1X when you were at 10x is virtually non-existent people develop skill sets and those skill sets are good at certain seasons of the businesses growth and then they don't fit anymore and the only way for that person to stay
(08:52) on the ride you have to have a growth mindset and many people don't have a growth mindset you do because you're watching this but most people don't it's a much smaller percentage of people who are willing to do that one and then also just because of the the churn and burn of business in life and moving locations and families and drama and whatever that they actually are there with time you have to always prioritize the business because the business is what feeds everyone all the wealth that you want in your entire life is on the other side of a few hard conversations and so it's a
(09:15) skill you're gonna have to develop number two is hire for a purpose all right so you should have a clear idea of why this person is coming in you want someone to come in with a clear goal or a clear problem to solve and this makes the interviewing process a lot easier you don't have to give hypotheticals you can just say hey this is my business these are the stats this is the problem how would you attack it and if you ask that to 10 people the way someone answers the question and the way they talk through it logically should give you some insight into how this person is going to work with you a lot of times
(09:44) entrepreneurs just hire people that they think they would be friends with but then you hire a lot of people like you and then you still need the people who are not like you to actually run the business look at track record and experience and how comparable or relevant the experience is as one of the number one predictors that they're going to be able to help you go to where you want to go so this applies for a CMO a CFO a CPO meaning head of product all of those C Dash O's all of them you still want to think this way which is like can they do the thing more than are we going to be best friends and when we're thinking about replacing the day-to-day
(10:14) we've got risk you've got getting more customers and you've got making them worth more so you can actually think about that in terms of leadership so you say okay if I were to leave would we be able to get more customers next month and the month after if I weren't here well if the answer is no then all of the leaders that would make that happen would be check box one the second check box would be making sure customers stay and continue to pay and maybe increase how much they pay over time if I leave is there somebody
(10:38) or multiple people who are going to make sure that that happens if the answer is no then you need to check that box off and for us at gym launch for example my limits test is always if I step away does the company continue to grow for six straight months without me jumping back in which means that if they come to you with a problem you have to say you have to solve it they probably already know what you would do and they can just make the guess and a lot of times I would ask what do you think I'm going to tell you they're like well I think you told me to do this I'm like so what do you think like I think we should do that great do that right and so that's how it
(11:09) can develop over time so number three is that a players know their value an a player costs 25 more than a b player but a players produce five times more than b players and so being willing to pay a little bit more to get way more value is one of the single best investments you can make in business that being said if you are bringing a players on expect them to want more also expect some of them to negotiate pay some of the best people I've had have tried to negotiate pay when they came in and that's okay I
(11:36) actually had to have a conversation with one of our bigger portfolio CEOs because he had amazing talent person that we found he was like dude she's trying to negotiate if you said if she loves this job why doesn't she just take the job I was like a players know their value and it's now he said the all-time best hire has ever had and he almost didn't hire good Founders know that it's about the size of the the pie not the shape of the slice the founder of the company when they go public has on average 12 percent
(12:00) of the equity in the business when they go public all right now most people would say that if you founded a company and then it went public that you probably are very very wealthy so those Founders understood something that maybe you didn't and definitely something that I didn't when I was earlier on which is that it's about how big you can make the pie and the more people who are incentivized to grow the pie the bigger the Pie Gets Jeff Bezos doesn't have 100 of Amazon Warren Buffett has 30 something percent of Berkshire Hathaway Elon has 20 percent of SpaceX I'm going to ask you a visual question would you
(12:30) rather have this slice of pie or that slice of pie so it's not about the shape of the pie it's about how big it is and that's what we ultimately care about and that was a big belief that took me a long time to break as a small business owner I wanted to not give anything away but it's amazing how much more discretion or effort you can unlock when people feel like owners all these things put together go to create the first part of the mosey Lisa so let's talk about piece number two marketing without the
(13:02) founder so this is me marketing thy business and sometimes even being in the ads and the videos and making the content whatever it is that is not an asset that is a job this if I still own it and still happening is an asset that's the difference and this is what the investment banker friend of mine was explaining to me he said well number one you don't have a leadership team in place because it's just you and your wife number two is that urines every single ad if you leave how do we know we're going to still get customers
(13:30) I had you step by step fix this with my own business so that somebody else could own it I started filming ads with my general manager so we'd film ads together and he told me later that the first time we filled ads he was like terrified because of course she wasn't going to be as good because I've been doing it for a decade right like I've been recording ads for my gyms five years before that and then I've been recording ads for gym launch for another five years so like it been a while that I've been on camera pitching stuff and so I would record all the ads
(14:00) and then he would follow me and do the exact same ones and when we started running them surprise surprise mine still did better but we still ran the ads and he still came with me to do the ads in every session and guess what happened next he got better and over time he would start having ads that outperform mine and the way that we transitioned it was I did them and then I would do some with him and then those were the ads we ran in the beginning only Alex and then Alex plus kale Kale's my CEO he's still there two Alex kale separately to kale so that was the
(14:33) transition we went through think about this from a branding perspective brand is about associations and so if people associate me with this brand what I need to do is transfer that Association to someone else and so I say hey we're in this together and we run ads together and so people are like the brand Alex this person brand Alex this person and then eventually you can remove Alex and you have that person in the brand this process just from here to here took about 12 months and you might be like well Alex like you have a
(14:59) personal brand why are you doing this well there's a couple things one is that you can separate your personal brand from your business for example you've got Andy frisella has Andy frisella and he also has first form and they are somewhat different right you've got vaynermedia and you've got Gary vaynerchuk you've got Alex from Mosey you've got acquisition.
(15:22) com but I actually have another level of removal because all of how I actually make money is not ads for me it's companies that we own I can sell the assets that we have in our portfolio without it affecting me like somebody who buys one of our companies is going to be like well Alex doesn't come with a deal well I don't actually influence the business I influence how I get deals you're always going to be you and so your personal brand is always going to stay with you for the rest of your life you should want to make sure that it's not intertwined with your primary source of making money mind you that's if you want
(15:44) to sell if you don't want to sell then don't worry about it just go make money it's fine not a big deal so I don't know about you but I think we got the corner of my hat done and Mosey Lisa getting a little a little feisty so the third part of the mosey we said that my Investment Bank and Fred said that I didn't have and needed to fix was delivery without the face of the founder okay so you're not in the ads anymore but if I'm the one delivering service to customers or I'm key to the delivery and so you can think about this in two different ways one is I'm literally
(16:16) there doing the things as if you are the face and people come for your expertise in some way then this can be difficult now sometimes it's just your expertise is innate in why the product is good so like if you're a software designer and you're just a genius software designer or you're like an amazing editor even though your firm may sell this and it doesn't actually have to do with you if you own the customer relationships for example like they only work with it because they love you or they love your
(16:39) way of Designing things those are all different examples of why a Founder would be used in delivering any risk factor for somebody else coming in so what do we need to do ah rip my head off we need to uh make this with cool man there you go a lot of people think that when they're going to replace themselves they need to find one person to replace them but finding another human being who has lived your exact life is impossible but it's much easier to find two or three people or five people who've lived
(17:09) portions of your life in different areas so that together we're gonna make this look even weirder you have a Hydra of people who can deliver value to the customer now here's how we did it I started edifying different people now how I did it was we called them subject matter experts so I found people really get one component of what I did I might say this guy is my subject matter expert of sales this might be my subject matter expert of retention this might be my subject matter expert of marketing and so what
(17:41) happens is people will identify that person as an expert in that particular area but not necessarily overall now they still could be good overall but how you brand them within your world matters number two the people that I did put even more edification into had equity in the business which also means that non-competes hold weight if there's equity and to give you an idea of how involved I was in the beginning to give you some hope if you're like man what easy for Alex right the first 400 days of gym launch I did a q a for 90 minutes every single day so I just said hey if
(18:14) you want my help I'll hop on with you but I say this to say that like I had a huge amount of demand to show you how much of a contrast this was from day one today whatever it was and put yourself in the shoes of the buyer the investor why would I want to buy a business where the guy who's literally delivering all of the values like hey can you just pay me for the next six years of value I'm not going to provide no of course not right it wouldn't make sense I will pay you for all the value that your company will provide to
(18:44) customers in the future if it doesn't require you and that's why this affects the risk factor within the business remember this little variable we got customers because remember if you lower the risk the lower you make the bottom fraction the bigger the overall value so a mistake that a lot of Founders will make is that they'll start selling kind of time with them one-off things they might do if you're in the beginning and you make money do what you got to do survive don't get me wrong I'm just talking
(19:08) about how to maximize Enterprise Value it's really just more you doing a job and getting paid for it which is fine it's just not wealth creation it's income creation so Point number one is that it might not be one person but many people who end up fulfilling Your Role within the company number two is that you want to edify each of those people to the customers in their respective places number three is that you want to transition me less than them and then eventually adjust them and then number four if they're high enough up then you
(19:32) can consider giving them small slices now mind you what I'm saying giving Equity I'm not saying like give 10 I'm saying you can give a half a percent or point one percent do these people said that they're still tied into the Business Delivery without the face of the founder boom next up we have this part of the background of the mosey Lisa but incredibly important multiple reliable acquisition channels so right now if your business looks like this if one day someone comes in and this just snaps and
(20:00) you have no way to feed your family over here all your family they all die because you can't eat right very sad so we don't want to do that what we want to have is multiple lines in the water that's you know a Fisher with lots of fishing pole sticks yeah all right so there's two elements to this you've got multiple and you've got reliable and both of those make up the fact that you have a more valuable business the idea here is that you want to know that you are not going to have your line snap because you get a ban on some platform if all you do is run Facebook ads if for some reason
(20:38) tomorrow Facebook says I ban you because I'm the god of media and I don't want you to make money anymore and your entire business dies that's a significant risk the same degree if you make content on YouTube and that's your primary way of getting customers YouTube can cancel you or let's say that you have a emailing method that gets customers in the door if you're doing outbound well yet again if for some reason you have you know your whole domain gets shut down and then your deliverability tanks now mind you all of these things have Solutions entrepreneurs are problem solvers it's
(21:07) like well then I create a new alternate YouTube channel or I create a new a Facebook account under my wife's name and that one we were able to run or I spun up a new domain so that I could deliver emails like there's obviously service students around this but the more of them you have that are consistently getting customers the less likely an invest just going to think wow this can go from 100 to zero overnight all of these things decrease the risk of the business and so for us at gymwatch I had Instagram paid ads I had Facebook paid ads as my only two channels right
(21:37) but what ended up happening believe it or not was that during covet these actually didn't perform Super well for me and so I had to find another way to start marketing and so I actually had a guy from a competitor company approach me and he's like oh I work at a gym company that I hadn't heard of and I was like huh that's weird I was like well if you don't mind my asking like what kind of Revenue guys doing is like oh we do about 10 million a month and I was like okay so you're telling me that there's another person in my exact space that's
(22:07) doing more than we are and I don't even know who they are I was incredibly intrigued and I was like well how do you guys get customers he said oh we're all outbound and so of course I was never getting cold calls from them because I'm not a gym owner right but he had a team of 30 plus guys who were cold calling emailing to get customers and I was like well do you think you could build out the outbound system here and he's like yeah I'm pretty confident he's like it would take me like you know some time but I think I could do it and I was like all right well here's the deal I'll give you
(22:37) the job offer but you're going to start your own department and it'll just just be you and you're gonna have to start everything from the ground up and so the long story short is that 12 months later it was 50 of our Revenue by doing that and by mending this we had Outback as another method and because we had three different ways of getting customers the acquiring company was like okay I feel good and it wasn't just like oh we get five percent of our customers from this half our customers came from
(23:03) outbound half of our customers came from inbound and they were like this looks stable and the thing is is that over time this has been a lifesaver because sometimes stuff does happen ads get disapproved one of your top Setters goes on vacation or the manager is not doing a good job who you just put in there like there's things that can break on either of these but the more that you have that are reliable the more reliable the entire business is overall and that decreases risk which increases the value
(23:27) of the company and doing this provided you don't drop on your main Channel because of your split Focus also increases the number of customers you get so this having multiple acquisition channels both increases number of customers and decreases risk which is why it can be incredibly valuable it is however one of the most time consuming and focused draining things you can do as a business owner and if you think about timing somebody give you tactic number one is that one one one offer one Avatar one channel and that's until you hit one million dollars per year if
(23:56) you're not there don't worry about this you're not trying to build your a valuable Enterprise yet you're trying to make money which is fine once you're here I still say just increase how much you're doing of these once you get to about here you can consider getting another Channel going and oftentimes if you do it right you can have the other channel support the primary Channel if I said I wanted to start making content if I have content content supports outbound content supports paid ads and sometimes
(24:21) content itself can become paid ads and so these things do work together synergistically it just takes resources and my recommendation is if you're going to start it start with someone else doing it so that you don't stop doing your main job so number two is what I just went over which is the first thing that I'm going to do after I have something working is more and better okay we have paid ads can we do more paid ads can we spend more money can we make more ads we make our ads better can we introduce different callouts going to introduce different hooks can we create different value can we get a more voluminous
(24:50) Cadence of recording in place that would be ways of doing more if I was doing outbound more would be more calls more dials more Setters whatever better is improving the scripts improving the training improving the offer we give them on the phone this is the lowest risk way of growing the business we already know it works let's do it more or let's do better to the point where I think my team is probably tired of me saying more better and number three is don't kill your business in trying to save your business if you decide to go after the second Channel
(25:14) understand that it's going to take a long time and so if your main Channel drops while you're trying to start your other channel you basically create the problem you're trying to solve you want to one be patient before you do it and be patient once you start number two is look at progress more than outcome that's what I would highly encourage you to do because it's going to take time so like even if you're starting paid ads the first thing you'll be is like are we getting clicks great if you're getting clicks then it's
(25:38) like okay are we getting opt-ins great if we're getting opt-ins and can we get scheduled okay are they showing okay are the people who are showing the right types of people okay yes great if they're not okay what do we need to do to tweak in the targeting or should we get the messaging across the whole funnel okay we're getting on the phone with the right people but they're not buying okay then we need to add some more friction we need to add some more selling aspects Etc right look at the progress not the outcome because if you look at that you might think wow this
(26:01) took two months and we didn't even make any sales the thing about this way let's say it costs you ten thousand dollars a month to invest in a new way to get customers and it takes you six months to make your first sale let's say a sale is worth a thousand dollars well that costs sixty thousand dollars but when you do get that first sale you got a ten to one return on that once you got all the tweaks done well in that next month you could spend 30 grand and make 300 and get 5x on your initial investment think
(26:25) about this as investing in a machine that prints money of course it's going to cost across time and cost money to create the machine but the machine will pay for itself over and out which is why business overall gets higher returns than anything else because there are very few other machines we can put a dollar in and get 10 Baht or put a dollar in and get 100 back in a month but business you can but it costs money and time to figure it out my third Point here is that I would say use others and of course there's examples where you
(26:50) could say okay I started this one channel I got a leader in place and I'm going to figure out this next Channel that's a way of doing it as long as that person continues to run the thing without you the way that I have preferred to do this over time is that I will bring someone else in to start the thing and I will consult and give feedback but I want them to own it so that I don't just create another problem that I'm going to have to solve in the future which sometimes means that it's going to take longer and I have to make sure I'm focusing on the progress as
(27:14) long as every week we're moving towards this we'll get there and if you're looking at well okay well which one would I do next which is a great question all right which is number four my recommendation is look at where people in your industry already acquire customers so if you are a directory consumer brand and you sell something that is weight loss focused well then paid ads is a huge source for people in that industry and you can be confident that if it's paid ads and it's in this media type for businesses of your size
(27:42) like don't look at Weight Watchers and be like well Weight Watchers is running a Super Bowl ad so I should try that probably not the best first step right but if you're looking at other people who run local gyms and you can say okay well companies of my size in the space are able to acquire customers here profitably so if they can do it so can I and that's kind of how I look at it until you've like done this multiple times just look at what other people are doing and you can iterate off that hey real quick guys if you're a brick and
(28:06) mortar chain you've got two three five locations and it's a working model that's doing at least a million dollars a year profit maybe two three five million dollars a year we're super interested uh to partner with you and help you scale and take you to the moon so if that's you go to acquisition.
(28:23) com we'd love to talk with you provide some value and if it makes sense invest and take it to the moon so with that being said enjoy the rest of the show multiple reliable acquisition channels like content ah tile number five is reliable recurring Revenue so let me illustrate visually why this is so important in a normal business what might happen is you would sell a customer this month and they're worth a thousand bucks and the next month you sell another customer is worth a thousand dollars you make another thousand dollars this month and guess what month three you do the exact same
(28:50) thing and make the exact same amount of money that is what most businesses do which is why they are not valuable now let's say the exact same scenario except in month one you sell a recurring customer a customer who buys this month he buys them next month he buys a month after that well in month two we're still going to sell another customer so we're gonna sell that customer and guess what he's going to do he's going to pay the next month too in the third month we're going to sell yet another new customer boom now if
(29:15) you're comparing the before and after here of old Way new way this is just three months now imagine 36 months or 60 months this thing would be this high and this would just still be the same and so when you see a business that's plateaued it's because they sell the same amount of customers every month and those customers are worth the same amount to them and they do not grow they've hit a point of homeostasis recurring Revenue businesses if designed properly will continue to compound and so this is why
(29:41) it takes time to build big things and so one of the biggest breakthroughs that I had in my business career was understanding not that you should have a subscription and why it's not just about having a subscription because let's say you get a subscription everyone cancels after the fourth month so this is the fourth month but every month after this we're going to have the same Revenue so this is going to stay the same because they're all worth four months so I'm gonna stair step up to four months and
(30:06) then I'm gonna plateau again what you really want is something called net negative turn it's a fancy word but it basically means that every single month if you acquired no new customers you would still make more money so an example of this would be something like Salesforce which is a company that's valued at a gazillion dollars and the reason for that is let's say that this month they have a hundred customers now they may lose one or two customers this month but the remaining 98 customers become more valuable to them than next
(30:31) month than they were that month because those businesses grow and the better designed a business model is the more aligned your customers outcomes are with your own outcomes and so for Salesforce they're like okay well if you have more seats or you have more email contacts or more Revenue that's flowing through the software we get a bigger percentage of that and so the remaining growth that they tie themselves to they get their claws in you allows them to continue to grow and so when they acquire customers think about this if a customer to them might be worth a million dollars how
(30:59) much can they spend over our customers unlimited that's the difference here is that we want to have Revenue that will not only stay but also grow and that's kind of the two levels of this like Netflix doesn't really have a lot of expansion Revenue besides you getting add-ons for your family or whatever right but they just hope that you never cancel and that's more common in consumer businesses in B2B businesses because you have way fewer customers you want to usually have much more expansion Revenue opportunities tied in in a way that not only gets them to not cancel but actually buy more so remember
(31:28) earlier we talked about Enterprise Value so Enterprise Value is the value of the business but usually the value of the business is measured by a multiple on earnings meaning how much money did this business make this year or the last year and what is the multiple that we'd have so if I made a million dollars in profit and I said the company was worth five million dollars then it would be a 5x multiple right and so in public companies they call them price to earnings ratios let me show you some companies that you may have heard of so you've got Netflix here you've got
(31:51) Amazon here a little Jeffy B and we got a little Billy G little Microsoft and so you might be like oh all of these companies are super valuable and they are but you might not know how much more valuable investors value them compared to their earnings and that multiple is purely based on on how reliable they think the future revenue of the company is and How likely it is to continue to grow so Netflix right now trades at 44 times earnings man wouldn't that be nice if you made a million dollars in profit someone paid you 44 million what a steal
(32:20) Microsoft trades it 29 times earnings a little less kind of interesting good old Jeffy B is getting 310 times earnings now there's a couple things here part of the reason that this is 310 is because Amazon actually runs slim margins and that's by Design because they continue to reinvest in growth and they look at their Returns on Capital and so investors know that at any time if they wanted to make the business more profitable they could they choose not to make it super profitable which then compresses the amount that is being
(32:49) multiplied for this value so there is a little bit of a game to this in terms of understanding why the multiples are so high but when us as business owners you're probably not going to be in any one of these scenarios realistically you're probably looking at one to four times earnings if you're a small business owner that's doing less than 10 million a year if you're doing over 10 million a year and over two million dollars a year in profit then sometimes that multiple can move up again it depends on some of the other factors we're talking about today which is and you check all the boxes then you do own an asset that's valuable and that's the
(33:18) point of this whole thing part of the reason that Amazon also has a higher multiple is that Amazon has a lot more expansion opportunities so think about this they have Amazon Prime in their home Marketplace but then they also have like AWS and they've got Prime video they could literally sell everything so they have tons of expansion opportunities Netflix has significantly fewer expansion opportunities and so it's not valued as highly and that's mostly just because they only really have one core thing and the other piece is how defensible is this How likely is
(33:42) it that another Netflix gets created well we already have proof of that you've got Disney plus you've got HBO Max they used to be this category King they're the only person then everyone else is like oh wait we can just go hire Production Studios and stream stuff too we need to get a couple big Brands models Disney was like we'll get Marvel and Star Wars and then they weren't the dominant they were just a channel whereas Amazon it's virtually impossible to recreate what Amazon's done and so they also have this big competitive mode around them which makes it almost impossible for anyone to beat them at their game and so they have this base
(34:10) way of holding on to all their customers and then all they're going to do over time is just add more and more and more ways like buying Whole Foods to make money from their customers but there are nine C's of recurring Revenue when I think about this is like how can I increase how sticky it is or How likely someone is to continue to pay me for whatever I have number one is consumption are they actually using the thing that they are paying for right one of the interesting things I found out in the gym world is that almost everyone is willing to pay for a gym membership that they use and almost no one is willing to
(34:38) pay anything for gym membership that they don't the next is collateral think about a storage unit they've got your stuff like you have to keep paying them a payment processor has all of your customer data and they process all of it they make it very difficult for you to take your credit card info which is encrypted from their payment processor to somebody else's and so they have collateral they have some of your and so they force you to keep paying them so that they keep making money the next is cost of switching is there a way
(35:02) that I can make it difficult to leave don't think how do I make my customers life harder more think how do I make my thing so much better better that they would lose all of these benefits if they left if I have 10 friends in a community and I pay for that community and then I leave and I meet with them in person on a regular basis I'm going to lose that so there's a high cost of switching next is choice I don't want many other choices like what I have available for them if you have a patent or you have
(35:26) some sort of trade secret that makes it difficult for other people to clone what you have so your n equals one of the only option that someone can have next is control the money flow this is more in a B2B scenario but if I have the ability to control the money flow that's why I like payment processing and software always tries to get the ability to process your payments for you Uber process their payments for their drivers doordash does for the restaurants if you can control the money flow you have a lot more leverage for them to stay with you the next is a softer one all right
(35:54) which is cause Charities movements things that you associate with if you have two different options and you're like you know what this one does a lot of good in the world I align my identity with their values I want to continue to pay there and I hinted at this one before but Community right like Community is a way to increase the stickiness around whatever the recurring membership you have is right whether it's a gym or it's an online subscription if there is a community now you might be like well there's no Community around Netflix you're right but do you think that there's a community around stranger
(36:21) things hell yeah there is right and you want to be able to say on Monday morning dude did you see the new episode of stranger things it was wild right and so you commune with other people about the content next is contracts and that's the same ideas as commitments right so if I say hey you're signing up for 12 month membership here's the contract that's your commitment then you're going to have stickier recurring Revenue than you are if it's just months a month you can cancel whenever you want and the last one I'll give you is communication which
(36:44) is literally just talking to your customers more regularly so in the gym world we figured out that when we said we're going to run events on a regular basis belly Blaster big booty boot camp or whatever it is our churn would decrease leading up to the event because they had something to look forward to but then after the event it would go up and so what do you do you just always have something for people to look forward to and you communicate that regularly so I give you nine ways to do recurring Revenue there are more but
(37:09) that's a good place to start do you think we've checked this one off I think so this looks like a nice green corner that was anticlimactic so our next one is part of my bicep or Mosely Lisa's bicep diverse customer base so having a diverse customer base let's imagine that this is your customer base you've got all these little fishies here and then all of a sudden one day boom Mr whale comes along and says I want to give you so much money because you're a small business owner you're like man I gotta win this whale I want to make this money and hey don't get me wrong by all means go whale hunting but the thing is
(37:41) is that this actually materially changes your entire business and your business strategy if you continue to acquire customers here and then you have to keep delivering on and hire more people to deliver for this whale you've kind of got this weird business and if I'm a buyer then you really don't have this business these are almost irrelevant it's like having only one customer and if that whale all of a sudden gets sick or just doesn't like you or one of your reps say something rude and he says I'm
(38:04) going to swim away then you're sad and then you're like what do I do and now I have all these people that are over hired for et cetera et cetera and so if you have the choice between this with a couple of little fishies underneath or a whole school of fishies then as an investor you're going to want this because it's more diverse if I lose one fishy it's not really going to kill me and I can go get another fish but if you're thinking what else could I do well I'll tell you yeah [Music] if you decide that you want to do this
(38:33) whale thing and you realize that whales are worth more and you actually enjoy the process more then go get a whole bunch of whales you will still get a diverse customer base of huge clients and these are some of the most valuable businesses is if you can get 10 or 20 or 100 whales then everything's based on percentage of Revenue whale is relative if you get Google as a customer they're a will but if you have Google and you have Amazon and you have Netflix all the other big companies then all of a sudden
(39:01) they're just little fishies too it's just you have a way bigger Pond for your fishies to be in and so the idea is that you want to have no one customer be greater than 20 of your Revenue ideally for me I don't like anyone more than five percent of my Revenue as much as the short-term revenue of having a whale come along sometimes these guys can Cannonball and create too big of a wave in your business that might actually sink your ship and so the risk that we're trying to address here is what if one customer leaves so let's say you've got a hundred dollars whatever you can put whatever zeros you want on this all
(39:31) right this is your business today and this is your profit cool I told you that what if a whale is 30 of your business here's Mr whale it's like a worm anyways now Mr whale leaves so does your profit and then all of a sudden you're breaking even so even though the customer was only 20 of your business it might be a hundred percent of your profit and so if you can lose 100 of your profit by losing one customer that's super risky and so that is why I prefer to keep it at five percent or less of all my Revenue coming from
(40:07) one specific client or customer I think there's two big decisions you have to make when you're thinking about diversifying customer base one is do you take the wheel on to begin with because it may create too many waves in your business that you basically have to create a business around the whale that if the whale leaves you then are left with all these costs that would sink the business if you didn't have them so you become really reliant on them so decision one is whether you take the wheel on decision two is that if you take the whale on are you going to then
(40:30) go get more minnows or you're going to go get more whales because it might make sense if you say hey strategically I think it makes sense for us to go up Market go after higher value customers and have fewer of them and so I'm willing to build this infrastructure for this one customer so that I can have 10 more of them that makes sense and so if you said this is my business this is my avatar this is my Niche this is who I'm going after then a big part of focus means saying no and sometimes a big shiny whale is just
(40:54) another woman in the red dress who's trying to distract you from your ultimate goal because fundamentally if you had a business that just served that one Avatar you should just go 10 exit this will create all of these difficulties that will distract you from the main thing I don't think there's anything else to add here so let's stick this puppy on diverse customer base before upper arm piece in reality number seven automated metric tracking every business needs to have metrics because if you don't have data you can't make good decisions and you'd be amazed
(41:23) how much smarter you seem if you have data to support what you do it's one of the first things that we do when we work on a portfolio company is get this stuff in place so that we can make better decisions for the future and ultimately give that data to an investor who might ultimately want to buy it for significantly a higher multiple in the future so what I'm going to do is demonstrate this in the real world to give you an example and call my director of brand this could go horribly wrong what's up all right pop quiz test number
(41:45) one uh how many registrations do we have right now for uh the book launch event we have 34. almost 292 000. that sounds nice thank you guys uh how many uh how many Affiliates how many people are promoting the book on our behalf uh it's over ten thousand I think it's ten thousand eight hundred and something as of yesterday as of this morning as of this morning yeah I can get it I have so 10 800 as of this morning all right that's you know we're two hours away from that real-time stat so there you go 10 813. okay thanks man I
(42:24) appreciate you so that idea is automated metric tracking and so he would only be able to say that if he actually had dashboards in front of him that would allow him to answer those questions if he didn't he'd have to be like I'll have to get that to you tomorrow and I'll have to look at three different Google Sheets and then count manually how many people are doing x y z right and the thing is is that the more difficult it is to collect data and report on data the less data you end up reporting on which means that you have few and fewer pieces to make decisions off of and so I'm often Amazed by how
(42:53) little data is collected in most businesses because I'm like how are you making any decisions and for the most part the answer is they're just guessing which is a terrible way to make decisions so one of the best things you can do is switch from a big conglomeration of Google Sheets to actually fully integrating some sort of CRM into your business and this is where the things like Salesforce and HubSpot and some of these other platforms exist is to help small businesses become medium-sized businesses it's worth paying well to get
(43:21) it implemented in the business so you know data of what's going on in real time so you can make real-time decisions automated metric tracking affects how many customers you get lifetime gross profit per customer and the risk associated with everything because if you don't have tracked metrics you won't know what your lifetime gross profit is you won't know uh where your customers are coming from or what percentage of Revenue each customer is worth or what your cost per lead is and so if you don't know what the basics are then how
(43:47) can you make the advanced moves if you don't even know what the basics are how do you improve them and so the first thing if you want to do a gross business is know what current state is but again I'm amazed at how many people don't even know what's going on in their own business if I'm like hey how much profit you make that's something they're like I don't know I'm like that's Friday you should know these things you can tell how skilled someone is at anything based on the number and quality of the metrics they track a lot of like marketing Founders if you're really good promoters
(44:11) are like oh our product's amazing and I'm like cool what's your time to Value what's your turn which your onboarding you know process and I start collecting you know asking just for stats around product and they're like we have a low chargeback rate and I'm like that is not what a good product means if I said hey what's your customer impression what's your cost per lead what's your conversion rate and they're like oh I got that you need to be as in depth about your product and your delivery as you are about your acquisition and if you know the quality and quantity of
(44:39) stats on the front end you should be paired in terms of how nuanced you are on the back end because the people who are really good are that nuanced and that is my biggest indicator if I'm interviewing for roles by the way of knowing if somebody's good or not if I'm interviewing for a sales manager for example and I say hey you know what metrics you'd be tracking he's like I like to go by feel you know manage the vibe of the team I'm like that's not bad that's fine but like what metrics do you track and they're like you know closing
(45:02) percentage and uh you know cash collected I'll be like okay cool that's a great start versus I have a guy who comes on and says show rates I like to count offer percentage I like to count uh what types of objections we're getting on our nose I'd like to count number of uh calls required to close I like to have cash collected I like to have cash as a percentage of total ticket value I like to know what my speed to contact is I like to know what my speed to close is in terms of first Contact until they close all of a sudden I'm like okay this guy gets it he's
(45:34) looking at a number of different variables that are highly quantitative so that he can then make far more targeted improvements in the process so that we can make more sales this is actually supposed to be for another video but I'm going to show you this uh in real time so this was actually a before and after of one of our portfolio companies and so what we did we said hey let's track data and so then we started tracking data and then they were like oh gosh these are our stats and we're like okay cool now let's improve it so to
(46:02) make these improvements for example for the show rate we have a huge checklist of like 22 things that we do many of them are automated that we can do to increase show rates and boom 50 to 70 now you might think oh that's a 20 Improvement that's not a 20 Improvement that's a 40 Improvement on the original number so like wow that contributed a lot here from close rate we then started going through our drilling process to train closers and our scripting process so we can get to the sale faster so we can close a higher percentage people and
(46:30) that showed in the numbers so from an improvement perspective this was 14 but 14 of 27 is a 50 Improvement in sales and then the bottom is the end result so one of the things that I have is no silver bullets many golden babies it's a game of incremental improvements for us at acquisition.
(46:50) com because we work the same types of companies we know what it takes to improve shell rates like we have all the best practices and we just say here's the 22 things we do and we're going to implement all of them one by one and that's the result with close rates we're like these are all the things that we have to do in the business and one by one we take them off and so it becomes very clear what the next step is because you know if you do all of those things the numbers will go up why do we feel that way because we have evidence so number one pick the platform that you want to start tracking the data number two pick the data like
(47:14) what data do you want to actually track some people call it kpis I don't really care pick the data that you want to track number three person so you're usually going to have somebody who's going to be implementing this platform in your business someone needs to own it you need to have one chest to poke or throat to choke or whatever you want to say and then four game plan and the way that we do this is we operate off the theory of constraints which is we look at these numbers right so let's say that we had just collected so we picked our
(47:36) platform we picked up the data that we wanted to pick and we had somebody who's making sure that this is happening okay cool which of these do I feel like we have the highest likelihood of improving the fastest right this is going to be the constraint of the business and the way that you see what the constraint is you can add five percent or a fixed percentage to any of them and see which one of those will actually yield the most throughput meaning if I had five percent here five percent here five percent here five percent here which of
(47:58) those five percent increases actually changed this number the most and the answer in this instance would be this one which is the lowest number so if I'm looking at this and my my next lowest number would be cash collected and the number after that would be show rate and so I would usually attack it in that order so that I could have the biggest bang for the buck for the things that I do which one of these is the smallest that's the one where if I if I make an incremental change it'll actually yield the most outcome forearm
(48:22) we're getting close we've got ourselves a nice corner piece of the MOSI Lisa which is high cash profitable growing with a good story so let's do a little physics lesson Sir Isaac Newton's first law of physics was an object at rest will remain at rest and an object in motion will remain in motion until another force is acted upon it and so it's much the same with businesses you want one that's already in motion because you know that it's more likely that a growing business will continue to grow than a business that's
(48:52) not growing will start growing because you have to exert Force to a business that isn't moving in order to get it to move stay a business that has high cash flow means that it kicks off cash in excess of what it needs to reinvest in the business to remain competitive and grow the second is that it is profitable now you can have a profitable business that doesn't create a lot of cash flow for example if I deliver services and I have to wait 90 days in order to get paid then I might be profitable on paper
(49:17) but not produce a lot of cash Because by the time that cash hits I have new liabilities that I'm incurring and growing is that a business gets bigger every month or every year right pretty simple there and ideally with a story because if you have a story investors like anybody else our customers and they like to hear stories as well so let me give you a very complex visual of what this looks like you want a business that goes like this and not like this I'm not saying that a company cannot be valuable if it doesn't have a high in every cash or it's not
(49:46) profitable HubSpot for example I'm pretty sure isn't profitable and it's a public Trading Company worth hundreds of billions of dollars I also try to cater my content to my audience which is 99 of business owners aren't Netflix or aren't HubSpot or aren't venture-backed with tons of money that are hyper scaling most of them are like us are self-funded in one way or another or have friends and family who invested in their business to help them grow and those people have lives and I will say this is that we hear all of the Netflix stories and the HubSpot stories but we don't see the graveyard of the many others that
(50:22) didn't make any cash flow for six years seven years and they never quite became HubSpot and so the founder spent seven years of their lives never really took a paycheck out of the business and then ended up with nothing and so for me especially if I'm investing in a business I'm a cash flow investor I want to see how much money does this thing kick off after we have to reinvest in the business to keep it competitive and even with companies that have high demands on Capital I'll give you an example like we we love brick and mortar businesses so like by the way if you have brick and mortar chain we Crush those those have very consistent Returns
(50:53) on Capital meaning it cost me a hundred thousand dollars to open a facility and I make five hundred thousand dollars a year and profit back and then I say okay cool well that's an amazing return on Capital how can we take that 500 and then open five and even in those situations with an insane return on Capital I would still usually recommend that the founder take a fixed amount out of the business on a monthly basis to de-risk them now it's a 100 personal choice because risk and how much you're willing to expose yourself to is personal but for me I'll tell you a quick story when I had my gyms I
(51:25) invested 100 of all my profit to open new locations I then decided after a few years that I didn't want to be in the gym business in that way anymore and so then I basically fire sold my gyms to then start gym launch and so I could have made a lot more profit during that period of time and I could have sold them for a lot more than I did but because when I wanted to sell them I wanted to get rid of them and so I think in total I think I made like 250 or 300 000 from the sale of six gyms which is not a ton of money I'd put way more
(51:56) that just into building the gyms I encourage Founders to take cash out I still prefer to put human first and say I I'm willing to sacrifice a little bit of growth for you to like take care of your family for example we started talking to a company which is a teeth whitening chain in 32 locations by the time we actually ended up closing the deal I think this is probably like four months um end to end which is actually pretty decent in terms of timelines they had grown by 30 percent in that period of time right and this is what made them attractive to us as an investor is that
(52:26) they had they were high cash flow they were profitable and they were growing and they had a cool story about how they wanted to continue to see growth and this is my bread and butter and I will be excited to tell you what happens in 12 months with these guys because I'm very confident about our Playbook but it doesn't cost a ton of money to open a teeth whitening Studio relative to the amount of profit that they kick off and so because of that Arbitrage we get really good Returns on Capital meaning instead of investing in the stock market and putting you know 100 in and getting
(52:53) ten dollars back I could put a hundred dollars in here and because of also how quickly they become profitable like how quickly can I pay off a new location well I could pay off a location in two months okay well then that means that I can compound six times in one year off of one location now when you have 32 locations and that's why they have so many so quick it can it can get really big really fast so when you're building a story for a company you usually want to track the story to a trend meaning like AI is a trend right now here's how AI will help
(53:30) us or how AI will not affect us is a great way to demonstrate a story around why somebody should expect to continue to see growth in the business so like if I have a haircut chain I could probably make a strong argument that people are going to still need to get their hair cut now if I'm in a design firm I might have a harder time arguing that AI is going to not affect my business or flip side I am going to try to put myself out of business and say we're fully leaning into Ai and we've already you know cut headcount by 50 and 10x productivity using these tools and so now we're even
(54:03) more profitable than we were before with higher cash flow so the idea is you want to track the trends that you align with that will give you Tailwinds to get one of these stories and not one of these I'm going to give a little a little nug here one of the first things that I'm going to give you a little Insider secret that I do when I go into a brick and mortar chain which is probably my favorite thing to invest in is I look at their whole product Suite so that means the products and services that they sell out of the facility and
(54:29) I'm going to look at two things I'm going to look at Absolute gross profit and I'm going to look at gross margin so what's the percentage right those are the same thing once a percentage what's an absolute amount and in general I look at what percentage of our sales are coming from each of each of our products and then I think okay this one has the highest gross profit and the second highest gross margin but we sell it the fifth most often how can I recombine these things so that it becomes the first thing that we sell most commonly in the highest volume and
(55:03) sometimes just making these types of tweaks can make massive differences in the amount of profitability and cash flow the company generates and so this is just one golden bb that we do in the process if you don't know what your gross profit is and your gross margin is on every product you sell and what percentage of your sales come from each do that and then reorganize your sales process to emphasize the ones that give you the most gross profit and gross margin and maybe consider down regulating some of the ones that don't weird green tile
(55:35) High cash flow profitable story of growth next tile audit ready financials whoa exciting I'm gonna make this one a little bit shorter because I know this is where people's eyes glaze over but if you think about audit ready financials from a risk perspective if I'm a buyer and you say this is what your profit is and I have no way of proving that that's your profit you could just make up a number if you have an audit ready Financial it means that a third party will come in and go through all your numbers they will calculate their own measure of profit and it matches yours
(56:05) if that's the case then you have audit ready financials a lot of times Founders think that their profit is a lot higher than it really is their Banker their accountant oftentimes works for them and as crazy as it sounds if you make the profit look better for the founder they are happier with you having a third party or making books that are third party ready for audit and getting something called a quality of earnings allows you to say to an investor these have been validated this is like a blue check mark in terms of this is really what I say it is so let's talk about this in levels level one have financials in general all
(56:37) right this sounds silly and in the beginning oftentimes you're just going to Outsource it you're going to have a third party who's an accountant or a bookkeeper in the beginning before you have an accountant who's just going to handle your books number two is you're gonna actually upgrade to an accountant uh who's going to be doing this and oftentimes this comes when you go from cash based accounting to gap which it just stands for generally accepted accounting principles that's all it is right cash is just
(57:02) money in Money out like so if I sell a three-month contract for 30 grand and I collect 30 grand today cash based accounting shows that we had thirty thousand dollars in Revenue today Gap says that we have ten thousand dollars in Revenue today as it's recognized over three months and then ten thousand next month ten thousand the month after right and so Gap Smooths out a company's financials Gap a cruise for the cost and the revenue throughout the year so that you can see over year over year how much money is increasing right it makes it easier to analyze the business level
(57:35) three of this is that you have audit ready financials and this could be in-house or out of house that you uh that you get this set up I've switched my perspective on this I used to be all about uh in-house accounting and in-house financials now you do need somebody who's in charge of that function but it just depends a lot on the business if you have a service business that doesn't require a lot of capital expense meaning you have to like invest money in forecast cash flow thing like that you don't need as advanced of
(58:00) a person for the business if you have something that's like manufacturing you need a very good Financial arm because they have to manage cash flow out to collect Goods invoices that are coming from customers as things are getting delivered payroll in between and you're managing a lot of moving Parts while also putting out orders for six months from now for stuff that you know you're going to need in forecast so like it depends on the needs of the business but I will say this one of our portfolio companies scaled over three years they
(58:26) went from you know a couple million dollars a year to a couple million dollars a month and we got to this Plateau point and I was talking to the the CEO and he's like I just don't know where the profit's going like I just I don't know if I have enough cash to open more locations or not I just like how many should I be opening he's like I'm just really struggling right now and I was like okay I want you to pause I want you to feel this feeling right now I was like it's because you don't know you don't recognize this pattern and I want you to recognize it for the rest of your life which is the feeling you have right now is a lack of Finance like you don't
(58:57) have the finance function built out and you don't have the support of Finance leaders because if you did then you would know what percentage of cash flow you could put towards it and how many locations you could have given the growth rate that you want but since you don't know that lack of knowledge that feeling of uncertainty is because you don't have that thing it would be the same as like I don't know where my next customer is coming from it's like you have a lack of the marketing function and I bring this up because you may feel
(59:20) this right now and if you feel that way it might be because you're missing this I know this one is the most boring but it's important and you will literally not sell your business for anything that's material if you do not have this audit ready financials 5 million plus in ebitda damn it the reason that this particular number is important is that most institutional investors do not want to buy companies that are smaller than this and that's usually because to get to 5 million plus in ebitda and ebit is just a fancy word for profit for the sake of our of our
(59:50) video today because usually to get 5 million plus on eBay you do have a professional management team it's not common to have a company that is doing that kind of profit and doesn't have a true management team that can run without the owner this is more of a volume or size requirement when you have a billion dollars you're never going to buy a million dollar business the time it takes for you to even analyze the business is not worth the time and I'll tell you a fun secret it takes about as much effort to help grow a one million dollar business as it does to help grow a 20 million business same effort
(1:00:14) arguably less because you have more of an infrastructure which is why people buy bigger stuff now just to give you some stats around this the S P 500 has gone from 12x to 18x historically and then today it's 23. if you made a hundred million dollars in ebitda then you'd have a 2.
(1:00:33) 3 billion dollar valuation as a company the reason I think this is so important is that a lot of small business owners overestimate the value of their business to them because they're friends amongst their friends they are the richest people they own a business that makes money but in the world of business when you're compared to Google that's what they make in the first like minute of the day right is your entire Year's revenue and I share this stuff because I made these mistakes too and I mistook the fact that I put years of time and effort into a business for it being valuable you might be thinking well how long does it take to improve this stuff like if I'm not a million or
(1:01:01) I'm at 2 million like how long does it take to improve well if you have the right tools and systems and the right plan the right who the what and the how you can get the right outcome pretty quickly I actually have my team print out our stats for this so our portfolio company on average within the first 12 months we increase Revenue by 1.
(1:01:19) 8 x so if you're making 10 million by the end of 12 months you're making 18 million not bad profit increases by 3.01 X on average so you're making two million dollars in profit at the beginning 12 months later you're at 6.
(1:01:39) 03 million dollars a year in profit I'm going to show you a little something that I haven't talked about publicly the reason that I look for companies that are at least a million usually two at minimum is that most of the companies that I like taking on are in that two to five to the six range the reason for that is because I can come in and do the things that I know I can execute our show list checklist our closing checklist our content checklist like this into a business we already know works and then go from five million dollars to quickly plug these holes that I'm talking about and then unlock 50 100 million dollars of value you might be like well is it like a one-trick thing not really because it looks like within
(1:02:13) the first 24 months so two years the average revenue increase goes to 2.8 x on average and the average profit increase is 4.7x on average that 2 million dollar profit company becomes a 9.
(1:02:30) 4 Million Dollar ebitda business think about the value difference here maybe it was worth 6 million when we came into it two years later at nine let's say it trades at seven so that would be worth 63 million that is fundamentally real data on context of how value can be unlocked all that to say if you know what to do then it just comes down to doing it a lot of people spend a lot of effort on things that are not the bottleneck now this was an example of I think a month difference or two months difference well it's like boom well that's a double great what are we gonna do for the next 22 months right well we're going to work on other parts of the business this is just the sales and show rate stuff and we've become more and more disciplined with this we only
(1:02:59) go after businesses that were like oh yeah we know exactly what we're going to do so that we can mitigate our risk big picture zooming all the way back out if you have a company and you want to make it more valuable you need to sell more customers you need to make them worth more and you need to make it more likely that it continues to happen without you which is why when you're making your MOSI Lisa Masterpiece with your best business getting a capped deltoid AKA getting big enough and having five million plus in ebitda makes you a significantly more valuable company and
(1:03:32) when you check each of those 10 boxes you make the business Masterpiece that can create the generational wealth you ultimately had and it's not about selling more it's not about making them worth more it's about making sure that those never stop happening and it doesn't matter if your business looks like this or like this or like this and so if we see that this one and this one are missing then we say great we're going to go unlock 10 million dollars in value by putting these right back in whatever the holes in the painting are the nice thing is that the end result always looks the
(1:04:03) same we know what the mosey Lisa looks like and all we have to do is paint by colors to fill in the gaps and that's how we made the companies a lot more value

Transcript:
(00:00) if you've ever struggled at the end of the month and worked all the way there to only to look at the bank account and find that there was nothing there there was too little for you to take out and then been like i literally just worked for an entire month for nothing then this video is for you all right so one of the number one issues that i see when i talk to small business owners of ms or medium-sized business owners is that they don't have an adequate grasp on the difference between gross and net margin and the reason i'm
(00:24) coloring the background green and i'm using my green pen is that margin is about the money so um this is a topic that people do not talk about it is also probably the number one thing that i look at in a business to determine its health and whether i would be interested in investing or any of those types of things so let me break down the difference between gross margin and net margin and then i'm going to tell you the functional ways that i use to fix a business alright so gross margin gross margin is what the direct cost of fulfilling your goods or
(00:56) services are and so the equation for it don't get everyone's like i don't like math it's subtraction all right it's not math that you be you're confused about if you like zone out at this moment it's because you don't want to do the thinking to understand the words i want to be really clear i'm literally going to use subtraction here all right it's the revenue how much money you're making minus the cost of goods sold all right that's the cogs now the thing is if you're in a service business your cost of goods sold isn't
(01:21) the physical products that you're selling because you're not selling those you're selling people you're selling payroll hours all right and so the cost of goods sold for a service business which is what the majority of people are listening to this are using is the incremental cost of the additional unit which means that that doesn't count your front desk roll that doesn't count your hr director it doesn't count your rent none of that stuff counts it's just the cost of one additional unit all right very important
(01:48) your net margin and i'm going to give you examples in a second your net margin is your chop right that's what it's the juice at the end of the month it's what you get after everything is paid what's left over that's what you end up taking home all right but the gross margin in my opinion well they're both obviously very important but the gross margin is the one that begets that creates the net margin and this is the one where i always focus and this is the thing that i fix and this is what i help people fix and this is the game all
(02:17) right so my revenue minus cost so let's say we're selling a service for 60 per per you know per hour that's what that's what let's just say you know you're a hair stylist or your trainer doesn't matter right you're selling 60 right in your business and your cost of goods sold let's say is 20 bucks right you're paying somebody 20 for the 60 thing you're like that sounds good there's 40 left over for me this makes sense right wrong all right and i'll get to why in a second and what number i use um but let's just do this so you can
(02:50) understand what the gross margin is here so the gross margin on this and that's assuming we're not using any product to like work on this if you were like a hair stylist for example but let's just say simply here 60 is what you're charging 20 is what it costs and 40 is left over right now what you do to figure out your margins you take that 40 right what's left over divided by the 60 of revenue which is what you got gross and what that does is it gets 66 percent that's the gross margin you'll be like oh that that sounds reasonable that's
(03:19) not that much you know that's not that bad the thing is is each incremental gross margin point is enormous and so let me show you the difference so let's say at the end of the year you're running a business that runs on 66 gross margins and let's say at the very end of the year now we're in the net margin category you uh you end up with 12 margins all right now most brick and mortar businesses run around there crazy right but that's what most brick and mortar businesses run around so if you're at 12 margins and i say
(03:47) listen you got to be at 80 people like well 80 and 66 it's not that different if you bumped your margins to 80 percent what happens at the end of the year that's 14 all right so what that does is you now have 26 net margins at the year we more than doubled we 2.2 x how much you make so do you think this is important can i double how much you make simply by changing this one number yes all right so let's use the 80 example which by the way is my rule of thumb this is the number that i get any service based business
(04:26) over all right doesn't matter what you're selling this is what you have to get over all right now i'll show you the difference between 80 90 95 100 in a second but this is important all right so if 80 uh gross margin is what i need there's two ways i can do it one i can decrease this cost right i could say that i get this to 12 12 right this becomes 12 bucks so cross that out and now my uh my new uh take home on this is 48 dollars right and so 48 dollars over 60 equals 80 so one way you can increase your margin is decreasing your cost gross margin the
(05:08) cost of actually doing the thing right the second way is by increasing how much you charge this guy right and so let's say instead of 60 and we have this 20 so what is how do we get 80 loafed over if we have a 20 cost well it's easy with this number because 20 is 20 right and so that means that you'd have to charge a hundred dollars for your 20 thing to have an 80 margin and so way number one you decrease the cost of fulfilling the thing way number two you increase the price right now this is why this is so important
(05:47) obviously i showed you at the end of the year you'd have a lot of money but besides that if you're making a hundred dollar or you're charging a hundred dollars or something right and it cost you 20 you got 80 left over all right now from that 80 and here's what's important you have to pay for everything else in the business and have enough money to market to acquire more customers and you have to have enough money uh uh to have a profit right and so it seems like you're like eighty percent alex that's crazy and so by the way all successful
(06:18) businesses the biggest businesses in the world they're not running 80 margins they're running 99 gross margins all right and you're like well they're only that's only 19 more it's actually not it's so much more than that so let me break down this difference real quick and then i'll finish this example so the difference between 80 margins 90 margins 95 margins right uh i'll just go all the way to 100 right and 100 let's do this is that difference between 80 and 90 is that this is twice as profitable as this why because it's
(06:54) half the cost right it means i took that 20 and made it 10 right that's the difference you're looking at this side of the equation not all of this all right this is between 90 and 95 gross margins again twice as profitable and what i mean by that is that you can sell twice as many people for the same cost that is the magic and that is how you scale that is how you get something that's enormously profitable allows you to acquire customers and has tons of profit kicking off every single month and so this is where a lot of
(07:24) entrepreneurs get messed up because they feel bad about charging a lot for their services or a lot for their products or whatever right the thing is is that if you do not do this you will make no profit and you will not be able to scale you will not help more people unless you get this price you got to get over this mental barrier that you have around what you're able to charge for things that don't cost you a lot of money right right okay so back to this example so if i have 80 left over that means that it depends on what my
(07:54) cost of acquisition is so let's say uh you know there's a certain percentage of my revenue that i'm willing to give for cost of acquisition let's say it's 20 right so if 20 of this i'm willing to give uh that means that 16 is what i have left to market this right because you see like you can only use it off of what's left here and you still after you pay your marketing right you still have the rest of your costs you still have rent you still have payroll you still have you know a payroll for all the non-essential stuff
(08:24) you still have software stuff all these other costs of doing business all right that have to come out of just the remainder between here and here all right this is the game and so in in sum total here if i'm looking at a business the big number that i'm looking at is 80 and that's what i i target i target any business especially for service that's over 80 and so if i'm trying to invest in something i'm trying like this is the game that we get to and so you can do this for any brick and mortar business for your business for anything
(09:00) you got to be over 80. and ideally pushing from 80 to 90 or 90 to 95 at each of these increments doubles the productivity of the business again right and that's where it gets magical and so the two ways you can do it just as a quick recap to increase your gross margin is number one you can decrease the cost and number two you can increase the price and that is how you can increase your gross margin percentage all right so i hope that was i before you hope that made sense i hope if you look at your own services and you're
(09:36) like well like what's my gross margin break it down what's the additional cost for one more person right um if i like i said earlier if i was selling something for 60 and if you don't know let's say you've got one person i'll give you one more example for this let's say you've got the type of business where one person fulfills for many people because you're like i don't know what my cost would be so i actually had this example not that long ago i was at a mastermind and a guy said he's got coaches and they coach people right and so
(10:04) i said well what are you know what are your gross margins he's like i have no idea i was like well let's walk through it together so he was paying his coach four thousand dollars a month all right that's what he was paying his coach and i said cool how many clients can your coach handle he said well um my my coach can handle uh 40 people all right 40 clients i was like okay what do you charge your clients per month he said well i sell packages and i was like all right what are your packages costing it's like they're 1200 packages i was like okay
(10:32) what does 1200 get me he said it gets you three months i'm going to give you a real world example here so please you dice dig this all right which means that it's 400 per month if you spread it out right so he's got 40 clients 400 a month is what is what they're what they're charging all right which means 40 times 400 hopefully my math is right here is 160 000 hopefully am i missing something up here i think it's 160 000 isn't it uh zero four times four thousand sixteen thousand i was like whoa um is sixteen thousand
(11:08) dollars per month right that's cool right that's neat so sixteen thousand dollars per month and the cost of the coach is four thousand right everyone following with me so it means that there's twelve thousand left over so that's what's left over after the cost and then we're just dividing it by the total revenue right which is this guy you just bring it back down so it's just 12 divided by 16 right which in this instance would be 75 so he's close to 80 but he's like well you know i don't want to change anything
(11:42) because because i'm already at 75 but remember at the end of the year the end of the year let's say you've you've got 15 margins right let's just say at the end of the year you got 15 percent bumping the extra five takes you to 20 right you're like oh wow that doesn't seem like a big difference 15 to 20 net margins at the end of the year is a 25 increase in how much money you make that is how important this is and so anyways so what would he need to do he either has to pay this guy less or he's got to charge charge more money here and so um the way
(12:18) to figure this out backwards if you wanted to if you didn't want to change excuse me if you did want to change your uh your price to get it over 80 then you simply uh basically increase what this number needs to be until it's 80 so um gosh what's the it's 1.6 times 8 whatever that is uh eight and then uh uh god it's uh 12.
(12:46) 8 yeah so that would mean that he have to get to 12 800 if he wanted to get over 80 which means he either needs to charge the the extra uh 40 clients an extra uh 200 no 20 yeah you need to charge an extra 20 bucks here right per month or he could pay this coach 3 200 per month and that is how he would get from 75 to 80 and that my friends is the game so hope you found this useful hopefully you like this hopefully you thought this was awesome if you didn't um well please tell me i just want to make stuff that you guys find valuable this is the game this is
(13:23) the stuff that i dive super deep into when i'm trying to fix a business model uh or i'm consulting with somebody and i hope you find that valuable too so anyways keeping awesome please leave a post or review or any of that good stuff and i will see you on the next one bye

Transcript:
(00:00) if you've ever struggled at the end of the month and worked all the way there to only to look at the bank account and find that there was nothing there there was too little for you to take out and then been like i literally just worked for an entire month for nothing then this video is for you all right so one of the number one issues that i see when i talk to small business owners of ms or medium-sized business owners is that they don't have an adequate grasp on the difference between gross and net margin and the reason i'm
(00:24) coloring the background green and i'm using my green pen is that margin is about the money so um this is a topic that people do not talk about it is also probably the number one thing that i look at in a business to determine its health and whether i would be interested in investing or any of those types of things so let me break down the difference between gross margin and net margin and then i'm going to tell you the functional ways that i use to fix a business alright so gross margin gross margin is what the direct cost of fulfilling your goods or
(00:56) services are and so the equation for it don't get everyone's like i don't like math it's subtraction all right it's not math that you be you're confused about if you like zone out at this moment it's because you don't want to do the thinking to understand the words i want to be really clear i'm literally going to use subtraction here all right it's the revenue how much money you're making minus the cost of goods sold all right that's the cogs now the thing is if you're in a service business your cost of goods sold isn't
(01:21) the physical products that you're selling because you're not selling those you're selling people you're selling payroll hours all right and so the cost of goods sold for a service business which is what the majority of people are listening to this are using is the incremental cost of the additional unit which means that that doesn't count your front desk roll that doesn't count your hr director it doesn't count your rent none of that stuff counts it's just the cost of one additional unit all right very important
(01:48) your net margin and i'm going to give you examples in a second your net margin is your chop right that's what it's the juice at the end of the month it's what you get after everything is paid what's left over that's what you end up taking home all right but the gross margin in my opinion well they're both obviously very important but the gross margin is the one that begets that creates the net margin and this is the one where i always focus and this is the thing that i fix and this is what i help people fix and this is the game all
(02:17) right so my revenue minus cost so let's say we're selling a service for 60 per per you know per hour that's what that's what let's just say you know you're a hair stylist or your trainer doesn't matter right you're selling 60 right in your business and your cost of goods sold let's say is 20 bucks right you're paying somebody 20 for the 60 thing you're like that sounds good there's 40 left over for me this makes sense right wrong all right and i'll get to why in a second and what number i use um but let's just do this so you can
(02:50) understand what the gross margin is here so the gross margin on this and that's assuming we're not using any product to like work on this if you were like a hair stylist for example but let's just say simply here 60 is what you're charging 20 is what it costs and 40 is left over right now what you do to figure out your margins you take that 40 right what's left over divided by the 60 of revenue which is what you got gross and what that does is it gets 66 percent that's the gross margin you'll be like oh that that sounds reasonable that's

(03:47) listen you got to be at 80 people like well 80 and 66 it's not that different if you bumped your margins to 80 percent what happens at the end of the year that's 14 all right so what that does is you now have 26 net margins at the year we more than doubled we 2.2 x how much you make so do you think this is important can i double how much you make simply by changing this one number yes all right so let's use the 80 example which by the way is my rule of thumb this is the number that i get any service based business

Transcript:
(00:00) everybody packed in let me properly introduce our guests okay so this is alex hermozy from gym launch okay so listen to me guys this is the all-time biggest internet marketer for fit fitness there ever was okay so i'm going to share my screen in just a second here and um you guys have heard me say this my one of my all-time favorite entrepreneurs is russell brunson from clickfunnels russell brunson calls alex hermosie the best sales guy that he knows he said to you one time on a vlog okay so this is a big dude
(00:36) i just said this not too long ago i ran into a situation being uh six months ago i was feeling a little caved in somebody said some stuff a couple pieces of some stuff i'm like yo alex i'm facing this dude what are your you know like what's your opinion and you basically told me what i kind of knew which was like dude it don't matter what people say about you matters what you say about you and if there's a little truth of what they're saying that's when it hurts so if you know like what you're doing what you stand for none of that [ __ ] matters and dude i snapped out of it okay so you
(01:04) guys know you know some of the stuff i've been able to achieve oh yeah this is a guy that i'm like dude this is like a big bro this guy right here is the real deal and he's here today he had a surgery and he's like mike whatever i can do to you know support the community drop some gems inspire like i'm here i got a presentation if not i'm gonna share my story whatever you need i'm here so um alex or mosey for gym launch these are 25 million dollar plaques the one thing let me give you the updated one let me give you the updated
(01:33) one bro i got i got all four i got all four i got all four bro 100 million dollars fourth one this is the michael jackson usually they said the michael jordan but these are like flats this is michael jackson of internet marketing guys big freaking deal so alex from gym lost bro welcome man good to see you either way um alex becker who's the who's the founder of that uh clued me in recently to something he's like dude your your your roads is insane because he can see everyone's revenue and their ad spend
(02:03) and i was like oh what do you mean he's like you have the highest return on ad spend of everyone in the entire platform by like a mile and i didn't really ever think about it but our lifetime return on advertising is 36 to 1. so to do over you know 100 and now you know 5 or 10 million whatever we're at now we've spent just under 3 million dollars in advertising and so there's a lot of other pieces to you know making more but just for everyone on this call we're talking specifically about sales correct
(02:37) yes so alex yeah yeah 99 of these guys are closers and they're getting closing positions a couple people are starting like a closer agency where they partner with a guy like you and they're like hey let's do like a little jb deal icelander deals okay sweet well then why don't i so what i'm going to do is because i do have a presentation um which is just how i think about sales and i have the third part of the presentation about scaling sales teams does anyone here have multiple closures to work for them
(03:06) or is is most people just closing on your own right now you guys got to talk with alex you don't bite i also can't i can't see the chat i can't see the chat we're working towards that alex okay so how about this i'll give you the things that so um russell when i first met him was like dude how did you learn how to sell so well and it was because i looked at my crm and i'd done 4 000 sales one-on-one uh in fitness and so that's a lot of reps you know i was taking 20 consults a day for like four years and so that's in person face to face my team would double the triple book me
(03:45) every 30 minutes and i just sold the same thing over and over again and because i was really good at sales i ended up not hiring a ton of sales people and i would actually have my managers set appointments for me all at one location so i had six gyms and so i would go there they'd stack up an entire day i'd mow down a whole day go to a different gym and they'd been stacking all the appointments and i'd mow down and so usually i do 20 to 25 consults a day and you just get you know you just get these reps in of reading people gauging tonality and seeing where you
(04:14) need to lean in and where you need to lean back and so um you know over time i then started training sales people and sales managers i had a remote sales team we fly we'd fly out and do turn arounds um like in person so i had eight guys we'd fly out to eight facilities every month and we turn these facilities around because i know mike you're in the fitness world before this um and then i brought that sales team in-house and they started doing phone sales for high ticket so i've had um i've had in-person phone high ticket low ticket we've kind of done a lot of those things i trained mortgage
(04:43) leads teams so kind of the whole gambit and there's definitely some things that i've seen you know i've brought every sales product on the market i bought grant stuff about balfour stuff um and i think there's a lot of merit and there's a lot of good stuff out there but in my experience uh simplicity is with scales and so i'll give you if you're okay with it i'll give you the few things that i have implemented consistently within my companies that have generated outsized returns is that cool all right so
(05:12) what i'm going to do let's rock and roll all right full jam so as i said simplicity right i'm the world's best graphic designer as you can see here so i'm trying to uh show the the real keys of the kingdom so everybody here is everybody here selling expensive stuff is that most people on this call yes everybody's high tech alex fantastic all right everyone still see me in the screen yep all right rock and roll all right so i'm guessing this guy isn't your first rodeo um not your first presentation with sexy headliner big promise and so if you have failed for you guys
(05:51) to uh grow your thing in the past i promise you it's not your fault lots of information very confusing um and you can sometimes be inundated with lots of different salespeople's information you've got mike here who's a gem and knows his [ __ ] and you guys are lucky to have him um but and hopefully in this presentation i will uh put some of those fierce rest of like what if i'm never what if i never make it what if i never turn this corner um and become the sales person i want what if i never hit the 100 grand a year what if i never hit 100 grand a month or
(06:17) whatever i don't hit the million a month goal that i have and then what does that what does that mean about me right if you've ever thought those things um like i can tell you i did too um right after the instance that i had uh mike with that individual and that individual drained my entire bank account and then sent it to their girlfriend in sweden and then filed bankruptcy after that happened i had 1200 because i had sold all my gyms and put my money into that account so i started at zero which i'm very grateful for because it gave me the experience that i have now and so what i'm going to show
(06:45) you is that you can have a simple sales process that can yield outsized returns a lot of people like to make this fancy because it makes it easier to sell stuff to people about selling but these are the things that i have seen that have unlocked the growth for us because i don't think i'm the best marketer out there i think we've simply attached a phone to a funnel and we've been very efficient at it and so as a result of that i've always been able to make more per customer than anyone else because of how efficient we are at the conversion process all right and so that's what we're here for so i want to show you exactly step by
(07:15) step our process for selling all right and so there should be uh two types of people here some of you guys who are under a hundred thousand dollars a month and i'll show you how to never compete on price again all right and if you guys are over a hundred thousand dollars a month i'll show you exactly what we did to scale a team to get to a million a month and beyond is that cool because if you're under 100 it's just you right if you're over 100 you need people all right so it's going to kind of be like the actual selling itself and then the
(07:37) scaling of the sales all right so that's kind of the goal for the 60 minutes i'll probably be able to get it done in 40-ish i'll talk fast so we can have some time all right everyone can just listen fast is that all right all right about it so i've been really fortunate um yeah now we're at 105 or 110 or whatever it is in selling stuff which has been cool what's been coolers we've been able to donate to causes you guys don't know my story but um i had a i had a gym teacher after school who stayed with me he didn't have to he didn't know me from
(08:06) anybody and he worked out with me for an entire year and taught me how to work out because i was like a really insecure kid and as a result of that i got into fitness and so i feel like it's all of our opportunity because a lot of you guys are on here like we're already in the top one percent in the world you know what i mean like we're bitching about not making 100 grand a month like [ __ ] you you know what i mean like really and so um it's been a great privilege to be able to give back and we've donated 1.4
(08:30) million just in the last three years actually 1.7 now i have to update that um but anyways just the causes that we that we care about and so for us it's it's kids being able to have the opportunity that we had all right and uh if you guys are in the fitness industry arnold was my hero is the reason i quit my job um and i've been able to you know grow a friendship with him which has been awesome um and we've had you know over a thousand clients hit a hundred thousand dollars a year using the sales framework i'm going to show you all right so like
(08:54) you can imagine that these people are not maybe as good as you are you can imagine that somebody in that thousand is probably not as naturally talented right so the process works okay and we've got a lot of people over seven figures now um but it wasn't that way right so this is me when i started my first gym i slept on the floor i had five thousand dollars total my rent was five thousand dollars um and so i had one month that i had to learn how to make money and uh i built a funnel because i learned this from the internet and i was actually i sent this picture to my dad because i was so excited
(09:23) i was so proud of this picture because i sold that many people in the first in the first two weeks uh for free um and things started to grow right that was my one of my gyms i had nine employees i felt like a badass you know my dad finally told me he thought i you know wasn't a schmuck for you know being an idiot and getting into fitness so i thought i felt like i was figuring things out and then all of a sudden facebook slap happened this is years ago there's been many slaps facebook just kind of kind of has it's it's [ __ ] hand proverbially swinging back and forth but um you know we got slapped and overnight
(09:54) my lead cost went up 5x right and so my my money my money making rain turned into a desert and the thing was my marketing was losing money every day and all i could think about was letting my dad down and more realistically having my dad be right i'm gonna i'm gonna all right cool um and so the question i asked myself was like how can i afford to get more leads right and so i called my friends up and he had he was a brick and mortar uh gym owner and he told me that things were going great for him and i was like what the hell dude what do you what are you doing he was like dude we just we just attached the phone to the
(10:23) funnel and i was like no [ __ ] he's like we're selling expensive stuff on the front end now instead of selling trials i was like well that's cool i'll do that and so we went from losing two and a half two to one to making ten to one return on the front end right what that meant for my business is i went from being able to break even at ten dollars a lead to be able to spend up a hundred hundred dollars a lead and still make money which is crazy right and so then things started grow again for me and then we you know open location after
(10:46) location and things grow and i met this guy and uh i was i was i met i joined his mastermind i was trying to i told him i wanted to create a nationwide jim jim chain and he said uh you should teach other people how you do what you do and not grow that chain and i was like well you make more money than me so okay i'll listen and so then i started making um our doing our marketing system mike this is by the way at that guy's gym um i did 191 signups in 19 days and that was the stack of contracts um some of you guys may have seen this it was like the most run ad for like a year and a half
(11:16) um but we did a hundred thousand dollars in 19 days in sales like in the ghetto all right so these are the three frameworks sorry i sped through that because we already covered a little bit of my story early so i want to get through it um and these are the free frameworks that i kind of discovered um to scale high ticket all right and it'll take if you're if you're partnering someone with someone then it'll help take their losing funnels and turn them into into cash machines and i mean that genuinely all right so the free three frameworks
(11:40) that i do is one is the closure framework all right these are the questions that get prospects to say yes all right so adding this to any kind of any funnel process is gonna instantly make it more profitable all right i'm gonna walk through the questions that we ask and specifically what only three things that you can say on a sales call period it's the number one mistake that all the sales guys that even my guys make and i have to remind them of all right the second thing is the conviction framework so anyone who believes can outperform a season sales rep by
(12:04) simply learning to control their tone all right so some of you guys right now can i get a hand i'm to unshare my screen real quick can i get hands on the screen of who here is newer to this newer to high ticket sales okay great perfect then this is for you i'm going to show you how you can beat the best sales reps all right and this is how i never ever hire seasoned closers just fyi no no it's not like we're going to trade trading sales people so i don't um but i'm going to show you how you can beat season prep season prize all right
(12:36) which if i can find my presentation there we go um by learning control your tone and the last one is scaling so for all you guys who are over a hundred thousand dollars a month and need to scale a team i'm going to show you how to duplicate the skill in other people all right because it's one level of the skill is learning to sell another level of the skill is teaching to sell and it's a more valuable skill so if you can duplicate your skill in someone else that is how you can make 10 times 100 times more money because it's no longer you're no longer constrained by your
(13:05) time all right so let's rock and roll close your framework so after pouring over like hundreds of scripts like i mean hundreds of scripts um i realized that there was always like these minor differences in wording but if i hit these kind of main milestones along the way i ended up closing the sale right and the nice thing is that this process works for b2c and b2b so i don't know what stuff you're selling but it works for both and it'll work for 500 tickets as much as 100 000 tickets the process is the same all right and the way i teach my sales teams and now thousands of clients
(13:35) is this acronym right and like even when i'm thinking through sales calls we use we're like closer c right l so the c is clarify why the person is on the phone with you right that's the objective why are you here why'd you take the time to take the call what's the problem right what are we trying to solve here after that they were like got it so what i'm hearing is you're struggling with this does that sound about right i'm going to label you with a problem after that we overview their past paid so it's like okay so you have this problem i can't be the first person to talk to you about this tell me a little
(14:07) bit about what you've done so far to try to try and get past this all right tell me more about that how that work out for you okay understood after that it's like okay so i'm hearing all these things this is why you're here this is what you're trying to get this is what you've tried and hasn't worked okay well can i tell you about how i think we might be able to solve your problem this is where we saw the vacation right and then finally step before finally we explain away their concerns so this is where we tell them about the program and then we're like do you want to do it they say yes or no if they say no then we explain
(14:37) away their concerns so they say yes and then once they say yes we reinforce the decision and this last r here is a point that i added years later because we realized that the sale the sale just continues throughout the entire customer relationship right and so for you guys if you're dealing with clients uh who you're selling for you have to also sell them on continuously selling right you might have closed the card or closed the first payment but their onboarding experience they got to close them again and then after that when they have their first week check-in call they got to get
(15:07) closed again because we have to consistently sell them on why they should do anything why should they not just watch netflix why should they why should they take action why should they have the discomfort of getting you know smacked on the phone by a stranger right why should they why should they feel the sting of failure we have to sell them consistently to help them overcome their pains right and so i'll show you some of these more closely so clarifying why they're there right it's like what made you come in today what
(15:29) made you reach out what's your goal right now why is that important to you right okay helping me understand what what are we doing here right this is one where someone in the beginning like you have to hit this because if someone says like you know i just wanted to find out more information you're like cool but why like what did you want the information to solve what was the like i'm sure you don't just go around collecting information all day right like there's something you're trying to get out of this what's the problem and then they and
(15:54) then you get what you need you're like got it okay so just so i'm hearing you right it sounds like this is your goal correct then they acknowledge they have a problem this is important because they have to say it they have to own it i can't cure cancer until you admit that you have it right we got to give it to you before we can cure it after that we overview the past right so it's like what have you tried so far to accomplish this how long did you do it for how long ago how did that work for you what else have you tried we call this the pain cycle right we consistently do this over and over again so we've exhausted all
(16:23) options right at that point we have tons of ammo that we can use later in the clothes which i'm sure you're aware of right and the big piece here is we explain how it's not their fault because if they had this missing piece or two of the equation they were halfway there they were three quarters the way there they were just missing this one piece which we're going to provide for them right and the nice thing is is for most of you hopefully you're selling a a holistic solution right so for example i'm going to use a fitness example
(16:47) because mike's from from that background too if someone came in and said they've tried workouts in the past and be like i'm not telling you don't that you don't need to work out it's great but you also need the nutrition and the accountability right you need nutrition to make sure they stop eating [ __ ] because if you just start working on eating donuts it's not going to work right of course now if i make you the best plant in the world but you don't follow it's not going to work either that's why you need the accountability that's what i'm here for and so from that point that's kind of how you can naturally transition so it's
(17:08) like i'm hearing these things this is what you were missing well do you any how the program works because i think we might be able to solve that for you they'll say yes all right so what we've seen is that there's three things that make clients successful right and at this point this is my belief is that three things has been you know unequivocal in most pitches is that i think it's human brain is that you can't take more than three but typically it's like three pillars to the to the stool or three you know finishing accountability if i was
(17:33) selling leads i'd want them to be you know timely uh you know qualified and you know uh exclusive right there'll be three elements to make without what makes a good lead right there's always three that you can usually find when you're selling a solution and most times not most times every time if you're on the phone with the prospect you always have the upper hand because they have admitted at the beginning of this phone call that they have a problem they have not solved it and so inherently they're going to be missing one of the keys they cannot have them all or they would not be on the phone so
(18:03) you have a you you you are in an unlosable situation unless you choose to lose it right unless you choose to lose the frame and so in this instance it has been my experience that we use stories short anecdotal stories to to break the belief of the prospect around a topic what's important here is that we don't get into uh jargon right we don't get into technobabble and talking about the program and the modules and the the things they're going to do because all of that sounds like work and that's not what
(18:36) they're there for they're there for a result right and so instead i would say something like with the fitness nutrition accountability like i said earlier so if i was trying to explain accountability i'd be like listen you don't have accountability when you were a kid you ever like have your parents tell you to brush your teeth they were like yeah like you know you're like i don't want to i don't want to and they would tell you oh no you got to go brush your teeth and you go you brush your teeth you sulk back to bed and next night you do the same thing they say brush your teeth
(19:00) you go first you go back to bed but you're an adult now right you brush your teeth they're like yeah and that's because you had external accountability that turned into an internal habit right and that's what we're going to do for you here right so i didn't tell them about [ __ ] the coaching call that they're going to have and the post that they're going to have and the blah blah blah we told them as the result of that we gave them an anecdotal story that made sense to them that's probably a really key point i
(19:23) just want to drive home here is that when you have your pitch part it shouldn't be longer than three minutes like tops because no one really gives a [ __ ] and at the end of the day the reason they're gonna buy is gonna be because of how understood they feel so how much when you went through that overview of the pain you were able to restate back to them accurately exactly how they felt and the struggles they are experiencing which is why you need to shut the [ __ ] up when they're talking right and so there's only three things
(19:53) that are ever said on a sales call do you guys know what they are there's only three things that ever come out of your mouth questions restatements and anecdotal stories which is the story that i just referenced the three stories that you will use to break a belief that's it so this that's how you sell them the vacations you have these little sound bites right i'll give you another example so if i was doing um if i was doing food right i'm like listen uh three parts of the program finish your shirt accountability so nutrition wise you've got to eat stuff that's gonna
(20:25) make you lose weight can we agree on that yes okay cool but the problem is you don't want to do that right that's why we're here right right okay so let me ask you a question when uh do you feel like what's your favorite tv show they're gonna be like uh whatever game of thrones you're like okay game of thrones do you feel like you need to get like motivated to watch game of thrones like man i was trying to watch it tonight but i just couldn't you know i just i just i got really busy and i just couldn't sit down on the couch and turn the tv on i couldn't do it right
(20:53) of course not because you look forward to it because you wanted to do it and the key that we're going to do here is we're going to get you to look forward to the foods that you're eating because if you look forward to you don't need to be motivated because you do it on your own because you like it does that make sense right so what i didn't talk about the macros and the carb cycling and the intermittent fasting and the calorie counting and the blah blah blah because the end of the day that does not matter what they want is for them to solve the
(21:20) problem and have it be pain-free right and that's what we're explaining to them so that's selling the vacation right and this is a saying that i've used for a long time which is cellification not the plane flight right and so this is what everyone else talks about they're like sir for us to get you these results you're gonna have to take your pants off you're gonna have to jump through this loop you're gonna have to go through the tsa the airport lines pack your suitcases take your shoes off do the layovers connect your flights uh have a person farting next to you
(21:42) don't worry they don't have covet you'll have tourbillons probably on the plane then as soon as you're out you think you're done you stop the way to baggage claim they probably lost your bag right and in our world it's your modules your meal plan your macros your workouts your support team your urls your domains your funnels you're targeting your ads and the other [ __ ] that doesn't matter right but instead what they want is you sell maui final destination and you always sell the same thing because the difference is only the level of
(22:06) service and how they want to get there right if you have multiple levels of service so do they want to swim to maui to where they're trying to go they're sharks and you could drown or get robbed right like this chick crazy uh do they want to take a boat to maui it'll take a little longer there's no shark attacks but there's still no wi-fi and you're kind of you know in the sun do you want to take a normal flight to maui get there a little faster still smells bad has security bad food but you're going to get there or do you take a private jets in maui right direct non-stop champagne on the plane suitcase is packed when you arrive
(22:34) right and so that's the selling piece e is explaining away their concerns and so these are the questions that sound like um so there's i'm sure mike has already taught you a lot of the uh the obstacle overcome concepts right so fundamentally there's three big ones right price and rather than teach you like the uh the the drilling of the obstacles i told you there's two things you need to memorize one of them are the stories the second are the obstacle overcomes right because those are the things that
(23:01) you're in the red zone like that's not where you start thinking about what you're gonna say all right so the two things that you need to memorize as a salesperson are the stories about what you sell and the obstacles that you're going to encounter when you're in the red zone the questions on the front end you need to know the milestones you need to hit in order to move forward and this is one of the big mistakes i'm sure mike talks about a lot which is you need to sit in the pain if someone does not clarify why they need a solution you do not ask for the sale if they're
(23:31) if we just say hey you know what what brought you here today i just want to find out more information okay cool so you know let me tell you about the program like that's not we didn't get the [ __ ] like we don't know why they're there we don't know what their goals are like one of the things drives me nuts about my team sometimes is i'm like dude we're eight minutes in the conversation i was like i don't know how many clients they have i don't know what their revenue is i don't know what their profit is i don't know what their biggest pain and struggle was right now i'm like what are you doing i'm like you just
(23:55) told them they're like oh gym launches 100 million dollar company i'm like they don't give a [ __ ] but they do my sales guys because they get their egos puffed up right but has nothing to do with the prospect they do not care right they only care about them so right right yeah the issue right everyone talks way too much about the product and so when you're training sales people you don't train them on the product you train them on the prospect the product doesn't matter i mean it matters obviously from like how you're going to make money because you have to do a good job because i'm going to get that in the second point but in terms of when you
(24:30) are selling and training someone if you guys know someone or know a specific niche really well then you will know their pains and if you have a new salesperson you hear them say [ __ ] and you're like that's not what he thinks what is he doing he might know the product perfectly but he just said that the guy's problem was not the problem and so then it doesn't matter what the product is because he doesn't feel like it's for him even though it's totally for him but you just misarticulated the problem
(24:54) that's where the clarity has to happen if you nail that the rest of the pitch is easy all right and so the key here is relying on past agreements that have already been made so this person with their partner with their spouse with their business you know whatever has ar that person knows that there's a problem and they also don't approve of that problem and so why would they be in any way against remedying a problem that they already don't approve of right and then finally we always tack on sometimes it's better as for forgiveness than permission right hahaha depends on
(25:23) the ticket sale right but you can get those in right and then obviously last last case here is you just do a delayed close and say let's get your card down we could put a down payment we can pay the rest on friday and if between now and then you know your partner comes back and says no man i want to be poor i want to keep struggling and like i want to never make money and like continue to do this for the rest of our lives then i'll absolutely tear up the contract don't worry about it right finally you've got stalls right i
(25:49) need to think about it so these are because people don't people are afraid of making mistakes right people are afraid of making mistakes and because of that they don't like making decisions because it's easier to let life make the decision for you and so they like doing it that way because then they feel like it's not their fault right and so i mean a great obstacle for this is what's your main concern which is usually my number one thing i go to when someone's like you think about it's like totally what's your main concern right let's think about it together right and so fundamentally these are the
(26:22) things that they need to know do you feel like what we're doing can meet your needs and solve the problem yes or no yes do you want to work with us as a company do you like our values do you like what we stand for do you believe what we believe about the world yes do you have access to funds or know someone who does yes well then let's rock and roll because those are the only things we know to me to make the decision right do you like the product do you like us and do you have the money to do it that's it simple as that right and so when we walk through those if you encounter
(26:52) these situations obviously there's you know if you're going to do it now sooner or they don't see the value later you didn't articulate it they have an objection on decision maker usually because you [ __ ] something up earlier in the sale but at this point you're in the red zone so you got to deal with it so you rely on past agreements if they come with a stall then you help them confront a decision and make a logical choice and teach them how to make a decision that in that moment you say what are you most afraid of happening i'm afraid you just you're
(27:27) afraid of me taking the money right just taking your money and you getting nothing right again well let me tell you how that's not going to happen right you can bring their concerns all right then finally they say yes and you're like awesome and this is where if you're selling for someone else get them to send a personalized video like hey johnny saw you just signed up with us today super pumped to have you uh you're gonna be meeting with heather tomorrow she's gonna get you kicked off um you should in the mail get a special gift so keep look out for that
(27:50) and then uh you know send a handwritten card if someone just bought a really expensive thing people are making their decision about whether they believe in you as a company within the first 48 hours after the sale they make a decision of whether or not they're going to be with you in the long term and how they are treated in the first 48 hours after they give you money so it's critical and it's usually in that point that people [ __ ] up and just ignore them framework two and you know mike i can stop i'll just do framework two and then we can do the q a because if i don't have time to scale
(28:18) the sales teams i can hit on the points later um so this is a big one for everyone who is who's newer to sales all right if you believe you can outperform the season sales rep by learning control your tone all right and so i reworked all of our scripts into the closer framework and the thing is immediately some people were crushing it right while others were still not selling [ __ ] and i was like what the [ __ ] right so i talked to my friends and they were like dude you should read this book by jordan buffer and the biggest thing that i got from the book was just he was very specific
(28:47) about tonality and that was a big shift for me and just learning to teach how to ask the question not just asking the question right and so in the book he talks about having the same issue that i had with scaling sales like i give the script to two guys some guy crushes some guys i'm like what the [ __ ] right and the thing is there's a hidden dialogue that the sales team does not know that they are talking it right and so the words are not going to be enough all right they're just literally ten percent so the words that you have it might be the most tested script in
(29:19) the world it's still only ten percent ninety percent is how you say the words right because how you say what you say is tonality like right now i can give everyone hears you know jerry seinfeld stand up script you could read it it wouldn't be funny right because it's not just that you had the script it's how you deliver it right and that takes time to develop right and that's kind of unconscious mastery and so there's two ways to do this all right that i have found you can either trick yourself into it or you can
(29:48) train yourself to do it all right and since we don't have enough time to uh to train on the influence of tonalities here's the trick that i teach all right conviction will correct your tone conviction made real so um let me tell you this story so i was i was brought in to do a day of consulting for this mortgage leads company to train their sales team and the first half of the day i reworked the whole script i put the closure framework made it a question-based um sale and then i came in and they were
(30:17) expecting me to like rain you know fire and brimstone on these guys and so i sat down and i was like who's the guy you having trouble there was this guy john so i was like john and they were selling leads i was like john i'll go to the leads he was like well you know and i was like we're good thanks and i was like let me show you how you would answer it if you actually believed the leads were good i was like you'd say like dude these leads are [ __ ] unbelievable right now i'm studying for my real estate exam so i can get in on these leads my aunt is a realtor and she has more business that she can handle and i'm sending her
(30:47) traffic i'm trying to get my my my brother to do it with me i'm not sure how long i'm going to work here because these leads are killing it for us right if you believe in the product you don't need to have all the sales skills you'll do it the right way because you'll actually want to help the person so that's why the most important part of the sale is the product because unless you're a malicious person like most people here was everyone here have some level of ethics on some level like no near just wants to like take someone's last dollar right so
(31:18) then the only way to sell hard because if you're going to close you've got to sell hard the only way to sell hard is to believe through and through balls to bones when you look at yourself in the mirror at night this is what i talked about mike said in the very beginning like what happens when people start hating on you the only way that i've been able to stay where we're at in the gym industry mike knows the amount of hate that i get right the only women will do that is that i read the testimonials the thousand of them
(31:43) that i have of gyms who have gone to six figures of the hundred gyms we've taken to seven figures right like i know beyond a shadow of a doubt that our product works i also know that if you sign up for a gym not everyone loses weight and i'm willing to deal with that i i'm willing to give everyone the opportunity to change their life so here's the tactics around this re-read testimonials out loud daily in front of your sales team all right and if the business that you're working for doesn't have testimonials find another business all right i'm serious you're not gonna be able to close unless you're
(32:16) like literally unless you're unethical you're not gonna be able to close so go find something that is a good product because there's plenty of them out there all right find a good product that you believe in you see tons of testimonials and then read those every day in front of the team all right second well this is for the business owners but fix everything you possibly can about the product all right and never blame a customer for lack of success so as much as there are people who have not been successful who've used
(32:41) gym launch i still take the fact that they were not successful and i think what could i have done that would have made the next person like them successful and you plug the hole right if you do that over and over and over and over again you know truly at the end of the day when you look at yourself in the mirror when no one else is watching whether or not you truly put the effort forward that merits the price that you are charging right only you can know that and the thing is is like the reason sales people get beat up is because they don't put the work in
(33:09) and then it grates on their soul and then eventually they burn out they burn out not because they can't handle no but because they can't handle how they feel about themselves right and so you have to put the work in to have the conviction because that's what's going to get you through it if you've ever met someone who's a born-again christian all right they are convicted they do not care how many people tell them to shove it because they are trying to save people's souls it's real like if you let that hit you it's real you know what i mean and if you can be a disciple of whatever
(33:44) the product that you have an evangelist in the truest terms then all the scripting stuff it won't matter why are some of the best sales people clients who had success because they believe in it that's it and the most convicted person will always win the fight right they'll always lead the dance because they have conviction in their skepticism you have conviction in your product and one of you is going to win out right and it's the question is whose belief is stronger because belief isn't binary it's not do i believe or do i not believe it's how much do i believe to
(34:13) what extent do i believe would i bet a thousand dollars on this product or about 10 000 on this product would i sell my mother this product think about it if you would sell your mother this product how convicted are you probably very and you will have no problem closing deals and notice that i have a lower tone right now so that you listen to the words that i'm saying so you think that they're important in terms of uh the training schedule 60 minutes a day five days a week my guys do world-class sales training they text
(34:42) me in the morning before they wake up they text me once they're done uh they do the first 25 minutes they read the script out loud five minutes they draw obstacles i need to think about it i need to talk to my partner um this is expensive and then they talk they draw the second half right as a closer you got to talk you got to listen you got to train both skills all right the talking's the tone and saying the words the right way and the right sequence without having to think about it the listening is going over recording and figuring out what went right what went wrong and what we're going to
(35:09) do next time and saying it drilling it as a team marking it and moving to the next one that's the short answer i appreciate that and i love the conviction by the way i can tell that this isn't scripted or anything and you're just going like your full heart out there yeah so i'm on instagram at appromozy my youtube is alex ramosey my podcast if you just type in alex mosey i've got a book some power yeah if you guys want i've got a book called alex's alex's book.com um it has 35 pages of obstacle overcomes
(35:41) in the appendix for each one of those obstacles if you guys want to go grab that there's i think there's a there's a sales training in there for like 100 bucks too if you want to grab it you can grab it it's very good [Music] i do it because i know it's so good people buy other [ __ ] so it's worth the money um hell yeah alex thank you bro thank you

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MD5-HByRxoA

Transcript:
(00:00) six years ago i told clients of jim launch that they should stop making content because they were wasting their time i was partially right and partially wrong and in this video i want to break down the shift that i've had in terms of content marketing and its role within a business the five phases in building a content marketing machine and how to focus on one of two primary objectives with content marketing and so if you don't know who i am my name is autry mosey i own acquisition.
(00:26) com we're full of companies right now does over 150 million dollars a year i make these videos because i hope that you use the stuff you make a bunch of money and then you come and join acquisition.com so we can invest in your business that's why i do it let's rock and roll with the phases of content i'm going to walk through the five phases and then i'm going to talk about which of the objectives you're solving for each of these and then finally like an out scale version all right phase one is you make something and you post it that's it you just gotta
(00:47) post something sometime somewhere and believe it or not a lot of you guys haven't even done phase one which is why i have to outline it number two is that you post something consistently you create a cadence or a calendar around when you post you find a platform that you like ideally one that you're probably already using and you just post again after you post it once and you say you know what this was seven days apart if i do this every seven days i will now be consistent for me i just know that there's one day a week that i do all my
(01:13) marketing stuff what i do on that day changes but it's always marketing related that's what's worked for me maybe it'll work for you the third phase you post you post reliably and you do it on all platforms that's a massive increase in the amount of volume that you are posting this is when it transitions in terms of objectives and i'll get to the objectives in a second phase four is that you go from posting just even once on every platform on a regular cadence to maximizing how much every platform can take the short form
(01:38) platforms can take sometimes five ten posts a day like twitter or tick tock facebook reels at this moment rules change all the time if you have a news feed style or you have an audience that it's pushing stuff to they tend to fatigue faster and they don't want to get overwhelmed with one person that's usually where you get capped at it one or two times a day and so what you have to do is look at all the platforms figure out what the max amount is that you can publish on a platform and then all you do is you crank the volume on
(02:02) all of them at the same time that's phase four most people never even get to phase four and then phase five you go from creating for all of those to capturing and creating for example if i wanted to have a show where everybody called in and i could repurpose all that stuff across content that would be me deliberately creating content in a way across all those channels but not only creating but also capturing so that i could further enhance my reach and the amount of volume that i created and the big rule with volume that i have is that
(02:26) there's no such thing as too long only too boring the second rule that i have is quality over quantity but quality quantity wins over quality in order to know what is quality it usually takes reps to get good and so you will probably do a lot in the beginning and it will probably suck comma and that's okay because it is a requisite for getting good you start by sucking and then you get better and then eventually you suck so little you're actually good the difference between phase one and two and phase three four five is the
(02:52) objective if you're doing phase three four five the objective is to generate new customers from content and it's different than phase one and phase two where the only reason you can do that is just to have lead nurture just to give you guys some sales stuff just to give you guys some fodder and just test some hooks those are the five phases if you're a small business owner that costs time and that costs money so what do you do i actually have had this conversation with probably half of our portfolio companies in the last three months what
(03:16) is the role of organic marketing play in the business from concept of acquiring customers that's why we do this stuff right we do this to acquire customers if you have other ways of getting customers which for most of you would be manual outbound affiliates or paid ads besides referrals and if those are the primary channels you do not want to take your eye off the ball on that that's what's paying the bills that being said the purpose or the objective of having the organic content is lead nurture not lead generation so what happens is someone
(03:41) comes in through an affiliate someone comes in through a paid ad someone comes in through a manual app on because you had an sdr call them or they got a cold email what do they do they look at your social profile they look at your website and they say is this person legit the only litmus test you have to pass there is that you've posted something recently that's not [ __ ] that's really it they'll probably consume two three four pieces of content and say this guy or this gal knows what they're talking about this is
(04:02) recent enough that i know that they're still in business this is a legitimate business that's all we're trying to accomplish here and if you do start to have content that starts performing better than others that gives you two things one is it gives the sales guys content that they can proactively feed to the prospects and so what you should build is a master excel sheet of your best content of all time because there is some content that you've made knowingly or unknowingly that convinces more people to buy from you on that
(04:25) content sheet you'll have what are the faqs what are the types of questions that people ask on sales calls which gives you great fodder for the types of content you make in the future and again you do it for one for the sales team and two for marketing you do it for the sales team because as soon as they have that question they can send that as a reply between call one and call two to close a prospect or if they have the question that they found out before the call they can send it to them beforehand increase the likelihood they close but
(04:46) that's the first tangential benefit besides nurture that making this content helps you with the second one is that it gives you an idea of what you can start leading with on your paid side they're disproportionately saving it disproportionately sharing it when you run paid ads you can look at your organic content be like dude i don't know what it is people went nuts for this if for some reason this headline or this hook worked well you weave it into every one of your cold emails and you can split test it and say wow this beat
(05:08) our control and so think of the the content you're making as just low risk ways of testing hooks and headlines to get people to buy from you phase one and phase two if you're in one of those camps you don't need to do anything else that's it that's all you gotta do if you wanna know what it looks like to actually use content marketing as a way to generate leads phase three which is your posting once a week or on some cadence on all platforms the purpose of phase three is learning what packaging looks like on each of the platforms if
(05:34) you've ever seen that meme that had like tinder linkedin facebook and like instagram platforms are all a little bit different same person just packaged a little differently this tweet here then getting put into a tick tock then also getting put into a youtube short and then also getting put into a reel it's the same concept the same subject matter but we package it a little bit differently phase fours you then say great i feel like we finally get each of these platforms and this [ __ ] takes time it takes probably six months and
(05:59) this is if you have means to pay for the stuff but i'll get into the cost in a second maxing out the platforms which is phase four number five is actively creating so candidly right now i'm barely scratching phase five we're actually just dialing on phase four which is maximizing across all platforms we're not really there yet we're maxed out on probably half the platforms i'm mostly making that's what we're doing right with 345 you're actually making good enough content that the platforms are serving it to new audiences because
(06:23) they are able to grow the amount of time people spend on the platform because your stuff is good they pay you an impressions for providing value to their audience more followers more likes all that stuff you still have to have a way to convert those people into customers and so the way to do that is just having call to actions for example if you're a business doing three million dollars or more and you're an internet business go to acquisition.
(06:44) com you can fill out the stuff for a minority investment that's what we do put that into your content and then the rest of your time you're just providing value you don't need to get fancy with it you don't want to be one of those guys who just pitching all the time a lot of people oversell the small amount of demand they have so they can never grow the audience the more you give the more you grow the more you take the more you shrink and when you do it that way you never go hungry because you always have more people knocking on your
(07:04) door than you have seating in your in your house from a cost perspective there's time cost there's long term cost and there's money cost if you start doing content as your way of getting customers expect it to take a long time i started making content for acquisition.com about 18 months before we really started seeing any kind of deal flow or growth across the platforms if you think about this as a long-term play i still believe that fame is the most efficient business model all right it's one of the best ways to arbitrage
(07:28) making money but it takes time and no one's willing to wait which then gives you a competitive advantage because patience is one of the ultimate advantages is that you're just willing to do things for an unreasonably long period of time without thinking you're smarter than you really are a quote from neil strauss even at phase three it's going to be pretty much beyond your capacity to actually create capture edit and distribute across all platforms you're not gonna be able to do it on your own and so you need some degree of
(07:50) leverage that leverage is gonna come in the form of labor you're gonna have to pay people to help you out in the beginning the more costly way of doing it but faster is to have vendors so to have people who are specialists on each of these platforms because what they're going to do is get you up to speed five times faster they're gonna already know all the mistakes that people normally make now one thing they have to look out for for vendors and this is especially important you know for me is that most vendors are data driven and what i mean
(08:13) by that is they get obsessed with clicks and views and impressions and subscribers that's good to a degree it's okay to be satisfied with a smaller audience that's just the type of person that you're actually looking to attract it's hard to make this shift and it's really hard to ram it down their throats because most clients that pay them only care about those things because they don't know what else to measure just because it's easy to quantify doesn't mean it's important the values that you have the messages that you want to get out there
(08:38) who you're trying to reach will be more important than the quantitative metrics are those good litmus tests in terms of if nothing you ever have hits yeah you should probably pay attention to that but if only one specific type of thing hits and it's not core to who you are you got to be able to resist that temptation because otherwise you're going to build this audience doing stuff you don't want to do attracting people you don't want to be with for us to put out the stuff that we put out right now across all platforms for layla and i
(08:59) cost about 70 000 a month that's to put out roughly 160 pieces of content a week you're like oh my god like i know it's a lot that's because we're trying to promote we're using this instead of using paid ads so if i were to just pay for the impressions it would cost me about 2 million a month to get the impressions that right now cost me about 70 000 a month i have a lot of cost savings doing it organically the lever on that though is how good you are and that's tough and it probably sounds weird for me to even say this so take it
(09:27) the way that you probably or hopefully know that i mean it most people talk about stuff that they don't have the right to talk about just because you call yourself an expert doesn't make it true and so the question is how narrowly can i define the problem that i solve so that in that tiny world in that pond i am king you might not be the best business person in the world i'm not but the question is of all the sources of information that are both entertaining and educational is the stuff that you put out there good enough that people
(09:51) are like i will pay attention to this person because if you've ever struggled to give away your services for free it's because the biggest cost isn't your price if people aren't willing to pay for it with their attention then it has other costs which is it's not worth their attention why should this person listen to me and why is this worth their time if you can answer those questions in the content that you're making in a tangible way that their life is going to get better as a result they'll come back and tell their friends i'm not andy
(10:14) versailles i'm not gary vee i'm not at my lead i'm not all closing in on a billion dollars plus i'm not grant cardone well don't try and compete with them but if you're like hey i'm the fastest toilet fixer in this side of tuscaloosa you might only be competing in three guys if you have evidence you are beyond reproach if someone looks at you and says like hey man your content's crap you can be like this is how you fix toilets i'll try and be more entertaining next time but this is how you fix them and you have evidence that
(10:37) you fix 500 toilets this way first you're fixing toilets and then you're talking about how you can expand a plumbing business and then you're talking about how you can expand a local business and then you're talking about marketing on whatever specific method you use to grow your thing and then you're talking about expanding an enterprise and then lo and behold you're a business expert but it takes time if you're a small business owner you can do the first two phases just post about stuff make sure it's valuable just to
(10:56) make sure that you are a legitimate looking business that looks like it's doors say open on it that's all we're trying to accomplish and help the sales guys out if you want to make content marketing your actual lead generation machine then you need to invest in it the same way you invest in it for paid marketing you're going to probably have to have vendors you're probably over time what you learn from your vendors you're going to bring employees in-house and you're going to teach it to them and then you start scaling the volume up
(11:16) internally and then phase 5 you go max out mode right you start cranking out on everything and then you start creating stuff specifically but when you're doing that at that phase you probably don't need to worry about this video

My Evidence Based Guide to Making Money Online [TIER LIST] - YouTube
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wR8KoE8u1p0

Transcript:
(00:00) I've grown my brand to over 10 million subscribers across all platforms and in this video I'm going to break down by tier which of these platforms has the highest potential for making you money with my real up-to-date stats and where I'm investing for the next year so let's start with Tik Tok so if we're going to analyze platforms based on how much money-making potential they have inside of them then these are the stats that I care about first is who so who's on this platform if there's a platform with tons of kids on it versus people who have gazillions of dollars I'd rather be on the one with gazillions of dollars how
(00:32) many of those people are on the platform is it is a function of how much market share that particular platform is captured of my ideal who next we have what's my ability to grow on the platform some platforms are really easy to grow some platforms are really hard to grow the next one is the depth because I don't want people to just recognize my face although that is good but I would much rather have them have a good relationship with me where I can provide tons of value which then increases the likelihood of them converting and then finally I'm going to
(01:00) give you the results that I have now underneath of depth I'll also give you a little bit more intrinsic stats like average view duration average percentage viewed so you can look at your own stats and kind of have that as a benchmark so let's start with who I looked at Pew research to see which percentage of platforms have $100,000 families or higher and how many of them are on that platform want to know what it is for Tik Tok it's 27% all right so 27% of families so almost one out three out of four are not
(01:29) on Tik Tok who make over $100,000 a year that was surprising to me but when you hear some of the rest of the stats it will become less surprising the next question is how many do we have here and so this is a function of market share within the United States which on Tik Tok is 33% now we're like Okay so we've got a lowish amount of people who make money there's 33% market share across the us at least now let's talk about growth now on Tik Tok growth is one of the highest and best components of Tik Tok as in it's one of the easiest ones to grow but I will say that in recent history it's become harder and harder to
(02:05) grow and because of the way that they've changed the algorithm what we've noticed is that shorts on one platform NE don't necessarily work on Tik Tok anymore and so now it's platform specific something that works on Facebook reals might not work on Instagram reals that might not work on YouTube shorts which might not work on Tik Tok and so it's actually becoming more and more fragmented which is why this video is so important so you put your attention where it matters most with all that being said Tik Tok still
(02:30) ranks high among the Platforms in terms of discoverability and your ability to grow from zero meaning it favors newer creators now it still may be hard but it still favors people equally versus other platforms where they still skew towards larger creators so when it comes to depth our next marker it's about how much time are they going to actually spend per unit of content that we put out so Tik Tok ranks really low here so on the low side you get something like five seconds to 20 seconds at least these are the statistics that we have on
(03:04) the low to high side in terms of duration per view now mind you that's not a lot of time to provide a ton of value especially it's just someone's immediately scrolling immediately scrolling and if you absolutely murder it and you get 25 seconds from them I think the main benefit you get is that they just recognize your face I can almost tell whenever I get recognized in public when someone is a Tik Tok viewer because they're like you're that guy I don't know your name but yeah I see you right versus people on like YouTube are like dude you've changed my life you've
(03:32) made me so much money you're the best I know your name I bought your book it's completely different Avatar in terms of the experience so then we have conversion now Tik Tok has two things that are kind of interesting that you might not know so number one jenzy prefers Instagram DMS to Tik Tok DMS and so in terms of your ability to convert people from Tik Tok it actually tends to be significantly lower now for very low ticket things things like Tik Tok shop are coming out are having massive adoption which is encouraging but if you're selling any kind of services which 78% of businesses are this one's
(04:04) kind of tough and so I'm going to put this as low and to be clear Tik Tok a couple years ago was amazing for new creators because it was the first one that had short videos which is easier for someone to get into it's much harder to write make a 20 minute high production nice valuable piece of content for YouTube versus a 15-second short that you can put on Tik Tok but then the other platforms caught on and you got YouTube shorts Instagram reels the Facebook reels uh and all the other platforms that have short LinkedIn has shorts now like they're all over the
(04:33) place and so let's get to the results and this is where it gets really crazy and so I have almost 900,000 followers on Tik Tok at the point of this video and the amount of traffic that I get from my Tik Tok despite being about a tenth of my follower account is only 2.
(04:59) 5% of all of the traffic that goes to my page which I've tracked on our CRM and so it basically has 1/4 the effectiveness per unit compared to the other platforms which means that some other platforms are disproportionately making up the volume and the whole reason I wanted to collect all this data for me was because there was a business owner who was a winner of the school games so school.
(05:24) com games and when he came out he was like yeah it's really weird I have 800,000 on Tik Tok and I have 200,000 on Instagram but 90% of my Revenue comes from Instagram and I thought about that and I was like wait a second so think about this the amount of time that he spends on Tik Tok could he spend all of that time on Instagram and get 10% more to make up for all of it and the answer is probably yes and so that totally changed my perspective in terms of thinking wait a second we want to grow everywhere but there's definitely some platforms where we get higher returns for our Avatar which is business owners and so for you and your
(05:54) avatar looking at the stats should give you where you should put your time so you can make the most money especially if you're on a budget and you can't do 10 platforms right you can maybe just do one or two you should do the ones that make you the most and by the way if you want to check out one of our workshops you can go to acquisition.
(06:12) comom we'd love to talk to you it's for business owners only so if you don't have a business go to school.com and we can H you star one with all this taken into consideration what am I doing with my Tik Tok strategy I am rating it an f and it's something that I'm not putting a ton of time and attention into because there are other platforms that are making me way more per unit of time money and effort I'm putting in and one more thing that my team just told me about Tik Tok real quick is that the average session length of someone going from tiktop to
(06:40) acquisition. my website is 8 seconds now you'll see some of the ones later are way higher so the next platform is the tubes which if you're watching this on YouTube then this is for you so we're going to cover the same metrics as before and we're going to start with who what percentage of families over 100k are here survey says eight 89% so take that in consideration versus Tik Tok which was much much lower than that all right people who have money are on YouTube the next thing is what percentage of the United States is on
(07:13) here 83% all right so you've got a huge percentage of the people who are making the most money on the platform and so growth for this platform really comes down to how discoverable is your content on the platform and to give you context for me at least 80% of my traffic comes from the suggested or browsed features meaning you know more than 3/4 of the people that come and watch my stuff maybe you right now actually weren't coming because you were a subscriber but because the algorithm said you might like this video and so for me I rate
(07:44) this as high now the next question is Okay so we've got the right people we can grow on this platform these are all pluses so the next thing is well how much time are these people actually spending with you so you can really provide value well for us our average view duration per video across all channels is over 8 and 1/2 minutes all right so it's 8 and 1/2 minutes now compare that to the 5 to 20 seconds that we're getting on Tik Tok I mean we're talking 20 times I need to do the math but it's a lot a lot more uh time is
(08:16) spent here versus others and so this allows you to develop a more realistic a deeper realer relationship with your audience because you can actually give them value that they can do stuff with if we want to do a quick Apples to Apples with Tik Tok obviously YouTube has shorts so let me tell you something interesting about this the average YouTube short that we have has a 33 second average view duration remember 5 to 20 on Tik Tok we're more than twice that over here on YouTube now how does this actually translate to what we care about which is conversion when we talk about the convertibility of YouTube is
(08:50) actually one of the lower ones but there's a massive caveat here which is that you can't D I can't DM you if you're a subscriber there's no real story that I can post and immediately see it the closest thing is the community tab that you can do which by the way murders so if you do have a YouTube channel highly recommend doing ctas on the community tab sporadically when it makes sense and so for here I would rate this low to medium the the community tab kind of brings it up a little bit but by and large it's very
(09:19) hard for people to immediately convert they basically have to click a link somewhere else and if you put it in the video it does kill your viation so it's like if you're going to say something you just got to make it short make sure that it's not too big of an ask from the audience and then you can put links in the description which by the way if you look at our description you can just look you want to put it above the fold so you want to have to be the first thing that somebody sees uh before they
(09:42) even click see more is where you want to drive them you can also Pro tip put the first comment that you have in the comment section just pin that comment so that gives you two different places and third inside the video where you can drive traffic this is just something that I've learned over time but still that's a lot of effort and it's not like hey respond to my Instagram story foreshadowing uh and we can take we can start a conversation immediately on the platform and to give context on this little Community post thing I was saying my community post over the last 30 days had 2 and a half million impressions and
(10:12) to get put that in context my short videos got about 18 million impressions so it's not it's not nothing it is it is relatively significant especially when you can load it with some sort of call to action in there but no matter what you pretty much have to take people off the platform in order to converse with them and potentially convert them now let's talk about results cuz all this stuff is conjecture let's get to the Brass tax which is here's the crazy thing drum roll 28.6% of our traffic comes from YouTube
(10:44) all right so a massive amount but there's another caveat that I want to put on top of this our YouTube traffic converts at three to four times every other platform so when people these clicks that go here are worth a ton and so the actual percentage of the contacts that we create people who want to become portfolio companies business owners that want to scale and go to acquisition.
(11:08) almost 60% of those contacts actually come from YouTube originally and remember that little 8sec average that Tik Tok gave us in terms of how long people even spend on the page want to guess what it is for YouTube It's 91 seconds it's a minute and a half so we're talking 10x the amount of time that people actually spending on page all right so you're taking somebody who has high intention that you've delivered value to they actually remember your name and you can actually start a meaningful conversation to help them in
(11:39) a more deep way VIA Commerce selling stuff whatever so one of the things that actually got me on YouTube originally one of the last pieces of content that I consumed before I was like you know what I'm going to start creating was I heard this guy who had a 20-some question application and he was on a podcast and he said I get about 3,000 applications a month and I looked at his YouTube channel and he had like 300,000 subscribers and I was like holy cow because at this point all I had done was paid ads and so I was like 3,000 inbound
(12:08) warm applications I was like my God if I had that kind of volume I'd be able to do so much with that and so when I saw the 300,000 and I saw that that translated into 3,000 applications a month I was like there's something here and I'm going to try and figure it out and so if you are getting started listen I have a massive team but I didn't start that way so I had one guy who I stayed committed to posting three videos a week and if you look at the very earliest videos on my channel it's me with a webcam at my desk just talking about business stuff as it came up throughout the day and so I would encourage you to
(12:37) just start and then all you have to do is every month or every week look back at the three videos you made the week before and just try and improve one thing and if you just stick that what happens is you create this checklist over time that becomes this Mondo checklist of what ultimately creates an exceptional video that performs I remember when I got so excited when we had my first thousand view video in 24 hours and I was like dude can you believe like there's going to be a time where we're going get 10,000 views in a day and now we do 100,000 views in our first day and so the the the levels just
(13:08) keep going and going and going as you grow in skill and if you're going to obsess about something these are the two things I would obsess on number one is the thumbnail one of my last two videos was no BS advice on how to get rich in 10 years and we split test nine different thumbnails and so thing one is the thumbnail matters a lot thing two is the first 8 Seconds of your video you want to be done talking about what the video is going to be about and start and this is something that when I see you know a beginner video I watch and it's like 2 minutes before they actually start the video you've already lost everyone and so you're going to lose
(13:44) most people in the first 30 seconds and so you want to crush the intro so they know exact it's exactly what you promised in the thumb and headline and then you get to the meet as fast as possible and this video right here we did eight different takes of the intro where I slow worked from 30 seconds down to 8 and then that's what became the intro that you saw before seeing this moment right now with all that being said the YouTube gets the highest praise in the internet uh ecosystem Jesus and gets the S tier ranking because this is
(14:17) where I'm doubling down and continuing to pour more and more resource resources because this is where I'm getting the best returns next up we have the artist forly known as Twitter currently known as the X Factor first up we've got who's on this platform so X has 29% of people over $100,000 in household income are on X so about the same as Tik Tok actually a little bit higher the next question is how many of these people right what percentage of the population in the United States is on X and so here this
(14:50) is where it's a little bit lower so Tik tok's got them they're at 33 versus 22 on X now let's talk about growth growth for X it's one of the most viral platforms because the share button is the easiest button on X and Twitter and this is fundamentally what allowed people to organically grow on Twitter to begin with but it is a platform that you have to be really really good at words and it takes a very long time to do that but the advantage is that you can actually tweet a sentence or a word or an image or a meme and so there's a lot of things that are native to the
(15:21) platform and Elon continues to put more and more stuff on there to make it more more viral and just continue to improve it overall and after being stagnant for years Twitter's actually back on a growth curve right now but here's an interesting tibit for X users it's a little bit more of a silo but the people who are on X tend to be really hardcore and so the average xuser spends 34 minutes per day on the platform which is about half of some of the other platforms but still not bad at all uh comparatively the next one's real quick
(15:48) depth we don't have stats because there's no real average view duration uh for Twitter but the easiest thing that I look at for this is how you know how many comments how how engaged people are I don't have particular stats on it but with that being said let's move on to conversion which is what matters now Twitter is interesting there's lots of people that have 1,000 person followings 8,000 person followings and make multiple millions of dollars a year on Twitter because they're super niched down in terms of the types of topics they talk about in fact there was a
(16:17) business that came here the other day who is an a cro marketing agency that specialized in e-commerce companies doing over $10 million a year so talk about like a niche of a niche of a niche of a niche and he was doing 5 million a year from his 8,000 person Twitter following and all he did was have indepth threads where he would just say here's the split test that one here's another split test that one and the entire thing of his bio was if you want a call click my calendar link and book a call and he told me that he was getting 8 to 12 calls a day with unbelievably
(16:49) qualified prospects and so one you have to go off platform but you have this link that's right there and immediately visible the second thing on Twitter is you can DM and so many people DM on Twitter all the time and so people who are on that platform are very accustomed to it and the amount of access that you get on Twitter SLX is kind of unbelievable like you've got superstars on there who will reply to DMS it's nuts first thing you don't want to do if you're just dming people on Twitter is just DM them with an ask the amount of people that have here is like hey can we hop on a call
(17:19) no no we can't thanks for the ass though um I think Compliments are a great way to start like Hey I Love This Thread don't just say hey I love your stuff point to a specific thread that you like and then explain why and if someone says thank you then you can respond afterwards if someone doesn't say thank you to a compliment then they're probably not going to engage anyways and so I would just start with some like what is valuable to somebody is just telling them they did a good job so I rate this a high on the convertibility of the audience now what does that
(17:47) actually translate into us for results so before I give you the stats on this I want to give you a little bit of context the reason I like X so much is that X is actually my hub for Content so what I mean is I consume X more than any other platform personally and I on the Fly create on X so 100% of the tweets that are on X are me in the moment just tweeting them out I heard something on a meeting someone said something and I think of a py way to say it and then I shoot it out right now the thing is is
(18:17) that X generates a little bit of results and I'll explain what it is in a moment but what it does do is it actually feeds all the other platforms because the captions on my Instagram are tweets from here and the long form stuff that we put on LinkedIn are just multiple tweets put together and reformatted and so if you ever see written word from Alex Heros on any platform they are words that I wrote I have no ghost writers I do have people who assemble the words that I have and then put them in a new order or group them together but that's how I've been
(18:47) able to scale my voice without ever being like Oh that's really cringe so your ability to repurpose all the stuff you put on X is super high our percentage of traffic that we get to our site is 6.12% % and if you look at how many people I have on Twitter it's about 6% of my total subscribers and so it's about 1 to one in terms of the ratio like it's pulling its weight in terms of conversion even though this is a short form platform compared to Tik Tok the average session duration on my site from someone from X is still four times higher than Tik Tok so it's over 30
(19:23) something seconds is what people do from X on my site and for that reason I give X an a rating for me cuz the main thing is is I'm not going to stop going on X we don't really have a lot of Team dedicated to X it's pretty much just me and my team takes what I put there and then sprays it everywhere else and so this is for me incredibly valuable y'all thought I was going to put it on S I know uh but no this isn't a tier for me I mean if I had to pick YouTube or X I would do YouTube but X is the Wellspring of everything else that I make which leads us to the in of Link the link
(19:59) magic the Professional Network where all people are serious but no one really is and let's break down how much money this platform actually makes and I think it will it will surprise you and I have changed my view on LinkedIn who's on LinkedIn now this one may surprise you 53% of households over $100,000 are on LinkedIn so this is double Tik Tok like we were talking about earlier now the next question is how many people in the United States are on LinkedIn and this one was kind of surprising to me it was 30% so I
(20:31) actually thought it'd be way lower than that because I figured no one uses LinkedIn but it turns out a lot of people use LinkedIn just not as much as you'd think in terms of per day and so the average amount of time spent on LinkedIn per day per LinkedIn users is about 7 minutes so way lower than a lot of the other platforms so let's talk about growth so growth for me and growth for you should probably be incredibly important because if the point of advertising is to let people know about your stuff you want platforms that let
(20:56) way more people than already know about you know about your stuff and so I give LinkedIn a medium to high and I'll explain why so LinkedIn is super sharable and very connection driven and so the part that I would say is high about it is that there's a lot of people who share on LinkedIn it's very common to share stuff it's kind of like a sharing culture and when you create high value stuff people want the association with that value and then they share public because it makes them look like they've got you know they thought leaders now the flip side is the reason
(21:26) that I I I still have this medium anchor is that because it's connection driven so think about it like a hinge so if you have 10 people a lot of your posts will get shown to people who are friends with your connections right so it's like so and so it's friends with so and so who made this post right and so in the beginning it can be harder for you to get started because you might have a only a few connections and so let me give you a tip on this right now wherever you went to high school wherever you went to college if you went
(21:56) to college wherever you work all of these places are customary to have LinkedIn profiles and by the way I would strongly encourage you to at least put one up there that looks like you exist because from a professional setting I'll tell you some of the big benefits that I get that are not on this list that have been worth it for me but you can get your first 500 connections and the nice thing with LinkedIn is they just say 500 plus so it's not like you have to think like oh my God I need millions and millions of people like you max out your
(22:22) personal connections at 500 so it's very you can do that with a high school class like it's not hard to get going so let's talk about depth real quick because there's no average duration we have no real stats on that so let's get on to the drum roll of conversion now LinkedIn so think about think about like you know Tik Tock is like a a bomb or like a sprinkler right LinkedIn is like you've got a hose with a a laser pointer on it and you can shoot whoever you want with it all right and so the conversion
(22:48) ability on LinkedIn is extremely high all right and I'm I'm going to talk about this in a couple couple couple different vectors so number one is it's very high because there's a ton of sophisticated tools LinkedIn is built for outbound meaning you can get incredibly targeted with your search ability criteria for prospects and so if you want to find hedge fund managers who are in this state and above this age you can do that and so LinkedIn has something called sales navigator that you can use 40% of B2B marketers say
(23:18) that this is their primary channel for getting customers so like do not sleep on the ability now mind you LinkedIn ads shaky some people make them work uh LinkedIn content over overall will help you convert when you do DMS but this is an outbound monster all right and relative to the following count that you have on LinkedIn your ability to make money is probably the highest so you can have the tiniest following and make the most money on LinkedIn because of how targeted you can be with your Outreach and how easy it is to message someone who engages with your content and before
(23:50) I move on to results I want to give you a little hack here for the growth one of the biggest growth methods right now in LinkedIn is getting large accounts to comment on your stuff and so if a large account comments on your thing it gets shown to all of their following and so it's a massive leverage Point like think about a comment almost as a collab and so you want to do whatever you can to attract those bigger accounts and I'll tell you an easy hack for this write about them talk about how great this
(24:19) person is or how great a particular piece of content they made is like actually write something significant and you have a high likelihood that they will say like hey thanks this was awesome and the longer their response is the more engagement draws to you like there was a guy that U made a comment uh made a post the other day and I commented on it and he had a smallish following and that post got I think like 50 times his average in terms of likes and comments after that because I have a large following on LinkedIn and so he got to leverage basically the entirety of my Audience by just making a piece of
(24:53) content that I found relevant so drum roll for the results and this will surprise you over 9% plus of my traffic to my site comes from LinkedIn and the average session duration of these people is over 40 seconds all right so it's higher than every other platform besides YouTube all right so really strong intent from these people now let me give you the Thousand IQ move that is the reason that I like LinkedIn a lot so for me we have a portfolio of companies at acquisition. comom right now it's just under 10 companies that do
(25:25) uh over $250 million a year in revenue and so we constantly are recruiting highlevel talent for our portfolio companies and for our holding company to acquisition and so the biggest unspoken Roi that I get from LinkedIn and that Lila gets from LinkedIn is that our DMS are about recruiting so we can go directly head hunt some of the best people in the world and because we have followings because they can look at the stuff we put out there the response rates that we get are higher than any other platform for talent and so if you
(25:55) want to get really amazing people LinkedIn is going to be the big lever that you can use to grow your business by just getting the smartest people on your team so with all that being said we've got a lot of people with money we've got decent growth we've got high conversion ability High intent and just to give you context on this 9% it's about twice its weight based on the percentage of followers that I have on LinkedIn so we get way more per follower than like Tik talkk where I get 1/4th the amount of followers that actually translate into results so where does
(26:28) LinkedIn go survey says boom B tier and main reason here is that uh I don't think that it can generate as much at least for me but it is like I would put it like almost between the two but in terms of where I'm putting my actual resources we use a lot of my ex content on LinkedIn and it's worked exceptionally well and so we're probably like it's going to I'm basically continuing to invest the same amount that I have been investing in LinkedIn next up we've got the Graham the myth the legend Instagram
(26:59) itself champion of children father to the fatherless and uh money maker to people who shake their booties so that being said I'm a B2B guy I Ser as business owner so how does Instagram measure up for me again the results may surprise you like they did for me so number one what percentage of people over 100k are on here 54% all right so a really monster percentage the second highest that we've had so far across all platforms only second to YouTube next next how many people in the United States are on Zam all right which is
(27:34) 47% again the second highest that we've come to so far so pretty promising up top now let's talk about growth growth because of the Advent of re right now is high all right you can if you are formatting your stuff correctly get viral growth and they're putting more and more to try and favor new Creator so if you look at a guy named moseri he's the head of Instagram uh i' recommend following him no association just has a lot of stuff like from the horse's mouth of what they're doing in the algorithm what they want to favor and I'll tell
(28:04) you a fun fact that he shared with me personally not really it was on on his Instagram um is that a lot of people think that Instagram's favoring video and he said no people favor video and so that's what gets shared the most it's not that we did anything to the algorithm it's just people just prefer to engage in videos and the big thing that they care about is shares they want to see how many people take your video and then immediately send send it to friends and especially if you send it off platform so if you copy the link and then text it that's what gets more
(28:34) people to Instagram that's the Holy Grail of what they want for the bad news so the depth on Instagram is lower now it's not as low as Tik Tok but for us it's 12 to 20% uh sorry 12 to 20 seconds now I'm going to give you a little bit of context on this number so I personally tend to do a lot of tweet reels and my tweet reels are like 3 seconds or 5 Seconds long so no one can even watch longer than that and so that skews my data lower and so if we had the if we wanted to take the time to like look at every single video that's not a tweet real and then par the data out we could probably figure it out but I'll
(29:08) bet you that it's significantly higher than this based on some of these down funnel metrics so people see the Tweet RS they share them that's how some of my growth comes but a lot of the depth for me comes from alternating between these kind of higher top of funnel if you will uh tweet based uh videos versus the kind of in-depth uh me talking to business owner me at a Q&A or whatever this is something that we learned the hard way so Instagram is unlike Tik Tok in terms of the fact that they penalize you for
(29:37) posting too much and so we've tried you know eight a day six a day four a day and so we found our sweet spot at two sessions per day so one in the morning one in the evening and we kind of spread them out now Tik Tok for example we post way more frequently and as you see I'm going to be divesting some of my attention there but you don't get penalized ized same as X you don't get penalized for tweeting more you don't get penalized for posting more Tik toks at the moment and so for us we really spend more time curating the one to two things that we put out per day on here
(30:11) because they're the only shots we've got so let's talk about your ability to convert your audience on Instagram so this one I would say honestly is probably only second to LinkedIn in terms of your convertibility LinkedIn has other things that make it worse than Instagram some of the other stats I shared but in terms of your ability to convert on Instagram it's so good so the only thing you can't do is get laser targeted the way you can with sales Navigator whoa uh but what you can do is you've got stories where you can do ctas you can do swipe UPS people can click links you can link it with uh tools like
(30:43) mini chat where if someone DMS you a certain word or comments a certain word it begins a conversation with them and so you can do all of your Commerce directly on Instagram they also have Instagram shop like they have really and they're continuing to invest in this to make this such a high convert platform and the story that I told the very beginning a guy who had 800,000 on Tik Tok and 200,000 on Instagram he was getting 90% of his revenue from Instagram I was like I need to make a video on this because I need to look at our data to see if we need to reallocate
(31:11) our own resources to make the most money and so here's a really important point with conversion a lot of people chase views and so like if you go up to strangers on the street and slap them and run away you're going to get a ton of views because it's crazy viral stuff but you're not going to get the right types of views from the right who unless you sell how to sell you know how to slap strangers in public and not get hit back right but unless that's what you sell that's probably going to be relevant content for you and so if
(31:36) you're an educator you're a business owner which most of us are Educators not entertainers then what you're going to want to make sure that you're making your content is about the stuff you sell and about the problems that your avatar or ideal Avatar suffers from and how you can help solve them all right and so there's a there's a nutritional dietitian who I met who had 5,800 followers on Instagram she do a million dollars a year and with a couple tweaks that I walk through with her I think she'll do three to 5 million just from
(32:06) 5800 followers and her content here's the crazy part the highest piece of content that I could find when I scrolled had 19 likes but she was making 10 sales a day on average for her $39 to $99 thing and then she would manually email every person who bought the thing and say hey want to buy my more expensive thing and she was doing almost $100,000 a month just from that simple system and you know what her really Niche was she talked about how to build insurance companies more profitably all of her content was like hey here's Aetna
(32:38) and how you can build them way more than you currently are as a registered dietitian so like a niche of a niche of an Niche and me personally I look at a lot of gym equipment it's something that I'm really interested I'm a hobbyist if you want to call it that and so a lot of metal fabricators you might be surprised are very terrible marketers and so a lot of them have like five likes 20 likes on their post but guess who sees them me cuz that's what Instagram knows I love if they put a new machine that I haven't seen I'm clicking on it and so I would
(33:07) encourage you don't worry about the likes worry about who the likes are coming from and one of the cool things with Instagram because of all the different ways you can convert on there is that you can always be seen as giving and you can convert in private and so you don't even need to make asks publicly if you just say hey DM me this or hey I want to send you this thing then you can start the conversation and you can do the Commerce on the conversation rather than in public so give in public sell in private and this
(33:35) enables you to do both and this may be the stat that blows your mind the most the amount of traffic that goes to my site from Instagram is 48% 48% of my acquisition. comom traffic comes from Instagram now I'll give you a little caveat here because this will be important is that by absolute amounts Instagram sends more traffic to acquisition.
(34:06) comom than YouTube does you're like huh well that's interesting now in terms of session length remember this was 91 this one is 28 seconds in session length so it is shorter now mind you a lot of the content here is shorter so it kind of makes sense that people would follow their same kind of consumption pattern when they click over and so here's the the down fact about Instagram from this is that when they go to my site people on Instagram convert significantly less than the people on YouTube but they convert about the same as the other platforms tldr tons of traffic coming from Instagram conversion
(34:37) about the same and for that reason I rank the Graham in let's see if I don't tear this damn page off here we go I rank this as an S tier is it as an S tier is that what the Gen Z kids say these days it is an S tier it's the top guy it's very good I put both of these as my my two top dogs that we're investing the same or more resources going into the next year next up we have the book of faces the man the myth himself smashbook original this one is actually one that I've changed my mind on and so before I dive into these stats on Facebook I had to restart my account
(35:17) because and I'll tell you what I made as a mistake so years and years ago I was a new entrepreneur and someone told me uh just go run ads in Thailand because you get clicks for like a penny and you can get followers for like 10 cents a piece and so I ran ads to get my Facebook following to 70,000 so I looked legit now here's the problem with that is that Facebook then serves content that I have this is back in the day to people who were the people who liked my page unsurprisingly and it turns out people
(35:47) who don't speak English and are just randomly selected from Thailand are not that interested in business content and so it basically prevented me from growing my account when I actually wanted to go legit and make valuable content this is years and years later but I still have my original profile and so we had to restart my Facebook profile just in this last year and so for those of you were like man he's he's got all these F I started at zero this year all right so and like we were like hey we got a th000 views on a video and we started all over again so like don't be
(36:16) afraid of that it's just part of the game everyone starts at zero so let's rock the stats real quick so of people over 100k how many of them on here 68% all right so second only to zit tube how many of people in America now this is a wild one it's also 68% of America is on Facebook now known as meta I thought both are meta I'm confused you get the idea now let's talk about growth all right because this is where it matters all right got it we got a bunch of the people that we want on there a lot of the United States is on there because it's an older platform how about
(36:47) growth now because now there was a moment for a few years where Facebook was very tough to grow on so it was like organic on Facebook crushed and then all of a sudden it stopped crushing and they were like you have to use our ads platform if you want get any views and basically Facebook organic like died and then they resurrected it again when reals came out and they started making reals for Facebook and so now growth on Facebook I would say is high again all right if you make stuff that's platform specific again I've noticed we have noticed that stuff that performs really
(37:17) well on Instagram doesn't necessarily perform well on Facebook and stuff shorts on Tik Tok don't necessarily perform well here so each platform is getting more and more you know separated in terms of what performs well so with this one we weren't able to pull our our average view per but I would say that it's high because the average session length for us is 53 seconds on our site from people who come from Facebook which means that of all the ones so I'm going to spoil this one for you uh of all the platforms it is the second highest
(37:47) session length on our site which has a higher translation over to contacts and downstream things like money all right now let's talk conversion so the convertibility on Facebook I would say is high not as high as Instagram but High because a lot of the same features have been carried over one is you've got Facebook Stories and people can respond to your stories you can DM on Facebook it links with tools like many chat where you can do automation on Facebook and so you have a lot of different ways that you can convert people and it's a
(38:18) platform where many many many many people have profiles and get notifications when they get messages so we will rate this as I'm going to say a high medium to high uh like super high medium extra medium ish medium if you will and so let's talk about results because this is what matters most to everybody here right and so this one is also fascinating so 3.
(38:41) 8% of our traffic comes from Facebook now I only have like 150,000 followers on Facebook so for me that's the smallest of all the accounts I'm going to talk about today but this is more than Tik Tok which has almost 900,000 so my 150,000 followers on Facebook generate more than almost double the amount that my Tik Tok does with one6 the amount of people who are actually following so you look at the relative difference it's one and a half times more conversion on 1 16th so it's 9x the potency so you catching on with this here you're like wait a second you spent all this time here and in just a few months here you
(39:18) were able to get way more people to your site to ultimately convert later yeah and so if you're like should I start a Tik Tok or should I make more content on Facebook well I'll let you use your second brain cell and figure that one out for yourself and so one of the cool Parts about Facebook is it's kind of like a a hybrid between LinkedIn and Instagram because you can do long form text posts and like very long thread based stuff you can do pictures and you can do video on there and so it's a platform that's been really adaptable in terms of the amount of different types of content that you can create and I see that as a
(39:50) big plus because Facebook's almost like the whatever you want to make they'll support you in making it with the exception of Maybe audio and with that being said I have now moved Facebook in my life so before this it was below FTI we weren't even making content on Facebook at all but when we started looking at these stats I was like oh this is oh this is oh is oh H oh yeah this is actually an a tier for me and that may be surprising for you but this is where I'm putting more of my resources in the next year because of all the things I just said and to be clear before I made this video I it was
(40:29) lower but when we looked at all the data this is how I'm prioritizing my resources and so if you're like man which one should I should create on this should inform you also if you want the The Meta lesson here look at your data so I just do what the data tells me to do which is oh we get we have high growth here we have high conversion we have lots of people who have the money uh who are on this platform it's one of the oldest platforms they now have more discoverability and so yeah I'm putting more time into it and before before I get into our double feature for this
(41:00) next one uh I'm going to do some honorable mentions at the end that I am putting some resource SWS that I didn't want to put on this list that I think will be very valuable for you to at least understand but more realistically make money from so our double feature of the day we've got zip podcast which is a Spotify thing but uh it's still a podcast cuz did you know that spotify's podcast I know crazy and email and you're like wait a second are these social platforms yes and no and that's why I'm going to talk about at the same time cuz I actually think that these two
(41:30) platforms are more similar than they are different and so the big reason is all of this stuff is kind of your growth mechanisms and I'm already doing a little foreshadowing on our growth one here but like your email list for example is not going to just like Sprout Sprout babies and have more emails that get made right if you write a banger email you're probably not going to really grow the list but if you have a banger piece of content on these platforms you might absolutely grow your following which then goes to your site which then into your list and so the same happens with podcasts right podcast
(42:01) and email are both what I would consider long-term nurture you're basically putting your audience into a bucket so that you can consistently add value to them now here's the interesting thing with both these this is considered owned media meaning you can directly email anybody who gives you their email address obviously people have crms and things like that so you can blast email but you're still guaranteed to reach the email that they gave you uh Spotify and uh Apple podcast and whatnot people only listen to this is this is so important
(42:32) people usually only listen to three to five podcasts and so think about your Instagram for example if you look at the number of people you follow you might follow 500 you might follow a th000 you might follow 3,000 people on your Instagram and so all 3,000 of those accounts are competing for your scroll every time you log in but if you get on someone's listener followership earballs you are only competing against three for other people and so as long as you continue to consistently deliver you will basically be able to keep that
(43:02) person over the Long Haul now let's talk about some stats and then we'll get into the money on the people who got money we've got 54% now the stat that we found here was 75 we couldn't find uh the stat for 100k that's all right 54% of people over 75k listen to podcasts and 96% now this might be unsurprising of people whoever over1 who make over $100,000 a year are on email now let's look at America so 92 % of Americans use email I'm like what are the other 8% I want to be in the 8% uh there but uh 64% of
(43:35) Americans uh are using podcast or audio in some format which is actually way higher than I thought this was going to be I thought it was still like more of a you know kids Tech whatever but no a lot of people listen to podcast I thought more people would be on radio let's talk about the sad news for both of these your ability to grow a podcast is really low it's very very hard to grow a podcast same as growing an email list now to be clear these things paired with these things very valuable but these
(44:04) things on their own the vast majority of like big podcasters what do you think they also have big ass YouTubes so they take their podcast they put them on YouTube and then they grow now in the very very very early days when like six people were having podcasts there was growth on the platforms but now there are so many uh podcasts that are out there it's very hard Now podcast relative to the amount of people who are on Instagram I think it's like 6 million podcasts and there's I don't know two billion people on Instagram who are quote creators whatever and so you're
(44:35) still competing against a much smaller uh slice of creators but the card that someone's looking at they only got three to five and so there is fierce competition here now emails lots of people are spamming people's inboxes and so you have to be something that people want to click on and read so that brings us to the depth now both of these are going to be off the charts compared to everything else so the depth on podcast dude check this out 20 minutes is the average for us in terms of listen duration for people on podcast I mean it blows everything out of the water I mean the the closest is YouTube at 8 and a
(45:11) half now emails we don't have a depth because I can't say like how long it some to read but for us we have about 40% plus open rates on our emails and so I see that as like okay they're engaged they are at least clicking and reading the stuff that we sent out which is very sporadic because I need to work on that uh that being said let's talk about conversion so we've got these two we got lots of people with money low ability to grow really deep which you know what that's going to mean is that these guys are plus plus they're high in terms of
(45:41) your conversion I mean email is the conversion platform of conversion platforms so I'll give you a step if you're not making at least 30% of your revenue from email you're missing out and if you're not emailing well and this is this is me talking to myself too here you're just losing so much money because the thing is is that the return on email is the highest across all platforms all right so the average person gets 36 to1 return so if you have to spend money on someone writing emails for you these are basically free delivery like the only real cost is the cost of delivering the
(46:16) message and whatever CRM or sender you have to pay for however many emails a month you need to send and the person who's actually writing the email if it's not you that's it that's the only real cost and you can absolutely write a amazing copy make crazy offers there's the least amount of Co compliance that you have to deal with like if you get your Facebook ad account shut down or you get your Instagram you're not really going to get your email taken down now you could get a bad reputation with like Gmail and then they stop putting you in the main inbox that put you in
(46:43) promotions but big picture as long as you're doing things the right way you can have exceptional results with email in terms of converting an audience and with podcasts I'll say this I put a plus here I'll make it a I'll make it a plus minus the amount of people that trust the person that they listen to podcast is through the roof all right so when you make a recommendation the percentage likely that your audience that listens converts is very high but the actual difficulty of converting on podcasts is
(47:15) also High because most times people have to take out their phone type in the address or like it disrupts The Experience most people are listening they don't have their they're on their they're on their they're listening to their car radio CU they're listening to their car or they you know the phone's next to them or it's you know they're at the gym and so they have to stop midet and be like okay now I'm going to type in this address and they'll go convert or they have to remember to do it later which they never will and so that's to
(47:39) me a very big downside of this but it still in my opinion allows you to just get this huge amount of depth with an audience so that when you do make ctas everywhere else it increases the likely they convert but let's talk about results now for podcast I actually can't give results because when people type it in separately I can't know if they came from anywhere but I know that podcasts help us now emails is absolutely tracked and I can tell you that those numbers that we said uh are good now here's where it gets wild
(48:16) 133 seconds is the average session time of someon on email on my site now here's why this is exceptionally powerful we already have their email so this isn't me tring to convert them uh I already have their contact info so this is when I'm making a call to action saying hey we just opened up a new date or two dates for a scaling workshop at our headquarters acquisition.
(48:40) comom in Vegas if you're business doing over a million bucks a year go there so by the way you can go there acquisition. comom and just hit the scale button if you're a business owner if you're not a business owner don't do that um but if you're spending a minute you know 2 Minutes Plus on there it means that you're actually like engaging with what's on the site deciding to book a call with our team all right and so this is monstrous and for us we're working on sending more emails because honestly I'm so particular about written word which is why I've been so hesitant to send
(49:08) emails to begin with you'd be surprised right big author likes uh is very particular about his words yeah that's me and so like I said for Facebook there are some things that this video is changing about my behavior and so definition of learning same condition new behavior and so if you watch this video and then it changes what you do as a result of it than you have learned and so for me taking this data I have learned things and so let me tell you where I'm prioritizing jeez all right so where are these guys
(49:37) going where are these guys going for me this guy is staying in the b class all right I do like the depth of it I hate the fact that it can't it's really hard to grow but I do think it longterm is good for brand and things like that email right here I'm putting on the same level this is a tier the only reason it's not s TI because you can't grow but in terms of convertibility this is the monster of convertibility it's LinkedIn sales navigator on steroids it's the people that already trust you the most
(50:06) and you can consistently continue to deliver messages to them whenever you like as long as you continue to provide value so I have four honorable mentions that I'm not going to do the full Deep dive on but I think are important and the last one is the one that you will not expect and has made a tremendous amount of money for me that if you're good you can crush on so the first three are Pinterest Snapchat and twitch now right now twitch has been favoring super super long streams like all day long streams like walking along with me
(50:38) living Day in the Life whatever and people are going nuts for it I it's been tough for me because I do a lot of meetings with uh portfolio companies and I we share stuff that I can't really talk about and so like it gets tough It's actually why I haven't made many Vlogs because it was so hard uh the in and the out and if I'm working for hours so I I haven't done it but if you have a life or a workstyle that allows you to do it I think twitch is a huge opportunity now Snapchat has done an exceptional job at Commerce and so the
(51:06) average revenue per viewer on Snapchat I think is one of the highest if not the highest across all platforms and so it's really big in uh Millennials but it's coming at coming back fast with like gen Z which is kind of interesting and so um that's one that I've kind of have my eye on I still haven't put it on my list of where I'm going to invest resources into I want to keep doing what we're doing better but it's one to keep an eye on now now Pinterest if you are in a business that has anything that's very visual I you should absolutely be on
(51:35) Pinterest so I had an art dealer who came here and she had 90% of her business came from Pinterest and Pinterest has the highest average revenue per user all right so I think it's 120,000 plus is the average it's wild how many uh how much people who are on Pinterest make and so like it tends to be female skewed and so like think about the arts and craft stuff think about wines think about decoration home decor those types of businesses if you're in one of those Smash and highly recommend putting resources there because again you're not going to be competing against a lot of people because far fewer creators are on there
(52:11) all right so what is my big secret number four drum roll please well I've actually been seating you with it this whole time and know the books are not a traffic Source it's actually Amazon so if we think through the same vectors we had earlier Amazon what percentage of people who are over 100,000 on here all of them 300 million Americans are on Prime are on paid subscriptions absolutely absurd the most successful product adoption in history was Amazon Prime next is how many it's the whole United States everybody's on Amazon so for you to grow on Amazon you absolutely can and so what a lot of
(52:49) people don't know is that Amazon was actually one of my earliest platforms and so when I had only 10,000 followers on Instagram and I had maybe 10,000 followers on YouTube I don't even think I was making YouTubes yet I published this book and so a lot of people think that this book has the 26,000 five stars that it has on Amazon because of the following that we have and that's not true this book sold more copies than I had people on my email list all right so talk about contacts versus customers now Amazon has all of this traffic of all
(53:22) these people who have money now are are these people able to convert [ __ ] you they have a credit card on file and they can buy in one click so Amazon is built for Commerce it's also why twitch is one of the things that there's some there's big opportunities there now I'm going to do a little caveat here if you are an influencer or you would like to start creating content I think that Amazon is a sleeper and so let me walk you through some math my book page converts at 30% all right so like if you had a 30%
(53:53) optin you'd be like stoked no no no 30% of people who View my book page buy a book and to give you a relative comparison here Shopify the average is around 2% so it has a 15 time at least for me 15 times higher conversion for me versus Shopify because there's so much trust innate to the platform so if you are an Instagram influencer or Creator if you promote someone else's stuff the commissions on Amazon I'm pretty sure fixed about 10% but if you can convert 10 times more people when you send them to Amazon than
(54:32) you do when you send them to something that you get 20 or 30% on that only converts at 2% you're still going to make more money and as an added bonus when you promote stuff on Amazon in my opinion it doesn't feel nearly as asky if you're like hey I was reading this really cool book I think you like it I've got a link here people are like oh he's he's always selling this stuff it's like no you're just providing value from products that you found and so I think that the Amazon affiliate model is one of the most under tapped for influencers
(55:02) who are like I don't know what to sell it's like dude sell the stuff you like so like instead of trying to think of products and things like that I think the V1 is just like hey these flannels are awesome I found them on Amazon and here is the link right and so these aren't on Amazon unfortunately but point being I think this is one of the most under tapped opportunities because here's what's cool about this traffic Source on top of all the things I just said if you put CTA inside of your content inside of your
(55:30) books the stuff that you sell people can go there and then find you and these are people that I would never have otherwise found all right so they found a book that had a zillion five stars they bought and read the book and then that is how they discovered me and so my growth here that I want to say is it's incredible and also very difficult because the only way that you can grow on Amazon is having a good product but if you do have a good product you can put in the QR codes you can put ctas if it's education based like media like
(56:00) books uh if you have physical products on Amazon you can put the the little QR codes in there but this is another huge stream of people finding out about your stuff who otherwise wouldn't have now results these books sell almost a thousand books a day on Amazon which is absurd a lot of people are really excited to get a th000 email contacts a day we get 1,000 customers a day from the books and to be clear this is not I make my money but these actually have become a much bigger Revenue stream than I expected given it's just you know it's
(56:32) $30 book and also by the way guys you can you can get it for free on my podcast both of these are in audio format for free on my podcast you can search my name this one's a sleeper and if you are good it's worth putting some of your best stuff up there even if you put it free somewhere else because I see it as a traffic source and the more money you make Amazon the more they push it if you enjoy this video and you're trying to grow your personal brand I I have a deep dive with full slides and presentation on how branding really

Transcript:
(00:00) mosey nation a lot of people ask how do you guys get so much stuff done how does how do the companies move forward with such speed um and for those who don't know my name is alex hormozy we own acquisition.com our portfolio does about 85 million a year i give you all this stuff because i just want you to not be broke and a lot of people are and so i want you to be one of them all right and so this video is a video that was i released in a group a very long time ago and it's one of the top ranked videos in that group out of 300 plus videos and it
(00:25) was how we tactically execute on speed so speedys king is one of the core tenants of our companies actually turning that concept of speed into something that everyone can execute on is one of the key things that moves you forward towards your goals faster all right and it's not what a lot of people think it's not about being impatient it's not a lot not about trying to to get a hundred things done but it's about knowing how to get the things done that matter a and then b how do we get these short tasks done in a way that actually
(00:48) moves teams forward rather than individuals all right so i think you'll enjoy the video it was ranked one of the top ones and i'll see you on the other side mosey nation love you good morning everyone hope you guys are having a fantastic friday um today i wanted to uh talk about something that um has been it's been on my doctor for a while but today felt like the right day i'm calling this [ __ ] end of week what i mean by that is one of the things that i've seen across the board when we're talking to entrepreneurs and you know the the gym
(01:16) owner community that we have is that the one trait i see over and over again that is clear to the people who are are winners right the top one percent i'm not talking top ten percent but the top one percent is the speed with which they execute after making a decision one of the definitions that like we talk about the community is that differentiate power as i understand it is the gap between thoughts becoming reality and so if you thought about an omnipotent being right something someone who has unlimited power as they think
(01:47) that thing would be right and so if you were to believe in a creator of some sort then you might think as that creator thought the universe became right and so if you think that as like the ultimate scale of power then the closer we can get to that the more powerful we become the more potent we are as entrepreneurs and so i see this so many times that it's it's not even it's not even uh oh like this is associated with success like this is what creates success because the gap between where you decide something is a
(02:20) good idea and when it actually occurs is the loop with which you can improve your business and so it's a lot like i can't remember what the saying was but it's not like how old the car is but how many miles are on it what i mean by that is like we're young right but there's been a lot of a lot of iterations that have happened from you know when the business first started when i started my first gym until now and i think the key to that is the speed of the oota loop and that's that's just like a military term like observe orient decide act and
(02:50) it's just the loop with which that you can basically see what's going on make a decision act on it and then do that whole loop again right because the faster you can pivot and iterate the more responsive you are as an entrepreneur the faster you can take advantage of opportunities the faster you can find out what failures are then move on i want to talk about this within the context of running a team and employees and then also within yourself and so from running your team right one of the things that you know
(03:16) once once you're moving out of you doing things all the time there's how do i get other people to do things and so that's why i called this like [ __ ] end of week right is that i one of the things one of my biggest pet peeves is like yeah i can get to that by end of week i'm like why don't you just get it to me in an hour because that's how long it takes and then all of a sudden it's like oh it's like well i have a meeting right then it's like is it more important than this no okay well then do it like if you
(03:38) think about how you can run an organization like that if you can get things done end of day right rather than end of week you were literally speeding up the organization 7x think about that and so when you're thinking about deadlines and you're thinking about expectations you as the owner can set the x you set the cadence if people say hey can we do this and then you're like cool let's start right now you set the tone for how the organization's going to move how quickly it's going to orient how quickly thoughts become reality and
(04:07) ultimately how powerful your organization will become because of the speed right and speed isn't doing things fast it's basically just not being distracted by other [ __ ] that doesn't matter it's being able to prioritize and most people a lot of the times aren't doing something that's high priority right a lot of times they're just doing nothing if you can speed up that loop and force and and put apply pressure to your team to not do things by end of week or even end of day it's like it's 10 a.
(04:35) m can you get this done by noon uh okay and then you can have that loop happen three times within a day rather than it taking three weeks right because you set that cadence from the beginning and then things get done faster so i've been reading some really interesting books lately and i referred them out to um a handful of entrepreneur friends that i have that are all doing five five to 15 million kind of in that range and what was amazing to me is that every single one of them read the book immediately sent me back their notes and what they
(05:05) were going to do with it and like and basically were asking feedback on on the angle that they were going to take with it what's fascinating to me is that if you look at if you look at lower level entrepreneurs they and i'm not saying in a negative way i'm just saying in terms of just objective revenue like just they haven't achieved this much the delay between being able to gain information and act is so much longer and that's why they how where they want to be it's kind of the same degree of people who are
(05:28) like who pay for our program and haven't gone through the poor yet i'm like what do you do right like what priority like what what education do you have that is not relevant to your business like you're reading a motivational blog right now when you have to translate that motivation into a thought that you're then going to quote test and then you have to see how that test works and then maybe it improves something rather than just following the playbook that has already been tested and has already like the the
(05:52) tree has been shook right and so if you look at like joey for example who by by all definitions his gym is the is the number one gym within gym launch right he had already finished everything in legacy by week eight his first eight weeks he'd already implemented every single system and legacy and so it's not like it's not like he has more hours in the day right it's not like his business is different it's just that his level of efficacy in execution was so high because it'd allow himself to get distracted by things and the moment he
(06:22) has something he needs to execute it's creates this itch inside of him that he cannot he can't move forward without executing this so that the relief comes and if you can start to foster that type of behavior in yourself in those attitudes about execution you will grow faster and you will become more powerful as an entrepreneur right if you think about your competition who would you fear right the competitor who sees what you're doing can immediately execute implement and improve on it at a faster loop than you
(06:53) can even understand what's going on right and that's where speed of first to market and things like that don't matter as much because if an ex if a competitor can execute an out ooda loop right can can speed that loop up faster they can iterate and improve on it faster than you can and then you have no chance to catch up and so if you're looking at your business look at it from a context of speed of how long does it take us to improve things how long from understanding that our churn is high to executing the five
(07:18) horsemen how long did that take we knew what the problem was how long did it take for us to do and if you can if you can if you can get real with yourself about how many actual hours it will take to do something and then you look at your week and you think okay what am i doing today that is more important than this and where can i put these two hours and start with the moment that you make the decision and then all of a sudden you'll be getting things done that day that afternoon rather than end of week end of month we purposely delay these
(07:46) things because we just procrastinate for no reason when the the problem will not go away right and so that is why within gym launch speed is king is one of the core tenants of the business because you have to and the tone has to start with you as the entrepreneur like you have to apply that pressure you have to say [ __ ] end of week why like what are you doing today that's more important than this right what are you doing in the next two hours that's more important than this tell me right and a lot of times you'll get the
(08:12) answer like well i guess i can do it now it's like yeah then let's do it now let's get it done right and that small change can 7x right if you even going from end of week to end of day can 7x how quickly your business grows because the solutions that you need to implement to solve the problems and break through the bottlenecks happen today not in a week not in a month and then the reaction to the next thing that breaks the next bottleneck in the business happens not in a week not in a month but in a day and then that's how quickly you can
(08:42) pivot from where you are to where you want to go because it's not one big thing it's a million small turns that will get you there anyways i hope i hope anyone you know somebody found value in this if you have an employee or you're managing your team and you want to implement new things start with today right start with end of day not end of week start with end of the next two hours and then work backwards from there and then apply pressure and and push back on excuses for why something else why something can't be done ask for why why do you
(09:14) think this thing that you're going to do is more important than this and i want a real answer right and if they can't give you a real answer then it means that i need to help you prioritize and that's fine but this is now going to be your priority because this is what drives revenue this is what drives retention this is what's going to drive the business look at your schedule identify the bottlenecks you have and then start doing them now not in tomorrow not in a week not in a month because there's no point it's just the
(09:41) speed with which you can close the gap between your thoughts and your decisions and the reality that you create in front of you will dictate how powerful you are as an entrepreneur and even as a human being so anyways have an amazing day have a fantastic friday for my gym lords i will see you guys on the call later today otherwise keep being awesome tag like comment all that jazz um lots of love all right all right

I Doubled A Business in 60 Days to Show It's Not Luck (Part 1) - YouTube
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_6BrF7jOGk

Transcript:
(00:00) I have 13 portfolio companies and I just doubled one of them in 60 days by solving five key problems and what I'm going to do is show you the data of what it was before why it was wrong what we fixed and what happened after enjoy three young Founders who are all sad because they were not making the amount of money that they wanted to make so before I show you the data let me explain what each of these terms actually mean so show rate is the percentage of people who have an appointment who show up for their appointment so in any business if you
(00:29) deal with people you will have sessions or appointments you have a time slot that someone says they're going to show up right if it's a sales consult then they are a prospect and they're going to show up to get sold so if I have 100 people who have an appointment and 70 show up that would be a 70% show rate the second one here is offer rate which we forgot to put in the rate so let me just put that in for you there you go offer rate which is the percentage of people that we actually make an offer to you might be like well why would I not
(00:53) offer everybody well not everyone's qualified and so for example if I work with only gym owners and somebody comes on it's like Oh I'm a personal trainer well you shouldn't be here we had all these other things that said don't be here but you still came why are you here that means that you don't offer them anything and that's it now if 100% of people who showed up show R you were able to offer to then that means that your offer rate would be 100% And that is an indicator of the quality of the lead flow that you have the third is
(01:13) close rate this depends on how you can track this all right so you can either do it based on percentage of people who show or you can do it on percentage of people who are offered what I normally do is I'll just track both I'm going to guess that this one is off of offer rate because it's what we have here it's good to have both stats here because let's say a Salesman wants to artificially increase his close rate well then he will just say well I'm not going to offer anyone unless I know they're going to say yes and so then their close
(01:36) rate's high and then they'll show that there's really low quality score but if that salesman this is why having team stats is so important and individually is because if the team is all saying that their offer rate 70 and one guy saying is off rates 30 but he has 100% close rate and they all have 30% close rates we know where the data went and this is why having high quality data allows you to see what the problems are if I didn't have this percentage then I wouldn't know it's because we have low quality leads or because my salesman
(01:59) suck this data allow allows me to identify the problem and then fix it so the fourth set here is percentage of cash collected up front meaning if we're selling $1,000 widgets and the average cash we collect today is $500 because people do payment plans then we would know our cash collected percentage would be 50% if I have a low close rate at high cash collected percentage that would tell me a different story than a really high close rate and really low cash collected percentage I'd be like oh so they're just getting anyone to say
(02:24) yes and taking $10 down if they can versus somebody saying we have a hard line and so it's really trying to find the mag between these two and saying how can I get as many people to says and get as much cash collected up front the final one here is just unit sold and this is really just the output of these four if we multiple these things together how many do we end up closing and that's the result so beforehand damn we had a 49% show rate so let's say we have 100 appointments now we have 49 who actually show up for their appointment
(02:49) and then of the 49 we're able to offer 83% of them beforehand so 80% of that is 40 40 people now are getting offered out of our original 100 appointments of the people who get offered 27% of them which is 10 people roughly are actually buying in that closing percentage and then our cash collected from those 10 people is we're getting a little less than half of the cash that we closed down now I gave you 100 as a number but the actual number of units sold for this business in the prior month was 56 units all
(03:19) right so this is current state if you don't know these numbers in your business you should so that you can improve them let's say I invested in your business today the first thing we want to do is get the data so that we can see what Baseline is so we can see where the discrepancies are and where we think the biggest opportunities for improvement are and you're going to have to wait till the end of the video for me to show you what happened after so let's start with problem number one or opportunity for improvement number one
(03:41) we had a low show rate as in based on our benchmarks of 70% for any kind of appointment type business we think that we should have at least 70 there Allen which is a company that I had all we did was show rates we were doing 4,000 appointments a day we experimented we had a machine learning team to think like what was the number of communications that we had to have with a prospect what was the delay between responses that got the most people what were the total number of exchanges how far apart were the exchanges there is
(04:06) lots of data that we were able to collect so their number was 49% of appointments were showing up what we wanted them to be at was 70% this is our Benchmark where we'd say okay this isn't a problem anymore now do we want to improve things absolutely but where are we going to allocate our effort at the constraint this was a constraint now to give context here this Delta is a 40% difference 40% is a lot think about the S&P 500 they're like we trying to grow 9% a year it's like boom I unlock that I get 40% growth I don't have to do
(04:32) anything else for like 4 years in the S&P big wins that's what we look for lots of things can affect show rate by the way the number one one that affects sh is number of total time sits you've available take that to the bank but one of the other ones is the targeting and the offer itself so targeting is who's actually seeing this promotion if I'm targeting teeny boers for example I might get people to schedule but then realize that they're not here for a laser hair removal appointment so the targeting there would be off and so that
(04:59) would affect our show rate and that has nothing to do with our lead nurture sequence or our salesman or anything like that it's just the wrong people were seeing it so that was issue number one for context for us just imagine that's underneath it was 25 to 35 year olds who were gainfully employed and love their job and this when we came in to look at it was actually targeting 18 to 24 year olds the reason that this was far off for us is that the ad objective now I'm going to get a little bit tactical with you ad acis.com at holdco
(05:23) we have media buyers we have Pros who do this for a living and so when they zoomed in on how their media buyer was optimized the traffic they were optimizing against what a lot of people would initially think they should do which is optimizing for the lowest cost leads and the lowest cost appointments what we had to do we switch to optimize around cost per sale if we can optimize around who we actually sell to we will shift where the sales come from and just to give you how big of a problem this was they had to cancel 75% of their
(05:48) appointments before the 49% show rate the sales guys are spending most of their time just looking at their appointment looking up the person cancelling to get their 49% show rate and that's about the closest thing to literally burning money so the second big problem was multitasking and this really goes for any role but especially like sales-driven roles they had a setting team and a closing team and the Setters were both trying to call leads to get appointments and then also nurturing and doing the followup to
(06:12) remind them of the appointment and as similar as that may sound in your mind it's two completely different activities you're banging phones calling people up you're in that flow and then you're like oh wait Sarah has an appointment today let me go mind Sarah do Sarah going to shup it and then you're like wait I'm calling and then you start like and it's you go back and forth right so they had three big issues number one is that they weren't double dialing right which is one of the most common things that you
(06:32) can do by the way if you're doing phone calls because a lot of initial screens will stop the first call but if you dial twice you'll get through number two is that the time to contact was too slow so lead would come in and they would just like sit there for 30 minutes 60 minutes an hour 2 hours 3 hours right and they weren't getting contacted it's like what did this person do they're like oh I'd like to find out more information nothing and the third thing is that they didn't have the right time to set appointments and they weren't nurturing
(06:56) correctly so we go same day next day I'm just giving giving you some secrets and they didn't have mning of nurture meaning if you have an appointment today and you booked this appointment 3 days ago if I don't remind you that day that you have an appointment the likely that you show is lower and so these are the problems that they have no double dial slow speed to contact and they didn't have any mning of nurture but wait there's more the second problem they had or opportunity for improvement was that they had a low close rate and this is
(07:22) based on our Benchmark I would normally give you a kpi but it has so many different variables in terms of what percentage close rate is cuz if you're sell in in person for example for a low ticket thing you might be able to sell 80% plus of people walking the door on the flip side if you're selling an investment opportunity over the phone on you know a first or second contact you might sell 5% but for this particular type of sale that they had which was a two call close for like I would say a mid-priced consumer service in my
(07:48) opinion they should have been about 40% so 40% is what I wanted them to be at and then current was 27% so this is where they were this where we wanted them to be and again for context here this is about a 50% % Improvement so problem number one is that they had service level Discovery if you're not familiar with that terminology in a sales script there's different kind of phases that you go through in a conversation and the opening part is often a little bit of Rapport and then right after that you get into Discovery
(08:12) Discovery is where you're discovering what the problems that the person is going through you're trying to understand why they are where they are why they're on the phone with you why they decided to take time out of their day why this problem is important to them what they've tried in the past etc etc right this is the Discovery this gives you all the ammunition that you're going to use at the end of the sale to close it so the way that they were doing was simply saying how much money do you want to make just asking the one
(08:34) question which is the big obvious question it's surface level but the big thing that you always want to ask when you're selling is intention why do they want this like what changes as a result of this how will your life look different what can you not do now that you would be able to do as a result of this change who else in that in your life would that affect why does that matter to you right and so these are all why questions and it's to to dig up their intentions because if you can understand why someone's there it's much
(08:58) easier to get them to agree to getting them there right but if you don't know that someone's trying to let's say replace their income versus quit their job versus just have side hustle money those are very different intentions if I want to talk to side hustle money I'm probably not going to be like this is going to take a ton of time on the flip side if someone's like I hate my job I just want to do something that's not this then I might talk about what the day-to-day looks like in this scenario and ask them if that sounds better to
(09:24) them so if you think about sales process what they were doing is they were asking questions that were here surfice level but this is where all the meat is and that's where all the money is is the questions that are below the surface is understanding why someone's even doing this to begin with look at that Iceberg killer Iceberg and so the second issue is that they had a lot of objections coming up on the call I'll say objections but I also mean obstacles for those of you who are sales sales senses objections happen after you talk
(09:53) about the number obstacles happen before you talk about the number if you come on the phone and I say hey why are you here and you're like I just want to find out more information that's actually an obst obstacle like you already have to confront that cuz like no you're not hopping on phone calls all trying to find information what problem you trying to solve and then they're like well and then you get into it right but if you don't address that up front it'll blow up on you in the close so objections and obstacles is what they were encountering
(10:12) a lot of and part of that is because their Discovery was wrong right they were talking to service levels so then lots of was blowing up on them in the close common objections that happen after you present price is uh this is too much I need to think about it I have to talk to my spouse I'm not sure if this is for me I'd like to get more data can you send me a brochure like these are all just to make believe things that people will say in order to not buy from you interestingly a lot of times if you stay in the surface level they'll even
(10:35) give you what we call Smoke screens but basically like they'll just come up with uh a reason that they're not going to do it and it's not even the reason they just throw a smoke bomb up and they're like I don't like English you know walk away right has nothing to do with it they just want to get off the phone so those are the two issues that we had on the sales and that was getting us to this 27% close rate and what this looks like is lots of argumentation and like hard closing and it's because the sales n positioned properly and they were
(11:02) basically talking at people and not listening if the salesperson is talking more than the prospect in your sales like these are likely issues that are coming up I'm going to give you two examples real quick to show you how important delivery of a message is so if I say I have to think about it and I say oh like what are your main concerns or what are the main like what are the main variables that you're considering you're not thinking wow this guy's a douchebag I sound like I just genuinely want to know I call it childlike curiosity I
(11:27) always cue it by tilting my head I'm like huh what are the main things and I would increase my voice at the end there an improperly trained salesp person might be like well what are the main concerns you have and all of a sudden that sounds like a very different thing so they're saying the script but they're not but the prospect isn't hearing the same message and these are little details that actually can make a huge difference in ultimately how you close there's a lot of things in tone but I'll just say one is how you raise or lower
(11:48) your voice and the second is where you choose to emphasize if I say I didn't say he hit his wife if I say like that I have neutral Tone If I say I didn't say he hit his wife then it's like I'm not saying that I didn't say he hit his wife is now saying that like those weren't my words I didn't say he hit his wife he's the one to question I didn't say he hit his wife means like he might have done something else but he did something to his wife I didn't say he hit his wife it could have been somebody else's I didn't
(12:13) say he hit his wife it might have been his kid right and so it's the same sentence but simply emphasizing different parts of it communicate different things and so the tone and emphasis create a altogether package of how we communicate and for them their tonality was way off as a team because they were missing the first 5 minutes of disc discovering and setting the frame properly and so I'll give you the last set of problems opportunities for improvement and then we'll dive into what we did to solve them and what
(12:35) happened sales problem three opportunity for improvement people in orc structure issues so issue number one is that CEO was the sales manager and that was because he was the best closer he had a significantly higher close rate than the rest of the team but he wasn't a very good sales manager even though he was a good Closer by the way that's one of the main issues that a lot of sales teams have they promote their best closer as a sales manager and often times those are two very different skills and we could
(13:03) see this because the churn on their sales team was through the roof just to be clear like they were a group of young Founders it's not uncommon it's actually probably very common because usually when you start a business learning how to promote and sell the product is usually the job of the founders like how do I get people to want to buy the thing and so they end up getting the most reps early on and also understanding the prospect better than just about anyone and so one of the big things you guys are in little mini sales last Su today
(13:26) is that companies will over educate on the product and under educate on the prospect the person that you should be educating your sales stuff on is who we're talking to more than what we're selling cuz for me if I know someone deep in their core what their intentions are I can tell them anything I know someone inside and out and then someone says sell this thing and I know nothing about it I could probably get them to buy on the flip side I know everything about this thing and I don't know who I'm talking to talking to a child a man
(13:50) a woman old young different language and so a lot of people talk like hey sell me this pen when in reality what we want to do is like talk to John the majority of good sales train trainers who try to do that gimmick what they want the person to do is ask them a question it actually has nothing to do with the pen and so if they say sell me this pen what you do is you take the pen and you put it in your pocket and you say how's it going what brought you in today right cuz I got to go from where they're at to wanting a
(14:14) pen I'm not going to just be like hey buy this pen give me money like it doesn't work that way but bad salesman do so the second issue was the setting team expectations one of the benefits of working with someone who has more experience is that we know what the Benchmark should be and so a lot of times we can reset someone's minimum standard and they're like well they're setting two a day and we're like they should all be minimum setting three and that sounds tiny but again two to three is a 50% increase in sets and that's
(14:38) across a whole team so that means a lot of productivity but if you set the bar low people will just naturally shrink down to that level all right so you understand the problems and here is the data this is before they had a low show rate issue they had low close rate and multiple issues around that and they had people and organizational issues so I want you to pause real quick in the video in the comments to be like what would you do how would you attack these issue if this was your business and then I'll tell you what we
(15:03) did now there's two elements of solutions element one is what would you do to attempt to solve the problem and the second is which one do we do in what order the third problem that was actually the first thing we decided to fix was that we hired a sales director the reason for that was because the CEO was overly involved he was micromanaging he wasn't a good manager and he also wasn't doing CEO stuff and so we had to hire an experienced sales director who in this instance had been a sales trainer for a similar type of sale in a
(15:27) consumer good this guy ended up being exceptional in being able to implement the rest of the changes that we outlined so this was in terms of order of importance I think if we hadn't done this and had tried to do the rest of them it would have fallen flat this is like one of the most common errors that business owners and Founders make is that they see the what and not the who or they focus on the how and not The Who and if you have the same problem that has recurred multiple quarters in a row in the same Department underneath of the
(15:52) same who it might not be a what issue it might be a who issue one of the reasons having experience is helpful is because you know what it looks like when it's right some of the biggest costs in the business are hiring incorrectly you waste the time trying to find them you waste the time onboarding them and trading them and then you waste the time of all the time it takes you to figure out that they're not the right fit and all the loss growth that you would have had to then start that process over again that's tough but a lot of
(16:16) businesses have to deal with that which is why picking Personnel is so important with this instance we looked at culture fit which is like do we think that this guy will fit in which we usually the founders pick that part out like hey does this guy fit in cool and then we're going to hardcore drill on usually experience and tactical knowledge and so we have subject matter experts at holdco media buying cro experts sales experts Finance expert whatever and we will then do tactical interviews we talked about earlier you can know that someone is
(16:40) good based on the quality and quantity of the data that they collect I would ask somebody what data do you plan on collecting and how would you plan on fixing those things based on how vague they are and how high level they go in terms of their Solutions it'll tell you how nuan they can be in their thinking and ultimately executing Solutions sales director specifically in my experience when I have guys who are like I just want to build up people I want to give these guys skills and they marry that with like and these are the metrics that
(17:04) I track to know X Y and Z that's a good sales director the next thing we decided to solve boom was fixing the ad targeting and the reason we did the sales director first was because we're like well how do we know if anything else is going to happen afterwards if we fix this so what we ended up doing here it turns out is that we also had another Personnel issue the media buyer was asleep at the wheel they were optimizing around the wrong stuff they were trying to split their attention and start their own side hustle it was clear that they
(17:28) were negligent they actually were doing the right thing and then they stopped doing the right thing and it was clear that that type of behavior the founders felt was not going to correct itself so they let go of that person hired a new person and boom fixed the ad targeting problem we were back to 25 to 35y old people who love their job what did we fix next boom We reduced the sales team what and we reset expectations for the setting team what we looked at is sales team utilization if we know that guys can take 10 sales a day and they're
(17:53) actually only taking four then we have too many salese in this instance it gives you an opportunity to cut the fast for lack of better term and reward the people who are actually doing their jobs and closing well if you cut the lowest percent of the team and you have utilization like you have space you lose the lowest closing percentage people and you gain more closes just by Shifting the closing rate overall of the team when you make those changes in my experience sales people get into a rhythm if you don't take enough sales
(18:20) calls you're too desperate to close the deal and then you start being too hard and not listening enough cuz it's about you not them when sales people have more and more consult they sell from the back of their heel they're open-minded they're asking questions they're feeling good and they get in a rhythm the setting team we both downsized and increased expectations how did all these sales increase by having fewer people we had better people that's how and that also helps recreate the culture of the team so that we can have a new standard
(18:46) set of high performers because there's nothing that demotivates a high performer like a low performer who's still on the team and so we went from two to four in terms of our expectation per day for the team in terms of sets sales fix numo qu I'm messing all my columns up now just going to have to deal with it we promoted one Setter to lead nurture specialist I was saying earlier that they were multitasking right so they're doing some setting and they're doing some lead nurture and that gets really hard for a team of six guys to split
(19:10) those things we took one of the Setters who was really good and made that person the lead nurture specialist who basically acted as the bridge for both the setting team and the closing team to basically coordinate and remind the people of their appointments and we equipped that lead nurture specialist with one of our checklists for what that role needs to do to get the most people to show up and I'm not going to give you all cuz a long check list I'll give you two quick examples one of them is doing a three-way intro once you have the set
(19:33) appointment between the setter and the closer and doing it via iPhone if you can because now you have a known person and an unknown person and a person that Bridges the two they might know show on Johnny over here but not on the guy that they just spoke with and so the idea is how can I bridge that Gap and kind of make the association for them add some trust the other thing is that the closers morning of would remind them with either a voice memo or a video text personalized to them being like hey John really excited for our part today I saw
(19:59) your profile XYZ personalized to you I'm really pumped for I think we might help you out so that's just a couple of the things that we have on that list that we had them Implement and all do consistently and sales team fix number five boom is we optimize the sales scripts I said earlier that the discovery was to surface level so we rescripted the discovery made sure we were asking deeper more meaningful questions and a part of that is also bringing some of the objections to the front it's much easier and this is the
(20:22) this is the terminology that our team uses which is killing zombies right it's a lot easier to kill a zombie when it's far away than when it's on top of you if somebody's trying to bring up a zombie in the cloth another way of saying it is like you want to diffuse the bomb before it goes off in the clothes in your face so we solve the problem before we bring it up now this is actually something that we added to this part of the script which is prior to the appointment we say hey is there anyone else who' be
(20:43) required to make a decision about this thing if they say yes then you say cool well let's push back the appointment let's get that person on that way you have all the decision makers present so these are just little things but like little 1% improvements over and over over again is what yield these 50% boosts and the third main change we did was that we drilled the team on looping and looping is just a sales terminology for basically when you encounter an objection handling the objection and then asking again handle the objection
(21:11) ask again right because a lot of salese are afraid to ask if someone says no and they don't want to ask again right and I can tell you this is that the number of sales you make is direct proportional to how many times you ask there's ways to do it wrong and there's ways to do it right the idea is that you should be able to resolve the concern right so if someone says I need to think about it and you say well what are your main concerns and they say say well it seems really complicated you say oh what part specifically feels more complicated
(21:33) they're like it's the whole Tech thing and we're like oh we also have a vendor that can actually fill that in I think it's a couple bucks extra but like we can just handle that for you does that solve the problem and they're like oh okay so you guys will you guys will just hand that one part of it like yeah we hand that part of it for you cool now this is where the salesman says great you want to move forward you have your idea on you hey what card you want like you can just make the ask right after that and so then at that point you might
(21:55) say ready to move forward then and they might say this feels like a fast decision it's like oh well what makes it fast how long you been thinking about this they're like well I mean I just met you and you say well how long have you wanted to solve this problem and then they would say well I mean a long time it's like well then doesn't sound like a fast decision at all it sounds like you've already made the decision a long time ago that you wanted to change now we're just acting on it so now do you want to move forward right keep looping
(22:15) and continuing to resolve the concern ask again resolve the concern ask again drum roll please what happened in the real world so let's go to the data all right so in our first column we had 49% sure rates after we implemented sales fix 2 fixing the ad targeting sales Fix 4 promoted one lead Setter to lead nurture specialist and sales fix 3 reduce the team size and reset expectations survey says we had a 70% boost which is almost exactly the kpi and that's because when you do things that work they work so that was a 40% Improvement in sales and
(22:49) to be clear this was just over 2 months all right so some of these Chang is going to happen real quick if you know what you're doing the second change we have is our offer rate and so here's what happened survey says 80% we actually offered just about the same amount of people realistically what they were doing is offering people who weren't qualified cuz the sales team wanted to eat and I get that like there's a human component here they were offering people were not qualified the deal cuz they needed commissions right
(23:10) which is what we were trying to fix with the targeting close rates we went from 27% in 60 days later we were at 41% so 1% above our Benchmark all right this is a 50% Improvement in sales so 40 and 50 Kazam next up we have percentage of cash collected a really good metric for knowing how strong the sales team in is and this is especially important for that early Discovery portion and how good they are at looping and closing because the deeper you get the discovery the the more convicted the buyer will be about the solution and the
(23:40) more likely they are to pay UPF FR as a measure of their conviction in the solution the survey says we went from 47 to 82% so we almost doubled the amount of cash that we were collecting UPF front per sale in 60 days we had a 40% Improvement and we had a 50% Improvement and we had a almost doubling of cash collected so if we almost doubled the amount of sales that happened and we almost doubled the cash up front collected what did we do to the cash flow of the business forx ah much more enticing after we added all these four
(24:12) changes together and we waited 60 days what happened survey says we went from 56 to 93 sales a month and that was just from a few of these fixes on one particular part of the organization and you might think after we made all these changes that we're done we right off into the sunset but wait there's more there were even more problems in the business on the product and customer success side which we will get to in the next video

How To Get Customers So Fast It Feels ILLEGAL - YouTube

Transcript:
(00:00) want to hear something insane every 6 seconds acquisition. comom portfolio companies get a new lead so I'm going to teach you how to get new customers so fast it feels illegal and as I've done this we've gotten three leads one at the first second one at the 6C one at the 12 seconds and right now we just got another lead and so the first way to do this every business wants more leads but none of them want to give good stuff away for free and so my favorite marketing strategy for getting tons of leads is step one look at what other
(00:33) people are charging for step two look at the Hard costs of what it would cost for you to deliver it step three give that thing away for free step four see how many leads you get step five see how many you convert so this is the idea is that you can give something significantly better away for free than everyone else does ideally something that other people actually charge for and when if you really want to be a Savage about it which why wouldn't you want to be a Savage about it you make it even better than what they have now number two these kind of bets are hard
(01:09) for an employee to make because if you are somebody who's a an awesome marketer or that's your your primary skills you're good at promotion you're good at advertising then I have made this mistake before and I've gotten too far away all right so this is where everyone's working everyone's doing this I don't know why it's a hashtag but this is what work looks like and this is me over here not doing the work what happens is this distance basically dilutes down my marketing skills and I end up basically having a department of people that are using their best skill
(01:43) set rather than mine and so the business loses the biggest asset it has which is me or you and so like Mr Beast is still involved in the creation of his videos Steve Jobs still approved every final ad that went out for Apple so Legend says and so I think that the traditional setup is for the most part made by corporates who aren't Founders who aren't driving output they're just like meeting quarterly earnings they're they're not really changing the world and so I have put my my big kind of words on this fewer better and what that means is that you're going to have to back up
(02:29) your investment and talent with finances and so what I mean by that is if you were to build an department and say okay I need to hire a few people for $775,000 a year okay just use it as simple math well those may be a players b players C players who knows but an a player may be able to do quite literally five times 10 times the output 25 times the output of a b player and and so marketing is one of these roles that has tremendous leverage and so in thinking about this I think I've changed the way that I see building marketing departments phenomenally which is most similar role
(03:13) in a business that I can think of that we have in the portfolio is actually a developer so hear me out developers typically have technical career paths which means that you can be a level one level two level three level four level five all the way up and as they go up they make more money and the reason for that is because one amazing developer can make something that millions of people see so one of the old Legends of Google is that there was a particularly amazing coder they had bought some old version of Google Maps as an acquisition they kept trying to deal with the code
(03:43) and then one really high leverage coder remade the entire product over a weekend and then that is ultimately what became the codebase that we still use today as Google Maps and so one man made that that's how much skill he was able to bring to the table now here's where it makes sense from a business perspective that one guy maybe you have to pay him 10 times more than a traditional coder but if that guy can make a million times the output of one guy then it's still an amazing deal and so the thing is that there is outsized Returns on Talent at the top end and
(04:20) there's a reason that the biggest technology companies the biggest companies in the world are in a war for talent I was thinking about this as it relates to marketing because in many of the the businesses that I've started marketing has been traditionally underst staffed or overstaffed rarely appropriately staffed it's understaffed when it's really just me and like a couple people and when we do that it's because I have a ton of skills in marketing and so we can get away with very few people on the flip side when I get too far away I usually bring someone
(04:51) in and they just bring a lot of bodies but what ends up happening is that the output goes down a lot and so at gym launch there was a period of time where we had 17 people in marketing and once I got rid of the leader I moved in and I took the team from 17 to five and then output tripled and so I say this because the people who have skills are the ones that are moving the needle and so if I have three guys for 75k and they create 3x output one of the really interesting things about knowledge work specifically marketing coding is one of these is that the difference between the best guy and the
(05:29) worst guy in marketing isn't like the best guy who can cut a lawn and the worst guy who can cut a lawn the worst guy who can cut a lawn maybe it takes him an entire day and the best guy maybe takes him you know a third of a day because he's sprinting the whole time so maybe you get a 3X increase because somebody is better and so you'd be limited by how much you'd be able to pay someone more for that quality and that speed whereas with somebody in marketing somebody who's a zero marketer versus a 10 marketer the 10 marketer might literally be able to do a 100 million times more of the output because one guy
(06:04) with skill and an iPhone can get 100 million view video and that kind of Leverage is why it pays to pay better and so this is something that I've been obsessed with uh of late and I'm trying to relay this to each of the portfolio Founders in making sure that we're keeping the marketing divisions tight so that we have the highest leverag people in the highest leverag positions with incentivized performance so that we access their discretionary effort to maximize their skill sets the most important thing that you can take away
(06:36) from this is that the best advertisers don't need many people and if you have no one who's in your quote marketing department that means you and it's a game that you have to learn there are a few things that every founder has to learn at a basic level you have to know the core business you have to know how to get customers you have to know how to deliver customers just about everything else you can Outsource but those two things are core to every business and so if you don't know how to get new customers you need to fix that so the next big one that can get you more
(07:07) outsize customers than anything else is answering a specific question which I ask as a great thought exercise with our team is what would it take to be number one and another way of asking this question is what what else would have to be true for us to be number one in our market and so when we actually hypothesize about this we think okay what would it look like for us to be number one what else would have to be true what else would have to have occurred what's interesting about this question is that it circumvents the
(07:46) traditional incremental thinking meaning instead of saying okay we're just going to do 10% more we're going to do 10% better we're going to do 20% better when you start with the end in mind from a what would it take for us to be number one we assume the goal outcome and the crazy thing about this question is that you might be 1/ 100th the size of the number one player in the market but it assumes what it would take to be a 100 times bigger and then it gets reverse engineered into the present and so what
(08:13) happens often times when I ask this question is they usually State one or two key big things that would have to happen for the business to be number one and then I ask what would it cost for us to do that do we have the resources in order to make that happen and more times than not we actually have the resources to make that happen then the next actual question is then why are we not putting every one of the resources we have right now towards making that come true rather than just continuing on the path that we're on and so this is an order of
(08:45) magnitude increase in terms of business growth and ultimately what generates the most leads and customers and so when I ask myself this question years ago it was what would it take for me to be the number one business Channel right what would it take for that to happen the question beyond that was what would it take for us to be able to have one of the best investment firms in the world and I was like well I would have to have many many many more years of experience it's like I don't know if I can do that I can't make time happen faster so then I followed with okay so for me to be the
(09:16) best investor then what I would want is the most deal flow so what are the different ways of creating deal flow one of them is you can just go to broker networks so you go to investment bankers you get them to send you deals and then you bid on those deals but if I want to be the best investor in the world then I need deals that only come to me and so I was like okay well thankfully I'm pretty good at marketing and so I was like why don't I like what would what would have to be true for me to get lots of inbound deal flow I was like okay well probably building a massive brand around business
(09:44) and so then the the question was how do I build the number one brand business online and so it's the series of questions that I asked and then it was okay well I should probably start making content around this and I should probably write a book or something that would do really well that is in the business space that business owners would read and then think wow this guy knows what he's talking about and so by doing those things by publishing the books by making the content consistently and the moment I realized that that was
(10:13) what it would take I basically put all of my resources towards doing that despite the fact that in the moment it basically meant nothing it meant that I had to go write a book it meant that I had to start making content but I did all of those things because I thought for me to be number one I need to have proprietary deal flow for me to have proprietary deal flow I need to have a big big business brand for me to have a big business brand I need to make more content that's better than everybody else and so that's what I'll start doing now and that's where I'll allocate my
(10:36) resources even though I could have done a lot of different things that was the one that I felt at the time would give me the most leverage and so far it has worked out but asking that type of question you don't get to that type of solution unless you ask the what would it take to be number one and then sometimes the answer surprise you because you do have the resources to do it you just haven't yet and the reason this question is so powerful is actually from Step schwarzman so in in his book or his autobiography I think it's what it takes I think it's what it's called he has this really amazing uh opening
(11:05) couple of chapters and he talks about this idea of thinking big and he says building a really big business is hard building a small business is hard so basically it's just about as hard to do anything because hard is a constant so you might as well go after something really big with the equivalent amounts of hardness now we can get into difficulty levels or whatever but basically the upside of the incremental inre in hardness is outsized and so if you want to build a really successful restaurant it's going to take you a really long time if the man it's lots of people and and it's it's a tough business and if you want to
(11:41) build one of the top software companies in the world it's also going to take a long time and be really hard but one of those could get you into the many billions and one of them will probably cap at a million dollars or $2 million a year and so in thinking about that both of them require the same internal resources from you but very different external resources and so it's like you might as well solve for the biggest thing and this is about resourcefulness not resources if we wanted to be number one in the market part of having propri to De flow comes with two big advantages and this works the same if you're
(12:11) selling customers the same idea selling a vacuum but there's there's two different ways that you can sell in a vacuum and the reason selling a vacuum is so important is because when you sell in a vacuum you no longer have to compete on price or in my instance terms and so the first is you sell where no one else is selling so that's you find the little Pond where there are no other fishermen and then you fish there and you get all the fish you want the second way is to sell something that no one else sells and so one is a
(12:41) where thing and the other is a what thing so either you create something unique that you have some sort of feature or service that no one else can do because you have some sort of technological advantage fundamentally this is what Elon does in every one of his businesses he's happy to go where it's super competitive but he just sells something that no one else can sell and then he can command a premium price for it the alternative is to be good at providing value at scale to people so you get inbound demand and then at that point they're not choosing between you
(13:11) and six other people they're saying I'm either working with you or I'm not doing it all right this next one is huge which is pre is greater than post or uh an ounce of pre is worth a pound of post all right so as I've advertised in many different ways and many different channels for different Industries I have seen this consistently be reinforced for me what happens for most people is they forget to advertise and then they try and play catchup and they hop in front of the camera they sit in front of the computer and they start typing things out and then they hit post they hit submit they run the ad they they post
(13:46) content this then gets propagated as the process and so they hire more people and then they more or less do the same thing and then when the stuff sucks they say we'll fix it in post but the problem is is that post has very low leverage and very high cost whereas pre has incredibly High leverage and very low cost but it just takes more mental work so let me break this down an idea for a video for example has tremendous leverage more leverage than just about everything else if there is a video concept that more people would click and
(14:20) watch to see that idea itself even poorly executed will get an order of magnitude greater amounts of people to watch the content or watch the ad than otherwise and so putting more time into pre is the highest leverage activity that you can do and so more of my time now when I make ads for example for school I will spend on the pre-production that will be looking at past ads that performed well looking at the hooks that continue to to do well making sure that we have some props and things like that that we can use as
(14:55) visual aids and then when we actually do the recording it's very short and the the post- production because all of the work is already in the video there's very little that must be done afterwards and so what happens is the rate of progress and output increases to use a a big word tremendously and so the only reason for post- production especially in education is to enhance comprehension meaning to make it easier for people to get what the video is about and this is different than an entertainment where a lot of the
(15:29) emphasis on post but for the vast majority of businesses their advertising and marketing comes down to educating the customer or potential customer and if education is the type of advertising you do which is what most businesses do then you need to put more into do people find this interesting can I make it simple rather than I'm just going to hit record and see what happens yeah and the thing that shifted my perspective on This was um I think it's called calculus Walla but it's this Indian Channel where there's a guy who's like 20
(16:01) million subscribers and he teaches like physics Walla and like calculus and these different classes and his videos get like 10 20 million views just like crazy crazy numbers and it's just a dude in a whiteboard and when I saw that I was like I am I am missing the boat here like I am doing it all wrong and so we have consistently stripped back more and more of this postproduction put more and more of it into pre so this video for example like I have notes rather than than uh just kind of like winging it and then having the team just like cut
(16:33) everything that was not as good out right instead it's like okay let me be more purposeful about the points that I want to hit make sure that they actually make sense in sequence so that afterwards they don't have to reorder the video and then cut out this thing and then say hey could you resay this part it was unclear it's like I have examples I have clear language that I've already thought about ahead of time so that I can ultimately make a better video for you and also an easier video for my team to be able to produce so that we can make more faster adding razzled Dazzle and whizbangs is not
(17:02) going to make a video more educational so this next one is a really high leverage concept which I overheard this for the first time from a marketer named Perry Belcher and it was I don't think you even use this term but need to believes all right and so need to believes are basically like you want the Fest amount of need to believes for a customer to make a purchasing decision and so I'll give you a bad example of a business that I had then I'll give you a good example so with Prestige Labs one of the difficulties that I had was that I had
(17:34) to convince someone of two things I had to convince gym owners that they should sell supplements not all gym owners want to sell supplements some gym owners are against supplements but I had to convince them that selling supplements was not a bad thing then I had a second thing that I had to convince them of which is that Prestige Labs was a suppl company that they should use and so I had two need to beliefs and so it made it a very difficult sale uh to get someone because it was just too much basically education in Too Short a
(17:58) period of time now over the Long Haul could you do something like that yes knowing what I know now I'd probably have a multi-layered campaign one that basically gets the first big decision and then a second kind of campaign later for warmer audience kind of like middle of funnel that would then convert people into specifically Prestige Labs uh Affiliates or sellers retailers but that's a lot of work and you're definitely not going to make sales quickly an alternative to that is that if you look at most of the uh like real estate investment space right so anybody
(18:28) who who has funds who who invest in real estate who flip real estate who help people flip real estate find their first properties whatever there's this need to believe that doesn't really exist that real estate helps people make money most people generally agree that real estate is an asset class many people have made money in real estate and so there's just not a lot that has to be believed for someone to say okay well you are good at real estate I will buy your thing to help me could get at real estate and by buying it it means either I I I give money to your fund and then you do it on
(18:58) my behalf or you you you help me Source deals or whatever it is right and when we think about like the ultimate business opportunity of all time which I think is Amazon Amazon itself fundamentally had the proposition to anybody who wanted to sell anything all you have to do is upload your product onto our site and you can make money there's almost no like you don't need to know how to Market you don't need to know how to sell you don't need to handle customer service or customer support they took away every conceivable reason for
(19:28) someone that they would have to believe in order to be successful they were like you just need to follow this tutorial and then just upload your product like that's it and so as a result Amazon has made a tremendous amount of money and so the only real need to believe is that someone else might buy my product on Amazon and so people believe that and then they buy so it's like they barely even have a need to believe it's like a half belie right and so when I think about products and offers I think what
(19:57) must a customer believe in in order to make this purchase and do I have multiple humps or Hills that I have to get over and ideally I want to reposition or repackage the product and offer in such a way that there's either no beliefs they have to believe or only one and so if you're struggling to get more customers and you want to get crazy amounts of customers quickly you want to limit the amount of things that they need to learn or need to believe in order to buy and the reason that giving away tons of free stuff like I mentioned at the very beginning is powerful is that it will basically move more people
(20:28) from H someone who needs more information to someone who needs less information and so fundamentally this is what branding is on a large scale is that you're educating a large percentage of the audience and conquering some of the need to believes before they make the purchase if you try to go Cradle to grave in one move you will usually sell a smaller percentage of the marketplace unless you have figured out how to make that 6inch putt a 6-inch putt for everyone like Amazon has same thing with Uber it's like would you have to believe in order to make money on Uber you just have to be able to download an app you
(20:58) know upload your drivers license not have DUIs or whatever the requirements are and you have to have a car and so as long as you believe that when your phone dings you will get paid it's not it's not a huge hill that you have to get over in order to make money this next one is nasty so I am a big fan of split testing right and you've probably seen it with my thumbnails on you know these YouTube videos um because fundamentally why would you not want to get more for what you put in you take all this time to to to put together some notes think about examples you know make sure that it's easy to understand you know put
(21:29) together a thumbnail it's like why would we not just like test the thumbnail image when we could have two things and one of the thumbnails could like 3x the views on the video like that's a high leverage activity and So within the business that you have in terms of getting more customers I am all about thinking in terms of orders of magnitude but when you can get 10 20 30% boost and you can do it in three or four parts of the funnel you can double or triple the amount that you're getting from what you're already doing and when that
(21:56) happens your profit will increase disproportionately to your Revenue so if you double revenue and you keep your cost the same you could very well three or fourx profit because that additional Revenue might not have nearly the cost of the first set of Revenue that you had to incur with your fixed costs I want to rank for you the most important split tests that I do with a business the first is going to be offers all right that's the big obvious thing like what's the thing that you're giving away or that you're giving them the second is going to be the packaging which is going to be the headlines and sub headlines
(22:28) the Third third is going to be the images Associated all right with that headline and that packaging now the fourth one and this one's really the biggest split test winners I've had have come from one and four now the reason four is fourth is because it's actually really hard to do but the biggest personal gains that I've had have come from this which is third-party Integrations you're like what does that even mean well a lot of businesses use other technology you have a software stack you have you know uh
(23:03) you have a CRM you have auler you have a form a form thing uh on your on your site like all of these different pieces typically exist but what those third-party apps and tools don't typically report on is what the conversion rate is of their ux or their user experience and so I have found some unbelievable unlocks some of the biggest absolute split test winners have come from just saying like oh we're not going to use this software to capture this stuff we're going to use this software and even though the Aesthetics were basically the same outside of the third
(23:37) party integration I have had this happen four times in my career where this test was like a company explosion in terms of increase in sales and profit like really big the reason most people don't do this though is that it's hard so if you have to split this different tools it's like okay well we got some customers here in this system we some customers here it's kind kind of messy but it's one of the most valuable things you can do and what's interesting to me is that almost no third party provider ever reports on
(24:06) conversion rate data because honestly how could they because everybody's different but by having that and testing it for yourself you'll see some of the biggest gains that you've ever had one of the cool things with all of these is that when you implement these things you get permanent lifts for the most part so meaning like if you change the offer and then everything crushes it's like great that's the offer if you change the headline you find out that's the headline and it's like cool like this just keeps converting for us so it's like it's onetime effort for ongoing
(24:34) gains and like those are my favorite types of things to do in the world like you know build once sell a thousand times like those that I mean fundamentally like a book same idea you write a book once it's a lot of effort once but then after that you can just keep selling the book over and over and over over again and same thing when you give away free free products it's like you build it once and then that can get you unlimited amounts of leads last week for Black Friday I um spent 200 plus hours not on that day but leading up to
(24:58) it come up with a scaling road map uh basically taking a company from 0 to 100 million it's 14 hours that breaks 10 stages of growth for any company and it divides it across eight different functions of the business so Marketing sales customer success product it HR recruiting finance and so all of the functions of the business what the problem that you're dealing with right now and what you need to do to graduate that whole thing took me a really long time to put together but now that it's there and everyone can just like fill
(25:28) bill out questions and get a personalized solution for them and it's free and it's better than other people charge for then that can just consistently get more businesses into my world so the next big way of getting customers so fast it should feel legal is spend more waight that's not what it is it's be able to spend more so let me explain the difference so spending more is just cool you increase your budget sure and that can work but most businesses like if you ask businesses why they fail so they they do surveys in the Census Bureau and I think the number one reason that small businesses say
(26:06) that they can't succeed is because they have a lack of customers they have a lack of leads they have a lack of demand and the reality most of the time is not that they have a lack of leads but that they don't have a good enough business to be able to afford them and so this is where you have to solve the business from back to front and so there was a company um not that long ago that that uh that came out here to the headquarters and they're like we need help scaling and I said so what do you think your constraint is and their constraint was leads cost too much by
(26:35) the way leads costing too much is rarely ever an issue the issue is usually that you don't make enough money per customer and here's a fun factoid for you that I can share I look at a lot of different companies every single day and that's because we sift through deals and we look for patterns between markets and so right now for example I'm really interested in the metpa space and I would really like to get into into a chain there so if you are metpa owner and you have you know call it fiveish million in EAA hit us up anyways one of the things that's not unique between
(27:07) different met spot chains is their cost to acquire customers so the range of the cost of getting people in the door is usually actually not that different so the benchmarks are usually maybe 1X 2x of one another not huge but where the major differences that exist between change in terms of their success is their LTV which is how much customers are worth to that business over the long term and this is usually where the rich get richer this is why the biggest companies in the world are the biggest companies in the world Starbucks has a $14,000 LTV now for Starbucks to acquire
(27:41) a coffee customer is probably not going to cost that much more if anything they're probably wildly inefficient because there's this m massive corporate Behemoth right compared to the local coffee shot down the street but if they're going to head-to-head from an actual per dollar per customer basis usually the small local guy should be able to out compete the big National Guy where the big National guy gets them is that they've got 40 or 50 years of optimizing lifetime value per customer so they know every single thing that gets customers to come back what gets them addicted what types of products on
(28:08) what seasons what you know what pumps of flavors to give what options to provide which ones to cut they know all of these things and that is how they out compete and so right now if your cost to acquire customer is about the same as your industry which by the way you can totally just Google this it's not that hard you just say like uh average cost cost customer insert industry right and you can find it very quickly in a couple Google searches that will then tell you oh maybe I'm not that far off oh my
(28:36) business is broken and so this often happens a lot too where a small business owner will be like those guys overcharge I'm going to come into the market and charge less it's like well there's a reason that they charge more and why they're bigger than you because they make more money so they can charge more because they've already figured this out and so in my opinion the ability to spend more is LTV and LTV is the arms race of advertising and if you can spend more than anyone else can you can Outlast them because
(29:04) here's a fact that will make a lot of you uncomfortable advertising only becomes more expensive over time the cost to get a customer literally only goes up the cost of Impressions cost of eyeballs only goes up over time and so you need to have a force in your business that also concurrently goes up over time which is your LTV customers should continue to pay for the services from you continue to buy your products and you should be continually expanding LTV so that as you go to colder and colder markets on more and more expensive media channels that you can
(29:35) continue to outspend and earn a profit and you might be wondering why doesn't anyone do this well it's usually an entirely different skill set and there's usually fear associated with the actions that most strongly increase LTV so changing or raising prices something that most business owners are terrified of it's one of the strongest levers on lifetime value and yet no one does it and so they instead are like how can I get you cheaper leads because they had this one campaign this one time that kind of worked and then they're like I
(30:02) wish it was like that time it's kind of like their heroin addicts where like the first time they're you know they're chasing the first high and everyone every marketing campaign after that uh they're trying to get lead cost to that low it's never going to happen again just get over it the first time you send any kind of AD in a new market or you've got a new offer it's always going to do the best that's not going to be your your stabilization point it's going to get worse and so you have to build the business to accommodate that rather than stomp your feet and wish that leads were
(30:26) cheaper oh yeah man I love this one all right so affiliate models that work all right so we're talking about getting customers Stupid Fast all right one of the highest leverage things you can do is go to somebody who's already spent years developing your audience and then just ask to be promoted in front of it now there's a number of ways of doing this of course you can go for the Mega influencers and things like that the way that I have built every affiliate business that I have run has been not going after the Super Affiliates but
(30:57) instead trying to AG at many smaller businesses or nodes of new Revenue so there is a business right now that already has all the customers that you want and they don't have your product and you would both benefit from collaborating rather than competing and so here's the issue if I were to get on stage in front of a thousand business owners and say raise your hand if you have a deal where if someone refers you a customer you give them 20% half the remov raise their hand they'd be like oh yeah I do that and be like okay everybody is raising your hands why don't you go refer a customer to one another and then the hands go down
(31:34) because no one cares no one's going to say okay I spent all this effort all this time to build trust advertise sell create a relationship and I'm just going to hand them to you for 20% of your ticket what do I care right I'd rather just not even introduce the variable just keep living my life and so if you really want Affiliates to work you have to make it so good that it hurts all right and when I say that I mean you got to give the affiliate so much that you're like man they're going to make a killing on this and this is how I like to do it so let's say that you've got a
(32:06) product all right that has uh let's see if this drawing will actually work out I don't know this is why I draw on an iPad normally okay so let's say that we've got your product and you've got kind of four components to it right I guess this is more than four is it four no it's eight whatever you get the idea all right and you sell this thing for whatever $1,000 okay so what we want to do is we're going to say we want to take this corner and we're going to peel this thing off all right so this is just
(32:38) going to be a little side project that we have here just pretend that's a cube this is still a and instead of saying hey man I'll give you 20% give them 20% of your product and give them 100% here what I'm saying if I were a masseuse and what are all the things that I do okay I might do sports massage I might I might have the the the lotions and the oils I might do the the hot stone thing right or I might be selling you know 10 10 Massage packages or 20 Massage packages whatever I would go to a business owner and
(33:15) instead of saying hey I'll give you 20% uh if you send me somebody who gets a massage I would say hey man um why don't you sell all your customers three massages and you can sell it for whatever you want from me you can keep all the money oh wait so this is like a well how much can I charge whatever you want but it's got to be at least this so that minimum is whatever your price is because you don't want to get cheap customers in so let's say that your price is uh is $100 so you say you have to be able to sell uh those three massages for at least 300 you can sell for 500 you can sell for 300 you'll keep
(33:52) the whole 300 I just need to make sure the Price Is Right so it's the right people so let's say these guys are like oh my God these guys are nuts I'm gonna sell these three Massage packages for $500 and I'm gonna keep all of it you know what I would think to myself what's my cost so the cost of a massage let's say that you uh you you you pay your your your massage maybe it's you right let's say you pay $30 per massage and hard cost in terms of Labor okay so would I pay $90 to get somebody to do three sessions
(34:24) with me that paid $500 for those three sessions well that sounds like an incredibly qualified lead to me and not only is it $90 it's $90 in no other work I'm not making ads I'm not running them and buying media I'm not building landing pages I'm not working leads calling them sending them I don't have any of that they already paid they're going to show and so all I have to do is just have an easy handoff where they can just schedule them onto my calendar and then they've already paid so the likel they show is fine and the
(34:54) rest of it's automated when that happens and then you make this offer hey man and you do that to a 100 businesses there's a lot of businesses who are like oh I'm down to sell something for $500 and do no work and there's something mental about you don't split it with me just take all the money it's a very different vibe and so what ends up happening is they either use it as an upsell or they include it in their $1,000 thing and they put your thing in and they charge the th000 and give them the three massages you don't care either way you
(35:30) have a $90 cost of getting somebody who spent a lot of money and is perfectly qualified for whatever your next thing is and so then you just do the math and say okay well I know that I convert one out of three of these people one of three into my $2,000 thing which means that my cost to get a customer here would be 3 * 90 which is $270 so would I pay $270 to get $2,000 hell yeah I would and without any of the work of course and this is how you build an affiliate model that gets you customers Stupid Fast and gets you
(36:08) Affiliates who are trying to fill up your calendars because it actually makes sense for them now so if you're going to have Affiliates do it like you mean it it has to be incentivizing enough to change their behavior or it's useless it's kind of like these these uh these you know coupon codes that I see people give out to like influencers it's like 10% off it's like who cares like it like either I'm going to buy the jacket or I'm not 10% is probably not going to move the needle for me at all now for me discounts have to be 50% or higher for in my opinion
(36:38) for a real change in Behavior we get a massive increase in demand and so I don't want to take that off my main thing I want to peel my main thing and then give 100% of that and so this next one is truth and you're like what is that even mean how is this going to get me customers really fast well well lies will certainly get you customers pretty quickly but it also ruin your reputation so you want truth to be your greatest Ally not your greatest liability because I will tell you a secret about advertising nothing sells like the truth
(37:10) and so one people talk about being authentic well if you want your advertising to be authentic just say what's true and what's interesting is that a lot of people won't tell the truth about the things that actually could help them so like if you're a small business and you're getting started say so if you um if you don't have a huge amount of capacity because you're small say so not having a lot of capacity increases scarcity it means that there's fewer slots available not having a lot of capacity indicates that there's probably
(37:40) a high level of personalization and Personal Touch being a small business for many people is a pro there aren't as many people are like buy big corporate buy big corporate no people are like Buy Local Buy small business right they support small business and so like a lot of what people think are negatives are actually things that make their offer or their business more compelling especially to the Right audience and so you want to arm yourself with truth and think about how many different things are true and if you want to get really
(38:10) nasty with it you want to tell the truth that also isn't as exciting upfront so that when you sell your second piece of Truth they will then believe you that much more so I'll give you an example so I remember we had a a location that had bad parking and so we would say stuff like listen we have you know we don't have the biggest parking lot or we're not the biggest gym in the neighborhood you know we don't have more equipment than the guys down the street but you know what when you walk in this store you're going to forget about all of that
(38:42) because you're going to have so much fun you're not even going to care because this is a damaging admission it's X bad thing here I'll show you the equation for this I'll show you the formula for this so it's bad bab bad but good so but is an amplifier for this word so if I said I have an incredibly short temper I am impatient and I don't shower very much but I will be able to now you want this to be relevant to the damaging admissions so but I make you laugh but I will make you laugh your ass off all night for the price of a couple beers if you say that those negatives
(39:38) then are diminished and the good thing is Amplified and so if you know that you're going to tell the truth and that people are going to find out about this anyways you might as well be the one who controls the narrative and you can frame it in a way that that bad truth helps amplify your good truth obviously come from the the fitness space and so the examples that I think of um are there which is sometimes you know like a one of the gym owners was not like super in shape they'd be like hey I'm not the
(40:08) most in shaped guy but we have more fun at our gym and people get great results even though I like donuts a lot still and so what happens is people are like man this guy's so authentic and if you don't say it they're going to think it so you might as well account for it up front answer the why should I listen to you or what about about this big flaring problem that I can obviously see you want to control the narrative and make that thing into a weapon for you make it into an asset that serves your purpose rather than something that cast doubt in
(40:39) the prospect because if you claim it they they like I don't know why this works this way but it's kind of like Eminem when he when he said all the negative things in 8 Mile that anyone else could say about him so no one else could say anything bad it's like if you claim them then people can't hold it against you and the hardest thing in all of marketing is getting someone to believe you and so everything that you can do to increase trust is one of the best investments you can make in an advertising campaign in general and ultimately in building a brand the truth
(41:08) isn't just a good strategy it's the only long-term strategy and it just takes people a different amount of time to realize it and once you've activated Affiliates once you've given away crazy amounts of stuff for free once you've doubled down on the right people who are high leverage in the position once you've made the truth your Ally and you put your negatives out in the marketing so that people believe the good stuff that you say and you focused on doing more and doing better you're going to start getting more customers than you can

Transcript:
(00:00) Do you want to hear something absolutely insane? If nobody knows who you are, it's actually a good thing. And so imagine this is you and you're here because you have no followers and of course you're very sad by that or at least you think you are.
(00:18) Maybe you're crying very sad tears, right? And you don't have this massive audience like these big celebrities or influencers do. And I'm just going to explain three reasons why this will help you win. My name's Alexi. I'm the founder of acquisition.com. We make huge sums of money that are unreasonable. Uh so much so that I can have unnecessary extra camera angles like this one and this one and this one.
(00:42) But I will give you my my quick disclaimer which is that everything that I'll share with you um I'm an experienced business person and marketer and so these are no way promises that you will achieve anything at all. Mostly because most people do absolutely nothing. That being said, let's dive in. So number one is that you're an underdog. So the first and most important point of being unheard of is that every position actually has an advantage.
(01:07) And so for example, let me tell you a story. So I had a company called Allen, which I ended up selling 75% of um four years ago, 2021, however many years ago that was. While I was working inside of Allen, we had B2B customers, we had agency owners. And so an agency owner got on the phone with me and he actually was serving gym owners.
(01:26) Now at the time I still owned Gym Launch, the company that I ended up selling also in 2021. He said, "I feel like it's not fair that I have to compete with you." Now, mind you, I'm like here trying to help this guy grow his business, even though he is technically a competitor of mine by selling to gym owners. I made this point to him that I thought was worth making probably for you, which it doesn't really matter where you're at in business.
(01:44) Like I think one, you should always try and think like an underdog. If you're in the apparel space, you're always competing with Nike. And so like you're an underdog compared to Nike. But I think the underdog mentality is a winning mentality because underdogs are the ones who win ultimately.
(01:56) And the people who are at the top of the mountain are the ones who are fat and happy and end up getting taken over by the underdog. And so I mean Jeff Basos talks about this. He says it's always day one at Amazon is that we want to they want to keep that mentality. And part of that reason is why they are so big is that they still maintain that flexibility. So I want to hit on some of these advantages.
(02:13) in talking to this uh agency owner, he was struggling and he said, "Everybody who gets on the phone with me says,"Well, you know, you're not gym launch and you know, give me your track record, how long you've been doing this, things like that." And he was like, "I just don't really have a good response.
(02:31) " And so I said, "Well, have you considered that one, when I started I was in your position?" And so, one, it's possible. Number two is that your advantage is that you're not me, right? So, if we're the biggest person in the space, which Gym Launch is arguably the biggest the market leader in that in that industry, the advantage that I have as Gym Launch is I'm going to say, "Hey, this guy Adrian is in his mama's basement and has no track record.
(02:58) And if you want Coca-Cola Classic and you want to know that it's that you have success stories and there's tons of case studies and tons of proof of gyms just like yours seeing this level of success, we know that our system works. You just have to run the system, right?" And so that's fairly compelling. Now, what do you say in response to that? Well, what you would say to the prospect is like, listen, well, you don't want to work with Gym Launch because to them, you're just a number.
(03:16) You're never going to meet Alex. You're never going to even probably even talk to him. He's not going to know your name, right? You're going to get assigned some account rep, right, that doesn't care either. And they're just going to be running through some like checklist with you. Whereas for me, you're going to have my cell phone number. If you need anything, you can call me whenever you want.
(03:32) And it's actually me. And so who you're really comparing is not, you know, my company versus Gym Launch. It's me versus their rep who they would assign you to. And I can promise you I'm far more dedicated to seeing you succeed than they are. Compelling. Of course, both positions have advantages. And so you want to play the cards you're dealt.
(03:52) Only a loser's perspective that their position in some way dictates how the end is going to happen, right? Because one of the beautiful things about having nothing to lose is that you also have everything to gain. And so what it means is that you also have unlimited shots on goal because if you miss, you're just back at zero, which is exactly where you are.
(04:09) So you have essentially risk-free unlimited upside, which I think people wildly underestimate the advantage of the underdog, which is why in terms of game theory, they're the most dangerous player on the board because they can't lose.
(04:27) And that perspective was ultimately what got me to even quit my job in the very beginning was worst case scenario, I just get my job back. So that means that like I have risk-free shots. It's like life giving you a lottery ticket. The only thing you pay for is with time, but you still have unlimited upside every time you scratch it off. To me, not a bad gig. And to be clear, I have the portfolio that we have now and it's all all this money and success, whatever.
(04:45) But like I had nine businesses that amounted to almost nothing before I had my first real big win. And unless you're Mark Zuckerberg or you're Jeff Bezos, which is not common, uh most people fail the first time and the second and the third. And sometimes what happens is that the failures just become less failure.
(05:03) Like in the beginning like not no one buys anything. But you do remember building the logo on the website and thinking that you had a business but like nothing happens, right? And then finally you make your first sale, but you're like this isn't a real business. Like what's going on here? Like I exchanged money, so I guess I technically in business.
(05:14) Do I have to pay taxes on this now? Like what happens, right? And then and then eventually you get to one where you're like, "Okay, now I'm starting to sell stuff and make money, but like I'm not actually making money. I'm making revenue, but I'm making no profit. I'm like incurring all this risk and all this debt in order to get it going.
(05:27) " and you're like still trying to figure it out and then on like your fourth try you're like oh what do you know I made a profit and it took me five years to get here. every entrepreneur that I know, so I don't know Zuck and I don't know Jeff Peso, so you know, unfortunately I'm not there.
(05:44) But the guys that I know, almost all of us like failed for a while, like I don't know anybody who like crushed it in their first 5 years. Like most people like basically ate glass and stared into the abyss to to quote Elon Musk, which is just existential dread at all points in time. And the eating glass is the fact that all you do all day is deal with problems, which are mostly revolve around people. And somehow you're supposed to get work done in between.
(06:02) So, if you're in that kind of underdog position, you can pop open the leads book and I have a chapter that I wrote on this which is called More Better News. So, it's 161 and I actually tell some of this story um that I'm telling you right now. And one of the things that most smaller underdogs really no matter what size you are relatively have this belief that's false. And so, I want to kind of crush it for you real quick.
(06:25) The reason for this ad is I'm throwing the entrepreneur event of the season and you're invited. This is going to be my biggest book ever. No, not like that. This is going to be my biggest book. Well, not even like that. This is going to be my biggest book ever. Actually, not even like that. This is going to be my biggest book ever. 100 million Money Models.
(06:42) And I've been preparing to release this book to you for over two years. And at the launch event, August 16th, I'm going to be showing you how to get more customers to spend more money with you in less time over and over again. It's the most valuable skill set I have. Now, on top of that, come check this out.
(07:00) I've got five mystery headliners that have all confirmed they're going to be there live and they've never before shared the same stage and most these people don't speak publicly. Now, on top of that, I have four amazing bonuses that are available to anyone who wants to pre-order a book. You don't have to because you can register for free for that. You can show up for free. You can enjoy all of that for nothing.
(07:13) But if you want to pre-order a copy of the book, I got four bonuses for you. Now, on top of that, I've got one project that I've been working on for the last 2 years that I'll be unveiling live. And I can't tell you what it is, but I can tell you that it's better than an NFT. It's less than a bitcoin and every single person who shows up live gets one. So if you want it, click register.
(07:31) I'll see you there live August 16th. Pre-order a book if you want. It's going to be awesome. So number one is that the volatility that you're experiencing is a result of inadequate volume. So you're not doing enough which gives the appearance of volatility. So let me say it differently. If you were to sell one person every like three to five weeks and you're like, "Yeah, every month I get like one customer, sometimes I get two customers." What that really means is that there's a certain amount of advertising activity that is occurring, whether it's you doing it or it's other
(08:07) people doing it on your behalf or it's word of mouth, any of those things are happening. And it takes that much volume for you to get one new customer. And so the question we have to ask ourselves is how can I take the amount of advertising that's occurring over four weeks to get me one customer and crush it into one day so I get one new customer every day.
(08:24) That's all it is. The volume increasing volume negates luck and will give you consistency. The second piece is understanding where you actually sit here. Page 168 the size of the pie fallacy. So the issue is that most small businesses think that it's like this. They start advertising on one channel. They're really happy.
(08:44) Look at this big smiley face. Okay. Then a competitor comes in and they start advertising on the same channel. And then in their minds they think, "Oh no, I have half of this market now." And then all of a sudden two more competitors come in and now you're like, "Oh no, I have a quarter of this market. It's shrinking fast. It's so saturated.
(09:03) " But that's a fallacy. It's a lie. It's an illusion. This is what it looks like in reality. So most people see their market as one method, one platform, one medium. They're like, "Well, I make Instagram reels and that's how I get my customers." So, anybody else who makes Instagram reels, they're they're in my market and it's saturated.
(09:21) But the reality is that there's so many ways to get customers. You can do warm outreach. You can do cold outreach. You can post content. You can run ads. You can have affiliates. You could have referral networks. You could have employees doing this on your behalf. You could have agencies and head hunters who bring people in. All of these different vehicles for advertising.
(09:39) And then within those vehicles, now you have the platforms of all those things, right? So, it's like you're making content on LinkedIn. You're making content on Twitter, you're making content on podcast, you're making content on on tw on t on on Twitter, uh Tik Tok, right? For however long it lasts, right? So, all of these different platforms. It's like, so really that little circle that you have is just this tiny itty bitty circle here and all of these other circles and all of these other methods and all of these other mediums are basically empty. And so, the reality is no one knows you exist. And
(10:06) so, the answer is you have to advertise more. you have to let more more people know about your stuff. And so the way that we do this is we do the rule of 100. All right? And so by method, that means that's page 164. You either do a 100 reachouts a day, cold or warm.
(10:23) You do a 100 minutes of making content and post something, which for some reason I didn't put that in the book. Um, no, I said release it one per day. Thank God. All right. But some people hear that first line and they're like, I'm making 100 minutes of content today. And I'm like, I haven't seen you post. They're like, well, I'm still working on it.
(10:34) I'm like, what are you doing? Post. All right. And then and then um paid ads is 100 minutes a day of making paid ads. So that's doing the research, looking at other hooks, recording, editing, cutting it, and spending money, right? You got to spend money. And the amount of money you spend, I would say per month should be relative to what you're willing to pay per customer.
(10:54) Okay? Now, I have an update to this that I'll share with you which we learned from the school games because I help a lot of people who are starting out. Now, it doesn't matter whether you're brand new or you're an experienced business owner.
(11:05) If you start a new channel, you're still starting at zero, right? And one of the things that we added in for at least the content side was most of the times you'll be limited by, you know, the amount that you can make and sometimes even the amount of DMs that you can do on on a social platform. But one thing that's not really limited or less limited is the amount of comments that you can leave uh on other people's posts.
(11:22) And so what you want to do, the goal is to have the best comment on a post that is relevant to your avatar. So basically, it's like all of these posts exist. They're almost like free ads that you think are attracting the attention of your avatar. And so what you want to do is have the most thoughtful response to that uh post and then you basically can like hitch a ride on somebody else's views and it's totally legal.
(11:43) So like do that on top of this. And this is for those you are like I just don't know what to do. This is what you do. You reach out to people, you make content, you run ads. Pick one. And to be clear, this is Alex's two cents. So this is this is a personal opinion. Um I don't really tear people down. That's just I just don't do that.
(12:02) Um, some people like make their whole brands on dunking on other people. I just don't like that kind of negativity personally, like in my life or otherwise. Um, you're welcome to do whatever you want. My recommendation would be to give people flowers and, you know, basically give them props, which is what I think millennials say. Uh, for when they do a good job. Sorry, I'm dating myself here.
(12:19) Uh, flowers, right? Uh, tell them they did a good job and basically break down or add to it. Say like, I love all this and uh, and I think that's a great way. So instead of saying basically this is and thinking instead of or thinking. So my first piece of homework is write what your advantage is in your current position. So if you're if you're Nike and Nike if you do want to respond to this video, I'm totally okay with it.
(12:44) Uh but if you're not Nike, right, talk about the unique angle that you have compared to the leader in your marketplace. Because let's be real, the vast vast majority of people who are watching this are not the leader because only one leader and everybody else who's not the leader is more people than the one. So the likelihood that you're not the leader is high.
(13:02) So talk about how you're different than they are in a way that is factually correct that they cannot argue with and drop it in the comments. I'd love to see them. And everything that I just talked to you about those positions is what I would weave into my sales and my marketing because the nice thing there is it's also it's not like claims based. It's just like these are the facts and this is the reality of it.
(13:19) And if you ever want to make more compelling marketing, the thought that I would give you is just drill one level deeper. At the surface level, it's like it's David and Goliath. But like when you actually drill down, it's an unfair advantage because David isn't really competing against Goliath.
(13:31) It's competing against Goliath's like kneecap, right? It's like it's the piece of the larger thing. There's this amorphous idea of Nike, but really all you're competing against is the person who's six levels down who got hired out of college to make their social media post for one specific, you know, person or whatever. That's who you have to beat.
(13:51) And so, like, the way that you beat the Roman Empire isn't by taking the Roman Empire on head on. It's by tiny little nibbles on the edge of their kind of perimeter and just working your way in. And fundamentally, that's how the barbarians over time, you know, crunch down on Rome. And so, in this instance, we are the barbarians.
(14:10) Now, part two, it's actually much easier to figure out a smaller business than a bigger one. And let me explain. So, you've probably heard the idea that if you have a boat, right, it's much easier to turn a dinghy than it is to turn the Titanic. Well, obviously you can't turn the Titanic because they dead. Just kidding. The boat's dead. the people might still be alive. I have no idea.
(14:29) Um, and I don't know if they had smoke stacks, but let's just pretend this is the Titanic before they had this big hole and everyone died. Okay? And so, and so the idea is it's much easier and more nimble to move a small boat. Now, let me give you the actual math. So, this is cute, but let me tell you the actual business behind this. We use a term that we call nail it then scale it.
(14:47) All right? And it's really nail it in order to scale it. And the problem is most people learn how to advertise. They learn how to sell a little bit and then think, "Oh, I just need to do more of that." But here's the problem with that.
(14:59) Until you find out what the compounding vehicle is within your business, you're bound to plateau. And so, I've done this example before, but I think it's so powerful that it's worth repeating. All right? So, let's say that you have company A and company B. All right? And both of them sell 100 people per year. Okay? So, 100 new customers per year. Sorry, A sells 100 per year.
(15:17) B sells 100 the first year, 200 the second year, 300 the third year. Well, which company would you rather have at face value? You'd think, "Oh, I'd rather have B." But wait, there's more. Let's say company B loses 100 customers every year because they're not that good at what they do or they don't have a very good model. And so that means that next year they lose 200 and next year lose 300.
(15:36) Now, let's say company A keeps 100% of their customers. So, year two, they actually have 200 customers and year three they have 300 customers. They have the original 200 plus this 100. So, now it's 300 in total. So, both of these look like they're 300 sales per year businesses.
(15:56) But which of these would you now rather have? This guy, because the margins are going to be better because you don't have to pay to acquire all of these extra customers. They had to pay to acquire 600 customers, right? This one only had to pay to acquire 300. All of that added cost drops straight to the bottom line.
(16:13) But on top of that, this is a business that literally will always keep growing. If you think about it, every year they you could sell another 100 customers and it would just keep growing. This business next year, if you sell another 300, the only way to grow is to sell 400 customers next year just to keep up with a and I can promise you one of the laws of nature is that advertising to acquire customers only becomes more expensive in time because you are going out to colder and colder audiences that are less and less of a fit. You're you're not getting the early
(16:36) adopters. You're actually getting the lagards and the late adopters. And so it costs you more to reach them. They're harder to sell. They're more price sensitive. like it has all the negative things. And so this is common when companies look that are bigger. If they're looking to exit, the acquirers, any who's an investor is going to look at this and say, how much runway is there that's left? And is there a way that we want at the very least can maintain the customers we have and ideally have some sort of vehicle inside
(17:00) of it that allows those customers to bring us more customers. And so imagine that let's say you're here and then you watch this video. And unfortunately, I've had a lot of business owners who watch my stuff like realize this is that they're like, "Oh no, I'm this business and I'm selling 300 people every year and I'm losing 300 people every year.
(17:19) Well, what do I do now?" It's tough because you're in a rock in a hard place scenario. And this is why it's so important to nail it, then scale it. And so, you just want to advertise and sell enough so that you can figure out what is required in order to keep customers, keep them happy, keep them referring, keep them paying.
(17:35) If you can't figure that out, there's basically no point to scaling. it's going to get more and more expensive. Your margins are going to get thinner and it will feel more volatile because you probably ri rely almost exclusively on paid ads. That's tough. And so having a different way to think about it, which is you want to get the foundational unit right. Once you get that right, everything else gets much easier.
(17:53) You know, I'm a I'm a huge consumer of software startup, you know, founders. And one of the things that they talk about a lot is it's so much better to just build your product or build your service for a 100 people to absolutely love you than to have a million people who kind of like you. I think part of this is that it's very difficult to to build something for the amorphice for like the faceless masses.
(18:11) But it's much easier to build something for a specific person of which there happen to be many and many of those people. And so I think getting really crystal clear this is why having like an ICP or customer avatar whatever you want to call it um some sort and you can like name them. It's like this is Jenny. this is our customer.
(18:30) She has three kids and she, you know, wants to lose weight or whatever it is, right? Would Jenny like this? Like, what would Jenny think about this? Right? And some of the best companies that I've seen from a product and branding perspective always basically have Jenny sitting at the table or their customer avatar and they're like, "Well, what do you think Jenny thinks about this?" Right? And that's what allows them to make the best long-term decisions for both the customer and the brand.
(18:48) Like, for the love of God, if the economics that you have when you're small aren't amazing, they're not going to get better when you get bigger. And so if you're like, "Okay, that's great, Alex, but how do I tactically improve my offer or like my offering to the marketplace?" So inside the offer book, I talk about this um which is creating your grand slam offer part one and two, which is basically the problems and solutions.
(19:06) And so I think one of the best exercises that anyone can do with their team is and if it's if you're just the team, then it's just you, right? Is to sit down and say, let's write down what here I'll walk through I'll walk I'll walk you through it. So the first thing we're going to say is what's the dream, right? What does Jenny want? what is what is her big outcome that she wants to have happen.
(19:24) Okay, now that we define that, we want to be as crystal clear about that as we possibly can. It also feeds in the messaging, sales scripts, copy, etc. The second thing is we're going to talk about what are the problems. What are all the things that are getting in the way of her getting her dream of accomplishing what she wants to accomplish? And we want to be as again as specific as possible here.
(19:43) Now, typically there's really one big dream, right? But there's many problems that get in the way of that dream, right? It's very simple to just say, "Oh, I just want a six-pack." That's a dream, right? But what are all the things that are preventing you from uh getting your six-pack? It's probably like you don't know how to cook food. You don't know how to grocery shop. You don't know how to weigh yourself.
(19:58) You don't know how to count calories. You don't know how to lift weights. You don't have time to go to the gym. You don't have you have to make different food for you as you do for your spouse. Like there's almost unlimited problems that can that can manifest.
(20:10) And all you have to do is ask somebody who's give just give listen to their excuses. Those that's what the problems are going to be. All right. Now once you have the problems what I want you to do and this is a mental exercise is you list them as solutions. So you take so after you have all the problems you're then going to list them as solutions. So the solution is going to have two parts to it.
(20:28) One is you want to have some sort of name around it that's like okay you don't know how to cook food. So we have our you don't have to cook food system. All right. Now underneath of that we're going to have every possible way that we can think of and this is probably the most creative fun part right.
(20:42) going to list every possible creative way that you could solve it. And I'm saying like you can't think about cost. You you you have to be purely brainstorm. And so by the way, fun rule for brainstorming is that you never say no. You just add to things. You say that's amazing. And so it's not it's a lot of and thinking, not or thinking. There's a lot of good ideas are on the third or fourth iteration.
(20:59) All right? And so for example, with this meal thing, I could myself drive to their house and I could cook their food for them. I could do that, right? Like let's write it down. What else could we do? We could hire a chef to do that. Okay, cool. What else could we do? Maybe we hire chef for lots of people. Okay, that's kind of interesting. Oh, what else could we do? We could do a grocery store where we actually take them shopping.
(21:16) Okay, well, could we do a recorded version of that? We could do a recorded version of that, too. Right? And so all the things you think about all the different ways you could solve it. When you think about this, you're like, "Wow, there's like 20 ways I could solve this problem, right? Which then leads you to step four, which is I call the trim and stack." And this is probably the most businessoriented part of the five steps.
(21:35) All right? which is you have this big list and you say, "Okay, if we were to rate these on which of these are very high value and which of these are low cost, we want the ones that are super high value, super low cost to be our first priority.
(21:54) Now, the second bucket, and this is something that I've probably changed that's that might be a little different than uh what I have in the books. This is a little bit of an update is I am more okay with what about some things that are incredibly high value that have some cost because a lot of people immediately go to zero cost solutions because they want to just have something that cost nothing.
(22:13) The thing is is it's very crowded in the zerocost solution market but you know what's not that crowded the little bit of cost solution or the medium cost solution but very high value. And so the thing is is that this process is an unconstrained ideiation process. And the reason for that is we have yet to determine our price. And so you might be like, well, I can't drive out to their house. Could you for a million dollars? Probably.
(22:33) Well, then it's not off the board yet, right? So we just want to think what is the most valuable combination of these things. Then we go to step five and we say this is now our valuable thing, our valuable grand slam offer. for whatever amount of money that you want to charge that makes sense relative to your trim and stack. And this process, I'm telling you, if you're like, "Man, my customers aren't in love with my product yet." Then build this out.
(23:01) And here's the thing. In the next 60 seconds, I'm going to show you the system that's responsible for the vast majority of my material success. And inside this, I'm doing this at the live launch event. I'm going to show you how to get customers to spend more money with you in less time over and over again. But that's not all.
(23:19) On top of that, there's going to be four amazing bonuses that are available to anyone who wants to pre-order before the event. And on top of that, I've got one secret project that I've been working on for over two years that I'm going to be releasing live at the event itself. Now, I can't tell you what it is yet, but I can tell you that it's better than an NFT, and it's less than a Bitcoin, and every single person who shows up live gets one. But you got to be there August 16th. So, click register, and I'll see you there live.
(23:45) It's much easier and this is unfortunate but it's it's much easier to promise these things than it is to deliver them. And so the reason that I emphasize the nailed and scaled is that if you do have multiple components to your service, your product that you want to deliver and have this be incredibly valuable thing, this is very compelling when you present it to somebody, which is why you can raise your prices, you can make more profit, you can market better, can sell better when you follow this framework. But if you can't deliver, you don't want
(24:09) to scale it yet. you want to keep working on it. And the reality is that it's going to take a lot longer than you think. Like I it's like this has just been a very hard lesson learned for me is that what you think should take you six weeks, often times six takes six months, sometimes a year.
(24:27) And so what what you realize the longer you do business is that there are just far fewer things, fewer new things that you can take on than you really think. And so there's always going to be an issue with translating these things to your team so that they can actually execute. and forget about new people coming in who haven't even gone through this process.
(24:43) They're just adopting this final solution, but they don't know how you got here and how you derived it. And so being more patient about the idea and I'll I'll give you I'll give you a pro tip. This is a little side quest for you. So in any given function, let's say that this is your baseline of performance. All right.
(25:01) Now, whenever you change anything, in my experience, you get about a 20% decrease in performance immediately. All right? So if you change a sales script, you get a decrease in performance. You change your your ad copy, you're going to decrease in performance often time. change your landing page, most times the page that you had probably was working.
(25:12) And so something that's not that has a lower likelihood of succeeding than something that is more of that, right? And so a lot of times when you make a change, and this is especially operational changes more so than anything else, often times you get a decrease or decrement in performance. And so if I know that I'm guaranteed to have this 20% decrease, then it means that I need to make changes that I have a very strong idea that they're going to have at least a 20% increase effect.
(25:35) And so the result of this line of thinking which has made me a significantly better entrepreneur this is a huge breakthrough for me is that number one some things will never get fixed and that means that some things are like man this could be 5% better the cost of the change if you are constantly changing things because here's the thing is you're like well it's still I would I'd be willing to give the 20 to four months from now have that you know return to baseline and then get the 5% improvement. Yeah, but that assumes that you're going to change nothing else in that f fourmonth period,
(26:00) but you might be an add entrepreneur and you might just change it, which means that you're actually permanently kind of sitting at this 20% decrease in performance because you've never given anyone a chance to get good at their job. You're always changing [ __ ] And so I traditionally will overindex now on stability because we get consistent improvements in performance across the team because people just get better at their job, right? And then if I really think that something's worth changing, it better be north of 20%. And so it's like, man, I keep doing the math, like I
(26:31) think this is like a 30 to 50% boost for us. If that's the case, then it's probably worth the bet. But most of the small changes that I used to mess around with my company where I like, oh no, I'm Steve Jobs. Every detail has to be there. Like if you're building a physical product that is manufactured, that's different.
(26:50) If you're building software one times change different in a service business if you're changing process that people have to execute very tough make sure that it's worth it and to bring this whole offer stack idea back to being an underdog. If you do this when you have zillions of customers way harder than if you just have a handful because you can change the back like you can be more nimble and so the smaller your team is the more agile they'll be the less this decrement in performance will be as a result. If it's just you, I mean, you don't need to communicate as anyone. You could just change, right? And so, like, again,
(27:20) think about that as that natural extreme. On one side, it's just you. So, there's basically no change in or decrease in performance. Now, you have to learn stuff, but you'll learn it quickly, right? But if you have to translate it to a 50 person team, it's like you better be darn sure that it's good and worth it. And so, this is another advantage that you have of being smaller.
(27:37) So, nail it first so that you're not going to have to change this later because it's going to be costly. And so the third big reason that there's a huge advantage of being an underdog is that your competition changes over time. Let me kind of break this down for you. So in the beginning, the big competition, you can maybe make the argument this one's always there, right? Uh is you.
(27:55) You are the competitor, right? Like you have to get yourself off the couch. Like the person you're competing against this like lazy version of you, version of you that you think you need to be better than, right? Now, let's say that you're like, you know what? I finally believe that I could do this. Okay.
(28:08) Well, who who's the next big person that you're going to have to have to face? It's going to be your family and your friends. Because now some of you guys have amazingly supportive friends and family. And I am so grateful for you. But for everybody else, uh, a lot of those people aren't going to believe you. They're not going to believe in you. They're not going to believe you. They're not going to believe in your idea.
(28:27) Um, and they'll say sometimes tonight remarks. Sometimes they'll scoff at the trade-offs that you're willing to make, right? Like you're like, "Well, I can't go to that event because I need to keep working on this and then all of a sudden now you're costing them, right? Because the thing is is that fundamentally they have this relationship with you and it's based on these expectations and you're saying, you know what, I'm changing the expectations of our relationship. And most people don't like when things change. And the reality is that like like I'd say that in the earliest part
(28:50) of my career, this was by far the biggest part that was painful is the friends that you that you move on from um because you say, "Hey, this is the terms of our new, you know, new relationship, if you want to call it that way." And they be like, "Well, I don't agree to those terms." And you're like, "Well, then I guess you can't really be here anymore.
(29:07) " It's kind of tough because the thing is is like I've seen a lot of entrepreneurs like they will just say you know what I would rather have these friends than my dream and if that's you amazing you won. You made a decision. But I would just advise you to say like is it really worth it? And I would say that a lot of people that I've had in my life um have come and gone and I've been very grateful for the work that I've been willing to do.
(29:26) That's a you know Alex one thing uh you can do whatever you want and I don't know anything. I have three. I do have three cameras, though. So, you know, just saying. All right. So, what's the next competitor? So, now the next one is going to be employees. Now, it's not necessarily that you're going to be employees. So, think of these more as like bosses you have to face that you have to get over.
(29:45) And these never go away. So, it's like they add on top of each other. You're still going to have to conquer yourself at every level. You're still going to have new pressures from friends and family at every level. Now, here now, you got to sell employees on your dream.
(29:57) You have to recruit really smart people because if you want to do something good, you're going to you're going to need help. All right? Like uh there's an old African proverb that I love which is if you want to go fast go alone. If you want to go far go together. Um and I think big things are accomplished with teams because fundamentally like anything that's really big and worth doing takes a tremendous amount of expertise and it takes time to to learn all these different skills. And so like you can't live 20 lifetimes.
(30:15) And so like no matter how smart you are, it's it's you have a lot more leverage finding people who are exceptional at these things and just bringing them in. So like oh I'm going to leverage this 20 years that they already spent there. I don't have to spend those 20 years. I have all that experience and skill set. I'll just bring them on in.
(30:27) Right now, the next level that ends up coming up and this is the bigger businesses will will hear me in the room. Uh you're going to have market place changes because now you're big enough um where like markets do move you right when you're really really small like basically like it doesn't matter how small the industry is.
(30:47) If you're trying to make $100,000 a year, you can do it because the industry is probably if it is an actual industry is going to be significantly larger than $100,000, right? In terms of revenue. And so it's almost an inconsequential amount of money. Not saying to you as a person, but to to like in general for a marketplace, it's not a lot of money. And so, uh, as you get bigger, like if a market shrinks by 20% and you're a huge part of that market, like that will affect you, right? And also to the same degree, as you make more money, uh, regulators begin to target you and try and find things that you are not being compliant for. Like Elon talks about
(31:12) this. Now, this is not a political comment. I'm just saying like if you look at Amazon, look at Fortnite, look at Reebok, uh just in the last year, all of them been hit with uh FTC suits around something that's not compliant. And so I will just say one thing on this then I'll move on which is fundamentally when 100% of businesses are not obeying some law then there's probably a deeper question which is is the law just and who are the ones who are making these laws and are these people people who are qualified to make them based on their business experience? And so I want to be
(31:43) clear, I think there's always uh there's important, you know, it's important to have rules of the game in order to play any game. Um but I do also subscribe to Elon's perspective of like if there are too many referees on the field, you can't play the game at all. And so but these are these are facts of life.
(32:02) And so to loop this to what I was talking about at the beginning, which is the advantage they have as an underdog is you don't need to worry about all these other things yet. And these things are coming, but you don't have to worry about it yet because like you're not big enough for a regulator to give a [ __ ] about you honestly, right? like your friends and family like maybe you're just getting started.
(32:15) And so these are things that are coming. The competitors will change in their sophistication and in the pressure that you're exposed to and you just got to stand tall and deal with it. But as an underdog, you're like not my problem right now. I just got to focus what's in front of me. And so that's the advantage that you have.
(32:33) And part of the difficulty with the friends and family and sometimes customers is well, I'll just tell you a story that I think will illustrate it. So, I wrote this narrative when I was a gym owner when I was probably 23 24 years old. Now, I I like writing. I was a I got a a creative writing scholarship back in the day. I ended up not taking it. Um but uh I like writing.
(32:55) I was head of the the creative literary magazine in in high school and something I enjoyed. So, I wrote this this article basically or essay called um everyone believes in the American dream until it comes true. I was struggling with this difficulty of my reality which was that you know when I started out in the gym which was my first business uh I didn't have enough money for two rents and so I had saved up all my money for two years to start the gym and I didn't have enough money for rent so I just slept at the gym which I was fine with and you know customers basically could figure out because they could see my pillow in the corner like they kind of got what was
(33:25) going on and they were like good for you for you know pursuing your dream like that's awesome like keep at it and then like the gym started to grow right it started you know started to fill up. We started I started to be able to hire employees and you know probably nine months later or a year later you know I'd come in and at this point I have a manager for location and it kind of runs not without me but like I owned it more than me running you know working inside of it and I'd show up and then like you
(33:49) know the clients would be like ah boss man's here you know and I remember being like wait I like you guys said that you were rooting for me to pursue my dream and now that I've accomplished my dream you guys make snide remarks at me And it was, you know, I I've said this before, but it was the first time that I realized that people want you to do well, just not better than them.
(34:14) As you continue to achieve, you will see that in the vast majority of people. Now, I believe that special friends exist who truly want you to win. And if you have those people, like, hold them close because most people aren't like that. Uh most people will be happy either overtly or more likely subconsciously or you know under the under the you know under the surface when you lose they're happy because it makes them feel better about the things they didn't take on the risk they didn't take and so it's tough business isn't for the faint of heart
(34:45) but at the same time neither is life and so I think like everything everything is hard and I think that the only real flaw in the system is that we have a belief that it shouldn't be and that if we somehow change our conditions, it will get easier. And it basically just never does.
(35:05) And I think that's been something that's like helped me kind of get through my like woe is me wallowing moments that I have, which is like if I had a job that I wasn't satisfied with, I would be unhappy. If I have if I have, you know, stressors of day-to-day business that occur like that also can make me unhappy. Now, of course, we make the argument nothing makes you happy or unhappy.
(35:29) Um, but I am human probably like you and I have things that definitely have I have better days and worse days. And I think that more or less across all of these situations, I have rem more or less stayed the same, right? Like I think there are things that uh money buys you that make life more convenient. And it's definitely one of those things that uh you never believe people until you have it.
(35:48) So, I'm not going to try and dissuade you from doing it. My whole channel is about helping you grow your business. Um, but I think that it helped me get over a lot of stress in thinking that this should not be this way. Like just like what what demand of the universe am I making that isn't true? Business should be easy. It should feel better.
(36:07) Uh, it shouldn't be this stressful. Like it shouldn't have this many people problems. And also comparing it to the alternative which also has problems. And so I think a lot of times we get in this really negative spiral as business owners, which is we compare ourselves. We look at the we look at the grass on the other side of the field, but we don't know that it's lined with manure, right? That's what makes it grow.
(36:27) And I think I I try to remind myself of that. Like whenever there's a green pasture, it's like it's built on. And so that helps me just say like, okay, I just don't know what the is on the other side, but it's there. And that kind of gets me, you know, kind of back in the saddle and focused.
(36:44) And so I will I will wrap with this which is that if you were an underdog, you have advantages. Every position has an advantage. You have to nail it and then you scale it. And be grateful that the competitor that you're competing against right now is smaller because they only get bigger and stronger as you get bigger and stronger.
(37:01) So if you're a business owner, I uh just started doing these real business breakdowns of business owners that actually have come to our headquarters. um and uh from the audience, some of you guys, uh and I'll spend an hour or two with them and basically break down what they need to do to scale their business at a super tactical level. I think it's some of the best stuff that we're putting out.
(37:18) I'm super proud of it, very excited about. Go check the video out, watch it, enjoy it, and uh let me

Transcript:
(00:00) these people all got rich in the influencer revolution and in this video I'm going to break down exactly how they did it how I built my personal brand and how you can too and yes that's you my close friend Taylor Swift has built one of the top 20 net worths of self-made women and has one of the single strongest personal Brands as a woman in existence today and here are five things that I learned from what she's done in building her brand that I use for me the first thing that I learned from her longevity do you know how old she was when she made her first
(00:31) song 16 it was in 2006 Tim McGraw was the first song that she released these people have actually a very long time under their belts of how many years they put in to their personal brand 14 years ago news Force Harry buer met an aspiring country music singer from Hendersonville high school and so a lot of times we're measuring a two-year career against a 20-year career and everything compounds with time she gained more popularity in the last 12 months than she probably did in the first 19 years which sounds crazy but at the same time is also true and so that's what Taylor did for longevity but what
(01:07) did I do my first podcast was in July of 2017 six plus years that I've been making content now to be fair hers was at a larger scale and as I actually increased my scale so too did my branding awareness and reach follow you got to do the same thing in a lot of quantity for a very long time before it really starts to get going don't compare your first year to someone's 10th year the longer you do something the better you get at it also the longer you do something the more you have done because if I post once a week for a year versus once a week for 10 years it's talking about 520 videos versus 52 videos so I'm
(01:44) going to have all of the compounding of all those other videos that going to be bringing people to my world that whole time plus 520 reps of being good at that thing and just to give you some numbers around this my first year of posting videos on YouTube I gained a total of 88,000 sub subscribers the second year I gained over 600,000 subscribers and so far this year I've done over 1.
(02:10) 1 million subscribers and so the more you do the better you get and to give you another extreme example because I mentioned my podcast earlier my first two years of podcasting I got to a total of 2,000 downloads a month and just fast forward to now 6 years in I get about 2 million downloads a month so these things can compound they just take time the second thing that I learned is SC in the unscalable so she has famously been known for appearing randomly at some of her fans weddings to play songs for them everyone loses their mind all the iPhones come out and then she goes viral on the
(02:48) internet for a few days a newly wet couple got a surprise Wedding Crasher that they wouldn't dare to turn away I am not a worldclass performer and I'm probably not going to be able to perform at someone's wedding but how can I take what Taylor did in scaling the unscalable in that micro example and apply to what I do every so often I'll do a sporadic Q&A live with people in our audience in mosy nation what do I do for a living I invest in advised businesses so what's a micro version of that I can invest invise somebody who would never really have access to me in
(03:18) any other capacity and so I can still take that and then multiply to thousands of other people because it scale something that otherwise is unscalable I couldn't talk one-onone to every single person in my audience it' be impossible she can't show up at every person's wedding but she can still simulate the experience and to the same degree for me the reason I put out all this free content and I put out all my books and my Audi books and the courses and they're all free and I do that because that's something that allows me to take a lot of energy put it into one thing and then distribute it to everyone the third thing that I love from Taylor
(03:49) vulnerability even in her songs themselves she showcases her heart and her looking like the fool or the crazy person more times than not and so it Happ happens is she becomes still despite being the superstar that she is relatable at the lowest level to the girl that's still singing in her hairbrush into the mirror because they experience the same feelings Taylor does the many flaws and pitfalls and heartbreaks that she's had over her entire career and just showing them to the public rather than trying to hide them Taylor then instead of having something that everyone can attack flips
(04:25) it into a power because if you attack her for that you attack her entire fan base for experiencing the same thing and so she builds an army of people that will defend her because they resonate with the experience that she shared Taylor Swift fans may have taken her hit song Shake It Off too literally yeah it actually caused the equivalent of a 2.
(04:44) 3 magnitude earthquake and it lasted several hours that's a new record okay Alex how are you vulnerable all the stories I tell the vast majority of them are me up and losing all my money twice she talks about relationships and love a lot and so her equivalent of bankruptcy and losing everything is is getting her heartbroken and so for me I talk about the first time I whiffed on a sale the first time I trusted a partner didn't work the first time I had all my money stolen the second time I had my money stolen the multiple businesses that I had to shut down when I had nine businesses and had
(05:14) to shut eight of them down so that I could go all in on one these are all stories that aren't like the fun cover of Forbes instead they're just like hey I also was a small business owner and made a lot of mistakes that you might too and so for another small business owner who hears that they might be like I've been there too and then it takes something that seems crazy and unattainable like a multi million doll portfolio and makes it relatable thing number four from Tay Tay I'm just going to put ownership so one of the things that Taylor has done differently than many musicians is that she's a shrewd
(05:44) businesswoman it's also why she's top 20 on Forbes for wealthiest women in general which she doesn't talk about as much but girl knows how to make money her last a Tour gross over a billion dollars on one tour so what she's done is she independently publishes her stuff and this has been something I think she's worked towards because in the beginning she sold our music and she had to buy it back lots of drama but she has moved towards this action and because now she has more money and she has more leverage because she has such a big audience she can negotiate different deals that other people wouldn't be able
(06:14) to and it's like okay Alex well how do I do something like that or how did you do something like that right off the bat I could have gone to a regular publisher to publish all my books like that would have been pretty much the normal path for the business influencer who wants to get the New York Times best seller whatever and so for me I give away chapter left and right I make it free on my podcast no Publishers like wait I want to buy the rights to your book so that you can only give it away for free but I want to do that and so in order to
(06:38) maintain control I maintained ownership over my stuff because even in the short term I could have taken a few million dollar check from a publisher just up front to write the book but I'd so much rather own it for the rest of my life and be able to give it away as I see fit because I know at least for me conditions change and me trying to make a decision today for something that I'm going to have to live with for the rest of my life feels steep even though it probably hurts more in the short term which is why so many musicians and creators do sign away all their rights
(07:09) too early because the people who have been there before have seen a hundred other creators go through it and they know it's going to happen but if you can have the stomach to be patient and actually believe that you're going to go all the way then it never makes sense to sell and so the last one that I learned from Taylor was shifting identity now a different way of saying this is that her brand has shifted over time yet she's gone from a country music player to the girl who chases boys and gets her
(07:33) heartbroken to then just becoming this powerful woman today and so she's shed her identity multiple times and transformed her brand multiple times into what it is today and I would say that the Aeros tour for example is a great exemplify of her leaning into this idea that she has set eras in her life today I didn't wear a nose strip what does that mean it just means I didn't wear a nose STP today and that's okay I don't actually have my hat on today either why am I doing that does it mean that I'm making some big statement about it no I just want to be me and if I ever
(08:05) feel like I have to dress the part to be on camera I don't want any part of it play it out if I then become beloved for something that I'm forcing myself into then what I'm doing is I'm portraying something that's other than myself for people to fall in love with as I change and grow I will grow further and further away from the thing that people love which means that I will have to feel more and more like a fraud I will have to fake it and pretend more and more as more people fall in love with this Idol that I've created that's not even real
(08:36) and so for me if I decide to change my shoes one day I'm going to change my shoes I'm not going to say well my whole audience expects me to wear Crocs I don't wear Crocs by the way anymore I think this is one of the beautiful things that creators have and that us as individuals have it's embracing who you are which I think she's done unbelievably well and staying true to that North Star rather than what critics want her to be and she's even changed that way in her music and she's like you know what I'm just going to be me that's what her audience is in love with her
(09:06) being her because she gives them permission to be themselves and if you're curious you belong with me is my favorite talor Swift song This Is The Rock This is a life-size cutout of him yes I am huge but not as huge as the Rocks net worth which just cross multiple billions of dollars based on his stake in teram Tequila here are four things I learned from from The Rock first thing right off the bat is the same thing that I got from Tay which is longevity do you know how long the rock has been the rock I
(09:37) mean we even call him the rock but he's Dwayne Johnson and some people don't even know that he got his career started as a WWE wrestler he started his career in 1996 some of you guys watching this weren't even a glimmer in your father's eye in 1996 so Point number one is longevity Point number two is work ethic one of the things that Dwayne Johnson has made himself famous for for is how early he shows up to sets how late he will stay and how he never misses a workout no matter what he's he flies into China it's 4 in the morning he's lifting weights like what the when he started his career he started at the bottom of the totem hole in WWE the guy
(10:14) that everyone beat up and he had to show up and work twice as hard the same story as Kobe Bryant of like if they work out once if I work out three times I'll just get better faster he wasn't born this way and even 5 years into that career he wasn't Dwayne Johnson The multi-billionaire icon he wasn't even still can you smell what The Rock is cooking yet [Applause] like but the Rock is cooking he hadn't really even reached the the peak or the Zenith of his startom it took a long time for him to get there and he was able to stomach it because of his work
(10:49) ethic and so how do I apply this to me I have always taken the position that I work from the moment I wake up until the moment I literally can't work anymore especially on the come up and so work from 4:00 a.m. until 10: and then from 10:00 a.m.
(11:07) on I would do my actual work with other people and so I couldn't get the work I wanted to get done done during the day cuz I had to run the business and so I would do it before everyone else was up you have to work double time you got to work the job that you have today but in the mornings or the late evenings you build for the job you want to have tomorrow when I say job I have a job too today even though I own the businesses that we're a part of I still have a job to do and so that job is doing what you have to do today and building for what you want to have tomorrow even my current season I spend 6 hours a day every day writing so that I can publish books on a regular Cadence
(11:36) and so my last book $ million leads I spent 6 hours a day for almost two years writing that book and same thing for offers and now with XYZ secret book that's coming out I'm doing the same thing the first thing every day before I came in today here to film this with you I edited my book for the first four hours of the day so the third thing I learned from the rock is expanding niches he became one of the most if not the most famous WD wrestler of all time now he could have stopped there but he had bigger aspirations and so over his career he has continued to widen and bro
(12:07) in what he's Associated himself with right in the very very beginning he was a football player then he spun that into the wrestling career and then he took that to the Natural maximum and then from there he started making movies but what did he start with he started with roles that required him to be in really good shape and show off that he was in it if you remember his first two movies the money returns and the later Scorpion King where he was actually a main character in that one he was there pretty much to show off his physique no
(12:31) one else in Hollywood is doing that not Tom Cruz not Will Smith now he's in Disney movies so he's gone from being a really high level football player to being bottom of the totem WWE to top of WWE to low low in the movie scene to high in the movie scene as an action career to the broadest base that you can have because when you get into Disney movies at that point you're catering to everyone following the strategy has made him among and if not the highest paid actor today and so for me you're like okay well how did you expand your Niche well I started as just a dude who was in
(13:05) shape and then people started com in and be like hey can you help me get in shape and I was like sure I guess and then somebody literally handed me money without me asking and I was like oh wow I guess I could make money doing this so then I got into the business of helping getting people in shape and then I was like maybe I could open a gym so then I opened a gym and then I started doing well with the gym and then people who own gyms were like hey can you help me run my gym and I was like I guess so I don't know if this is business and then
(13:27) again literally someone handed me ,000 and said launch my gym and I said I guess so and then I took that to 5,000 locations and then from there it was like hey how did you expand this BWB licensing thing so you went National businesses of that size started to approach me and that has literally been my entire career do something really well people ask me about it and then I say okay well I'll show you how I did that and each of these transitions has actually been forced every single time someone literally handed me money and said can you do it and I was like I guess so and then that's how it started so on the topic of money the fourth
(13:57) thing I've learned from The Rock monetization so The Rock has spent the first 20 plus years of his career not really monetizing his direct brand now he was in movies he obviously gets paid to do that he was paid to be in the WWE but he didn't really own anything that he was able to really push and then all of a sudden in the last three or four years he came out with zoa which is the energy drink and supplement line he came out with project rock with Under Armour which was a collaboration between him and them and he came out with teramana the tequila and his slice of teramana I
(14:27) believe is 30% stake in the company which is now valued over $6 billion he's been very strategic about the highest leverage ways that he can monetize his brand without deluding who he is we've all seen those actresses who come out with an alcohol line now and they don't even drink or they come out with makeup and they actually are known for their natural look things that just obviously don't make sense now what do people fall in love with a rock for they love the fact that he works super hard but he also has cheat days on Sunday he also sips his tequila and was doing that for
(14:57) a very regular basis and people knew he loved tequila and so it made sense for him because it wasn't a change it was just reinforcing more of what he already was and so if you think about how you want to monetize you want it to be more of what you already are and this is where people miss the mark they're like what's the thing that I can sell to the most people or what's the thing that's got the highest ticket it has to reinforce the association that people have come to love about you and so in studying The Rock and setting some of these other influencers what I'm paying
(15:26) a lot of attention to is how they're choosing to monetize Tastefully how do I monetize Tastefully well I own companies and so when companies consume my stuff and learn and grow and make more money then they hit me up and say hey Alex can you help me grow and scale my company and invest and I say sure if they're awesome and if they're not I just say just enjoy all the other stuff I don't need 25 Facebooks I just need one and so I'm okay with the fact that 99.9% of people will only quote take for me and not give anything back and I'm cool with
(15:58) that it's the same reason it would be weird if I came out with a luxury watch line or a suit line of three-piece suits that would be completely off brand now do a lot of my people in my audience probably wear suits and do business yes would that be a high ticket item I could probably make a lot of money on yes does it make sense for my brand no and so that's the idea is that we have these associations that people have come to love you for and then to go counter that just to make money everyone sees it and then they lose trust with you you can file bankruptcy when you go way too far
(16:30) into debt and then you can start over but you can't file bankruptcy on a reputation once it's ruined it's ruined for life and it takes a very long time to build one and a very short time to lose one and so if you ever have the choice between reputation and money always choose reputation because this one you can't get back you can always make more money all right the rock now we're going to Mr Beast so first things first that I learned from uh Mr Beast was his longevity and you're going to hear me keep repeating this and the reason I say it is because everyone keeps comparing themselves to someone's 10th year
(17:05) starting was what 13 what's up guys OV excited generic YouTuber here he's 11 years in of doing this at an obsessive rate I feel like there's there's two stages in most people's career there's the time they start and the time they get serious he happened to do both on the same time and so if you can decrease the time between when you start and when you commit you'll start seeing the benefits of commitment sooner like I see so many people who got into fitness and they say I've been training for 5 years and I say have you been training for 5 years or do you have you been
(17:33) going to the gym on and off for 5 years and they're like well I've been training for 6 months I've been going on and off for four and a half years and I'm like well then the first four and a half years was literally just to prepare you for the first 6 months of taking this seriously you're only 6 months into your working out career not 5 years and so they then compare themselves to somebody 5 years to be like why am I not there it's like you're really only 6 months in Go Pro be a professional and take it like your job number two and this is a
(17:56) big one this is super tactical so I was having a conversation with Mr Beast and I was like we're not trying to make you know clickbait videos we going to make stuff that people feel is you know really high quality Etc and he looked at me and he just looked at like I had four heads and he was like you absolutely make clickbait videos he's like you just need to make the clickbait true and it was such a great mindset shift for me because when I think about marketing I think about the same way if you want to Market a product make the crazy claim but back up the crazy claim
(18:24) and some of you guys have been commenting that we've kind of upped our game on our videos and a lot of it comes from this Frame of Mind of like how can you make an insane claim and back it up with an even more insane video number three is doubling down the day he started was the day he went pro he said he was either going to become a pro YouTuber or he wasn't going to do anything at all and he has shown that with his actions as he makes more money he puts all of it back into the next videos and he has consistently done that
(18:48) since day one and if anything his current Channel still runs as a quote nonprofit in that it's not profitable because he actually chooses to monetize elsewhere through febles and Beast burger and some of his other Ventures he has continued to reinvest in his compounding vehicle and you'll notice compounding is a common theme among all these people that we're talking about is that he took the extra rather than putting his pocket he said what if I put it back on black again and it is very much a gamble but if you know what you're doing you become the house so for me personally I have been willing to
(19:20) double down on my career and make big bets that otherwise didn't make sense my first career as a consultant most people said oh you should go do more of that but I took all my learnings from being a consultant and then started a gym which was a a big bet for me but I was doubling down on what I beli to be true then I scaled my gyms to six locations and then I just basically walked away from them I fire sold them in 90 days and then started the licensing business and from there doubled down there until now we now have acquisition. comom our portfolio of companies even when I was
(19:50) thinking about selling gym launch so many people are like dude you have this amazing business that you don't have to do anything for that prints you out millions of dollars a month in personal income what is wrong with you why would you sell because the thing is is that they will project their goals onto your reality and as long as your reality is above their goals they will not understand you and so if you have big goals then you only have to listen to you because whatever yours is if you satisfied their check mark it's like I satisfied you not me and so being willing to double down and burn the boats and pursue the dream that you
(20:21) actually want is risky but in my opinion when I die and I look back well when I die I won't be able to look back but right before I die and I look back I will be so much more proud of the failures that I risked than the successes that I didn't and the fourth thing that I learned from Mr Beast was packaging specifically around media I watched Sam take apart someone else's video and in the first 5 seconds he said stop the video and this is somebody who had already had 10 million views on the video and was upset that
(20:47) they didn't have 30 million views and he said oh you didn't match the thumbnail to the first 5 Seconds you didn't confirm it he was like well that's it he's like I don't need to watch any more of the video that's why it's not a 30 million view video and it was such a tiny tactical detail but it made such a massive difference in the amount of views I now appreciate how important how you package the content you have so for example some of you guys have noticed that we run split tests on the thumbnails and the reason for that is that there's two things we look at one
(21:12) is how many people click but then how long people who click based on that watch and you'd be amazed that there's sometimes 20 30% increases in the amount of time that someone will watch simply based on how the video was framed and so for us we want to make real business education accessible for everyone and making it accessible for everyone means that we have to package it in a way that makes it attractive to everyone and fulfills the promises that we made in the packaging I made a video a long time
(21:37) ago about luxury goods now the whole video is just about understanding how luxury goods fits within a pricing Matrix in a marketpl sounds kind of boring but I was like huh how can I package this in a way that would make it more accessible for more people and recently Bernard or know who owns lvmh Which is a holding company that owns many many luxury brands that you've heard of flash them on the screen he had just recently become the richest man and so I was like oh this is relevant how did he become the richest man through
(22:06) luxury goods and just doing that dramatically improved how many people would benefit from the video because it became timely it became trending and he was around someone who already demonstrated that he was a viable business model and the last one I want to hit on from Jim is resourcefulness now a lot of people see him today as the person who spends a million dollars on every video and he's giving all this money away and they're like I could never copy Jimmy and you're right you can't today but what you can copy is the
(22:30) things that he did to get here and so his first ever viral video was him counting up as high as he could and I think he got to 100,000 plus now how much did that cost nothing just imagination and as soon as he made $110,000 from that video he gave it to a homeless guy this is not clickbait I'm going to give a random homeless guy $10,000 today and then that video went viral he's consistently just said how can I use what I have which if you follow any of my content the first rule of entrepreneur ship is use what you've got and he has exemplified that in his
(23:02) content and so how do you relate this to me well when I started I didn't have the big media team that I have today it was just me and a webcam and then from there we're like okay let's get one with just like some lights in a professional camera and then it was like okay I'm actually going to have a videographer here present with me when I do these videos and then it was like you know what we might actually edit the videos rather than just trimming out the front and the end and the ums it didn't make
(23:24) sense for me at the beginning to have a massive media team because I didn't know what I was doing and so as we've gotten better we've gotten better and we've used the resources we have to continue to grow the team so we can make more stuff for you guys I would recommend not beating yourself up for the fact that you don't have resources but learning the skill of resourcefulness which you will need throughout the entirety of your career because at every level you have to always be resourceful and if you don't learn how to be resourceful when you have nothing you're not going to be
(23:50) resourceful when you have everything thanks Jim appreciate that and the chocolate bars check out febles by the way right off the bat what did I learn from Joe longevity you're like wow Alex why do you keep saying that because it  matters all right I keep repeating it because not one of these people is an overnight success all these are decade plus successes and most of them are multi- deade successes Joe started doing stand-up comedy in Boston in 1988 and for many of my audience you also weren't alive then on top of that he got his first real break when he started doing Fear Factor which is a
(24:26) show where he's basically mcing girls getting rats thrown into a tub with them where they have to keep their mouth open Joe's had the humility throughout his entire career to be willing to do whatever it took and I don't think when he was a little kid was like I want to be a star he was like I'm going to go MC girls in bikinis uh having bees all around them dripping with honey I don't think he thought that but he was willing to take the opportunities to presented itself and he's been willing to stick
(24:52) with it for a very very long time second thing I've learned from Joe you know what I think this is important enough that I'm I'm going to put it on here because he has restarted his career at zero multiple times like he was a standup comedian but then he's doing mcing for a TV show he probably wasn't as good as he is now when he does it for the UFC one of the biggest sports in the world he was willing to be humble and do it and suck and that's why so many losers lose is because they're not willing to lose they cannot accept sucking and so they always lose by
(25:22) default because they never start yeah until you win no one pays attention to you get used to it and the reason people look like overnight successes is because you just happen to find out about them when they hit it and so you just Mark the fact that when you find out about them is when they started doing it which is ridiculous but it's a cognitive bias just because you experience the world that way doesn't mean it's true so for me I have basically restarted my career multiple times probably the biggest slice of humble pie that I've had to eat was going from being a white collar consultant on my way to Harvard to being
(25:53) a personal trainer at a local gym so not even an owner or a manager a Frontline trainer getting paid minimum wage and so when you go from a sixf fig job to a minimum wage job your status changes a lot and that was tough for me but I knew how miserable I was doing the thing that I didn't like and I believed that this wasn't what I was going to be doing for the rest of my life and I knew that for me this was a season of learning not earning and so I never thought I was going to be stuck at minimum wage I just knew that I felt like I was just getting
(26:25) paid to learn so I was like I would pay to be here so the fact that they're paying me is just a great deal for me because the thing is is you compare yourself today at Day Zero whereas what I left I was probably at year six in terms of like all the things I did to get there I had to prep for SATs to get into Vanderbilt to graduate in three years to have be president and vice president of the The Power Team president of the fraternity and then do all the case study stuff so I could get the consulting job and did that for two years and then prep for the gats like I was six years into that career but I
(26:54) started over at zero because I just wanted something else and all of you guys who are watching this right now you're watching this personal brand being built and all this content that they putting out I just learned this stuff like 2 or 3 years ago right now I started making my podcast six years ago but for three years I didn't do anything else besides my podcast but I didn't really go pro on making content until the end of 2019 2020 I didn't know anything and so I hired people and was like hey can you tell me they're like you suck and I'm like yeah I'm aware of that and I told the first guy that I heard for YouTube I said I'm willing to
(27:25) do this for 10 years and I was like if it doesn't work after 10 years I was like I'll stop and when we obviously took it in house he said on the way out he was like I just want you to know that you changed my entire perspective because I've never had a single person tell me that they were willing to wait a decade for something to work he's like every other person who comes to me is like how do I get 100K subscribers 90 days and it's unsurprising now that we actually probably have a bigger subscriber base than anybody he'd ever worked with because we approached it
(27:51) differently I'm just willing to suck because I believe that if someone else can get good at it so can I number three this is probably probably the most important one you are the niche I want to be really clear there's a difference between having a personal brand and building a brand in a business building a brand in a business is going to be around the products you sell and the Avatar or the audience that you Market to so if you want to build content for a specific business that sells widgets then it should be probably people using that
(28:18) widget within the context they would use it in but you building a personal brand should be true to the person just like you're being true to the product and be Encompass all the things that you really are what is Joe Rogan's Niche is it politics but then he does all this biohacking stuff okay was it Fitness well then he talks about aliens like a lot okay well is it fighting cuz he's really deep into fighting but he's also a big time standup comedian well shoot what is it it's none of them and it's all of them it's Joe Rogan because if I said all of those things together
(28:49) hey what big celebrity do you know who's into biohacking aliens politics technology fighting and comedy you'd be like Joe Rogan because that's his unique thumbprint now all of those are different categories and in different proportions so for example he's got health and he's got comedy well on his show which of them takes up a greater percentage well he probably talks more about biohacking and health and things that are going on in the in the total us around Health compared to Comedy now he still has comedians on his show and talks about comedy stuff but the
(29:19) proportion is different so not only is it the number of categories but it's the proportion between the categories that makes the unique thumbprint of the creator point being if you're building a personal brand speak to things that you know and if you're like well I don't know very much you start with the one you know cuz you've lived your life up to this point and you spent time one way or another which means that there are things that are unique to you that you are deeper on than somebody on the street and one of the hardest parts
(29:44) about this and this is me just being real with you is that if you know it really well you actually assume everyone does if you were raised around cars for example and your dad was a mechanic or you just like love that stuff you probably know a lot more about cars than the average person I don't know anything about cars I'm not really that interested in but there are people who are and so you making content about the things that you actually care about you will be knowledgeable and there's a difference
(30:07) between telling people what they should do and sharing the things that you know it's subtle but one is preaching one is teaching and you want to be the teacher not the preacher I think one of the things that he has given me permission to do is talk about all the things that I am interested in cuz I spoke to many people and they're like dude don't talk about your like death phosy stuff it's like really dark and they're like just just talk about money stuff but if you're going to be talking money stuff you should wear a suit because you want to look that part but I don't I don't dress that way I
(30:36) dress like this but they're you're going to look like a meathead so then which of these things is Alex rosi all of them none of them at the same time your brand will be stronger based on how closely it matches who you really are and the things that you genuinely care about and as those things change so too should your brand to reflect that rather than say oh I had a mustache for 5 years which by the way I did I had a big Gunslinger mustache for 5 years and everything that was public had a gunslinger mustache and then I was like you know what kind of want to do a beard
(31:07) so I put a beard on and so what happened to my brand it changed but that was okay because that's who I was then and this is who I am now and maybe in the future I'll shave one day and you know what I'll still be me and so if you want to measure the strength of a single person in your audience in relation to your brand it's how many interest that you have that a person in your audience shares or overlaps with if I like politics and fighting and comedy and health and Aliens I'm probably going to love Joe Rogan on the flip side if I don't like any of those things but I kind of like Health then I might kind of
(31:44) like Joe Rogan because I don't like the majority of the other stuff he talks about and so taking this into my personal context if someone likes training calvs they like desserts they like being in shape they like business in making money they like philosophy they're probably going to like my stuff and some of the business people are like dude I wish you could just only make business content I was like but that's not me cuz I don't only talk about business but the point is is that like I don't want to shy away from who I am so that I can meet some artificially generated algorithm
(32:15) character that doesn't really exist and I think that in the short term if I did that I probably would win in the short term but in the long term I would resent who that character become because they had been become so far away for who I really am and then I would feel like a fraud and then you would see it in my content because I wouldn't feel legit number four is that Joe only talks about sponsorships he believes in now he obviously is equity in some of the companies that he promotes though he had a big exit with on it uh which is a multi million do supplement brand that
(32:46) he basically pioneered and Alpha Brain the product that he talked about a lot when we came up with alpab brain it was the first one that I ever tried that I was like this is like a very clear difference but he's in a position where he could get oh my God if if FTX wanted him to to promote their products I'm sure they did he could have made a massive check from them for promoting it but he didn't believe in it so he said no and so a lot of what he's defined himself by is all the things that he only truly wants to win so he only
(33:15) promotes stuff that he actually wants to win and he believes in and you can hear it in the endorsements that he gives he's like I use this stuff and so I'm letting you know about it I take uh a a a giant athletic greens every day and doesn't come across salesy he just lets you know why he takes it and so in my opinion the thing that I've learned from Joe is that you want to promote things that are minimal changes in your behavior so ideally you exist exactly the way you were before except you just happen to get paid for something that you would already be willing to tell
(33:45) someone about now that massively limits the amount of things that you can promote but that's okay because you don't want to be these people who just shill 100 things because by doing that you also dilute the brand that you have because everyone knows it's not you because no one's interested in 100 things you might only be interested in 2 3 4 maybe five things and that's probably what you should limit your quote brand bullets to and the fifth one is no hacks all right this is so so big because you can think about Joe is almost the anti- algorithm it just says episode whatever and the name of the guest and he doesn't cut all the stuff
(34:18) so he can make it the most action- pack scene he just lets it cut unedited raw and uploads it his Instagram he says he subscribed to post and ghost which is he posts it and then he ghosts it they're not optimized he just uses the platform as somebody who uses the platform and people choose to follow him because they are interested in what he is interested in so he is interesting because he is interested if you look at every one of these celebrities if you look at their social media it doesn't look like they're influencers but they have more
(34:51) followers than almost all the influencers put together that are what I would consider the hacky and influencers always trying to like algorithm hop or Trend hop you don't see Rogan hopping on the Taylor Swift trend for his Instagram he just is Joe I get approached by so many people who DM me saying hey man I don't think your LinkedIn is optimized hey I don't think your your Instagram is optimized for growth hey I can do a shout out for shout out let's do a giveaway to do 20,000 followers 50,000 followers whatever it is none of those
(35:20) build brand they are simply trying to exploit an artificial hole or inefficiency in how an algorithm works and if you base your brand on algorithm exploitation you're basing it on a flaw in a system that will get fixed and so what you want to do in my opinion is that you want to align what you make with what the platform wants rather than what the platform doesn't want and you hacking around it what the platform wants is for you to make engaging content that an audience finds interesting so they stay on the platform that's it and so the best way to make interesting content is to talk about the
(35:55) things you are interested in if if you post things that are real for you you will be real for your audience rather than just some that surfed on their Newsfeed that they can immediately go to your feed and see that all you do is Trend hop which means that you actually don't exist at all Kylie was actually the last in the armor for me deciding to start making content and the reason for that was she got the cover of Forbes as a quote billionaire at age 20 and I saw that and at the time I thought I was hot  for being a multi-millionaire and
(36:29) when I saw her do that I have a fundamental belief about business that if someone makes more money than me they are better at the game of business in some way than I am and that I can learn from them and the big difference between what Kylie was doing and what I was doing was her brand and she had built that through content the first lesson that I'll say that I have learned from klie was yet again longevity because yes she has a billion dollar brand and she's very young but guess how young she started being on National television she
(36:58) appeared on National Television for the first time 20 years ago on Keeping Up with the Kardashians as a little bitty itty bitty gy girl yeah yeah yeah going she's been in the game two decades and so as much as she is young she still has put time under the bar and if you see a common theme for all these people even the youngest people here have at least a decade and often multiple decades under their belts so staying with it for a long term yet again rules the day number two is that she showed me Leverage now
(37:27) leverage in multiple ways number one is that she is leveraged from her family she hangs out with other people who are famous one of the easiest ways to get more exposure is to hang out with people who already have exposure and she did that early on and has done that throughout her career number one number two is that she uses media she record something one time and millions and millions of people can see it and so by using that she gets more for what she puts in and so that's being able to accelerate her career number three is
(37:52) that based on the actual products that she has chosen to sell with her brand she does does things that scale and so imagine if she was selling a tax service it'd be very difficult for her to scale that to her audience but if she sells a lip kit she can make a gazillion of those the only real constraint on that would be capital and she's got that and so she was able to get a high leverage brand with a huge audience that she built with a long time and media and funnel it into something that has a lot of Leverage that she built one time and then could print over and over and over
(38:23) again to her entire audience just simply the business she chose to select was one that better suited a mass Market B Toc brand a lot of creators make the wrong mistake here I see guys starting a restaurant when they have a national brand not to say that you won't make money it's just that you won't make as much money as you otherwise could in a better vehicle number three is that she outsources her weaknesses so the things that she is in charge of is the product and the marketing so she cares a lot about the lip kits and she cares a lot about the messaging and how things appear and how she disseminates and promotes it but everything else that
(39:00) she's not an expert at she's probably not an expert at third party Logistics she's probably not an expert at actually manufacturing stuff she's probably not an expert at running warehouses she's probably not an expert at even building websites but based on the brand that she has and the success of the company she has we could probably make a leap of faith to say that she's pretty good at product and she's also pretty good promoting and so by doing the things that she's good at she's been willing to give up some of the pie to other people
(39:22) who have that expertise so she can leverage the fact that somebody else has years in third party Logistics partners with them and to be fair this is something you see across the Kardashians they do very well is that they don't try and own the entirety of the pie they say how can we all win here and I'll take this from the late Charlie Munger I don't need every last dollar because he believed that it's either a good deal or it isn't and if it's a great deal I'm going to make a ton of money and if it's not he doesn't need to Chisel away
(39:47) percentage points and I think I've seen that across all of the Kardashians and how they structure their deals they're willing to let other people in to leverage 20 years of experience to not have to start over at Ground Zero they start at year 20 on someone else's career because of all the learnings and connections that person has so that they can just jump that much further forward because I don't know about you but I'd rather own 20% of a 20 billion company than 100% of a million dollar company and number four is that she Embraces controversy they have time and again
(40:17) leaned into what other people deem as controversial and ridden the wave of attention that it brings with it Kylie and her entire family has been willing to do that now that being said I wouldn't say that I've completely embraced this one entirely because I don't really talk about much controversial stuff besides poor people should stop doing poor people stuff they start following what rich people do and do more rich people stuff but besides that not a lot of controversy and so maybe I need to do better there but these are things that I think have helped build and Propel her brand at a
(40:46) faster rate than other people the next one is that she's adaptable but she's been able to adapt as media platforms have changed and so it was television once and then they went from television to Hulu which is online TV they went all in on Instagram really really early and started making content there on a regular basis and their content looks very different from the classic influencers their content feeds into their brand as super famous people and they continue to reinforce that with the luxury Brands they've all done deals
(41:15) with and the products they promote themselves and the next one is that she is accessible and this may be even her superpower and this is partially because she's in the makeup industry she leaned into just being who she was and so she would do Instagram lives and stories where it was just her no makeup despite what the media May portray them as is making false and unrealistic expectations for girls I think that what they actually make in their content is probably the exact opposite of that they show the 16 hours that it took them to get ready for the Met Gala and all of these things that they do where they
(41:45) have to paint the stuff onto them or they have to not be able to go to the bathroom for 3 hours because of the stuff that they're wearing they show that stuff so that they become more accessible so that people who relate to that also want to buy their their products and so you might see all these things and be like how did you use this Alex one I started posting content in general because I saw how much she had made and I was like I am missing this whole concept of brand and started leaning into it number two is that I
(42:09) would say that leverage literally is part of our logo and it's one of the things that I talk about all the time it's something that I believe a lot in Outsourcing weaknesses that's why you hire great people every single time I built one of these channels out I don't try and learn a new platform I find somebody already knows it and I pay them to teach me so that I can learn faster I'm not good at embracing controversy but but in terms of adaptability and accessibility we have continued to go into new platforms as fast as we can and
(42:34) as fast as they come out so that we can experiment and we're willing to have stuff that absolutely flops and I think that's cool because we learn and finally the accessibility piece is even though in the beginning it was a webcam and it was just me in a closet making videos I'd rather start with what I have than try and portray the life that I have cuz I went from being really rich and Anonymous saying you know what maybe I'll make some videos to making lots of stuff and making it look really polished and highly produced but it didn't happen overnight and I think that mosy nation has appreciated
(43:06) just watching the journey the whole way through just as they've probably appreciated watching her journey even though they know that she could put filters on or could only hop on Instagram live once she's done all of her makeup like I could probably Flex more of my material belongings than I do uh because I just don't think that would serve anyone and so that's why I don't so I've learned that from them now obviously she flexes a little bit on her material belong but you know tomato tomato everyone's got different brands I'm not going to come out with a lip kit anytime soon so that's her brand not
(43:33) mine so my brand has evolved over the ages you can call this mosy through time and this is me as 23 years old really into fitness and just starting my first gym here I'm much older as somebody who's the master gym licenser you know I have 5,000 Plus locations I'm building gym launch which is a company that's B2B servicing gym owners and then over here you've got mosy today who is the managing partner of a private Equity Firm called acquisition. comom that owns a bunch of companies and so the question
(44:02) is how does a brand as a personal brand evolve over time in the beginning look how I dressed I've got my neon tank top and I've got my neon shorts and the reason that I dress this way is because one this is how I actually dressed cuz I was into fitness but also I had a 70% female audience I needed to look approachable not like a big scary dude me today probably not something that most women are going to be like yes I'm going to trust him in my weight loss Journey they're like I don't want to look like you and you have a beard no thank you right but this looks like a
(44:36) relatively approachable young man who's high energy and filled with the Light Of Hope all I was focused on was Fitness Nutrition and accountability I was listening to Rihanna on Tuesdays that I was cranking inside of the gym and I had women's only playlist and I was catering to the audience that I had at that time and me in reality was this person all I was thinking about was Fitness and anyways and really just trying to get my career going as an entrepreneur now fast forward here when I'm the master
(45:03) licenser if I was this guy the audience that I have here is 90% male and not only 90% male 90% jacked male gym owners so look how my personal brand changed now I want to be clear it's not like every time I did this it was the most deliberate thing it was just that I also changed over time because what happened is here all I was thinking about was Fitness I had just been competing I had a few State records I was following periodization I was counting my macros every day it was what I was obsessed with at the time which is why I started a business around Fitness but that second part a business around Fitness started to become the most important
(45:41) part to me which is why over time I started caring more and more about business and less and less about Fitness and so then I became the gym Lord which was the name of our community which is gym Lords and so I started wearing the stuff that repped my new company and most most the people that followed my stuff then believe it or not I was a lot cruder about making money back then than I am now because remember this was the guy who wanted to be rich and Anonymous you will probably grow and change in your interests and the way you dress and the way you look also changed that way
(46:10) now I think there's a biral relationship I changed and so so did my audience which also changed me back my pants are falling down I have to blur that out so I'll call out two things that were very specific about this number one was that I called it originally gym rescue and as soon as I got on the phone with people people were like I don't be rescued I don't need to be rescued and then their egos would flare up so I was like oh no what if we just launch your gym like we're doing a grand opening and they're like okay yeah yeah that's cool even though they've been open for 5 years but
(46:40) when I called it a launch everyone was fine with it so then I switched my language from gym rescue to gym launch because of my audience not because of what I wanted kind of interesting the second thing is you'll notied that I went from brigh eyed and bushy tailed kid here to man with a handlebar mustache and so then the mustache became part of the brand and I did that for the entire of time that I was the gym Lord and running gym launch so then what happened is as I started making more and more money I started seeing people making even more money than me and it
(47:08) was all these private Equity guys and I was like this guy bought a company for 50 million sold it for 250 made 200 million didn't even have to start the company and so as my interest started to evolve because I started investing more and I started buying real estate I started buying businesses and I was like huh there's a game beyond the game and I actually started moving away from being the gym Lord because I didn't want to be the face of that company more I just wanted to be the owner and so this shift
(47:32) was me going from operator to owner and as an owner all I cared about was my return on investment and making sure that we were doing business in alignment with our values and so I started dressing how I would dress without being public facing now the irony of this whole thing is that in dressing in a way that wasn't supposed to be public facing I ended up becoming even more public facing than I ever thought and so over time the way that I dress which is pretty much just the most utilitarian way I can imagine look at
(48:05) these caps and so this is mosy today and there may be a mosy in the future who dresses differently because I changed my mind about stuff but the thing is is that over the years I went from loving Fitness to loving operating businesses to loving owning and scaling companies and my progression as an individual has reflected in how I dressed and who I was talking to but the point is is that I think the only way to make a personal brand last is for it to be you and I want to be really clear here this is a
(48:38) visual prop set and I'm using this because people need visuals to understand stuff but I will say that I feel like this overemphasizes the importance of a quote outfit it is not that important if I start wearing black tank tops tomorrow and I start wearing sweats no one's going to give a because my value is about the stuff that I provide that helps the audience do better helps hopefully you guys make more money grow in the ways that you want to grow achieve the goals you want that's the value not how I dress it's just that because I dress this way and I
(49:09) do it consistently because that's who I am people have then Associated that value with this outfit which is why someone else can wear my logo and people will approach them and Associate the value that I've given them with that person and that's how you brand that's how you build brand equity and so I show this as a visual demonstration to give you the idea but not to emphasize that you have to wear a certain thing in order to build your brand but if what you wear is a representation of who you are then it will probably have some
(49:39) degree to that because people at least at the onset will judge you by how you look and just to give you guys some context on why a private Equity investor would be even be making a a YouTube video and be explaining this topic so number one is that notice how all these people are all billionaires kind of interesting why are they billionaires what's different now versus what it was before well now there's direct distribution when Tom Hanks became famous he didn't have direct distribution so he always had to do
(50:09) Partnerships with movie companies who then did Partnerships with movie theaters to distribute the content but now because platforms came in between the distribution and the end user creators could immediately post directly and interact with their entire audience and so what that did is it cut out all these middlemen and allowed creators to take up a huge slice of the economics and so me recognizing that in each of these people is part of the reason that I started even though I didn't need to start making content because I saw the value in the audience and just to give
(50:44) you guys some hard stats around this on why I decided to basically give up anonymity which I do like my privacy one is that this is according to Goldman Sachs the crater economy is projected to be at 500 billion half a trillion a year plus by 2027 this is not far away this is 1 b500 times in a row every year that's a that's a lot of billions and to give you an idea of the audience size Instagram has 2.3 billion and then YouTube has 2.6 billion users and Tik Tok has 1.
(51:19) 6 billion these are all monthly active users I mean this is the world and then beyond that just to give you context in terms of just USA YouTube alone creates $25 billion a year in GDP for the United States of America just from jobs that were created by creators which right now is over 400,000 jobs this is real economics that are happening and unfolding in front of our eyes how business was traditionally done has been turned on its head and when you see teenagers and 20-year-olds becoming decamillionaires ctim Millionaires and billionaires pay attention because the
(51:57) troll comments in this world are like if you have so much money why are you making these videos dumbass if I have so much money why the do you think I'm making the videos because there's value in doing it beyond all of the obvious ones which is you build an audience you can sell things to them the larger one that's unspoken is the access to other people now if I want to reach out to a public CEO and say hey can I hop on the phone or hey do you want to do a podcast the answer is yes because I have an audience and so whatever their message is it doesn't matter how rich you are if
(52:29) you don't have someone listening you can't distribute your message so you might be sitting at home or at the gas station or between things or you're on the can right now thanks for joining me and wondering okay I just saw some of the biggest influencers of all time and how they built their brands what am I going to do now so what we're going to use as a process rip Charlie merer called inverted thinking so rather than say hey here's the six steps to creating your personal brand I want to talk about
(52:55) the things that would would destroy a personal brand or guarantee that you never build one to begin with so let's start off the top if I were to only do this one thing what would I do to guarantee that I can't build a brand well number one is I would talk about something that I know nothing about so if you talk about stuff that you don't know anything about and are not interested in I can guarantee you will not build a very good brand around that topic next I would be inconsistent and ideally not even start for fear of
(53:19) judgment so let's call that quitting slash start stop you can't stick with it because even if your stuff was really really good if you quit for a long time or you start and you stop and you start and you stop I can guarantee you you're not going to build a big brand next thing I would do is I would try and do two things around selling one is I would sell early so that means that I haven't provided any value to my audience and I immediately start trying to sell them stuff I have very little Goodwill I don't have a lot of people but because I'm desperate for money I start trying
(53:49) to sell stuff and I sell it really hard well that'll probably destroy the brand because people already have very little affin towards you and now they have zero so that would be one of the things I would definitely do to make sure that we destroy your brand the other thing is I would sell wrong and what I mean by that is that I'd sell the wrong stuff and so if I'm making stuff about gardening then I say hey you should take this credit card that has all these great Reward Points it doesn't really match now if I was a financial or investing influencer that might make sense but if I'm a gardening
(54:18) influencer just because they're the only person who reached out and said hey we'll give you 500 bucks to do the sponsorship some money is not worth taking but if we were to do that we would definitely decrease our audience and decrease the likelihood that they want to tune into our stuff in the future so the next thing I do is I was associate with the wrong crowd the wrong people people that their core values and the things that they're interested in directly conflict I'll give you a couple examples for me one is like a snake oil
(54:43) salesman so if somebody has a really crappy product or they make these false promises or false claims then me making association with them would hurt my brand and so the idea is if we wanted to make sure we'd hurt your brand we'd make sure to associate with the wrong people next is I would need perfect conditions don't start today start when you have perfect conditions because the thing is is that there are no perfect conditions and so you're like well I will only succeed if I have a really big set and
(55:06) lots of people helping me and a script and a teleprompter and all these special effects if you need that to win you're not going to win because what I can tell you about every person that we talked about earlier all of them started with what they had and so if you really think you're going to go all the way then be willing to work with what you have and the last one is I would never ever change because even if things did start working if we guaranteed that we didn't change then we can guarantee that eventually the conditions will change and we will fail because you're like but
(55:34) this thing started working I have to keep doing that and then you slowly see it stop working less and less and less and less and you don't change with it and at the same degree you change if your brand never changes at all you have changed and it means that there's actually greater and greater distance between who you are and who you represent yourself to be and that long term will sync you and so so if everything I just covered if you do these things you can guarantee that your brand will not win and will not succeed in the long term and so if we're being enterprising about this what if we flip
(56:05) it because that might just be the recipe to succeeding in the long term which means we talk about the stuff that we know and that we're interested in we stay consistent with it and we just start and we keep going you wait way too long to sell it all if you are going to sell to begin with because you want to make sure that you always provide so much more value than you ever ask from your audience and then if you do choose to sell something you sell something that actually requires you to change nothing about who you are if I already love this type of tank top and people
(56:34) know that I've been wearing it for a few years then it would make sense for me to say by the way this is the brand I use no one's going to be upset by that because it makes sense based on everything they've seen up to this point and I would associate with people who are like me who have audiences like mine who care about the things like I do so that those audiences combine and compound unto each other rather than duding all of the associations I spent so much time curating and putting together to say this is what I stand for
(56:59) and we would wait for in perfect conditions which often means today because there are no perfect conditions and finally being willing to embrace change because change is the only constant that will happen in braining at all is that the platforms will change the media will change the packaging will change and you yourself will change over this whole time and you have to be willing to do that or eventually you will die and so these are the steps if reversed that can create a brand in my opinion might be able to follow to get rich in today influence Revolution

Why I Don't Go Home for the Holidays - YouTube
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvEfWrDOfNk

Transcript:
(00:00) I don't go home for the holidays and that surprises a lot of people and I don't do it because I don't like what going back home does for me and that's not just family that's friends environments places I go to people I speak with anything for me I left home because I wanted to be a different person I wanted to change my environment and I wanted to start clean and move in the direction of the person that I wanted to be I think the main reason that I want to make this video is because there's probably a younger
(00:30) version of me out there that is terrified of the idea of not listening to their parents and going home for the holidays listen if you love your family and it's like the highlight of year then [ __ ] go if I'm talking to Young mosy the biggest fear that I had was what people would think about me if I didn't go out with them when I was back home because it's like well I'm back home for a week they're like yo you're back home let's whatever and I would feel obligated because I'm back home and I'm only back home a couple times a year but
(00:59) the reason that I haven't been in touch with that person when I'm not back home is because they try and meet me in my past and treat me in a way that I used to accept them treating me as I've grown in their word changed I no longer accept the type of behavior and it's not just the things they say it's how they say it and a lot of times like it's not super direct a lot of times it's indirect especially if it's people who like you this is why it's so tough when you have a cousin or an uncle who says oh you know how you are and they say like that
(01:27) cuz they want you to be like oh yeah I know how I am but the thing is is that when you do that you basically agree you accept their label of who you are which is often the person that you used to be that you literally left there to try and change this was super tough for me because you know I have lots of traditions and hey come on like aunt whatever is going to make pumpkin pie again oh you know so so is bringing her meatloaf or whatever it is and so you can't miss it but the thing is is you absolutely [ __ ] can you can
(01:52) absolutely miss it I made a video about this four or five years ago and it was one of my top videos that I made and I thought it was worth a refresh and one of the things I said in the video was I have become increasingly intolerant of people treating me in a way that I don't accept and I said you know maybe in the future 5 years from now I'll look back on this video and think hey maybe I was a little too harsh maybe I was a little too extreme and the reality is the exact opposite I'm even less tolerant now than
(02:15) I was then so if you're sitting on the couch right and someone says hey get over here if they said something like that to me in that tone I would say don't talk to me that way I'm not your dog like what do you need they like uh just get over here and i' be like no you're just repeating the same thing and then it gets to this really awkward point in those awkward moments is when you reframe and you retach someone to treat you if you think it's uncomfortable for you it's even more uncomfortable for them one because
(02:42) they're not used to it and no one does this it's also why most people are mediocre and never get out of the Doom Loops they have from back home and they fall right back into the old behaviors that they were trying to get away from when you're teaching that person of how you how you want to be treated you're saying you can do whatever you want I have no control over how you choose to speak to me but I do have control over what I will choose to do in response and so if you would like me to get up and help you with with this thing simply ask
(03:05) me hey Alex are you busy right now and I might say yes or no if I'm not you might say would you mind helping me with these things and I might say of course happy to help but if you say get over here I'm never going to respond to that and you repeating it louder in no way makes makes it more likely it I'll respond a lot of times it's these little things like this it's these micro exchanges because it's rare that someone's like you are not happy Alex they don't really do that not often sometimes they do like I mean I'll give you a couple examples
(03:30) like ah you have such a short temper right I'll get that one when I go back home anybody who knows me now probably would not describe me that way and here's a key Point what most people want to say even if they have the balls to to step up and this is and kudos for even stepping up if you say hey you know what please don't say that I'm really working on it that's a great half step in the direction but believe it or not it actually makes no progress here's why if you say I'm working on it you're still accepting their frame that you are that
(03:54) way if you want to be a different person then you need to behave a different way which means that if you want to step into that identity of the person who doesn't struggle with drinking or doesn't struggle with their temper then imagine what that person would say in response so if you don't struggle with drinking and you have no temper and someone says hey Alex you know how you have a temper I would say no I don't I don't know yeah you do I mean you've always had a temper like I might have in the past I don't now please don't speak
(04:19) to me that way it doesn't help me unless you prefer that I be angry whoa you're getting angry no I'm stating facts I'm asking a question would you prefer that I be angry no well then don't tell me that I am are you here to help me or are you here to get me to behave the way you want me to it's very tough for people to see people change because often times when we change in our world grow we remind them of the changes they've been incapable of making we remind them of their own deficiencies of their own failures of the Comfort zones that they
(04:43) had been unwilling to step out of that we were willing to take the risk for to figure out whether your family and the people that you're going home to are conducive to your goals what behaviors do I need to do to achieve the goals I want and do these people support those behaviors or do they detract from those behaviors that's it if when you get in that environment you are less likely to do the behaviors that you say you're committing to so that you can be the person you want to be and achieve the things you want to achieve then that
(05:08) would be a detractor if they are helping you and they are supporting you and they are they're clearing the way and they're giving you attention back then that's an amazing family and they are supporting you in your goals and this is the double-edged sword this is the Paradox is that the loving caring family that would say hey I respect that you're trying to make this change go do what's right for you so you can become that person that's probably the family you'd want to go home to right and that's the Paradox of this if the family and the
(05:30) people around you the people that you went back home in high school and to have your your your high school parties with or whatever actually behave that way they wouldn't be there they'd be somewhere else right they would have moved on they would have grown themselves and so that's the tough part about it if you are young mosy and you don't have a lot waiting for you back home in terms of what you're looking forward to I just want to give you one outside person's permission if you need that to not go home you can miss a
(05:57) holiday and if you need language around that you just just say I'm not saying this is forever I'm just saying this is for now that's it easy language and if they throw a tantrum that is on them they may miss you and the thing is is that there are elements that you may miss too the question is just whether it's worth the tradeoff here's an easy way to think about this when you go home there are positives there are some things that are positive there are also things that are negative they exist separately it's the
(06:24) reason that people get into abusive relationships they have lots of positive and they also have lots of negative and so when they break up with the quote abusive person or the person that they have some chemically you know crazy Dynamic with they feel like they miss the person because reward does not decrease over time but your reminder of punishment does so let me give you a tactical example on this have you ever finished a night of drinking and the next morning you say I'm never going to drink again probably but then what do
(06:50) you do the next weekend you drink why because punishment decreases in its Effectiveness over time you quickly forget and then you do it again reward is actually different than that which is why when you think about a relationship 10 years in the past you think about all the sweet memories because all of the punishment associated with the relationship disappears but then you get back in the relationship and you're like holy cow I forgot all all this crap and so what happens is we spend a long time away from our families and we remember
(07:13) all the good we forget all the bad but then we get back home we're reminded of all the negative things and why we left to begin with I try to actively cue myself and remind myself of the many reasons that I chose to leave center point of that is because I didn't think it would help me become the person I wanted to become especially this is for young mosy if you are if you're in a season right now of trying to become a new man or a new woman and you're trying to flex your muscles of being on time of being consistent of of maybe not
(07:42) drinking too much of of staying in the Rhythm that you're in right you've got you've got this little work grind that's going you've had you've had a good streak you're like being productive you're making progress don't break it it's not worth the trade-off how does you drinking Aunt son so's eggnog and having a couple of pictures and having some weird comments from your uncle that you don't talk to that much and getting some political argument that doesn't matter anyways how does that make you better the only
(08:06) reason you go back is because you're afraid of what people will say imagine play it out you've got the whole family there and not you version a they just forget that you're not there and they keep living their lives in which case Kudos it's fine on the other hand the entirety of the room [ __ ] talks you the whole time you're there are you really sad you're missing it you choosing not to go has no downside in terms of if they have a negative experience or you have negative experiences being there and if they treat you negatively and so
(08:35) we have all these positive memories because it's impossible to live an entire life without positive memories right you just also have negative ones and the question is is the upside worth the downside and so for me especially as I was coming up through this I noticed that I would get tons of anxiety going into the holidays I would dread certain occasions I would dread certain Traditions that would happen and I hated all of it and one day I was like why am I putting up with this [ __ ] like there's no rule that says I have to go back and
(09:00) then I gave myself permission to not go back you know what happened I kept living and so did they the people from high school they just moved on they found other people to find Drinking Buddies with and if they're like oh Heros thinks he's better than us okay different for sure if you want to be exceptional and I will say this again then it means you will be an exception the majority of people will not behave the way you are they will say why are you acting so weird why are you behaving this way this isn't normal what's going
(09:26) on they're going to ask you these questions because they want you to get back in line but back in line leads down the road and you know where that road ends and you you know that's not where you want to be that's for anybody who doesn't want to go home now if you do have elements of people who you do love there and you have elements of people you don't like there then I would say just avoid the people that you don't want to be with and that means that you can just simply not respond to their text when they ask you to hang out I
(09:47) know crazy you can also just not put yourself in like if someone say hey sit next to me and you're like ah I don't want to crazy you just tell them the truth I don't want to this is the ab absolute litus t test for navigating these controversial conversations elegantly is that you simply tell the truth and it's because there's so many perceived social obligations around holidays what's expected of you what you're supposed to do what you're supposed to pay for what you're supposed to help set up what about the tree what
(10:18) about the presents what are you going to do right if you still feel obligated you can send money for presents and say Here's money for everyone the truth is what you would say to your real friends or to the few people that you care about about the situation so I don't want to go to my aunt's house it's like so and so drinks too much and so and so is always inappropriate and I always get in political arguments I just don't want to deal with it you say that to them you always get in political arguments you always get too drunk you're always
(10:46) inappropriate I just don't want to deal with it you just say that rather than making up some BS answer because they're going to overcome your BS because it's BS and so they will have the upper hand because they are telling the truth and you are not you state the facts I don't want to come I'm doing really well or hey I will come on the condition that I'm not going to talk to so and so and I want to make sure that you as the host are okay with that and I will have a conversation with them up front letting them know that I'm not interested in
(11:13) talking to them you say hey Uncle John there's 38 people here at our holiday get together talk to any of the other 37 but me that's it and if you need to make Grandma you're welcome to just don't include me in it please also one of the things that I think is underrated is is Leisure Time just because you are home and you don't have some scheduled doesn't mean everyone has free access to your time if you want to stay in and watch a movie because you're on holiday break and it's one of the few times that you just do that even if it's just you
(11:39) and not even with your family then if someone says hey let's go out and you say no I'm good and they say what like what are you busy tonight or what do you have plans or if they start with hdf plans and you say no and they say you want to go out you can also right after they say that say no because rest is productive if it Nets you a gain in how much you can do if you rest well during the holidays and you're more productive after the holidays that's a good thing if you feel like you have to recover from your holidays then you don't even
(12:02) get the main benefit of holidays if we think about how we curate our environment the wealthier the people that I meet the more contained and pristine their environments are they don't allow people who are detracting from the people they want to be and the behaviors they want to do in and so think about Elon Musk or Jeff Bezos or Steve Jobs think about the teams of people that they have around them do you think you can be an idiot and be in Elon musk's presence do you think you can be a drunkard and be in bezos's presence do
(12:29) you think you can be like an idiot and passive aggressive and Mak SN remarks in in in Steve Jobs presence no why because they're intolerant of that they have a higher standard and so if you remember the first girlfriend or first boyfriend you ever had versus what your standards are today your standards rise as you grow as you become better so too do your expectations or rather should your expectations become of others that you surround yourself with and so if you're spending all this time working on the person and the character that you're
(12:58) trying to build and then you just dilute it with crap around you it's very tough to get back to that which is why you feel like you have to take one or two weeks to shed the bad behaviors and the bad habits that you picked right back up when you went back home and so for me it's like I would rather not have you know a week or two of of bad bad lack of rest where everyone feels that they're entitled to my time entitled to my energy going into another week or two afterwards where I have to recover from this vacation it's like I just I ate up
(13:28) three four weeks of my year it's 8% of my year my whole year because of a social expectation to me that's ridiculous and so I don't subscribe I opt out we create our reality we create the Rules of Engagement for other people to interact with us we teach and reinforce others for the way that they treat us if we don't like the way someone treats us we don't like the way someone talks to us it's our responsibility to set it straight and if they do not adhere to the agreements that you have set then you don't need to
(13:55) play anymore and their loss is your company and then you keep living in your life I think this is epic tetus but he says like how do you get angry at a rock you can call a rock names you can shout at it you can stop your feet but the rock just stays a rock and so if they get all upset just be the rock be like I understand got it not going to change my behavior but I understand having these hard conversations gives us the space to be the people that we want to be on the terms that we set rather than the ones
(14:20) that are thrust Upon Us by social expectations and cultural norms that were created for people who are not trying to achieve the goals that we are I'm only sharing this because some of you who are listening to this are actually going to achieve big [ __ ] and it's going to feel really lonely for a lot of that time and it's because you're going to feel like the odd man out and you're going to feel like what you're doing is contrary to what everyone else is doing the people who are back there are going to you know call you names
(14:42) behind your back they're going to say you think you're better than them they're going to say that you forgot where you came from and you just develop a thicker skin because you realize that they say those things and yet you still continue and yet you keep living and you keep getting closer to your goals and then the thing is is goal after goal starts falling down and you get more and more evidence that this path is the path you should be on and you'll feel more and more confident to the point where in the future you you just have no issue
(15:05) with that you'll have zero tolerance someone texts you just block them like I don't care I don't need it I just don't need it and so I am significantly less tolerant than I was in my first video four or five years ago and I was pretty intolerant then maybe 5 years from now I'll uh I'll recant all of this stuff but maybe 5 years from now I'll say the same thing that I do now and maybe I'll be even less tolerant I'm making this for young mosy who needs to hear that and if you have an amazing family that's awesome go back enjoy the holidays keep
(15:28) living you but this is just for the people who aren't stoked about going back for the holidays and are not sure what to do

Transcript:
(00:00) I sold my last company for $ 46.2 million I crossed $100 million net worth at age 32 and I just made my biggest investment ever by becoming the co-owner of school and I always wanted breakdown videos from Jeff basos and Warren Buffett and Elon Musk what were they thinking like of course they're 100 billion now but I want to know what they were thinking at 100 million and 10 million I want to show you what the thought process is behind the investment and most importantly how you can model that decision-making framework to make way more money in your life I decided to
(00:28) invest in school and make my single largest investment to date including putting my brand behind it and endorsing the company because there's multiple things that are aligned in the same direction so Charlie Munger talks about this he calls it the LA laaloa effect and so usually when you get these like massive explosive growth opportunities it's not because of one thing so a lot of people want to have a silver bullet so it's kind of like a silver bullet fallacy it's thinking that there's this one big thing that if we just do that then everything else will work and more times than not it's the
(00:59) hundred golden BB's no silver bullets it's two three five six things that all have an incremental boost but when you multiply all them together create this insane outcome and so I see that with school and so let me Zoom all the way back out to like the ecosystem so this would be like big thing number one if we look at the education industry so let me let me show you some math real quick education globally is 10 trillion big all right us is 1.
(01:33) 3 trillion still very big now this is split between two things you've got formal education so that would be like twoyear and fouryear degrees and right now that's around depending on the source 850 billion and for those of you who Google and find out that it's 863 or another source this is 842 it doesn't matter because in this type of stuff that we're talking about we're talking about big forces and we're talking about directional corre Ness but it's around 850 billion for formal education now on the other side it's split you've got e-learning in online education I'll put it that alternative
(02:13) education which right now is about 200 250ish billion 200 to 250ish billion depending on your Source all right so close to that now here's the really interesting thing about this and this will relate to why I'm betting really big on school or at least one of the reasons is that this one is shrinking by 6% per year kind of interesting this one is growing by about $40 billion per year now that is because this one's growing at roughly 20% per year so you've got this massive nut here that's shrinking by 6% all right which is about
(02:54) what's the math here about $50 billion is what it's losing every year and we've got this other one that's gaining $40 billion a year and growing at 20% so when I see these two things and I see this big overall industry in terms of 1.3 trillion 1.2 trillion whatever I see this as actually a crisscross so formal is continuing to go down and alternative or e-learning Etc is continuing to go up and so it's almost the exact amount that this loses every single year is almost the same amount that this one is gaining every single year and so that underpins a
(03:39) shift in buying Behavior people are seeing more and more that formal education doesn't give the return that it was promising and people are able to learn skills directly that can contribute to them making more money and being able to contribute in society feed their families pay their rents pay their mortgages and ultimately just live productive lives and so if you're a hair stylist you're like well you know what the the formal education thing doesn't matter because all I have to do is like learn how to like post on Instagram like my clients that even I do in my garage
(04:10) and I get more DMS for people who want me to do that and not a single customer's ever asked me for what my certification was huh so maybe this skill is more valuable than this skill huh and this girl is willing to teach me how she does it for 1,000 bucks whereas this school is 2 years and 15 grand well well the ROI is not there right and so what's happening is a lot of this money that has been going to these big endowments these these hars these these big university money now I do think at the top those guys are probably protected for a while but it's
(04:44) like the mediocre middle it's CCU state right like those are the ones that have four-year degrees that don't mean anything that no one cares about all of that money is getting actually pushed all the way back down to the bottom to basically creators people who are good at teaching a niche skill they're like hey I did this thing it worked well for me here's how you can do it and that works for anything whether it's like you're selling a customer like hey I lost this weight this is how I did it I ate all meat all the time and somebody else is like I only ate plants whatever and if that sounds cool to you I can show you how I did it and so this
(05:16) industry is Contin to grow so when I see this I think okay huge amount of money Changing Hands in a very fast time zone I'd rather be in this boat than in this boat and so that's thing number one so that's kind of the industry overall now if you look at me personally like how do I intersect with this well the first two companies that I sold so gym launch and Prestige Labs well I'd sold companies before that but they were just low seven fig numbers not bigger numbers those companies service creators and as somebody who came from first a direct response marketing background and selling media and
(05:54) Licensing uh to Brick and Mortar gyms I'm really familiar with this model like there is no University for gyms and so I did my best to create that University for gym owners because if you went to school for being a gym owner you'd make a heck of a lot more money than if you just went to school for like business and then opened a gym I have lived through this huge shift in wealth because like I started I think when I was 27 years old I think we took home $16 million in income just capitalizing on this trend and so I know that that
(06:26) money is out there and people are starving for information that they can actually use to feed themselves and so I have the big Trend data that I can see on the charts and the big fancy Finance people but I also have my personal anecdote of having experienced that huge amount of wealth coming towards me so that's thing number two thing number three is where do I fit in with this ecosystem and so my audience for the most part is split between business owners and people who'd like to start a business my whole mission with making the content that we do has been to make real business accessible for everyone
(07:08) and so early on for me I didn't have a lot of mentors and help and so I just looked everywhere I could to learn this stuff and I learned a lot of it the hard way one of the reasons that I put this stuff out there is that also some of the sources that exist out there are just honestly false like they are teaching things they have not done they're regurgitating content from other people and getting key points wrong because they don't know why it's right to to begin with and just basically leading people astray and I actually don't think it's malicious I think they just want the views they want the likes they want the ad Revenue whatever and like I don't blame whatever I would like to at least
(07:39) put stuff out there that I know like I have done this and I have done it many times and so if you follow this process whether you're a good person or a bad person it will probably work for you and so my audience knows that my whole goal has been to make real business successible for everyone and so if we're thinking okay Alex you could have promoted I don't know pick something Drop Shipping like there's a lot of different things I could have done but why why School particularly well because the mission of school aligns with my
(08:08) personal mission which is to make real business successful for everyone they want to like School want myself included now I'm a co-owner want to make business fund and easy for everyone and so I spent six months talking to the founder about like what do you really want this to become and he has a huge massive vision and his vision aligns with my vision of how big I think the space really is if you think about all the different industries that exist most of them have been disrupted by technology in some in some way you've got like
(08:37) Airbnb so hotels got attacked by Airbnb taxis got attacked by Uber these are the famous examples right but there isn't if you think about it no one's disrupted education no like there's no one place that everyone goes to learn stuff it's still completely fragmented and as somebody who's been in that space and understands that space very well and sees the trend I believe that there will be someone who will take it and my bet is that school will be that company now why School versus the zillions so this is like I
(09:10) guess point4 which comes down to why this particular company this particular product and hopefully even going through this the thought process you can still relate to any major decision that you have to make in your life and so why School particularly one of my big litmus tests for something a product that I'm going to promote is that I want it to grow on its own meaning if the only way that a company grows is that it advertises and when it stops advertising it goes down I don't like that I like to have passive growth and so let's go over
(09:44) here and I'll walk you through it so there's something that I call the golden ratio in business you have the percentage of customers who refer customers and the percentage of customers who uh exit so these people exit these people refer and and if the percentage of people who leave every month so this is 0.
(10:07) 1 so 10% all right I'll just I'll put as these percentages rather than decimals there you go bear with me if 10% of my customers refer me a new customer every month and 10% leave every month then my business will stay the same now if 20% of my customers refer me a customer every month and the same 10% exit my business over whatever this interval of time is Will 2x 2 over one and that means that no matter how big I get the business will consist consistently double every one of those time intervals and so I look very carefully at what percentage of customers decide to bring other customers to the business and what percentage are leaving or choosing not to buy again and this works
(10:43) whether you're selling physical products this works whether you're selling software it works whether you're selling services it works the same way and so this golden ratio of percentage of referrals over percentage of people who leave or churn is what tells you the passive growth rate of a business now the vast like vast majority of businesses they've got let's call it you know 2% of people are referring and they've got you know 10% of people that are leaving and so they have to fill this bucket up with
(11:12) ads or or marketing or Outreach or whatever it is that they have to do to fill up the top side so that they just don't lose everyone over time and that's because they don't understand how to build a good product now once you have a company that does this and does have more people who refer than leave every month that is when you this is a flame that's when you pour gas on this thing and you say okay now I want to tell the world about it so that that number of doubles it just goes dot dot dot do Dot and then it doubles off the
(11:44) chart and then you add even more and then doubles again off the chart because you're just increasing the nend as fast as you can so that the doubling happens on a bigger amount of customers so when I saw school's metrics I was blown away I had never seen a company who had metrics as good as school to like I've never in my history of looking and we look at a lot of businesses we get gosh several thousand businesses a month that reach out at acquisition. comom for investment and for us to to buy you know a minority or majority of the of the
(12:16) business and so I've looked at a lot of business metrics and so when I saw the passive growth rate that school had it really intrigued me and so that business underlying fundamentals were there the mission of the fact that it wanted to make Business Online easy and fun and it starts right now in the education space like all of those things made it really really a good fit for me now let's talk about uh Enterprise Value stuff so number five I am here to make money and so I I I like to have my my altruistic goal is to make real business education
(12:53) accessible for everyone but guess what we have a lot of people work at this company a lot and you know unfortunately you guys you know want to eat feed yourselves have girlfriends and uh boyfriends hey you know uh and uh and and have houses and cars damn you right and so these guys need money unfortunately I would do this for free but they need money and so uh money is obviously a component of uh of any business so let me let me walk you through um the difference here so let's say that I have a traditional business number one so let's call this a service
(13:30) business and let's say I'm just going to use Simple Math here all right I'm going to try not to do too much math because I know everyone hates math right which by the way get over that because if you want to make money but let's say that we've got a $10 million business that does Topline and it does 3 million in profit okay cool now a traditional service business like this might be a $15 million business so that's just giving a five times multiple to the business which by the way that's how businesses are valued is usually a multiple of earnings and so cool this is a 15 million do company now if I double
(14:01) this company and go from you know 10 to 20 and 3 to 6 then I go this goes into becomes a $30 million business more or less might get a little bit more maybe get 6X cuz it's a little bigger but more or less I have this Delta that I can add to the business now if I had an e-commerce business my multiple might be on top line but it might be a little bit higher so if it was the same numbers 10 and three then this company might trade at call it three time you know two times Topline so this might be a two times Topline business 2x in terms of how the how it's valued so this might be a $20
(14:40) million business at Baseline and again if I double this business then it goes to $40 million okay well that went from increasing by 15 million to increasing by 20 million so if I owned this business me putting the same effort in I would make more money neat now let's look at this third piece and then I'm going to tie this together for you let's say say we have a tx/ software business and these businesses trade and all of these trading multiples depend on all the fundamental business second Ops I'm trying to keep this really simple on High level because I want the decision-making process to be
(15:14) the highlight more than the individual numbers all right but if a business again is $10 million Topline and $3 million of profit let's say they might get somewhere between 10 to 20x their Topline and so this might be somewhere in the neighbor of 100 to $200 million now let's say I double this business and we go from 200 to $400 million well then we created $200 million in value so we created $15 million by doubling this one $20 million by doubling this one $200 million by doubling this one so if you're going to put effort somewhere and it's the same
(15:52) amount of work you get more for what you put in and that's fundamentally like the acis.com logo is about leverage so like the the it looks like this is our logo and that's because this is a lever and the main point there is that you get more for what you put in and so one of my big things in life the reason we be able to move quickly in terms of accumulating material wealth is making sure that when we make the move we get the most for it and so obviously I've spent four or five years building an audience and not really promoting
(16:22) anything or any of the companies that I own but this one felt too close to what so so many people needed which is they wanted a way to make their first business they wanted to make a way to make their first dollar online um for me the the mission was aligned they want to make it fun and easy for everybody just like I want to make business successible for everyone it had the fundamentals of the big Market behind it so it's moving in the right direction I'm on the right wave and the business itself was sound it was a really good product so I felt
(17:00) for my brand that if I'm going to promote something it had to be really good because if people say I'm only trying this because of Alex and they get in there and it sucks who do they think sucks me I'm the one who introduced them right like if you had a friend who's like oh you got to use S Sally she's a great hair stylist and you go and Sally just gives you a bus cut and puts your hair as blue and you're like but I wanted my hair to be red right forget the bus guy um you'd be upset you'd be like Sally what the hell this person's crazy right and so you be upset at the
(17:30) person who referred to and so the same degree I had to take that kind of I had to take this even at a higher level cuz I'm also a business owner so like I've I've been referred companies and I've like oh it's pretty good obviously there's things they could improve but like I know that the internet um has a short memory and has low forgiveness and so I had to make sure it was something that I could really get behind which is why it's honestly I've been looking for something that I could get behind for years there's just nothing that met the met the standard um that I have for you
(18:00) guys honestly I got very excited about that and so after six months we decided to do the deal and I talked about this big decision that I was going to make in an earlier Vlog was like my billion dollar my billion dollar decision it was about school was whether or not I was going to invest in school and specifically also promote it and like actually talk publicly about it but it felt too big and like it would help too many people for me not to do it and so um that was ultimately why I made the decision now if you listening to this I
(18:31) have two camps right we have business owners and we have people who want to start a business and so I want to share some cool metrics uh at least they get me very excited about this and for the future that if you want to start a business even if you have a business that you'll find interesting and that could probably make you money all right because we now like now I'm a co-owner of the platform I have access to a lot of information that other people don't have and so we ran something that we wanted to call the school games and so so this was something that Sam and I came up with together we were like how do we make this fun like how do we make
(19:03) this cool and so we're like like it has to be it has to be something more than just try this out right and so we're like What if we gave away what everyone else charges for which is usually my like go-to like how do I how do I look at what everyone else charges for make it better make it free like that's been my I'll write that process out like look what everyone else is charging for make it better make it free all right like if you want to get customers that's the Playbook now so with the school games what we did was I said okay what what
(19:33) does everyone else give away oops school games well most people have like coaching calls whatever you want to call it so people charge for that uh they have courses right they have courses they put inside all and they charge for that uh they have a community these are all C's that's kind of nice uh they have a community um that they have uh in involved there and then uh I want to have another one so I'm I I want to keep it to C's uh but so they have code which is realistically they have tools right so they have tools that they give people right and so it's like okay if someone
(20:12) has expert help they have doy self training they have support from other people doing the same thing which this also builds out there here's another C for you builds their conviction because in the beginning making your first dollar online so little of it has to do with making their first dollar and so much of it has to do with getting out of your own head which is why a lot of people were trying to get into business start with personal development first because they have to get through all their fears of rejection and why their dad didn't love them and why they're doing this to begin with and what's my
(20:42) passion blah blah blah blah blah right all you got to do is make a dollar and then you're in business just FYI so these are all the things that people charge for and we're like okay well let's just make it free and so that's pretty much what the school games was about it was giving all of this stuff uh and so we do I think three a week with all the top Community owners so this isn't uh so this is the people actually doing it and the nice thing with school because we own the platform we know no one's fronting we
(21:10) see all the numbers and so and all the numbers are public so no one can claim that they're like I'm making a million dollars a month they're like dude you're right there I can see how you I see what what you make right and so it just keeps everything honest and transparent in an industry that lacks a lot of that and so my hope also Sams as well is to is to bring transparency to an industry that's been very shrouded uh in in just lack of transparen just lies honestly in deception I would say misrepresentation would be the the correct word for that so we do all that stuff and we said uh
(21:43) we'll make it 30 days and so I'll give you the the business explanation behind this so we did 14 days for free in a 30-day games that way people have two weeks if they're like you know what this isn't working for me they can dip out if they do think it's working for them and they finish the games then they can the top 10 people fly out um to Vegas and we help them grow their their communities and and learn from them see how we can make the product better things like that now this is the part that uh might
(22:08) interest you well hopefully that interested you too but this might interest you so I got the stats from the first games um and 3.44% of people finished the first month of the games so they they went to 30 days made their first dollar online so just under one out of three people made their first dollar or more obviously um who finished their first month after the school games and that to me was like the most excited I've ever been finding this out because I obviously like I have so many people in our community who want to start businesses and I was like how can we make this as easily as seemly possible
(22:56) it's like okay well there's no other piece of software that has to get used you don't have to learn anything else it processes the money it helps you with the delivery it's all in one place like there's nothing else that's needed like you can run the entire business on the platform um and you can start for free and so that's what got me really excited about it and so I'll explain the business model to you guys if you're interested in terms of uh how I'll explain how School works and I'll explain how uh the school like hosts work so school is just a $99 month
(23:29) platform and longterm that's not the monetization place I just like to explain um where it is so right now it's $99 a month um and we keep it that way because we just want it to be simple like if we wanted to maximize profit we would have lots of tiers and we could do you know a ton of other things believe me to make more money with the system that's just not the objective right now the objective right now is to get as many students on the platform and as many teachers on the platform so that we just create a richer and Rich community
(23:57) of content so that we can tackle that 10 trillion dollar Global nut of Education because if people can go to one place to learn whatever they want from people who are actually doing it and they'll do it affordably compared to $50,000 a year or whatever you know CCU charges that is a bet that I'm willing to make and so right now we're in growth mode and so that's the model it's just however many groups there are is the times 99 is what is how how much money the platform makes and the platform has been losing money because we've been aggressively
(24:30) reinvesting in getting better and better software engineers and designers and developers to make the product absolutely exceptional so that's why obviously I wrote a big check into it because I want it to happen I wanted to to crush in we will like it's doing really well so we're good there but let's talk about you so if you if you were to start a school Community because a lot of people who follow my stuff are like well I would like to start a business and um if you think this is okay then I might give this a shot so I'll just explain how the business model works so you've got
(24:59) this is my Instagram my Instagram icon man this is going to be tough let's see if I see if I can I know all of them that's that's Tik Tok I think and then you got Facebook right you got Facebook all right whatever that's good enough so you got social media so you got traffic you got eyeballs all right so just think about this like this you got eyeballs that you have to go get now you can get those in any ways you want you can post you can run ads you can do Outreach you can partner with somebody who already has an audience all of these
(25:28) are ways to to fundly just get eyeballs and so then you drive those eyeballs to your school page so this is why this is kind of neat so I'll explain this to you so our vision for this is that like we just turned on ad tracking this last month so it's kind of exciting is that if you think about the difference between Shopify and Amazon okay so Shopify let's say I sold a pens I sell these markers okay so that's my product I sell these markers and I sell on Shopify well I'm going to to customize the whole page I'm going have to learn the Integrations I'm going to
(26:02) have to build all this stuff but I have a lot more control all right so that's that's the the plus is that you get a lot more control a lot more customization the downside is it's a lot harder uh and there's no inherent brand trust so if you just throw up a shop store with pens why should I buy from you not a really compelling reason although in The Other Extreme you have like Amazon so I'm the same same guy selling pens but I put on Amazon now I can't control the color the reviews the I can't control anything I just know that I have to use the template that Amazon has and I put this on there but
(26:33) here's an interesting stat for you so I have a book I have multiple books1 in $100 mil Ser $100 offers $ leads and another one coming out soon um and so my Shopify page converts at like 2 to 3% something like that which is like fairly standard for e-commerce my Amazon page that has the same book converts at 30% so 10 times as efficient in terms of converting now Amazon obviously takes its fee for you know doing the transaction whatever but the key point is that because what happens is you start to build inherent trust in the platform and so as people begin to trust School more
(27:11) and do more and more transactions on school then these School pages will convert better than any page that you could possibly build on your own because you get to borrow school's credibility that's the key point and so if you're trying to get into business like number one way to make lots of money just have amaz like a massive huge brand of and an audience okay but if you're trying to get into that it's like uh it's like telling a model like how do I be successful it's like be born beautiful like like how do I be born how
(27:38) to be a great musician like be born a great musician whatever point is is that we can actually help arm people who are getting into business by letting them borrow our brand credibility and because of this it also becomes way lower technologically in terms of difficulty for somebody who's starting out interestingly it's like if you look at Amazon l Zillow you look at Airbnb they almost all more or less converge at the same overall layout you've got a video right you've got a video you usually got a carousel of images you've got you got some
(28:13) reviews for the thing you've got a buy button and then usually a handful of bullets about the product almost all of the pages look like that and so by the way if you're going to build something maybe something to consider that those guys have more traffic and conversion data than anyone on Earth they built it that way for a reason and so the school page looks the same way that way you can build it that way so you get your eyeballs whatever you want you drive it towards the school page which probably convert better than anything you make on your own and
(28:43) then you have your community so you've got all your people inside your community and they're all happy and they look like they have dresses on cool whatever and so and so then you provide value this people and this becomes a recurring Revenue stream and they pay whatever between you know $1 and 9999 whatever per month and that's it and the reason I like this model overall too is that it it creates a way for people to provide value to people with low risk like if you say hey I need $50,000 to for you to do this thing with me it's a big risk if
(29:23) you don't know anything if you haven't consumed anything but this allows people to have a front end that with low risk someone can come in learn about them get value and then if they want they can choose to ascend to higher levels or that just becomes the main thing and they just drive tons and tons of volume through it people have won in either of those scenarios but this is fundamentally like the simplest business model I could possibly imagine for someone's trying to get started you don't need inventory you don't need any
(29:46) third party Integrations you don't need to know anything about technology and you can actually make your money on the platform so this is from Evelyn I just want to read this to you because I think it it'll it'll say better than I can she said $99 a month worth it I think you need to understand this I keep seeing post questioning if $99 this is inside the school games if $99 for Community is worth it and if you should go with a free Facebook group instead I didn't see or understand uh this when I started on school but if you want to actually build a community of a meaningful size you need to hear this um I have deep regrets
(30:18) yesterday I was listening to Matt Thompson and his latest podcast when one thing really struck me that I want to share with you it's insane how much Community Management cost you save when you use School versus a Facebook group for context in my own communities we manage over 11,000 paying monthly members and combined with my other business partner over 20,000 because there is a no payment integration and B Facebook restricts our paid reach down to an average of 300 out of 6,500 members in our biggest group so
(30:45) you have this group of people and you can't actually reach them that sucks but that's the prevailing that's like what's currently out there and if you want to have payments it doesn't integrate with anything you can't do it right and so we have to pay team of people to a find and remove people who don't pay because Facebook doesn't do that automatically like school does and then B provide 24-hour workday written support because school members in contrast School members actually see each other's posts and want to help each other out because of the gam gamification element and the connection
(31:13) that comes from having to start to engage and so some of the things that school has which is why it's growing at the rate that it is is that we've put gamification inside of it and so people get points for getting likes and getting comments but to them to themselves and so they gain a status in the community like in real terms they gain status and then that status actually unlocks other abilities like a game and so the core of the development team at school is actually all gaming developers because
(31:39) we wanted to make business fun and so we wanted to make it like a game because there's so many people that I see especially younger people but just people in general who are absolutely insane at different games and I'm like dude if you just took this level of focus and applied it to business you'd already be a millionaire like no doubt in my mind but no one's just taken business and tried to turn it into a game and so that is absolutely the vision of what we're trying to do is how do we make this fun and easy for everyone how do we just take the bar that's already low and just make it that much lower so that way more people can
(32:08) cross cross it like you don't have to be this tall to ride this ride anymore you just have to be this tall right that's the idea and so she says honestly this is so genius our community is now one of our the the community she built on school is our most profitable community because one we don't run ads to it at the moment 234 members of net growth in the first month after playing the school games all organically from school Discovery page in this community so one of the cool things about school is that it's a platform and so what that means is that like when you have a community
(32:38) this ranks in our directory of communities and so just like Google ranks web pages we rank communities and so people will go to learn things they want to learn how to do plumbing at home or they want to learn how to fix their roof or they want to learn how to play ping pong or the watercolor whatever and they go there and click watercoloring groups and then the groups that come up they joined but the people who own those groups didn't generate that customer we did again this is you borrowing off of
(33:05) school and so we can actually help people get customers as well which is one of the again one of the cool things that I like about the platform she had 234 new member net so that means net of turn people who left people she added 234 without any paid ads pretty cool and so the second reason that it's more profitable is that we haven't paid we haven't promised 24-hour ritten support and don't deliver it because members are helping members and it's working amazingly here I'm really mindblown this would never been possible with a Facebook group it might be the amazing
(33:35) Community the lower cost or the fact that I can finally reach my own Community again but I'm becoming a Super Fan I say that because I think she can say better than I can um is that if you actually want to have a business and this is the hard part about being being a beginner is that if you actually are successful then you will run into new problems later and so school unfort like for me as a marketer this is the worst position to Market from because no one is suffering from the problem yet but you will suffer from the problem if you actually win it's like if you lose weight you're going to have to change the clothes out of your wardrobe because
(34:04) nothing's going to fit anymore but people are still so focused on losing weight that they don't think about the next thing but I'm telling you that if you follow the steps and you you become one of the 30% right of people who make their first dollar right 3.
(34:26) 44 make their first dollar well then when you make your second doll and5th doll and thousandth And1 10,000th quickly you're like oh shoot I wish I had started this on a platform that already knew how to scale and with school you can start the right way from the GetGo rather than rather than have a switch later and so big picture I decided to make this bet on school because it was growing Without Me based on Word of Mouth it's harnessing a huge Trend in the industry in terms of Education overall I personally know a lot about education have made a lot of my wealth in education um and so I felt uniquely qualified to
(35:02) help the company grow fourth my brand has been built and my mission has been about making real business education accessible for everyone and until now I haven't seen anything that actually really anybody or any team that even came close to the level of dedication that school's team has and also the level of talent exceptionally talented stacked developer team like A+ talent and uh we're able to make a platform right now that handles currently millions of users every month Millions many millions of users every month and it just works seamlessly and so for
(35:39) those reasons and because now I have the data to support this so just to be really clear the first four things is why I made the bet the fifth one which is what I just showed you the 34 3.44% of people who make their first dollar after their first month of school like that's what just gets me even more Jazz that it was the right call and for those of you who are business owners as a side note almost every existing business would benefit from having a community in one place so whether you're a real estate agent or where you just want to have a place that you can just spoil
(36:06) your customers they get to know each other you make introductions that means you add value and the cool thing with communities is that the members add value to each other that's like what the concept of a network effect is is there's a network effect like people each when somebody else gets added to the group it actually adds value to everyone else so if there's one person in a in in a community there's no network if there's two great when you add a third person both of these people benefit from the new party when you had a fourth person all three benefit from the fourth and that's one of the cool
(36:31) cool Parts about this and so if you're a business owner and like I said whether you're a real estate agent or you're you're a plumber or you're or you're a gym owner or you have a salon and you do hair it doesn't really matter having a place where all your customers can be together without worrying about like the craziness of like Facebook and some of the other social media platforms that exist and know that you can curate the entire experience uh just the way you want it and you can reach 100% of your
(36:56) customers every single time you make a post um and they can you can reach out to them you can DM them you can do all these things uh you can host the the content you can have calls regular basis all that kind of stuff and they are incentivized to engage in there and that's one of the big lifts of the platform is that people are incentivized to engage and I'll tell you it's it's wildly addicting because I'm in this I'm obviously in school as well and I'm in the school games Community for everybody who starts it's 14 days it's free I want to see my little ranking go up I was like I own the platform I was like I got
(37:24) to [ __ ] up high ranking and so I'm I'm I'm I'm in there posting and engaging more than I do on any other platform more or less uh that is why I decided to uh to make this big bet and make it public uh because I do think this will be our this will be my one of the paths that we uh they create a billion or Plus in net worth and I hope that people look back at this video and be like wow Alex looks so dumb then but now he's a billionaire so it sounds cool um and so I wanted I wanted to have that and so I'm going to I'm I'm
(37:54) committing I'm going for monthly um I'd like to give updates of the the cool stuff that that's happening kind of from a business perspective so that you can see us build this 1 billion 10 billion hundred billion dollar Enterprise so let's do this so I have my team here they just heard me talk through that and so I just told them write down your questions and so when I'm done I'll answer them and so this is the questions that they had while I was presenting this so so you get it like we really just do this in real time all right so shoot the traditional education it's
(38:24) very centralized right a big play billions and billions of dollars is the e-learning more distributed is it is it an easier playing field for the little guys who don't know what they're doing yet yeah 100% so so a lot of markets basically it's a cycle of centralization decentralization that happens over and over and over again and so right now like all the power was centralized and so if you look at like Rome right the Roman Empire like is all centralized and then you start the Barbarians at the gates that are all these tribes that are independently none of them could take on the power of Rome but in aggregate
(38:55) attacking from all these different angles they just start nibbling away at it so a lot of Empires and centralization doesn't lose in one big coup I mean obviously in the political scene sometimes it does but it often erodes so it's little itty bitty Snippets little crumbs that get broken off but the the cookie is so big that the crumbs are actually the size of this building right like they're big crumbs um and the reason that the smaller competitor can beat the larger competitor right now is two main things well I'll say three one is to beat the
(39:26) larger competitor you don't have to offer more classes than Harvard you just to have just have to know one thing better than how they teach that one thing or whether they teach it at all and so if I am the best pottery maker and I have a whole Instagram or social media or YouTube channel whatever of me making these insane pots who are they going to who are people in general going to want to learn from just generic teacher number six at CCU who teaches Pottery or the the largest pottery YouTube or Instagram person in the world
(40:01) well probably that person so number one number two what's the cost difference so this is the the this is the cost component new entrance can enter because they don't have to have a building they don't have to employ anyone if you have an iPhone and you have an internet connection you can be you can get famous you can distribute and so distribution which is three so cost of delivery is zero cost of distribution is zero and so that's the big thing is that distribution has been disrupted which is fundamentally what the internet did in general to all Industries it's just at
(40:30) this moment and I honestly think the like you guys want the I'll try not to put my clip political cap on but the reason that the the formal education industry has not been disrupted or has been more slow to be disrupted than other ones is because the government Prof it up people have interest free loans they don't have to pay for for 10 years if that weren't there they would already be gone like I just like the fact that the government fronts $200,000 $100,000 $50,000 and the way it actually works is
(41:01) that they back lenders so they say if these people don't pay we'll pay you back there's more Nuance to it but fundamentally the government backs the loans if it doesn't cost people money to buy something then the incremental cost appears to be zero it's obviously way more and I've made videos about it but it feels like zero because you sign a piece of paper and then you get to go to Disneyland for for kids and so and you don't have to do anything for four years and you just get free money right so you have this discount this big big bad thing that happens years from now but
(41:29) you get all the good thing today and that just leverages human behavior like one cookie now more people will take it than two cookies later just is what it is but also side note successful people wait for two cookies won't get into that the reason that that centralization has even existed is because of government subsidized uh payments but the new Creator can win because their content will be more specific and deeper and they will have proof and evidence that they are the best at it the cost of creating that content and or the deliverable which is now digital education courses calls whatever is also
(42:01) free and the third one is that the cost of Distributing that is also free and so the barrier to entry is pretty much just the cost of the few pieces of Technology you have to rope together to have a business and the crazy thing about this is that it's the irony is that it's never been lower risk to start a business than today and so if you re rewind a 100 years in 1924 you would have had to save for 15 years have a house use your house as leverage to go to the bank and say will you help me start this Bakery and then
(42:36) the bakery had real cost and if you went out of business you went bankrupt you lost your reputation and then that was it you'd be known as a failure for the rest of your time now because of that the stakes were higher people tried way harder but fewer people did and so the trade is now it's way lower buried to entry and also a lot of people who have no work ethic can get into it but it also requires the same amount of work but less risk you still have to work just as hard as you did however long ago but you don't need to risk as much to get it and I think that's pretty cool and so
(43:07) fundamentally that's why why the crater economy overall is just booming because one person won't bring down the the system but a million tiny players will bring down the whole thing because they each will beat that one big player at their tiny sliver could you break down the math how much money could I actually generate for well um so I want to be really clear about claims implied claims anything like that all this is involve risk in general so if you pay for a platform that's $99 a month then your risk is $99 a month all right just to be clear beyond that the amount of money
(43:42) you make is subject to how hard you try how much you promote but if you were to look at and I think this is a decent proxy if you look at some of the largest communities that exist in General on the internet outside of school you've got many many communities that are at 1 million 5 million $10 million a month and it's because you have a single player free distribution and basically as long as you have a good enough product and a ton of traffic to bring people into that product then people will pay to be in
(44:13) there and see well let me give you a little little tip so a lot of people are like well what do I put inside of a community I'm going to give you a little little tactical nugget here all right so profit well uh which is owned by a buddy of mine who just sold it for $250 million did a really cool 14,000 um business survey of what were the features that people were buying that had the highest willingness to pay so wtp is willingness to pay um and then I can't remember what these four were but basically they looked at all these different features that people had in communities and which ones people wanted
(44:49) to buy the most versus things they thought were par for course versus things that they didn't really care about at all and so it's kind of like care vers versus willingness to pay so if you have a lot of care so care let's put it this way so they care a lot and they're really willing to pay this is where you want to be they care a lot but they're not willing to pay means you have to do it it's kind of like protein in your supplement stack like people care a lot but you're not really willing to pay an arm and a leg for it because it's almost like an expected right and then on the flip side this would be the
(45:18) worst thing which is like no one cares and no one's willing to pay so don't do anything in here and so they had things like discounts like if you have a community where you put like exclusive discounts uh like merch merch was one that was over here like some people like merch some people don't like some people are willing to pay on the care Spectrum not really high over here and this is where it gets really interesting or important newsletter was uh something that people like kind of expected for a community they want some sort of regular communication um but they weren't like
(45:49) willing to pay a huge amount for it but the big three that we're in here and so I include this one as my number four by the way because I still I want to make sure I do that right is they wanted exclusive access so that means q&as uh talking to experts they want to be closer think proximity either digitally or in person but just for the sake of this conversation for digital Community it's like they want to be able to ask you questions and so that means like they post and you respond or you hop on a call and you respond any of those things would count so number one
(46:20) was access uh number two was content meaning they like some of the stuff that you put publicly they just want more of that stuff privately that they can't get somewhere else and so you have exclusive access exclusive content um as the second kind of bucket courses would fall under this uh trainings things like that and the final one which surprised me actually uh was events and so people in a community want to be able to meet up they want to meet up in person you can also do virtual events of course but I think I think the real power is if you
(46:50) can meet people in person have them fly in or fly out to them depending on the size of the community and so these are the big four that people put into communities to drive value is that I will be the one talking to you I'll respond to your stuff via DM I'll respond to your posts inside the the feed or I'll have calls on some regular Cadence or you can expect some sort of response time from me content here's some additional training here's some course here's some whatever that I can put in here to provide even more value now the content can also be in feed meaning you can just write articles so
(47:18) in the school games I prefer to be written and so I actually write long articles like probably two times a month on one component of the school games like hey if you're using ads is what I would consider if you're getting Partners here's a script that I wrote for you guys to go get partners right so that would be content and then events is that you meet people together like that one's pretty self-explanatory in the newsletter you can actually just take some of this content put in written format email it out right very very easy
(47:41) um and so School helps you do all four of those things all in one place when you were running gym launch did Community feel like a really obvious thing that increased a lot of value for users like I'm wondering if that oh yeah so this is really interesting so samon consulting.
(47:58) com which is a which was a relatively large um education business and he found something really interesting which is I think one of the impetus God catalysts uh for for this uh for him actually innovating the product that that would eventually become school is that when he looked at his user data he saw that people would buy a course but they would log in they'd watch a handful of videos and then they would spend the rest of their time in the group and so they'd make content in the group they'd ask questions in the group almost everything the community really was the group way less so the course but
(48:32) everything that was out there was focused on building the course rather than the community being the core component and so he flipped the priority and said well what if we made Community the main thing and just had all the things that people like that surround communities as I want to say add-ons but like integrated into it but the community is the Hub and so um yes with gimm launch the community was obviously a huge part of it I think works with any any kind of business that's service related or education related like I
(49:01) still consider the gyms semi education because a lot of people there trying to learn more about how to eat healthy work out better learn form learn cooking recipes meal prep there are a lot of other things that go into that lifestyle and so a useful question for any business owner is like what lifestyle am I bringing people towards and so like if I were teaching music there's a musician's lifestyle there's probably like a way that they schedule their time there's there's tools that they use there's ways that they practice all of those things go along with the identity that someone would have as a musician as
(49:31) somebody who's a fitness person as an author right and so one of the great like business strategies just think like what is the I am statement that accompanies my product so like I am a and then what comes along with that and so if you can build a community around that of people who also identify with that label you have a much deeper connection with them because they all identify the same way how does making a school group or taking this business model uh compared to let's say something like Drop Shipping or e-commerce like
(50:00) any other thing that you yeah it depends on the goal right and so if you're trying to if you're trying to make money on the internet you want the thing with the simplest business model that has the lowest risk and the fewest moving parts and I think school has that um I would say I'm quote biased because I'm a co-owner but like I honestly I I would never risk my reputation to say something for for I just wouldn't do it so you can choose to believe that or not from a selling perspective if you wanted
(50:28) to have like a big exit in a business um you have to prove that you have an asset that is sellable that that works without you now a school Community or community in general if it's built off the face of a Founder is going to have the same issues of keyman risk that any business that is built on a Founder would have and so you would have to build a school Community differently if you had that intention now the vast majority of people that consume my stuff um are trying to just make a lot more money than they currently are whether they're by quitting their job to start something or within their business they just want to grow it now some people want to sell
(51:04) which hey acis.com so we're here for give us a call the main thing that someone wants to buy in a business is long-term recurring revenue is you want to know that the people that are paying today are going to pay four years from now and so school isn't is it a salable asset or not a sellable asset it's just like any other recurring business how good you are at it will dictate how recurring it is and how valuable it is and so I'll give you an example there's a a I say an acquaintance of mine who has a a business that Services uh mechanic shops so really Niche he's got 10 locations so he knows what he's doing
(51:42) he's not somebody who like started one wasn't making money then started like those who can't do teach he didn't go that model like he has 10 locations he's legit he's done a handful of rollups like a very legitimate player and because he is legit he has uh uh a business that does I think just under $50 million a year all on recurring Community right and so if you have a niche expertise that has super high value and compared to everything else in the marketplace you have all these benefits that no one else has people will stay and they'll continue to pay and this guy is growing every single
(52:11) year and so if I'm looking to acquire company yes I'm super interested now on the flip side if you create a community and you don't provide value and people cancel in two months then no it's not going to be valuable you'll make an income because you'll know how to Market and you'll convert some sort you just do number of new conversions per month times average order value and you'll you'll get how much money you're going to make in terms of income but I would say this is that if you're trying to get going don't worry about that get the
(52:34) first dollar across the bridge you'll learn so many skills in just doing that the next steps will become clear to you once you take the first steps because it's really easy to get overwhelmed in the beginning just get the first dollar across the line you have a huge International audience yeah and I wonder if part of this was being able to make business accessible to people dude th% yeah so we have right now 50% or something like that of our total audience is international um and so having something that could also service all of those people was a huge a huge Boon um to why this also made sense for
(53:07) me versus like if I had a physical product thing and we were only in the US then I would automatically cut out probably 70% of the people that I could potentially help oh and this is yeah and a great Point too is that if you make content on the internet for example as a way to get customers you will also have a certain percentage of your audience that that is international and having like a community for example as long as everyone speaks the same language you can provide value to them without having to worry about International borders the
(53:31) tariffs tax like you don't have to worry about any of that stuff believe me I've done international shipping it's a nightmare also anyone can join the school games and read your posts and potentially come out to the headquarters verus becoming a portfolio company is yeah and one of the other things I thought was kind of cool is um obviously the only companies that we like really directly interact with are companies that we own but by having the school games and you know the top 10 every month of the school games and the cool thing about the school games not to push this too hard but um is that it's off of
(53:58) new recurring Revenue meaning it's not like oh these guys have been doing you know school for five years and they win every month if you win you get taken off number one and number two it's based on the new added Revenue so you can start and in fact uh March of last month I think four or five of the people who won started that exact month now some people started a handful of months ago and then like took it seriously they like went pro like they were like this is the month I'm been try and win and they really pushed it and then they did get
(54:23) on the top 10 and then they're flying out to Vegas to hang out um talk about growing their business but like four of them literally like they're like yep I saw an ad and it was you know February 28th and then I was like I'm starting on the 1 of March and they just did it one guy met his business partner I think in school and was like oh you know hor he's a foreign guy he was like you know her Moi yeah he's got the school games I'm doing it and so he's like let's win and they met and one guy handled the
(54:49) delivery the other guy handled the promotion a great partnership and they came in 10th place they like just got in um it was really cool very cool Russian guy yeah really cool uh do you want to talk a bit about like why Sam and yeah I mean Sam he's obsessive and so this is really interesting for you so people have probably heard the term OCD right obsessive compulsive disorder first off off I would drop the D and just say someone's obsessive and compulsive it doesn't mean it's a disorder unless it affects their life uh negatively and I would say many quote OCD people do better than people who are not and so
(55:20) why would it be a disorder but neither here nor there so you have two components there you have obsessiveness and you have compulsiveness I think the the ideal makeup of an entrepreneur somebody who's obsessed but not compulsive is that you can literally hold your attention on this goal for years and not compulsively change direction not compulsively need to do things to quell that you just are obsessed with this one thing and Sam is obsessed he wants to build the absolute best product that is the most fun that
(55:46) makes making money online and making your first business as easy as possible and seeing that Obsession and his attention to detail throughout the many months of conversation that we had before we decided to uh before I decided to you know Buy in um as a co-owner of the company and then obviously promote it uh publicly um I saw his obsession and I felt like it mirrored mine in a different vertical and I think from a partnership perspective that's what you want is that you want someone who's as obsessed with you sorry as obsessed with
(56:15) the with whatever they're good at as you are with whatever you're good at what you don't want is somebody who's as obsessed with the same things as you are because then one of you isn't necessary and so perfect partnership typically there's three big veins in a business you've got product you've got promotion and you've got people and so uh you want somebody who who's who represents all three of those now to be clear the equity distribution doesn't need to be third third third it could you could have an employee who's exceptional like you it's just those are the functions
(56:40) that have to be maintained for business to grow my last question is a little like Easter egg for anyone who's made it all the way to the end of the video from the first couple school games are there any like really amazing tips or tactics that you've seen from people building great communities and scaling Rel so instead of tips or tactics I will say that there's a lot of ways to win the game and I think that is probably the the metal lesson is that I have seen people on the school school games who only did email outbound they literally did cold email got on the phone and sold
(57:08) people into their Community now obviously they have a higher ticket so it's more like $500 month or $1,000 a month for their Community but they won the school games that way there were people who already had organic audiences and then just like basically made the CTA and said hey put a ton of bonuses ton of value in there and they were able to take an audience that they basically weren't making anything from and then turn it into a community that they also got paid for so they both deepen the community and uh make make an income
(57:32) from it so that's like the people who had audiences there's also people who ran ads to make this work uh there's people and this is probably my favorite model is there's these two guys uh mix and fad who came in I think third or third last time and neither of these guys have social media presences at all but they reached out to an influencer that had like 50,000 followers and they said hey we'll make we'll do everything like we'll we'll edit your videos will prompt you we'll record it and we'll do the ctas we'll do everything
(58:01) and we'll make this community and we'll manage it and they grew him from 50 to 3 million so they're good at what they did and they also started the school games in the first month they made they added like 40,000 in recurring Revenue uh or 50,000 or something like that uh in the first month in recurring Revenue like not like recurring Revenue so my point is is like if I had to if I had to if I had to start over tomorrow at zero if I had to start over tomorrow at zero and I didn't have any money and I had no connections like no one knows me I have no reputation the model that I would use
(58:31) to win the games is I would use cold reach outs two people who are influencers to ask them to partner with me because of that because the the hit rate you only need one so from a success percent you literally just need one and the key and this is the pro tips if you want an Easter egg this is it when you do these reach outs every position has an advantage and a disadvantage so I'm going to zoom out for a second and explain the advantage of the underdog so when I had gym launch I had a guy who so I had Allen to my software company and we had so this is kind of funny but
(59:02) I had agencies using one of our unique selling props in their business that was trying to compete with my business but we were the underlying infrastructure anyways and so they were like everybody wants to buy your thing because you're the big established player right and I was like dude when I came in I wasn't the big established player so what did I say then so when you're coming in you say man to Alex you're just a number like you're never going to talk to him like he just owns this thing like he's just like it's just some representative that he trained who's going to be on
(59:29) your account like it's it's going to be nothing with me you get all my attention I'm going to be fully focused I only have two other customers like you're going to have all my attention that's the advantage now if I'm Alex I'm going to say this kid's in his mom's basement he has no idea what he's doing there's a reason that he only has two customers because he doesn't know how to provide value consistently we've systematized this thing so we can consistently produce the result everybody has an advantage and everybody has a disadvantage and so if you're getting in even if you have zero customers here's
(59:58) what I would say I would say listen I don't want I started this with the intention of not having lots of customers I want to find a partner and I'm going to devote everything I have to just this anybody else is going to split you and you're going to be in account to them you'll get a rep but with me it's just me and I'm going to build this whole thing myself like you'll have my cell phone we'll talk every day we can do whatever you want I'm going to build this thing and the way you prove it this is the key point this is the the the
(1:00:23) real nug is that when you do that Outreach and you say it with that perspective when you get on the phone [ __ ] prepare don't get on the phone and be like yeah I was thinking maybe we like partner up on this thing like you have this value and I have nothing like this should be a great deal right like no you get on and you do so much work ahead of time like DM the people who are commenting on their on their stuff get on the phone with them say hey what kind of community would you want take the notes record the call if you do five of those interviews and then you hop on that call with that influencer and you
(1:00:51) say hey I made this deck do you mind if I show it to you they're going to be like you made a deck about my business and they're like you're like yeah I can walk you through kind of the strategy I was thinking about like the phases of roll out that we could do and what I've already talked to your customers about what they want they're going to be fascinated by the fact that you already you might know something about their customers that they don't and you know how you do that you work it's work that's how you do it but you literally work so much that when you make the
(1:01:16) claim that you will work hard for them you are demonstrating that you will work hard for them and so they will believe you because fundamentally every person just wants a hardworking partner right you just you just have to get them to believe that now anyone can say I'm going to work my butt off I'm all in but the the proof is stacked against you because you have nothing and so you have to make up for that now and here's the here's the cave what if influencer number one says no you do it again and when you get on the phone with influencer number two guess what you do you show the thing you built for influencer number one as an example and
(1:01:46) then you show theirs and if they say no what do you do when you go to influencer number two you show the stuff from influen number one and number two and then you show there so you're actually building out a portfolio of stuff but you have an incentive to make it exceptional cuz you're never going to present it to somebody so like you win either way the only way you lose is if you don't work and I promise you that on a long enough time Horizon if you reach out to these people and you get on the phone with one and I'm I don't think this is a key point I would not shoot
(1:02:11) outside of your your league all right like if you've never done this before I wouldn't say go after a 5 million person account I just don't think that's a smart idea but I think if you go after a 50 or 100,000 150,000 person account and to be clear you want to make sure they're getting engagement it's not like bot you know bot account or whatever but you want to real person who and like you want to know the real secret go to somebody you already follow go to somebody you already like cuz then you won't be bsing when you talk to them you're like I love this stuff about your brand I think this would fit in in this way and you know had that thing two
(1:02:38) months ago I think this would be perfect with that and I talked to a bunch of my my friends who also follow you and I talked to these other people just so it wasn't just my friends and these are the things that they were looking for and I think that if we did this here's an estimate like if we convert 1% of your audience over it's this much a month I think that'd be interesting and so you probably follow 2,000 people now anyways so just pick a hundred of them or pick 50 or if you really want to be targeted Pick 10 and think to yourself if I had
(1:03:03) to get one of these 10 will would I do and then do that and I promise you you'll get one and then from there you have a partner and then you get the leverage of the fact that they spent five years building Their audience and you get to have a part of that today even if you only get 20% right now of course you have to negotiate that piece but my recommendation is don't be greedy up front get the deal done get the Reps in your belt because also being real you don't know what you're doing and so I wouldn't try and ask for the majority of this
(1:03:26) until you have some reps under your belt right so take a smaller percentage use it to build your portfolio in terms of your proof that you're good you learn at zillion things along the way and you're going to get paid to learn and so if all this school stuff sound interesting to you um I do have an easy offer for you you can go to school.
(1:03:49) com games and what we have inside for you is we have three calls a week with guys who are actually making tens of hundreds of thousands of dollars a month on school using the platform teaching you exactly what they did step by step so we've got calls for you of other people we've got a community of others to help you out um and I think the benefit here is that you get people who are both starting with you at zero but people who are also at the end of the race cheering you on and so you kind of have like three types of accountability so you've got peer accountability you've got kind of like coach accountability because people are are are rooting for you but then you also have alumni accountability people
(1:04:20) who've already been through it and then uh I made a course that I put in there it's free it just shows you how to to do this the different ways to play the game the different kind of like avatars that you can self- select maybe I'm somebody who likes making content maybe I'm somebody who's better at ads maybe I'm somebody who already has an audience maybe I'm somebody who likes outbound um maybe I'm somebody who likes to have a partner so I break down all the different paths that you can use to really start making money on the internet with what I think is the
(1:04:43) easiest business model uh out there the best part in my opinion is that all of this stuff obviously we have the prizes the top 10 uh gets fly out so hopefully you can do that but you only need three people and I just did a one day full deep dive it's eight hours of me just helping the top 10 communities scale and those recordings are live right now so if I had a $100,000 Mastermind or something this would be it except it's yours and it's free and here's the here's my incented for you if you just get three people into your group all right so I like to put a like as low as I possibly could you get three people
(1:05:19) into your group you can get your friends in there I don't care if you cheated it's fine get three people into your community uh and you get the all the downloads from that and all of this stuff you can start for free for 14 days just so you can get a feel for it you can go in there and download everything and steal it all for all I care all right but my hope is that you actually use it so you can make your first dollar and I'll just repeat this one stat because I think it's the most important stat I think of the business right now is that 34 30.4% of people who
(1:05:46) finish their first month of the school games make their first dollar online it's about as compelling as I can get so check it out school.com games see you there I'm also on the inside of the group too so hit me up tag me whatever

(00:00) scientists have discovered a revolutionary new treatment that makes you live longer it enhances your memory and makes you more creative it makes you look more attractive it makes you slim and lowers your food cravings it protects you from cancer and dementia it wards off colds and the flu it lowers your risk of heart attack stroke and not to mention diabetes you'll feel happier less depressed less anxious are you interested if so keep listening practically right now the number one thing that actually does all
(00:24) this stuff is sleep and sleep is a key determinant in how good of sleep you are physically how much fat you store and where how good you are making decisions how productive you are how intelligent you are and in other words this isn't the kind of stress that makes you stronger it's the kind of stress that makes you dumber fatter slower and with a smaller bank account and if you don't know who i am my name is alex mosey i am the owner managing partner of acquisition.
(00:45) com we have a portfolio of companies about 85 million a year and one of the key questions i get a lot is what do you do at night in order to have a nighttime routine and so i have assembled a large amount of habits over my life i think i counted them over 55 that i'm going to go with you and a lot of them are as tiny as put you know take a piece of salt before you go to bed so that you don't pee at night like there's tiny little hacks that i've developed over time that i've acquired from learning and i heavily ripped off this presentation from the presentation that
(01:14) i gave with dr trevor cashy my good friend at one of our licensee meetings and so without further ado i want to explain to you why this is such an important part of making money and that might sound crazy to you but i will explain and so the reasons for entrepreneurs in terms of why we need to have good sleep schedule good sleep hygiene good sleep routines etc is really two main things number one is impulse control and number two is intelligence so from an impulse control perspective i'm sure you guys have already heard a lot of self-development
(01:40) books and know about the lizard brain and all that kind of stuff um and as it turns out a sleep-deprived brain basically has use has us performing as a drunk person and so it gives us the emotional stability of a drunk human being and so the the fancy connection between you being a lizard and the part of your brain that says hey maybe we shouldn't do that gets weaker and so your ability to put on the brakes goes down and so it doesn't inherently make you a negative person but it makes you more reactive and more prone to be
(02:05) overreactive or emotional when you ideally shouldn't be in a business scenario second is intelligence so our ability to learn new things the more you sleep the more your brain clears out useless information from short term and stores it as useful information into the long term so if you don't sleep as much you have a goofy short-term memory while you're on wake on top of a terrible capacity to move information from short-term to long-term while you sleep not only that what you do to manage to learn during a sleep-deprived state
(02:31) erodes away each night so even if you get a regular time to sleep your ability to store learn and reconfirmation is cut almost in half with as little as two hours of sleep deprivation all right so to drive this home your ability to learn is even paired with fitful sleep that is to say sleeping enough but if your sleep is poor quality you are still doomed to be learning challenged and this can mean anything from the ghost um in other words if you don't sleep as much or as well as you could be you're dumber because of it and as a result you will
(02:55) make less money that's my case now i didn't really like any of this stuff in general because i'm not a big believer in superstitions and whatnot and i will cover some of my beliefs around this topic but my first wake up call was when i actually had a client in my first business uh i snapped at a customer and she was like you can't do that i realized what i had said and the person had a very normal request and i just like really bit their head off um she's like you're not gonna be able to run a business like this and that was when i
(03:19) realized i needed to change some stuff and so that kind of began the journey for me down this 100 million dollar sleep compendium of little tips and tricks that have served me well over 55 that i will cover in this video now that being said i broke this down into kind of four major buckets um beliefs around sleep that have served me well the environment that is conducive to the best high quality sleep three intake in terms of all things you put into your body or directly applied to your body that have improved my ability to sleep
(03:46) and then finally uh habits that surround sleep and activity in general that i generally um do and so i didn't really think that i had so many of these until i started to write them down for this video because it was a question that i was getting in my faqs on the gram and so without further adieu let's rock and roll okay so here are my eight beliefs around sleep number one is do not create superstition all right so you have to remove the have to must need to should from like if i don't get eight hours of sleep
(04:16) right like if you if you think that way so as much as i just said everything's important i'm now gonna just contradict myself in saying that i think that these beliefs are more important than the rest of the stuff i'm gonna cover this video all right because the thing is is like still think about this as an 80 20.
(04:27) like if 80 percent of the time you're good and 20 of the time you're not it happens right we're human and everyone wants to be perfect and no one is and then for that reason we get upset with ourselves that being said whenever you say things like i have to i must i should you're actually creating a threat to yourself in the universe because the next thing is or what like i have to get this sleep come or what right or i have to follow my routine comma or what right and if you fill out that or what all of a sudden you realize that some of the
(04:50) beliefs you have are kind of silly and so one of the worst things you can do after this presentation is a disclaimer and a warning is take all of us all the stuff i'm gonna show you as doctrine and say if i don't do all these 55 things i am a a terrible person i will have terrible sleep i will make less money and i will suck don't do that all right if you can take one or two of these things to improve your sleep on 10 of your nights of sleep for the year it's a win right so look at it on 365 nights if we can by the end of this video increase
(05:13) your quality of sleep by 10 or 20 percent just from one 20-minute thing that you do one time and consume it that is a amazing return on time and attention all right so so just as a big disclaimer number two as much as i just said that sleep is so important a belief that has served me well is thinking i don't need a lot of sleep now in doing that what it does is that my anxiety around sleep is not really present at all like i don't obsess about sleep i have done all the things that i'm going to cover in this video and i do these things ahead of
(05:38) time so i don't have to think about it um but like i don't i don't allocate a lot of time towards sleep stuff in general especially a lot of mental efforts a lot of people struggle with sleeping and i understand that and i am not one of them but i think part of it is because of the 55 things i'm about to show you which i have now covered two of them now the the third point here is i like to have the belief that i can sleep anywhere right so we want to create our sleep dojo right our our our ideal scenarios where we want to sleep but we
(06:01) want to have the capacity the flexibility the adaptability to be able to sleep on a floor with nothing right and so it's balancing these two ideas of like i want to increase the likelihood of my my success or ideal outcome while also in no way needing to having to musting this thing right i'm i don't have to do this thing i prefer to do this thing all right number four this is a belief that has served me well ninety percent of the benefit that you get of being asleep is from being just in a dark room with your eyes closed and so
(06:27) the reason you might be like well i don't know if that's sciencey hold on if you've ever been tired in the middle of the day and you just close your eyes for 10 minutes or 15 minutes then you feel completely like regenerated or re-energized it's because you get a lot of benefits just from being in a dark room with your eyes closed and so i have taken that as a belief of mine because sometimes when you have this anxiety of like i have to fall asleep quickly i have to get more hours i have to count down the clock
(06:49) like all of those things decrease the likelihood you're going to sleep and so for me that's why i say i don't need a lot of sleep i just remember that's 80 20. i don't have to be superstitious about it i am the type of person that can be successful and energized and succeed even if i sleep i don't sleep at all because i have a history in the past i've known that i can do that and so it decreases my need for having to sleep which then in so doing actually allows me to sleep more number five working all day helps so so i i never really had any
(07:14) issues sleeping but i especially didn't have issues sleeping when i was starting my first businesses because i worked literally all day long and i could sleep standing up and so if you ever in these situations we are struggling i do think that just literally working harder doing more stuff doing more thought-consuming work doing more physical activity helps and so if you're not if you're not doing that stuff maybe you can take a real ego egoless look at yourself and say like can i be working harder are the things
(07:38) that i'm doing right now not engaging and that could be in your work like me whatever and in so doing is it impairing my sleep because i'm not getting enough of a spike during the day which is not creating enough of a trough at night because the actual worst case scenario of what it looks like to not sleep well is that usually you're groggy during the day and then you're groggy at night but you're never fully asleep and you're never fully awake so what you want is the highest peaks during the day and the lowest troughs at night and if you're
(08:00) not getting the high peaks you need to create the high peaks so that you can give yourself the opportunity to crash number six tracking i stopped doing it so i used to track at one of those rings or a band or whatever i've tried i've tried apps i've tried different things but what ended up happening in and i i'll tell you i haven't solved this problem for me i get i'm too competitive i'm competitive with myself and i see and every day i wanted to you know break a new sleep record but you don't hit sleep records right like but i am an
(08:25) incremental improver by nature and so whenever i saw that stuff i ended up thinking and obsessing and i would try not to move at all because i didn't want to move my phone which would [ __ ] the app up um and so i i basically threw out all the apps and i slept better as a result because the end of the day that's all that matters all right number seven don't judge yourself not good or bad as humans animals don't need perfect sleep to survive think about the amount of times the animals have to move in the middle of the night because the predator
(08:47) comes by like all of these things are ideal they're we don't have to be perfect and judging ourselves is usually the source of the vast majority of the anxiety that we have is that we say we are bad sleepers therefore i'm a bad person i i have i don't have mental health that's great blah blah blah which then you can ask the question why do i need to have great mental health right why is why does it make me a bad person right and so you can ask other questions around the threats that you're imp implying with your must have to
(09:12) statements and then finally and this is a belief that has served me while this is kind of on the border of habit but it felt better in this bucket treating weekdays and weekends as the same thing is one of the easiest and biggest things that you can do in the beginning of your kind of entrepreneurial career because you probably work on weekends anyways so they are probably your weekdays as much they're just weekdays without meetings and so you can actually just get more work done and so for me my most productive work actually happens on the
(09:35) weekends and so that's when i want to get my best sleep right and so i definitely don't want to change the way i sleep when i wake up during those times or treat them any differently okay so without further ado that is the first of the four buckets so beliefs are now covered sorry i didn't put check marks on this thing i figured you guys would care more that i just cranked this out for you those are the beliefs and that is my big disclaimer before i dive into this because people will love to say oh my god if i don't do all these 50 things
(09:59) i'm going to suck and i don't want you to do that take one or two of them take three or four of them implement them over time maybe one of these things is like oh i didn't know i could do that and awesome we'll do okay number one make the room cold and if it looks like it's small on the on the form on the sheet here it's because i have a lot of them on this list so here's nine environment hacks all right these are the things that you can do and this is the nice thing about the environment hacks you can do it once and then never
(10:19) worry about it again like i love do it once and then get benefits forever this is one of these things so make sure that you have good ventilation if you haven't fixed your ac unit and it's not strong enough if you haven't fixed the insulation in the room fix it you'll sleep better it is worth it no matter how much money you make for the life benefit you get because if you sleep better you tend i'll give you an interesting stat that i don't have in the presentation one more hour of sleep creates more happiness for the average
(10:42) american than an extra 70 000 a year okay crazy so think about that like you can try to make more money or you just sleep a little bit more right or a little bit better so number one make the room cold typical is 68 to 72. we sleep at 67. i like it cold i run hot and i tend to have like a sheet on and layla has like two blankets all right so make sure that the room is cold enough for you if it's not it's just miserable number two have a house plant in the sleeping room everyone needs a friend right something
(11:10) alive is nice now i'll tell you at the very end of this little nine part section all the things that i do i do number one i don't do number two and i'll explain at the end in a second but number three get rid of all the lights in the room aside from the overhead lights obviously so don't do the charging stuff leds anything of that nature not even your phone in the sleeping room all right so get out the screens tvs computer get it out of the room all right keep your phone in another room if you can it will keep
(11:30) your anxiety levels also a tad bit lower because all of your anxiety comes from your phone so if you can get it out of the room getting out of the sleeping area will help you from a headspace perspective okay number four get blackout curtains or eye mask or better yet do both and you want to be able to like it should be able to be pitch black in the room in the middle of the day like that's how isolated is like just having curtains isn't good enough because there's the things on the sides and i'm telling you i know this sounds
(11:52) minor but like the depth of your like these are all you do this one time and you just get better sleep forever so like to me one-time fix for long-term benefit worth it all right number five and you know what as a side note a lot of people don't do this stuff in their businesses either it's like if you can if you can front load the work and then just get enduring compounding returns on on the back end why not do it okay so number five get a weighted blanket anecdotal evidence suggest ten percent of your body weight so if your 200
(12:15) pounds get a 20 pound blanket makes sense there's actually a ton of research that supports this which is pretty cool it's rare that like new stuff actually comes out that's useful way to blankets pretty cool number six get a nice mattress all right i can give you the stats you know the mattress salesman pitch but basically you're spending eight hours of your day right in bed it's like a third of your day it's like we spend millions of dollars on a house and we spend like a grand on a mattress like come on it's just like it you don't
(12:37) even spend that much time in your car like think about it i i agree with the pitch and i think it makes complete sense like there's not many expenditures that will increase the quality of your life and your productivity so much as just getting a mattress that isn't shitty number seven this is a great one this is actually one that i started we started doing like six six or seven years ago and it's just been really great and i used to make fun of layla for it but now i actually really like it having a white noise
(12:59) machine or a white noise app on your phone there's a zillion free ones or getting used to ear plugs if you're used to that because we right now like where i'm at right now we're on the strip so like i have plenty of noise and light around me so we have blackout curtains and we've got your earplugs if we need them which i only really have to do on like big concert nights because a white noise machine covers all that and so like if you and you and your partner you make noise or you have have all the little creaks and things that
(13:22) wake you up in the middle of the night all of that goes away with a white noise machine so like for me this is one of those things like if you get used to the beginning because i didn't have it lailey used to sleep with one and i didn't and i started sleeping together and so i had to get used to sleeping with white noise but now that we do have it it's actually awesome because when you go to hotels when you're in different areas and you have this thing that you can't control from an environmental perspective just having
(13:40) white noise just blocks everything out which is great all right you can even have a fan and point it against the wall doesn't really matter eight um i have an orthotic pillow so uh for me i have like terrible neck [ __ ] and so i sleep with an orthotic glow like wraps around my back like a u it's like a 200 pillow i'll see if i can put links in the in the description from some of the stuff that i reference but anyways getting a good pillow is important so like try them out and like here's here's a fun one buy five if you're like i'm gonna
(14:05) spend five i'm gonna buy five pillows yes buy five pillows figure out the one you like the most and then toss the rest and you're like what waste yes life is short sleep on a good pillow all right number nine sleeping buddies consider separate rooms i know this is crazy and and absolutely against common common whatever um layla and i actually didn't sleep in the same bedroom for like a year and a half and it and believe it or not you can still have sex if you don't sleep in the same bed the same way you did before you were
(14:31) married when you didn't sleep in the same bed i know crazy and so uh you'll also probably like each other more if you're both sleeping a little bit better but i actually used to have terrible terrible terrible breathing i still kind of do which is why i wear these patches we'll cover in a second and so we did that for a while i got my my sleep thing fixed and this is one of those trade-offs where like technically we should continue to sleep in separate bedrooms but life-wise layla prefers me to be a better and so that is what we do
(14:53) all right so these are all like i said these are not half twos these are like would be nice if you can do it as a one-time fix all right so those are the nine environmental hacks now you might be like well what do i take from this i do all the stuff i just mentioned except i don't have any plants because i don't like life i want death to stare me in the face every night before i go to bed i just haven't gotten around to it but there's plenty of research to suggest that's a good thing i don't do the way to blanket right now i think it's
(15:16) because we we moved and i just didn't take the blanket with me when i slept in my own bed i had a weighted blanket it's just been kind of annoying with layla because then it's like it's just kind of a pain and i need a heavier one than she does and so like logistically for me it was a pain so that's why i don't do it but i do it is beneficial and it does help i think it also makes you move less because it's just heavy and so it kind of keeps you more still which i think is helpful as well uh we don't sleep in
(15:38) separate beds because post neurosurgery like i mentioned and i do have my phone in the room all right but i don't have all the other lights i do all the blackout stuff all the cold stuff all the other things i just said we do i do have my phone in the room though but there are no like alarm clock lights or anything else and my phone is down against the thing and i probably shouldn't do it but i haven't had an issue sleeping so that goes to show you that you can just get half the [ __ ] right and still be fine okay so
(16:00) beliefs and environment check check one two going to number three which is intake this one will be fun these are all the things you get to do to your body and imbibe yourself all right number one if you have supplements and things like that that you want to take put it next to your bed or buy your toothbrush it's the easiest way that i have found to not have to forget this stuff because i am inherently i tend to be a forgetful person all right all right i just don't remember things as frequently as i probably should okay so
(16:23) i use sleep multipliers product by prestige labs i probably should have a link or logo i used to own majority of the company i still continue to take the product it's exceptional if you are the type of person who tracks it take it for 30 days and look at your sleep source before and after and for everyone it's not a sedative all right you're not gonna like immediately take and just like pass out but what you will notice is that your average sleep scores on a 30-day rolling period will be better i guarantee it all right like i said i
(16:46) don't know i'm not the majority of the governor of the company so i can say that but uh it is expensive but it is 100 worth it it is so so so worth it um like what do you pay for in increase like people buy courses they buy all these things when you could spend like three bucks a day and have 20 increased output because you sleep better like to me it's not even a question okay let's get to the things that we're gonna try and help prevent from things that fragment sleep so peeing a lot of people get up in the middle of night one two
(17:10) three times to pee so here is where we can actually nip this in the butt i used to do this so like let me help number one you can take salt tabs before you go to bed all right so if you take if you have salt tabs next to your bed you can take them and i drink it with gatorade zero rather than water because there's salts in there as well and what it happens is you it constricts the amount of water you like you bloat right but the thing is is like don't worry like if you get on a cycle you'll pee it out you're not gonna look bloated all right
(17:32) but what happens is it will restrict the amount that you'll pee for a short period of time all right and so you might actually be able to make it through the night without having to pee if you take the extra salt all right that's kind of the idea i already said the gatorade water and as a side note and this is something that i've just developed over time is like i eat at the same time every day so i eat my breakfast the same time i eat lunch at the same time i eat dinner at the same time and the more you can get in that
(17:50) habit the more regular your digestion gets the more regular bowel movements get but also as a result of that you have less uh less variety which comes down to you sleep better because there's less like kind of variables that are affecting your sleep right so if you have anyone's had like crazy indigestion because you had really hot tie one night and you had it two hours later than you normally do you're not probably not gonna sleep as well and that's just like is this tie really worth that i don't know maybe it is
(18:12) maybe it's not but if it like sets you back like a day or two because you didn't sleep that well yeah to me it's not really worth the thai food all right now breathing and this one is a special section for me because i have struggled with this a ton my whole life since i was in eighth grade i couldn't read that well so there's there's there's three main things that come to breathing so i'm gonna go a little bit on tangent here because i've done a lot of work and spend a lot of money on this stuff there is your allergies so your level of
(18:32) congestion there's the the shape of your nostrils right and there's the stuff that's inside of it so you have like the shape of your nostrils if you have things that are impeding it and then you have congestion all right so those are kind of like the three variables and so if you have i'm forgetting the the name they're the things that they're like these globules i can't remember the name inside um of your of your of your of your sinus and your and your nasal cavity if you can get those removed surgically but you can it'll improve
(18:57) your breathing i don't know why this got got all zoomy let's see if we can get back here we go and the easiest thing like besides doing the surgeries and whatnot that you can do is i'm going to cover in this little breathing thing okay nose strips number one absolute lifesaver they're awesome you can look on amazon go grab whatever i'll have the links the ones that i use like the reason i wear these is because i sleep in them and i continue to breathe great in them and that's why i do it and when i couldn't breathe at all this is the
(19:18) only way i could sleep and when i after the surgery i went from being able to sleep okay and fine-ish without them and now i just sleep even better with it now i'll give you a hack that i don't have listed here that if you don't have these or like let's say you go out and you travel and you forgot them or whatever i'm telling like i've been doing this for years so if you fall asleep you can fall asleep on your hand like this and so what happens is like you don't have to you're not actively pulling something but your
(19:42) thumb is always going to be straight right and so if you fall asleep like this it actually will keep one of your nostrils open like that's how i had to sleep for like 10 years before i found out about these strips all right highly recommend next thing creams and sprays so like there are there are nasal sprays i think uh salt sprays work i don't like doing any kind of drugs and medication stuff because i don't like to be dependent on anything but if you have those things put those beside your bed like i said solid sprays work well and i
(20:04) actually put cream on my face when i remember to so that hopefully i don't look old and gray in a year peppermint oil stuff uh i think i just put it on top of my mustache if you put it too close inside the rim it starts to burn so i just put it like right on my on my stash or my upper lip and that seems to work okay for me and i only use that now in like extreme situations i don't normally and then neti pots for people who um like that thing uh work well for people from a breathing perspective but for me the big one is
(20:32) the nasal strips and how i sleep for breathing okay now those are the things you can start doing but you're like man alex it sounds like a lot of stuff to start doing well let me tell you things you can stop doing number one and this is a huge one especially with entrepreneurs we love the stims i get it but try and cut it after 10 a.
(20:47) m so like sorry like don't don't drink them after 10. uh it will affect your sleep people like oh i can drink a zillion things of caffeine you pass right out it means that you are completely like it means that you're not receptive to them anymore which means you're like not getting the adrenal boost that you want from it and you have become sensitized to it because you have such rolling amounts of caffeine in your system at all times that you never even get it out all right so you have to you have to you have to pull the plug on this because
(21:09) the half-life of caffeine is six hours half-life so let's say you take a gram of caffeine that's a thousand milligrams it's a lot of caffeine six hours later you have 500 that's still a lot of caffeine six hours later you have 250. still a lot of caffeine that's two coffee cups six hours later right you have 120 which is one cup of coffee but now we've already done half life six six six it so there's four sixes it's 24 hours we already covered a day and you still have a cup of coffee in your system so you have to think about the
(21:33) half-life of the thing that you're drinking so if you drink a cup of coffee in the morning 12 hours later it'll be it'll be at a quarter of what you were so if you had 120 if you have 30 milligrams of caffeine still in your system all right 12 hours later and if you're sleeping 18 hours later which you should be right i should using loosely here for ideal sleep scenarios that means that you're now at 15 milligrams which for most people would be okay and so that's why how much you take throughout the day even the timing thing
(21:57) like if you take a gram in the morning it will affect your sleep at night because the half-life is still like taking 500 milligrams six hours later think about this when you're when you're when you're thinking about stimulants all together if you're if you're one of those people's trouble sleeping i would say i would suggest trying not to do it and suffer for the five days and then restart you know re-kick start your sleeping habits all right number two have your last meal two hours before bed i cover this with a peeing thing but
(22:20) like just don't if you eat right before bed you'll usually have to do some more bowel stuff or pee or whatever and it also can affect your digestion it can increase your body temperature all those things if you do it right before bed number three stop drinking out within four hours of bed so ideally if you're gonna drink do do it as a day party rather than going late into the night and as a side note you actually end up being more hungover from the fact that you [ __ ] up your sleep more than the alcohol anyways but as a side note
(22:43) there's tons of stuff on alcohol you probably already know that but just as a reminder and then stop drinking liquids throughout before going to bed right uh like if you do that then you can ideally you front load all your drinking in the morning so when you wake up drink a bunch of water and then that way you drink less over the day and you pee more so your balance between drinking and peeing drink a lot more than you pee in the beginning of the day and then you drink less and less and less and pee throughout the end of the day so that
(23:06) overnight you wake up and then you're really thirsty and then you do it again right you don't want us to flip that habit where you drink a ton right before you go to bed and then you're peeing all while you're trying to sleep and then you wake up and then you don't drink right so just flip the flip the cycle the nice thing is you start once you start doing this once it's very easy to stick with because your body will just do it naturally number five avoid medicines that delay or disrupt your sleep all right so um a lot of these
(23:24) different things can disruptively patterns so like that's why i don't like taking antihistamine things or things i just don't like taking meds in general on a regular basis before bed this is not medical advice i'm not a medical doctor all the stuff you already know i'm saying these are things that have worked well for me and i try not to become dependent on anything my two cents i do everything that i just mentioned except i only have the mentor for extreme circumstances and i don't use a nutty pot because i hate it and it
(23:47) burns my nose and i'm a [ __ ] about it okay that's that go so beliefs environment intake check check check number four is the habits all right so there are 13 habits that we're going to cover and let's rock and roll with them so number one i should have made these as step-wise but i guess i left this whole list out um a.
(24:06) m sleep at least 20 minutes preferably 30 minutes get an hour of total sunlight during the day if you can and i think this is great for a work break thing like after you eat lunch go walk right it's an easy thing to do go walk and talk take phone calls whatever it works take a short mark before bed i like this from i usually walk after i eat so just fyi after lunch and after i dinner i walk and that's kind of my jam and so that's an easy way to implement this from a workout perspective don't work out two hours before you go to bed
(24:30) because your body temperature stays elevated for up to two hours so don't do that or you will mess up your sleep screen's off this is just a general reminder yet again from a habit perspective all right two hours before bed now i'll tell you the stuff that i do versus don't do in these habits but these are the things that generally i have collected over my years as things that have helped me sleep better so i could make more dollars number five go to bed between nine and eleven set an alarm so here's a common one that people
(24:52) don't do is that people love to have wake up alarms but they don't have to go to bed alarms you should have a go to bed alarm and not go a wake up alarm if you have the right go to bed alarm you will wake up naturally at the time that you should wake up i know crazy and so if you need more sleep you'll sleep more and i mean less sleep you sleep less right beautiful thing about the body all right and as a side note with napping and i'm a fan i am somebody who likes to nap it's fine try not to nap after two o'clock and try not to nap for longer
(25:15) than 30 minutes because all my stuff up so for me i set my timer at 20 and i know that i go into the the thing with the mindset that if i don't fall asleep at all and i have my eyes closed in a dark room for for 20 minutes i get 90 of the benefits without even having to go to sleep which actually ends up decreasing my anxiety around the sleeping overall and then i end up actually falling asleep in like five seconds the next seven and i probably should have gotten the numbers to start at eight but so be it if you can
(25:37) sleeping on your back is much better uh from uh from like uh not messing up your shoulders and stuff especially if you're a bigger guy it's like side and back are better than than front because you're all like splayed out so like i said i try and use my hand to keep my nose open if we're just talking about sleeping positions and then slide the face off the side of the pillow so you can tilt your pillow so it like smashes your face like this and you can breathe better sleeping naked for comfort and temperature that should be
(26:00) soft it also helps with number three which is only sleep insects in the sleeping room eat in the eating rooms work in the working rooms ideally you can separate the types of activities that you're doing in the room because you will carry over the anxiety of the activities that you do in that room they will anchor the room for you now you're like what if i go in a hotel and i work and i sleep in a [ __ ] and i eat all in the same hotel room short term long term 80 20.
(26:21) if you're doing it for the short term it happens it's okay don't worry about it but like long term if we're gonna make a habit so that we can increase our overall effectiveness then it's worth doing all right or or delineating excuse me if you can have an orgasm before bed sleeping naked helps doing that too and it does improve your quality of sleep which is great which for so have a partner with you right go orgasm together play with friend all right number five taking a hot shower or bath before bed decreases internal body temperature when you get out of it
(26:47) you'll fall asleep faster because the decrease in core temperature induces sleep makes sense right cool meditate for a few minutes i don't do this i'm going to cover all the stuff that i do in a second but for some people they like it a lot so do it and try and unwind before you sleep like if you got something you can do if you read a book whatever i don't think that working all the way until the moment you sleep is good for me personally i pretty much stop working after dinner so i work until dinner and then that's after i eat
(27:09) i'm pretty much done so just people ask me all the time so that's the answer all right and so um everything that i just said i do except for the screens off thing i'm not perfect and i don't do the hot shower before bed or the meditation either and that is uh because i haven't had any issues with sleeping but if you are one of these people like do more of that stuff and then you can start removing the things that are like have the lower input for you right bottom line if you're an entrepreneur and you're trying to make
(27:35) more dollars and you want to have lower emotional reactivity when you have a higher quality of decisions higher intelligence higher ability to learn less more adaptability in general sleeping is important the beliefs that i shared at the beginning are the things that have served me well these environmental traits the intake differences in the habits that i mentioned are the things that have served me well and i wanted to put them all in one video so that i would never have to answer the question again besides saying watch this video this
(27:58) covers everything that i know about sleeping that i do in my real life for everyone else go to sleep or watch the next video and like i said mozy nation love you guys and i'll see you soon bye

Transcript:
(00:00) if you had advice that you could give 40 year old Dave would you tell him hey guys on this episode that for Moses I'm gonna be flying down to Nashville to record a full podcast with Dave Ramsey I'm going to be breaking down a viral clip we posted that went crazy everywhere we're gonna be doing a full workout together and we'll wrap it up with a photo shoot enjoy what flavor is that no idea you never know could be a secret there's no chocolate chips problem with white chocolate not for me travel interrupts my productivity more than Layla's for me
(00:37) like having my stuff and my setup I tend to be more effective when I'm at home and so it feels like a bigger cost for me so I try and do it as little as I can going out to see Dave was something that like I've always been a big fan of his stuff and so it made a ton of sense for me to take a day to fly out see him to everyone who doesn't fly private I will give you a little bit of insight and it's not always as cracked up as you might think because the Wi-Fi is slow as [ __ ] yeah we're cheap private jet Flyers
(01:03) we have limits I just like can't yeah faster and they just pay obscene amounts for the plane and like it's just like I don't want to pay triple the price just to have like a nice plane like for us the big thing speed that's what we like about it I'm still not loaded waste the [ __ ] time all right make some goddamn content what [Music] I want to hear about Solomon's Paradox yeah it's almost an ancient King in the Bible that he was considered one of the wisest men of all time it's his particular Paradox because he made lots
(01:36) of bad decisions repeatedly had uncontrolled passion for money and women and neglected to instruct his only son who went on to ruin his kingdom people give significantly better advice about their own scenarios if they don't know it's about themselves if you only just filed your own advice it'd be way better than you currently are a practice that I started doing which is I have a coaching session with myself weird I have a conversation with my future self who's 85 and I asked him for advice on what I should do now and so 85 year old me
(02:02) explains to me what I already know in my deep self but my emotional self that's you know running the ship forgets but instead of like meditating to myself I actually write it down actually like the judicism we'll wait for the Wi-Fi Solomon projects my line and then their line and then my line again as I'm going through it so it's like I'm like chatting but I'm filling out both sides of the chat but I'm putting different hats on that's like me talking to me like I deal with this [ __ ] too I talk about thinking long and being patient
(02:35) it's because every day I'm impatient it's fun I'm like why is this happening faster like this should have happened two quarters ago like the same things that you guys feel as entrepreneurs like I feel them too oh wow I don't know that's like I'm bigger like what can I control what can I not control I hope that there was going to be Wi-Fi and there wasn't good Wi-Fi I knew I was gonna basically have three hours of my life taken from me we ended up turning it into a recording session which ended up doing really well
(03:06) from the stuff that we recorded in that time period so it ended up being a net positive that I didn't have Wi-Fi if I had had Wi-Fi the Avante moment might not have ever been captured so you wanna hear about Avante Layla and I walk a lot and so we get stopped fairly frequently but this particular guy came up to me didn't say hi and immediately started telling me about his life and he didn't take a breath he was like shaking he's like dude he's like I'm just so sick of being poor man he's like I've got a one-year-old I'm working two jobs she's
(03:31) like so I just I don't know how to get ahead this is a video I'm making for Avante the young man who was working two jobs with a one-year-old who's struggling and said he was sick and tired of being poor and didn't know how to get out there are far more people who are struggling than there are people who are succeeding and so having content that speaks tactically to what to do when you're in that situation appeals to a much broader audience it wasn't surprising me that it got the response that it did but I'm happy that I think
(03:57) it served a lot more people than just Devonte all right where's the right button here it's like six buttons here someone definitely has hit that button I think a lot of people beat up on Dave because of his stances on debt I live a hundred percent debt free but also his argument succinctly put is that introduces risk risk when compounded over a lifetime is bound to come due if you plan on playing the game for a very long time you're betting on the fact that you're never gonna have a bad season and that's a hard bet to make
(04:34) have fun thanks wish me luck if your plan requires luck to succeed it's a bad plan people travel all over the country come here just say you know their debt-free that's what worked it out so I think you're going to be right here today's uh oh good that's my good side yeah this is usually my better side but uh thank you for having me honored to have you sir you did a podcast with graham Stefan and he showed you his Investment Portfolio you said something to him that massively changed the direction of how we invested
(05:14) just so you know rich people always enamored me like I thought they had some kind of special sauce or something there aren't any secrets I find something that they like and that they understand and that they're good at and they do it a lot your giftings are much more in the real estate world than they are in analyzing stocks if we were going to put a portfolio together of your knowledge base it would be 80 real estate 20 stocks maybe probably it's okay if your portfolio is real estate heavy the reason that that little piece of advice
(05:40) that you gave to Graham was so meaningful for me was because everybody told me what they did and what had worked for them I talked to probably every guy that I know was who was richer than me and was like what should I do with all this and the answers that I got were as different as there are people under the sun yup left me more confused than anything when I looked at that pie and thought okay well what's my knowledge base it's all business I showed that clip to Layla my wife and I was like I think this is what we should
(06:01) do I think we should just stick to business and just buy businesses and grow them that's what we did with acquisition.com put money in stuff you understand and you love don't put money in stuff because it sounds fancy I'll bring us home because I had a and I could talk to you all day if you had advice that you could give 40 year old Dave would you tell him you know now that you didn't know that play incremental long ball don't look for the home run I keep waiting for somebody to call me and for this to get easy one phone call and it's all over oh
(06:33) now I don't have to think about it anymore someone else is going to do it for me it's all automatic now we're gonna be automatics never gonna be easy it's a hustle and grind it's a claw you're going to make a bazillion mistakes make mistakes that are experiments that you survive you put out a hypothesis you survive the experiment to live another day to have another experiment put out another hypothesis another product that fails another idea that fails our failures at Ramsey are in number and in money are way greater than
(06:56) our successes the only thing is we survive them a we didn't have debt and B we never bet the farm on one horse and so we're not looking for the singular home run we're looking to survive and fight another day and keep iterating the accumulated value of those iterations are what we call the gleaming mountain of success which turns out as a pile of garbage and mistakes that you're just standing on rather than laying under it I didn't understand brand I didn't get it like with Jumanji was just all quantitative like it was all clicks
(07:24) conversions like that was all I kind of cared about going to the content world was kind of an experiment I'd done Affiliates I've done referral programs I've done paid ads I've done cold outbound but I'd never done content I'd never made it and then in making content you learn about brand I'm not saying I understand brand but I know more than I did it feels like once you start doing that you realize that what you were doing all before was wrong what's going on dudes I always like thinking like let me see if I can
(07:50) download any lessons if someone's making more money than me there's always something to learn I would say having a conversation with with Dave like it's just showing up he does three hours a day every single day for 30 plus years three hours a day I've shown up and making content he's 62. once you have the right strategy it's volume like you just need to do more but I think just seeing that level of consistency over 30 years like I'm grateful that I passed my 10-year Mark but I'm I'm excited for what the next 20 looks like that's very
(08:16) cool by like and talking or presenting I think I burn more calories your brain is 25 of your calorie tank and it consumes like most of your sugar but Coca-Cola will kill you except Warren Buffett still murdering it freaking regular Cherry Pope unlike Two by The World of Coke and keep it company wait for it wait for it and we're not dead one more flight in the books of not dying is it Saturday oh good I gotta get a good pump on before I go foreign good all right so we're gonna do I'll be a super set of calves and hamstrings
(09:14) with Blum owner of Raw Fitness I will train way harder if I'm training with a training partner I'll train longer I'll do more reps I'll do more sets just someone else holding me accountable and one of the nice things if you ever get the opportunity is to train with someone stronger than you just like you have limiting beliefs in business you also have limiting beliefs in in lifting and so when you see someone warm up with your one rep max it really shifts the way you see the weight gotta start with calves start with the most important body part
(09:39) Cavs were actually my weakest body part for a very long time and I actually had a girlfriend say why don't you train your calves and I've been training them for like three years so Blum and I have known each other for 11 years 12 years Palomas was the gym owner who had a gym I did not have a gym you lived in one yeah I would just basically harass everyone have them let me just come around a little clipboard and just take notes on everything they were doing I'm like Alex is the same Alex he would always be there asking questions that I
(10:10) had no answers to What's your turn what's your this and I'm like I don't know I'm 29 years old and I run a gym I don't know what you're even talking about I'm like what's your onboarding process he's like they sign up and then they work foreign [Music] about your legs apart then I'll do your shoulders and then I'll do back hard don't do arms science so I try in full body every day because I want to grow everything every day and I also have a irregular schedule so I don't want to be like Mondays back day Wednesday's leg day you know Friday
(11:08) shoulder tricep bicep and then like I missed two Fridays in a row and I haven't trained shoulders bicep tricep in like three weeks so I train everything every day bodybuilding and business are actually really similar in that you will have uneven inputs to create an even output because perfect business would have amazing marketing amazing sales amazing product amazing customer success but the individual might be like I'm really good at marketing and that's all I do and that's fine but the business needs to be
(11:30) balanced and so I kind of think of the exercises in the same way of like I'm only going to select exercises and I'm going to order them and do the most volume on the ones that I need to work on the most so that my physique overall is more balanced you know I think splitting your muscles typical brochure you're doing the gym if you just prepare biceps all right so that was our workout [Music] so we are heading to a photo shoot main reason if you've ever seen any of my other random images that have been taken the reason I'm not wearing a hat is
(12:01) because when we took the photo shoot last time we were in transition on the logos and I didn't want to take a bunch of pictures of the old logo hat now we'll have photos once again with the right logo and the hat and the uh the logo beater and the logo beater essential detail cookies ordered some cookies is that there's no one skips dessert on the table Yeah nowhere whatever fireable effects oh it's honestly yeah we saw you take the Brownie and slide it into the trash can after you've done your lunch didn't take the extra bite uh
(12:32) what's the deal here I'm not accusing I just won't understand why you never know when you're gonna need one sugar a little sugar well uh oh he's up I haven't washed my head since the gym it's good for your immune system people will do is we'll run through all the different facial expressions that we use for the thumbnails all the different flannels so we'll just bash those out [Music] I know a lot of you guys are like man you know what made me really like Rosie better that's completely crushed [Music] it's a bit of a girl post
(13:24) oh Fortress White you want to listen to feedback from the audience but you don't want the feedback from the audience to change your brand because Brand's your is your identity it's your reputation what makes you you and if you get funneled into like the algo hole of looking like exactly every other person who funnels for the algorithm then you lose the uniqueness of what makes you you and then you get the views but then the moment that your type of content no longer is in Vogue and something else is like your entire
(13:56) brand disappears overnight I missed the others from Garrix I think it was really good you are your own Niche everyone has multiple facets they just don't express them like I like eating dessert I also look kind of Jack I also am into business I also work with my wife it's just like people who [ __ ] with any of those things and [ __ ] with my stuff but if it was like challenges are really important that's all we should make yeah then I would be catering to something that's not me don't let me get too far [Music]

Charlie Munger Changed My Life [8 Lessons] - YouTube
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NLqtk4F4oY

Transcript:
(00:00) Charlie Munger was one of my greatest heroes and he just recently passed away at the age of 99 uh month and a half away from turning a [Music] 100 he lived one of the most exceptional lives both in his personal success but I would say more so in how much he was willing to give back to others to help others along the way and he embodied all of the traits that he espoused in the many speeches and talks and shareholder meetings that he had over his 99y year career and I want to share some of my personal biggest takeaways from having
(00:41) Charlie Munger as a hero that don't even come close to the many gems of wisdom he shared but are some of the ones that I use on a regular basis so right off the bat the first and biggest one is his process of inverted thinking now he purportedly claims that he's not the first person to say this Einstein always said invert always invert and so Charlie wood was a huge history buff and loved living in the past and reading autobiographies of the smartest people who had ever walked the Earth and a lot of his thinking processes were
(01:10) formulated from seeing how those people thought and he passed it along to people like you and me and inverted thinking is simply taking a very hard problem so if you said hey I want to grow my business trying to grow a business is in some ways more complex and difficult than saying if I were to destroy my business in as few moves as possible what would I do and so then thinking well if I wanted to absolutely destroy my business I would do this first and then I would do this second and then I would do this third and then I would do this fourth
(01:38) and you create that list and all of a sudden what's interesting about it is that we have such a stronger ability to find threats and negatives in our environment then we do positives and so it's like if I were to ask you hey tell me 10 things you're grateful for you might be like um well I right now if I said tell me 10 things tell me about 10 problems you have in your life you could probably rattle off a 100 without breaking a sweat it's because we we're way more wired to find threats in the environment than find good things now
(02:05) using that engine we apply it to a business or personal setting or any complex problem and say okay I'm going to find all the ways I'm going to destroy my business and then you invert it and so if for me to destroy my business I would make sure that I would never let anyone know about my stuff okay well then what would I do to invert that I would let as many people as human possible know about my stuff if I wanted to destroy my business I would make sure that we had uh terrible product so that anybody who bought it would immediately
(02:31) think it was awful and tell all their friends that it sucked and leave bad reviews okay so what's the opposite of that I want to have something that's exceptional that as soon as people get it they love it they tell the friends how great it is and then they leave positive reviews right and you can go down the list and start thinking okay if I wanted this negative thing to happen what would I do you say that and then you invert it and for whatever reason you get completely different answers than you would trying to think of it in
(02:53) the positive and I have done this Einstein did it Munger did it they're way more successful than I am in many ways and so it is a process that I've used in so many different parts of my life Charlie said the the death of most people is liquor is the Three L's liquor leverage and ladies uh so and so I'm not saying uh you avoid liquor ladies and leverage but to some degree that's pretty much what they did uh they never took on excessive debt beyond what they could very reasonably cover they uh they didn't fander uh like
(03:22) obviously Warren had two wives he had his own setup but they weren't running through many many women um and Charlie was pretty adamant about this he said I've never seen somebody whose life was better by including drugs and alcohol on them next thing I got from Charlie is his absolute obsession with Simplicity and his abhorrence of complexity and things that seem too complicated Charlie's most common response to Deals was too hard and I think that that shows so much humility in how he'd approach he's one of the greatest investors of
(03:52) all time and still the majority of deals that came in and he was brilliant he would just say too hard and so to me it's not like obviously he could think about it harder and figure it out or he probably did already know what it was but it just showed his absolute commitment to Simplicity and I think Warren was uh quoted by saying we want to have businesses that are so wonderful that an idiot could run it and then have wonderful people run it instead and I think about that a lot with the businesses that we want to invest in and
(04:21) even the business models that we choose to pursue because often times you have strategic decisions you need to make in your business you're like okay well there's this slightly more complicated thing or this simple thing which one should I do well often times if it's simpler at scale it becomes complex and complexity at scale becomes impossible and so he takes the path of leas resistance when it comes to some of these decisions and so I guess Charlie gave me a lot of permission to just say too tough too hard for me and I think a
(04:48) lot of times letting yourself off saving all that mental energy of trying to make an impossible or complex task work rather than just saying I'm I'm opting out I'm going to I'm going to follow the easier path because at the end of the day we're the ones who choose how hard we want our lives to be and so he's like yeah well if it's my choice then I just choose the easy life if a hard way to make money easy way to make money and you could choose either one then why would you not choose the easy one the next thing I learned from a concept that
(05:09) I remember as unique expensive sticky air managed by an owner and so basically that was their breakdown of the perfect business so unique in that it has a brand or something unique about it that makes it difficult for other people to copy this is when they talk about a competitive mode and so brand being one of the most obvious ones that you can use unique expensive so expensive and air actually are paired together which is you want something that you can buy for a penny and sell for a dollar not buy for 90 cents and sell for a dollar
(05:37) right you want to have a lot of margin in whatever it is that you sell so that you can make more gross profit so that you can reinvest in the business Andor take distributions as an owner so the sticky part is getting something that people will buy again and again and again and again and so that's both recurring and also reoccurring and so if you look at their portfolio they have recurring businesses like insurance but they also have reoccurring businesses like Coca-Cola so you probably have bought Coca-Cola products knowingly or
(06:03) unknowingly and you probably have never thought that you're on a Coca-Cola subscription but every time you buy a power raid or you get a Sprite or you go to the gas station you grab a drink or you go to a restaurant and you ask for a Diet Coke when you're there all of those even though they are reoccurring to you they are recurring to the parent company because that restaurant or that gas station regularly buys the same amount of coke even though you're not the one who's quote on the subscription and the further up the distribution chain you go
(06:29) the more reliable those purchases become and so they both wanted unique things that no one else could copy that you could charge a lot of money for that don't cost a lot and so the air piece is also low capital expenditure like you don't have to keep pouring money back into the business in order to keep it competitive sticky is that you want people to love the product such that they want to keep buying it again and again and so those are the actual economics of the business the second part of the business was who's running
(06:52) it right they said they want a business that's so wonderful that an idiot couldn't ruin it and then hire a wonderful person to run it and so when they talk talk about wonderful people they' I've pieced these pieces together from the the talks that both of them have given but it's that they want someone who acts like an owner they want them to behave as though 100% of their net worth is in the business that they're invested in and they cannot sell a stock ever and so when you get someone to think in that in that way then you
(07:17) get someone who was going to make ultimately very long-term decisions that's the only thing they're actually indexing for by setting the incentives in that way you have to imagine all of your net worth is in the one stock that you're running of the company and you can never sell it now what do you do is decision- making and that's the right decision for the business and so I think one of the other things that Charlie's been so good at is he just knows what enough is enough he said I don't need the last dollar and I'm roughly
(07:39) paraphrasing there but basically he believed that deals should are either good and obvious or bad and obvious he said you shouldn't need an Excel sheet to figure out if you're going to make money it should be clear that you're going to make money on the deal and so he didn't need to Big borrow and steal and negotiate and chisel away the other person's slice of the pie to get a few more percentage points he said either I'm going to make a lot of money or I'm not and so he was willing to leave meat on the bone uh or some room for other
(08:06) people at the table so that one other people could make money but I think the long-term thing is that those people would want to do deals with him again because imagine if you have if you're always known as a super tough negotiator that doesn't leave anything for anybody else it's like you might get that one deal but no one's going to call you first you're always going to be called as a last resort rather than the first person they call and the amount of benefit you get from being everyone's first call rather than their last call
(08:27) probably can't be accounted for for entire lifetime compounded with that kind of reputation so another one this is a big one that I learned from Charlie was actually the importance of brand and so if you look at their most recent and if you think about them as investors in my opinion they only got better because your discernment as a decision maker just only improves with time as long as your mental faculties are there and Charlie has shown I mean till the day he died that he had all of his meal mental faculties he did the shareholder meeting
(08:51) was still just smart as a whip and there for 6 hours answering questions and and and putting people in their PL people don't seem to get that point have any idea why Charlie war and if people weren't so often wrong we wouldn't be so rich and if you look at their largest most recent investment it's been apple and so right now over half of at least the last time I checked half of Berkshire hathway is just Apple half huge why were they willing to buy a technology company when they normally didn't buy into technology overall it
(09:23) was because they saw the brand of apple as the big strategic Moe they saw that Apple could keep creating products and they had such a loyal audience of people who would just buy anything that they put out that they felt the likelihood that this company would be able to charge above average prices for average products for the extended for for the foreseeable future was high and so they were willing to bet a huge amount of money on that company and they did and they were right yet again and so seeing that the companies they buy really are
(09:55) Brands you know Ben Bridges Jewelers you look think about C's candies think about Dairy Queen you think about about Geico these are all companies that are wholly owned by Berkshire hathway and they were willing to buy those companies because they saw that they had a strategic moat and it wasn't because they had some novel business thing it was because of the brands that those companies had built and when I saw that them as investors and me as a business owner in different hats both saw the importance of brand to me was very confirming on my
(10:25) investment now in trying to build the brand that I am so this is a big one uh Charlie talked about living within your means a lot and it's such an obvious thing but if you had all the rules of money written in order you could follow just rule number one and never need money ever again which is if you always spend less than you earn you will literally never need money you wouldn't even need your savings because you would always spend less than you earn so you would never lack for money it's rule number 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 because like
(10:58) you can't even do investing where rule number one is don't lose money rule number two is don't forget rule number one well you couldn't do that unless you spent less than you earned and so like rule zero is spend less than you earn and what's crazy is that so many people are trying to find Advanced and complicated trading and investing tactics when they haven't even mastered balancing their budget and so he had such such an emphasis on doing the fundamentals that I think just his his repeated emphasis of that and just now paired with my own
(11:31) experience having grown relatively large companies I mean over the last three years we've added 100 million in Revenue organically from the companies we have in the portfolio so I feel relatively confident talking about it um we don't do anything complicated ever all we do is continually try and simplify the business and do the fundamentals everywhere all the time that's it because doing the fundamentals everywhere all the time is already as complicated as you can imagine doing anything beyond that doesn't even happen
(12:03) in reality and so if you do the fundamentals everywhere all the time you become an advanced business owner yeah I mean Warren and and and Charlie both talk about learning from the mistakes of others so the next point that I would say I grab from both him and Warren was learning from the mistakes of others you know they say uh a dumb person makes their own mistake and then repeats it a smart person learns from their mistakes a wise person learns from the mistakes of others and so you can live multiple lifetimes of lessons simply by allowing
(12:33) other people to share their lessons and their mistakes with you and then taking the lesson without the scar and so honestly that's why I make the I mean this channel is so that I can transfer as many of the scars rather the lessons that I got without the scars to everyone in mosy nation um but I feel like I've learned so many of those lessons from Uncle Charlie and Uncle Warren um that I've just been able to apply into a modern-day uh business environment uh just in my own life I think one of the one of the most understated things that
(13:03) I learned from Charlie was that despite being one of the best investors of all time I think the thing that made him one of the best isn't necessarily his financial return there are other investors who have achieved higher returns than he and waren have now obviously from absolute returns because they've been doing it for so long uh they have one of the biggest portfolios of all time but Charlie's net worth was only a few billion dollars and I say only as though it's not a lot of money of course it was but he could have made
(13:27) a lot more if he so chose to but he said over and over again that he never wanted to make money he just desperately wanted to be independent he said he just overshot and I think about that a lot when it comes to what things I'm optimizing for because it's so easy to get caught in the race of more of just always wanting more and never having enough and I think probably the single greatest thing that I would say I observe from Charlie was that he knew when enough was enough and that he' accomplished his objective which was to
(13:56) be free and independent and to just do whatever he wanted whenever he wanted with whomever he wanted and I think that in a lot of ways the way he lived was an ideal life he he he spent his time doing the thing that he was exceptional at with the person that he probably cared the most about in the world which is Warren his closest friend they never argued once in their entire relationship per my understanding and what better of a life could you ask for and so I think when I think about his life I see that as such a wonderful model to go after
(14:28) and and I will be eternally grateful for the contribution that he had unknowingly uh to my life

NO NEW FRIENDS (My "Extreme Views" on Friendship) - YouTube
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1taVrxMFjaY

Transcript:
(00:00) now some people have said that my Approach or view on friendships is transactional Extreme whatever and I'll say sure you're right and I don't see friendship as a binary term meaning it's not that we are friends or not friends it's how good of friends are we to Define friendship the opposite of friend would be an enemy or a rival someone who doesn't root for me they actively try and destroy my efforts they try and get me to be emotional rather than make logical decisions and they try and distract me from my ultimate goal
(00:37) and for many of you some of your friends fit that description now I understand that people are human and people make mistakes but if you want the one strike not three strike one-way ticket out of my friendship you only have to do one thing you have to not root for me meaning you actively resent either explicitly or implicitly when I win if you resent me winning why are you here like the reason they're still there is because there's a chance that your success will benefit them but while you're succeeding they'll still try and
(01:05) destroy it in case they can bring you down it's [ __ ] up but it's true so the reverse of that would be somebody who roots for you in front of you and most specifically behind your back real talk that's one of the hardest things out there especially amongst guys where it's very Alpha competitive as soon as your status starts to raise within the group You by comparison make everyone else worse so it's in their best interest to make you less of a threat to them by diminishing your status the things like talking behind your back trying to
(01:36) distract you make you emotional make you feel guilty about the things that you're doing take you away try and label you with old labels that are your old identity not aligned with the things that you want to do later and the thing is is like I don't think these are bad people to be clear I don't even think there's good or bad people anyways the question is just are they going to help me towards my long-term goal are they not if it's more likely they've earned a spot they're paying their rent for my time and attention if they're not more
(01:59) likely to help me hit my goal then for me the question is is the relationship more important than my goal and that's a decision for you I made my goal my most important thing because I believe that if I achieve that goal I would feel better about myself my identity associated with it and I think that there would be a new level of friends who would unlock as I got to that new level and for me me up to this point that has been true I'm not trying to achieve a common life goal and so it would make sense that my views would be
(02:23) more extreme than other people's I also think that some of these views become compounded when you have increasing demands for your time if that's not real for you right now if you don't have people vying for every minute of your day right now then what I'm saying might not be relevant for you but for the people who do have people buying for every minute of their day it might make more sense there's a reason LeBron says No New Friends hey LeBron hey LeBron how are you LeBron he's decided like he doesn't need a new
(02:49) printer he doesn't trust anyone new and that's fine that works for him he has a rare life it would make sense that he has rare rules you can't really give a [ __ ] about what people say no more because everybody gonna [ __ ] critique everything that you do no matter what you do they say we're creep into your mind the biggest issue that I've had with friendships in general is that people project what they believe friendships should look like in their minds onto our relationship for me I am transactional this is gonna probably
(03:15) piss a lot of people off the pros of this relationship should outweigh the cons and if people are like I can't believe you'd say that we probably wouldn't be friends and that's okay you'll probably be friends with people who don't have that definition but for me that means that like my life is better off with you in it you helped me achieve my goal you root for me along the way if you think about everything you do as an investor you invest time and energy into a relationship with the hopes of getting some sort of positive return you spend
(03:40) that time no matter what and the people who build their best relationships the best networks are the ones who invest in relationships that yield the highest returns in terms of exchange I believe in abundant exchange which is if both of us feel like we're getting the better end of the deal then this relationship will continue ad infant item it's going to keep going you would have no reason to end it where you get into trouble is the types of relationships that you're wondering should I keep these you probably already know you shouldn't and
(04:05) I love this little framework for decision making when you're faced between a hard thing and the easy thing and you're not sure what to do you should do the hard thing because if the easy thing were the right thing to do you would have already done it one of the hardest things about pursuing your dreams and pursuing your goals is that a lot of the people that are in your life right now will not support the future version of you that you need to become in order to accomplish those goals people don't actually want the best for
(04:29) you they want the version of you that best serves them now the closer they are to you in terms of long-term alignment the more likely those two versions of you will intersect which is often why often not always why family and your spouse should hopefully be the most aligned with you because long term their best interest is often aligned with your best interest I think the spouse is like the nth degree of what the most extreme French should look like that is the best friend you have for life which means they should root for you harder than
(05:00) anyone else they should never resent your success the biggest strongest Ally you have and then the friends you have are just non-sexualized versions of that core Ally you have there's a lot of statements that friends will make to try and keep you where you're at they'll say you've changed and they'll phrase it in a way that makes it feel like you're doing something wrong by changing all you have to do is look back at them and say you're right and you haven't that carries almost an equal weight back to them because some people want to stay
(05:28) the same comma and that's okay that's been my recurring theme with friendships is just accepting them for what they are and saying that's okay things have changed good that's what growth is you can't grow and stay the same and if we want to grow as entrepreneurs then we have to expect change and I think Tupac embodies this transition in between friends really well and he said just because you lost me as a friend doesn't mean you gained me as an enemy I'm bigger than that I still want to see you eat just not at my table I don't wish
(05:55) you ill I want you to succeed and I want you to do all the things you want to do in your life it's just that your vision for your life doesn't merge with my vision for my life it's the same thing as having an ex-girlfriend or an ex-boyfriend you had a season together it doesn't mean you don't honor the season and all of a sudden start destroying the memory appreciate the fact that you had a season understand that season's by their very nature end we both contribute to another and then we found out that we wanted different
(06:18) things which is great that's the whole point of learning the thing is a lot of people have these precepts of what a friend should be we're going to be friends for life how many 85 year olds you know who are friends with the same people their whole lives not many and if they are they've got like one it's not common but it is okay in my opinion to have seasons of Friends we're friends for the season and then we had train tracks that aligned and then we found out we had train tracks that diverted comma and that's okay have you
(06:44) ever had somebody who's like I was just trying to help and that person just like made your life 10 times harder that is not help that is destruction but true help comes from someone who comes into your life and all of a sudden everything gets easier that is Health that is a friend that is somebody who's an ally let me give you a little frame shift around Burning Bridges because people love using their friends like you don't want to burn Bridges remember where you came from you can consider it burning a bridge but you could also consider it
(07:05) pruning a tree in order for the tree to grow you only have certain amount of sunlight water and minerals in the soil the healthiest thing for the tree is to prune it cut the branch off and that may seem uncomfortable for many of you but again there's the hard thing and the easy thing and if you're making the decision you already know the right thing is probably the hard one so if you encounter somebody that's not aligned with the vision of your life and it used to be your old life they want to go to clubs every night they want to drink on
(07:29) Sundays do the bar crawls and now it's coming in Conflict they're losing friends so they want to keep you there and that's okay like don't hate them for wanting that it's just that it no longer aligns anymore I think there's really two directions for these types of friendships number one is that if you decrease the frequency of communication with someone over time you get fewer and fewer invites and then it kind of Fizzles that's how most friendships or loose acquaintances end the very hand select few of times where you have family or
(07:56) like super close homies whatever you want to call it I have one framework for having really hard conversations that I stole from Layla keep the other person as a human being at the Forefront of the conversation rather than being right if I remind myself every time I go into hard conversations that way it's amazing how much better of a conversation I have and accepting responsibility for the fact that like hey I've changed and that's not on you that's on me if it means that we're not hanging out as much anymore again it doesn't mean that you
(08:23) have me as an enemy comma and that's okay I think that you can have friends who aren't necessarily pursuing greatness as long as they're helping you pursue yours that's the bridge in my opinion I like to be inspired by the people that I'm around I want to admire something in every friend that I have I have a very close friend of mine who is an FBI agent every time I talk to him he's got like new stories of things that he's doing and for me the benefit I get from the relationship is that it gives me an escape from the day-to-day business
(08:53) stuff that I'm dealing with he benefits in no way from the status from the followers because he has no way to financially benefit he's an FBI agent but what we both mutually appreciate about one another is that we've both been committed to being excellent at our craft I just want people who are as passionate about their art as I am who root for me to make the best painting possible that's what I'm really going for at the end of the day it's just like does this person make me better if they don't then why are you here

Sales Was Hard Until I Understood These 9 Concepts - YouTube
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cy2k1GdA-9o

Transcript:
(00:00) there are nine things that brilliant sales people do differently and in this video I'm going to share the stuff that I've learned building multiple nine fig sales teams scaling teams from Z to 40 guys 0 to 60 guys and personally closing over 4,000 sales myself and so if you boil it down a salesperson has three jobs to do they have to maximize the number of opportunities they have they have to convert the highest percentage of those opportunities and and this is the important part they have to do it consistently for a very long period of
(00:24) time and so the nine things they do differently will fall elegantly into each of these three buckets let's start with the first one which is Max maximizing leads or maximizing the number of opportunities that a salesman has so right off the top I've never seen a salesperson who does the most in a company have the lowest amount of hours worked I've yet to have it you know what maybe there's a special snowflake out there but every company that I've owned and every company that I've looked at the guy who works the most hours is the one who sells the most deals and so
(00:54) maximizing opportunities comes in a number of different forms so number one is that they have the total most hours available per day because you should be available when the prospect is available and that means sometimes working long hours it sometimes mean working weekends and yes businesses also pay rent on Sundays and so you can make sales on Sundays so my software company Allen scheduled 4,000 plus appointments per day across a number of different Industries and so we got to see all the way from click to close which companies were selling the most people and we
(01:22) looked at all the different data so times of day number of days per week you know speed between text responses number of characters and text respon response all of these different variables cuz I had two data analysts that looked at this to figure out how could he maximize throughput for any business and obviously sales a big component of that and the single greatest lever on throughput across all companies was the number of total available time slots which means availability was the strongest predictor of total sales and
(01:52) let me give you a tactical example of this when Leila and I were traveling the other day we went to a different city and she wanted to get her nails done or something and so she just pulled up Yelp and looked at the one that had the top reviews called them up and they said oh I'm sorry we don't do same day appointments and they're like we can book you in for two days from now and she was like yep don't care called the next one same thing called the third one and then they were like yeah we can take
(02:14) you right now and boom she went in and the thing is is that both those other business owners the first two business owners that said no lost money and the next time she comes to that place she'll probably go back to the one that she went to as long as they did a good job and so trying to be egotistical about it rather than accommodate customers it's like well so great you just lose money now if we maximize the total number of time that's available for the salesperson to sell then the next part of maximizing their
(02:40) opportunities is getting as much of their day humanly possible filled with the best opportunities and so the second subunit of this is they will pull up calls and so the first thing is if you see a call that gets booked or you book a call that's on Thursday and today's Monday if you have a time slot that's open you grab your Thursday appointment you drag it into today because today appointments always have higher show up rates and if you pull it up then they're even more interested and you can close even higher and you could have two or three calls by that same Thursday time so you increase your sales velocity now a corat to that
(03:14) is if you look at your calendar and you've reached out to a prospect and that person has not responded back and now it's the same day and they're coming up in a few hours well what do you do well the best salespeople pull that time slot and say hey sorry I didn't see that you confirmed why don't we do the same thing for tomorrow you can push it out one and then try and fill that time slot with somebody who is responsive even if they're later in the week and that increases your total number of calls per
(03:37) day and so fundamentally the perfect day for a salesperson is that they have call back to back to back to back to back with the best possible leads that are the hottest that day I learned that little tactic about pulling up because we had one of our companies uh was in solar sales and they had one rep that massively outperformed everyone else and I was like what is this guy doing and so what he was doing was he would whenever a new appointment would book he would immediately call the the appointment to qualify the lead CU that checks two boxes one is he says okay is this person qualified to buy if the person was he
(04:07) had two decision paths if they had the time right then he would just go straight into closing because he was in offthe callop and then by getting in contact with the lead became on the call in terms of his sop and if they said they had time right now he just went for the sale that maximizes his time on call if they said no then the reason for his call was that he had an opening lader that day that he was trying to fill up and so he either takes the moment now that he's working the lead and turns it into a sales call or he fills another
(04:32) slot later in the day and turns that into a sales call both of those things maximize the number of sales that guy was having and this guy was selling like four times more units than the second best guy on the team and then they obviously saw this and then adopted it companywide and then of course I saw it and adopted it across all my entire portfolio and let me double down to why that's so powerful because not only does the salesman have two opportunities to sell now or later that day he also opens up the slot later in the week for
(04:57) availability for another customer that can't make it to day to book that time then because what I have found and we saw this with the software was if you have fewer time slots people may still book with you but they're not booking at the most convenient time for them you'll see schedule rates but then show rates will drop because it's not the time that works for them ideally and so you want to make it the most accommodating so it's not just are is it convenient or inconvenient it's how convenient is it if I have a a tight deadline and a hard stop and I've got something that I'm
(05:25) stressed about afterwards I might be able to schedule a call then but I might not be in a in the mood to buy but if I say you know what Sunday afternoon I'm free I'll have all the time in my world I'm going to have zero urgency to get off the call I'll listen to you and I'll be a completely different Zone and that might be when I'm in receiving hands in terms of prospect brain mode for buying and so one of the things that the best sales people have and this is something that companies should provide
(05:51) but often don't is that you have two Sops meaning standard operating procedures you have an onthe call sop which is what you say when you're talking to prospects and you have an offthe call sop which is what you do in between the vast majority of companies don't have an off-the call sop and they're losing tons and tons of money because they just say yeah just work the leads in the meantime when the total amount of output that a salesman has is so correlated with the amount of opportunities they have and they get those opportunities by the time they have when they're not on the call and so
(06:20) they should have two separate checklists if they don't have them in front of them and this is what the best sales people do is this is what I'm doing when I'm on and this is what I'm doing when I'm off and you can just switch hats as soon as you're off you start at the top and you're like I'm following with this person I'm following with this person I'm dragging this person forward I'm canceling this appointment and they have high Activity one of the things that we do across all our companies and I learned This Acronym from my friend Chiron
(06:44) bamfam which is book a meeting from a meeting which is that the best salespeople never finish a call with a prospect not knowing when the next time they're going to talk to the prospect so that Prospect should never fall into no man's L they should never fall between the cracks where they're like I don't know and so if you get to the end of the call and they're like yeah let's uh connect offline and we'll you know we'll Circle back up and we'll find another time no you have to address it at that time because if for whatever reason like a Time obstacle is still an obstacle and
(07:09) you can resolve it right then you both have your calendars up you can both make the decision if someone's like well I'm not sure then you actually address the concern like isn't this a problem for you how much you losing every day not implementing this solution in your business how much like how much of a problem is this in your life and why isn't it this something that we'd be doing sooner right and so you want to address those things because that is these are obstacles and so if you just get off the call Jolly then you actually lose more sales so you
(07:32) always book a meeting from the meeting here's three more things that the best sales people will do number one is that they don't take rejection personally because they're going to reach out in more volume than the mediocre salespeople and so you can see on a CRM how many Outreach attempts and how many follow-up attempts that A salesperson is having between calls and it correlates with the number of calls that they take and so they work their leads harder and that's because if someone before they've
(07:58) scheduled a call you know says something mean they're not like oh my gosh I can't believe this or if someone no shows they're not like well I'm not going to work the rest of my leads no one really cares about me like wo is me is no they know it's a numbers game and they just keep plowing something that I've noticed the best salespeople do is they have something called a kill list and so those are those prospects that you're like this is a whale or this is a really good Prospect and they they sure they
(08:21) have in the CRM sure they have them in the place that they're supposed to have them but they also have it somewhere else that's visible so they can always think about it and like that's like an everyday list it's like I got to get back to these two guys I got to make sure that these ones I'm going to put extra attention to because they're high value deals now the last element of what the best sales people do for increasing their number of leads is that they create their own opportunities so sure they're going to get the inbound leads from marketing they're going to get the people you know the leads that are handed to them but the best salespeople
(08:52) know the value of referrals and so the way they do that is at the end of the call or at the time that it makes sense they say hey do you know anybody else or my favorite way of asking is who do you know because it forces the prospect to answer the question with a not yes no but with a name you say who do you know who is as awesome as you now it's a compliment who would also benefit from this so now I'm giving them a compliment by by by asking them for the referral so I kind of like have a like a nice guy sandwich there so like you're amazing who else do you know who's like you who would love to do this with you or with
(09:22) us who could benefit from XYZ right now sometimes if they say no one then sometimes like this is where Rapport is important but but you could say something like why do you hate me so much and they're like what do you mean it's like well I only can assume that you hate us because you don't want anybody else to know about this amazing thing and you probably hate your friends because you want them to suffer as well right and if it's because you don't believe me then let's talk about that but otherwise like why are we not
(09:46) getting your friends in here because I can promise you you'll be far more successful if you have more people you know who are in it so in the spirit of bamfam book a meeting from a meeting if we consider this to be a meeting if you would like us to help you more with your sales process acquisition.
(09:59) comom just started a workshop division where my sales director my team will talk to you specifically about your sales your process your scripting so we can Implement some of the things that we know work in our portfolio into your business ASAP we do other stuff at the workshop but we also talk about sales if that's at all interesting you can book your next meeting by going ais.
(10:17) com clicking the scale button and following the steps and if you're qualified my guys will reach out when I had a team in a different portfolio company we had one guy who was outperforming everyone else by a huge margin this one wasn't as big as the pullup thing that was massive this was about 50% higher than the number number two guy and we were like what is this guy doing he was brand new and that was what was interesting is like brand new going to the top leader board it's not very common because that means that they're doing a different process right
(10:42) and so he was following the script and we listened to the calls we like this is the same call and so when we called him up we said what are you doing differently and the thing is he was multiplying his leads and so what he did was at the end of the calls he was just asking who they knew who would also benefit from this thing and I think they were they were selling um some sort of uh tickets of some sort and so he was saying who else wants to come with you who else would you like to bring and it's just a simple little thing that he
(11:06) was doing but by doing that he was increasing his sales by 50% because the referrals even though only one out of three or one out of four people would refer the referral close rates like 80 or 90% And so if you think okay I take you know four calls and I close one and I ask for referrals in all all four and only one of them gives me a referral but then that referral then closes then I take my one sale out of four and turn it to two out of five if you're a business owner thinking about how valuable just implementing that is consistently is
(11:38) that your cost to acquire a customer you just you cut in half by taking one customer and getting a referral from that customer and if one out of three customers refer someone then you cut your cost to Aire customer to buy a third and this is the type of stuff is advertising becomes more expensive because it always will become more expensive that the businesses that do this the salesmen that do this will be the ones that win in the future so now we have a Salesman who has the maximum number of hours the maximum number of
(12:02) days they're pulling up appointments so that their time on call closing with the best people is maximized they're following up before they're following up after they're doing personalized reach outs and saying like hey voice memo hey video hey I've got this thing for you that I've got set up for the call um what size shirt do you want I've set aside uh thing here was one of the things we did at the gym hey what color shirt do you want hey what boxing gloves hey what you do a tiny little thing hey I've got three gift cards I got one for Amazon one for Starbucks and one for
(12:31) whatever which one would you prefer right you ask a preference question prior to the call and more people show because the thing is is you're like well shoot this guy's doing this thing the least I can do is show up and so they're maximizing the number of scheduled appointments they're maximizing the number of shows they're maximizing the number of opportunities they're getting from those opportunities and now we get to the call so now we got to close it understand the value of preparation you would be amazed at how much of a
(13:01) genius you sound like if you just do five minutes of research before a call and so my rule of thumb for research is that if it's something that you do all the time it's about 10% of the time that you're going to be on a call or meeting that you can do in prep so if you have a 2-hour call then you've got 12 minutes of prep if you've got a 60-minute call then you do six minutes of prep now this is something that if you do it all the time if this is like I'm doing a quarterly meeting then it reverses it's
(13:25) like six hours of prep for one hour of presentation if it's something that you don't do often and so sales people do the same call over and over again but the thing that's different the tiny bit of difference is the prospect they're speaking with and so like this applies to everything like if you're picking a girl up at her house if you do 5 Seconds of research in the car before you go in and you look at what her dad does and look at the company of the of the father and say hey so Mr so and so really nice
(13:49) to meet you so I see you work at you know whatever engineering like do you like that stuff I see that they just had a a presses coming out do you have any involvement in that this guy would immediately see you no matter how you're dressed what you look like is it's a it's a check they're like whoa like I will respect this person because he did me the honor of actually taking some time to look me up and figure out more about my business he didn't show up like everybody else does not knowing which way is Sunday trying to figure things out as they go I'm telling you the best salespeople take those five minutes they
(14:20) do that tiny bit of research and the amount of Rapport that you build in that first one minute from having those Secrets the person is then like oh wow they know about me think about what it takes to close someone no like and Trust well all of a sudden you feel known because they did it you like people who know more about you and what else do you do you trust people who know more about you because you approximate friendship you approximate a relationship and you do and you get to do a ton of that at
(14:51) the first second of the call rather than taking the five first minutes the call to show that you don't know what you're doing right as I started selling gym owners rather than weight loss when I was selling my turnaround business I started getting leads but I didn't have any like methodology so like I had a webinar it didn't work and so I just started finding people on Google using their emails and so I'd find their social profiles and I'd liter have to piece together like a profile of who this person was because the only thing I was collecting was an email for this webinar and so I'd find like three or
(15:20) four social profiles and then I would connect with them and I would do some research so that I could make my reach out not look sketchy as hell and so when I would do my reach out that I would have all this data that I put as almost like a little profile together um about them and so when I hopped on the phone they were like whoa like you know a lot about my gym and I was like well yeah and I saw that because I look at the images and be like so I saw your square footage layout I think if you move this here this might actually be able to
(15:45) allow you to double the amount of usable square footage that you have for the sessions and that would help me sell more people into your gym so I don't know if you're open to something like that but now I'm coming with like I see the problem I also have the solution because I thought about it before we got on the phone because I don't want to waste your time trying to figure fig things out now I want to figure them out beforehand come with you with Solutions and this is when I starting out so I didn't have a reputation yet so I had to build the reputation by showing up and
(16:08) providing more value than other people were ahead of time and this is where like if you're new and you're coming into a space you win through prep like the big guys had the reputation the small guys went through preparation the best sales people take notes this is one of those things that is just like prep but it preps you for the next next call and so you do your public preparation with what you can find and observe you do your second call preparation with what you find out on the phone and I'm telling you if you hop on the phone and say oh yeah so you've got your daughter Sarah and Jessica and
(16:43) they're at you know Colorado and they're finishing up and you've got X Y and Z happening in the business is that correct okay cool just making sure just reading over some of the past notes for got on the call they're like oh wow I don't have to resay my whole life story again this guy now when this guy makes recommendations I assume he doesn't within the context of my business because one of the big things when you are selling something is that people want to make sure that it not only that it works but it's going to work for them and so you can address that concern
(17:10) before it ever comes up by proving that your recommendations are contextual this is also what switches you from being a Salesman to a consultant this is what switches you from somebody who's just trying to close to somebody who's trying to help the most brilliant sales people listen more than they talk and this is when that people get wrong all the time is that they see super talkative people I mean moms in high school are like you should get into sales because you don't shut up uh no that's not not always the
(17:39) case that's what that's what bad salesp people look like uh and unfortunately the thing is is the best salesp people don't come off as salespeople they just close and so people don't feel sold they feel like they bought and so everybody buys stuff every day all the time and they're buying from companies that have sales people people and they don't know it so when you go to a restaurant and they ask you if you want dessert that's a sale they get commissions on those things and if they do it in a weird way
(18:08) you're like uh I don't want to be sold but if they do it in a great way you're like oh I'm so glad that person made that recommendation and so you never felt like you got sold you felt like you bought and so the problem is that the reputation of sales people is terrible because you only remember the bad ones we actually did this big study because we have a huge amount of sales calls that we can look at across the whole portfolio and we use software that analyzes the calls with AI and all that stuff we can see what's talk time versus listen time and the best salespeople listen twice as much as they talk and so
(18:33) the little isms that I have for this is that the person who's answering the questions is the one getting interrogated you don't want to be the one getting interrogated and whenever you answer questions you give the other person something to attack and so you want them to be answering so that you have things that you can pick apart and move around if you're the one answering questions then you're the one who's getting picked apart and has things that they can disagree with I want to be like smoke right they can't they can't catch any thing that I say and so if someone says you know hey well tell me tell me
(19:03) what makes you better than your competition I'd be like well what things you're looking for right back to them right it's like it's like hot potato it's like right back to you well I would want this this and this and this I'm like why are those things important to you right back to you right like I I can do this all day right like I I cannot answer because the thing is is that they believe nothing that you say they believe everything that they say and so I need them to say that it's a good idea not me when I
(19:27) started selling weight loss I realized really quickly that I had an agenda of what I wanted to tell people they needed to do and I realized that I didn't have time in 15 minutes to re-educate someone their last 10 years of life of all the experiences good and bad that they had prior to me what I needed to do in that moment was get them to buy and then I could spend the rest of my time trying to do the real education stuff and so I wanted to Simply align with where they were coming from to get them to make the sale and
(19:56) so that was why I started asking what you done before what did you like what did you not like rather than picking apart the things they did and then then like I actually really like that about that other thing lost the sale only takes a few times of doing that to be like I'm going to shut the [ __ ] up and just let them tell me what they liked and then I'll say we're like that and not like that and so the whole concept here is you want to educate the prospect so that they can come to their own conclusion and so the only gaps that you're feeling is is hard information
(20:26) and I only give that information after I already know it's the right answer and so just like lawyers don't ask questions when they're on the stand that they don't already know the answers to should never ask for the sale unless you already know they're going to buy and so there are times and this is where pattern recognition is helpful for salespeople this is what the brilliant salespeople do is that if they're like I don't think he's ready there I don't think he's ready yet and it's like you don't you don't go for the kill you just ask more questions like I feel some
(20:50) hesitation like what are your main concerns right now like I'm feeling some hesitation around price talk to me about that there's two ways by the way if you're weirded out about asking questions is is that you can both give commands or ask questions and so you can change the the Cadence up in the script by saying so instead of saying for example hey how's it going it's an easy first thing a lot of people say on the first thing of the call but if I say tell me about your day it's a very different thing because it it people
(21:15) have automatic responses to questions they hear all the time and so if you want to break a pattern with somebody and then get them more present you say tell me about your day and then like oh uh I mean it it was good I had a couple calls before this and you're like oh that's fantastic is that related to this thing cuz I looked looked you up online totally different perspective on that salesperson in the first 30 seconds right so they listen more than they talk they are like smoke you only answer questions with questions unless you already know that the statement that you're going to say is in
(21:45) alignment with what you know the person wants and so if they're like tell me why you're different then I'd be like well what have you done in the past because then it'll give me more context so I can help explain it now they're going to say all these things they be like what did you like about that what did you not like about that and so when I get to the point where I actually have to say what what are things about I'm going to highlight all the things they liked about the other stuff and I'm going to not highlight the things they didn't like about the other stuff and all of a sudden they' be like this is perfect i'
(22:08) be like what do you know I just asked you the question of the things you wanted and as long as they are the things that we can actually provide I highlighted those features about our thing because I already knew which piano keys to play because you told me they breathe the script and so the reason I use that is because that is the best description I can give is that they can they can say it without thinking just like you breathe without thinking they can say the script without thinking because you can't listen to a prospect if you're waiting to talk because you're trying to remember what you're going to
(22:39) say next you need to know all of the script like the Bible or like something that you've memorized in the past so that you can be 100% present with the Prospect and listening and so my favorite ISM around this is again and the first time I learned this was I saw an exceptional sales trainer training rep and he was just drilling them on the opening 30 seconds of the script and so they did the script and I heard and I and I was watching him listen to them while giving them visual cues and so this is this was a huge advancement in terms of my understanding of selling happened because before this I knew how to sell but I couldn't transfer the
(23:16) scill but this guy was sitting there and he was like yep yep yep pause harder on this word do it again nice do it again nice one more time nice keep going and so he would get them to drill it three times in a row the right way after making the correction and then he would keep going in the script and so the point was is that if you're a salesperson you need to be able to do it again and again and again because the word concision matters a lot you don't want to be one of these salese that takes a hundred words to say something
(23:50) you could say in five it'll also make your sales way longer so again the best salesperson can take more calls because they shorten the call required a mediocre salesperson will do the script in the beginning and it'll close and they will have coughed right before they asked for the close and then the person closes and so they get reinforcement for coughing and so the next sales call they take they add a cough in and whether that person closes or not they're like well it worked on that other one and so all of a sudden they add coughing in right before they close now the next
(24:19) time on the time that they close let's say on their fourth call after this they also added a second question in before the close so they add the second question in and then you see where this happens is that they cough and add a second question to every single call that they do and by doing this over time the length of the script and the length of the things that salespeople do continues to expand because they get positive reinforcement but the reality is that that person might have just been willing to buy no matter what and so the
(24:43) script gets longer and longer even though it might not have nothing to do with what was required to close and so you want to be as concise as assumably possible and this is what the best sales people do in order to close the most sales per day per unit of time because the less time you're on the phone after you make the sale the more time you have to fill your calendar back up and close more deals and so the three tactics this is the sales managers is that you rehearse the script every morning they
(25:08) do role plays meaning let's pretend like I'm a prospect like you got to you got to get over whatever your weirdness is with role playing like I don't know what it is but so many managers like don't want to role play like Get over yourself you have to role play in order for them to get good and when you do the role playing you work on one specific part of the script because if if you're doing it every morning you're going to be able to work through things pretty quickly but you're like today we're just going to focus on the intro today we're just
(25:34) going to focus on the close today I just want you to focus on how we're overcoming spouse overcomes I want you to overcome I have to think about it issues I want you to give me two or three bangs in a row to overcome that obstacle because you seem to be struggling with it right and so by and you just keep hitting it again and again and again so that when it comes up they just breathe it out rather than thinking about it also because no one can improve multiple things at the same time so when you say hey there's nine things you did wrong one it's incredibly discouraging second they can't improve any of them and so if you look at any good skills
(26:04) coach whether it's a basketball coach or it's a painting coach or a sales coach they work they might see you have a hundred things wrong with your game they're just going to focus on one at a time until they clean them all up and then all of a sudden you become an exceptional salesperson so I said I had nine but I have way more than nine so enjoy so here's number 10 they kill zombies up front now that's the term that we use internally you can say diffuse the bomb which is one that I did earlier in my career is what I used to say um but I'm Middle Eastern so you
(26:30) know we had to change that the formal definition that I use is you've got obstacles and you've got objections an obstacle occurs before you've mentioned the price and so if someone says for example um you know I have a special snowflake thyroid issue right and you're trying to say like you need to do this thing to lose weight you know that that's going to blow up on you in the sale see we're doing bomb references so you have to address it up front and it's much easier to address things before you ask for money than after if you do it
(26:53) after it's called an objection all right so I say obstacles are up front you want to avoid them you want to move around them right right I mean you have to crush through them realistically but you get through those and then objections you have to handle but now the the time is ticking on the bomb like now you have a short period of time before it blows up on you right uh or the zombie is about to bite you whatever analogy you want spouse for example or decision maker or I'm not going to have time to
(27:16) do this thing or there's elements of this you know program or implementation that aren't a fit for me you want to address all that stuff up front so that you've handled everything before the stakes get lifted When you mention price and then you go for the close and the obstacles and objections that you handle are always the same and so they're going to Bubble up to three main things one is going to be circumstances so circumstances is going to be time it's going to be money it's going to be things about this specific program or implementation those are all circumstance those are outside the next is going to be other people it's going
(27:47) to be my wife my employees my kid my some my business partner somebody else has decision-making Authority and the third is going to be myself somebody who themselves doubts that they can do it or that they will be successful or that it's the way they want it to be done the good news is that most of the time when you're diffusing these bombs they start with the outside because time money fit is what I like to call it are things that are really easy to cast blame to and it's and it's almost a it's a it's a
(28:16) response right it's like they don't have to think about like I don't have time I don't have the money I don't have I don't have the card I want like I don't have the you know whatever if they talk about an authority figure then it means that like I would do it but this person's in the way and so now you're one step closer to the decision maker once you handle that if you have somebody who says I need to think about it that's actually great because it means you're already two layers of the onion deeper to just like you're talking to somebody who's in power who can make
(28:40) the decision great now you just have to help help them make the decision and so you should know all of the key fundamentals of how to overcome these now you can memorize each of them which I highly recommend but I think it's also good to understand the fundamentals and so this is what the best salespeople do is that they have key stories or metaphors to break the belief that the person has around that obstacle so for example if someone says hey um I can't decide today because you know my husband and I make all of our decisions together
(29:13) right now this depends on the nature of your sale if you're in a transactional sale and I would say like a consumer based sale that's under a th000 bucks maybe 2,000 bucks usually you have to do that right there if you have like a B2B sale that's going to be a multi you know multi call sale then you might have to bring in stakeholders and so this is one of the nuances that depends on the thing you're selling in the price point but the way that the best sales people do this is that you play out something in the past and you play it out in the future okay so with a decision maker you'd say hey so let me tell you about
(29:45) this girl Susan she was just like you and um she actually had the same issue come up where she was like I don't do anything without the consent on my husband and you know what happened she walked out her husband said I don't want you to spend the money I actually saw her a few years later and when I talked to her I said hey so how's how's things going with the you know the fitness stuff she was like oh they're they're not and I was like oh why she was like well my husband never lets me do anything and I was like oh geez um that's got to be kind of rough and she was like yeah it sucks and so the thing
(30:16) is is that if you play it out into the future like you're going to end up resenting that person because they're not letting you do what you want and so I think what you're asking for is permission when you really need support that's how you how you like you go from past to the future right and so then you can play it out with this person so so let's play it out five years so over the last five years you've gained 5 pounds a year so you're 25 pounds heavier so five years from now if you're 25 pounds heavier than you are right now they're
(30:39) like oh my God if I'm 25 pounds heavier than I am like but that's just the track you're on and so let's play it out it like what if they say no and so sometimes they're like well then I would do it anyways then you're like awesome let's sign you up now one out of three times that's actually what happened which is crazy I still am blown away by that but then the two out of three times then I go you want permission not support now if you're looking at time or money for example then you say hey we need uh we need resourcefulness not resources so it's like you have your little isms that you can remember if it's time then it's well
(31:11) is it a seasonal thing because if it's a seasonal thing means you're busy right now uh and you might be you know less busy later that assumes that you'll never be busy again and so do you want this thing to be long lasting this implementation or do you want it to be just like only for the time that you're not busy and then you'll fall off again when when you get busy well shoot I want it to last forever ever it's like okay well then you should probably start when you're busy because that's when I'm going to be giving you the most support is now so that when you get to the the
(31:33) free time it'll be easy coasting and when you get busy again you know how to stick with it because you had the support right and so again it's like you have to be able to dismantle these things because you understand all of these there's a fundamental underlying fallacy of giving away power to something else because people don't want to make mistakes they don't want to fail and so they come up with all of these excuses they come up with time they say like that's the seasonal thing you can have time and in terms of the micro which is I don't have time in my day I'm like well you're here so when were you
(32:03) imagining this is why you do this up front when were you imagining how much time can you dedicate to this implementation to this SEO agency to this weight loss program whatever it is right if you ask that up front then if they say oh I don't have time with it then you can say well what changed between then and now just so I have understanding did I ask the question in a weird way that made you like not understand it um and again this is where tone matters a lot because now you're in the red zone right now it's like like the bomb's way more sensitive cu the the the the time ticker is going and so we
(32:33) want to be extra this is where Rapport is so important in the beginning because I I'll add this in this is a bonus one I call it the ghetto tone okay and I learned this from Sam back yart so he had a personal training business and that's why I I I shadowed underneath when I got into fitness he let me just work for him for minimum wage uh and so I learned how the gym business worked but anyways I saw him have this you know rich white lady doesn't put her weights back right and he was still training at the time like he was training sessions a little bit um and so he was like girl
(33:04) he's like I know you ain't about to leave my gym without putting your weights back and he's a Persian dude right but he would get into this kind of like ghetto like whatever you want to call it way of talking and she'd be like ah fine I'll go put him back and I thought about that and I was like man if I had just been like hey Susan can you put your weights back like she's like I pay for personal training you can put my weights back like that could get really bad really fast but when you say it like that all
(33:32) of a sudden it's like I'm communicating the same thing and I get the desired result and they think it's fun and light-hearted and so in the same sense when you're in the clothes I use a ton of humor and that tonality to diffuse hard conversations so I say like girl I was like five minutes ago I was like you had four hours a week I was like what happened to my four hours if I say that no one's going be upset with me they' be like ah well I mean I didn't know that it was going to be X Y and Z and then I'll be like fine I know like and then then then
(34:05) tone switch and you're like what's really going on and then you get the real stuff because guess what closers ask hard questions right and they're the questions it's the place where you don't want to go versus where you need to go which is you want them to diffuse the bomb in front of you not when they get home right and so you don't want them to sit with the decision you want them to confront it's like you might be wondering this is a lot of money let's talk about it right you might be wondering if your husband's going to be against it well let's talk
(34:35) about some reasons that he might not be against it let's talk about uh what your business partner will say if you buy this without their permission let's talk about that right and so you want to confront those ugly things you don't want to because like you're not like if I if you take anything from this the best salespeople want to confront it because they're better at selling them than they are at selling themselves so you want them to confront the obstacle in front of you so that you can help them through it so don't wait for like you're not going to avoid it I promise
(35:04) you you think you're avoiding the land mine but like because sometimes you hear that thing in the beginning of the call and you're like that's a bit I don't know if I want to blow the CL dude it's going to blow up in the clothes if you can't even can't even confront it before you've mentioned price it's definitely coming up after you mention price so like confront it now so one of my favorite ways to get to the hard question is asking what are you afraid of happening and then I follow that with let's just play it out a lot of times it's like people don't even want to look at what's going to happen it's like no
(35:32) let's play it out right like I remember I had this this sale that happened where I had a lady who was like I follow Dave Ramsey and I have envelopes of cash and if I give you this envelope that's my grocery money for the week uh if I do this program and I was like okay well what are you afraid of and she like paused and I was like is it that you won't be able to afford food I was like would you be afraid of that and she was like well yeah cuz she thought she was going to win the sale day but it was a trap um and I was like but you're trying
(36:02) to lose weight I was like worst case scenario don't afford food you lose some weight I was like win win now I did that with a good tone so she got a laugh out of it right and I was like but let's be real I was like have you ever bought anything in the past that you weren't sure you could afford I was like and where are you now you still survived you're not on the couch right I was like we always make it work in the end right if and you have to cut somewhere else I was like this is something that's going to last with you forever like you have all these clothes I was like you want to make all of them look better in 6 weeks
(36:28) I was like just lose 20 lbs what are you afraid of let's play it out best case worst case when you do that you can basically take away the emotion from the decision and say okay worst case scenario you're on your friend's couch and you know what you were poor before this and you were happy then too so worst case scenario is you're in the same position you've been in before and it was fine best case scenario you changed your life forever so does that feel like a bet you're willing to take right and so if you if you just you want to confront it and then walk into
(36:56) what they're afraid of and just say let's play out so this happens here this happens here best case worst case and I can tell you like I've probably closed more sales on best case worst case than any other clothes I have ask for the sale again and so this is a big one if you do not ask for the sale you will not get it that is a promise once you ask if you ask again you'll increase the likelihood that they buy now there's a right way to do this and a wrong way to do this if you just ask again when someone says no bad Lu if someone says no and you ask why and then
(37:27) you you resolve the why then you ask again and that makes sense it says hey I can't make Tuesdays and you say no worries if we're able to do it on Thursday would that work for you and they say yes they say awesome so you want to move forward you ask again right so all you're doing is resolving the concern there's terms in the industry called looping or you know uh obstacle overcomes whatever whatever wording you want to use is that you resolve the concern and you ask again and you can do this literally unlimited times as long
(37:55) as you resolve the concern and then you ask again I mean let will tell you that like if it was either a Sunday sale cuz I usually had way less calls on Sundays um or it was the last appointment of the day for me she just knew that I would always close that sale because I would just have unlimited time because I was like I will just keep going and so I ask again and again and again and I had um I had a partner back in the day I don't know if I like the visual but he's like he's like you're like a Pit Bull on someone's ankle he's like you just will not [ __ ] let them leave and I was like it's cuz I think I think that they
(38:26) need it they came in cuz they're trying to lose weight we sell weight loss what's the problem like we just have to figure it out and usually it's just like it's mounds of stuff you have to UNP of all these excuses of all the times that they've been unsuccessful in their lives it's like they came in because they want to solve the problem and when then they can confronted with the decision they get freaked out again because they reli these past traumas of the things they've tried and then feeling like a failure
(38:48) and then they associate that failure with you in the moment you're like hey Susan Cal down we're just going to have you eat some [ __ ] chicken and walk a little bit it's going to be okay and so the best closers come from the frame of helping the Prospect and so I will tell you this right now the best salespeople care more about the prospect than they do so whoever cares the most about the prospect wins the sale and so if they care more about themselves then they will win now you're like well of course they're going to care more about themselves ah if you have more context than they do which you should because
(39:17) you know more about the product than they do you should be able to have the best perspective to say no I'm not going to let this guy's limiting beliefs get in the way because I really want to help him or really want to help her and I can see that today it feels safe to retreat back to not taking action on this huge pain that they have but I can see how this is going to play out because I've seen a hundred other people just like them walk out the door and I see them you know a year later and they're in the exact same position or worse and I don't
(39:42) want that for them and so if you keep the human at the Forefront of your mind when you're making the sale you'll never come across pushy because you they can hear the intention they can hear the tonality in your voice about you actually just trying to help them so when you ask for the sale again having key stories and metaphors that you can use to break beliefs is what allows you to then ask again and you can do that literally unlimited times as long as they have time and you have time and you address the problem now if you don't address the problem and ask in they'll get annoyed so you just want to make sure that you have an answer and you should have an answer because you've had
(40:15) this conversation before there's nothing they should be able to tell you that should surprise you if we zoom out we have a salesperson who has maximum hours maximum days they have as many time slots per day filled up with the best best prospects because they work them well they have a plan before and after to come prepared to the call and take notes and follow up with them bam famam the whole thing and when they're on the call they're completely present they breathe the script they know how to handle obstacles they have they have analogies and stories and metaphors
(40:43) memorized so they can help people overcome their issues they stick to the script they don't add to the script they keep their word concision as tight as humanly possible so they can maximize the number of sales they have per day and maximize the conversion rate of those sales fundamentally sales by the way I should have defined this earlier is increaseing the likel that the prospect buys that's all it is so everything that has to do with sales like if you had the perfect sales process it means you would account for every single variable that could ever
(41:07) happen to any human and you would get 100% of people who go through this process to buy that's what a perfect sales process would be and so it's a percentage conversion that's all it is and so with that we have maximum opportunities maximum percentage conversion we have an amazing sales are up but what if they can only do it for a day that gets into the third bucket which is what I would consider meta skills which is of the best sales people the things that most sales people struggle with are trait issues meaning
(41:38) they are on and then they're off again they're on and they're off again they get motivated they get demotivated motivated demotivated if you feel like this then it's a skilled deficiency you just don't know how to sustain performance for a long period of time and I promise you the difference between Champions and everyone else that they can sustain performance it's not like I don't know if sales is for me um I don't know if I'm growing enough in my dude here's the cleared efficiency you can't stay consistent there's some growth that you can tackle right now being consistent another kind of meta skill around this is enthusiasm like they're
(42:04) enthusiastic one week they're not enthusiastic the next week being able to sustain and maintain a high level of enthusiasm for both the role and when you're on the call is a skill it's a skill you whistle while you work you got to learn how to do it you got to learn to like the stuff you don't love so you can do the thing you really love which is sales the best salespeople kill for sport so let me tell you this a little analogy h notice a little analogies so I heard this from uh Mike Ary and I just love this he said there's three types of sales people there's dogs horses and
(42:34) tigers he's like dogs you got to feed them and if you don't feed them they starve to death and you got to you got to give them all this attention you got to rub their belly every day and the moment you stop they die horses they will Gallop as long as you keep whipping them but the moment you stop Galloping they just go down to a trot he's like but Tigers he said a tiger can eat a full meal but then if a bunny walks across his line of vision we'll kill the bunny for sport he's like you want tigers and I love that little analogy because the best sales people that I've ever met in my life they love sales they love the
(43:04) thrill of the clothes of the hunt when I was selling weight loss I would sometimes have homeless people and things like that that would come in who would respond to my ads it would happen right I had two ways to take it I could try and not take it seriously try and just like basically just get through the sale so I could move on with my life or I could see it is free practice and what's crazy is the amount of times where I judge someone as poor and turned out that they just dress different I don't know anything about that was more times than I can count and
(43:34) a lot of them were like hey I appreciate you just like you know treated me well I was like of course I was like this is a business your money spends the same and so you either practice the skill or you close either way you win it's a lot like lifting weights where if you have your warm-up reps and they look different than your heavy reps you're actually not practicing at all so you're wasting all these opportunities that you could be practicing your skill sharpening the sword which is what we call it in the sales world you could be sharpening your sword but you're actually making it duller because you're practicing the
(44:06) wrong way you're learning bad habits by not taking the sale seriously so the best sales people kill for sport and so I had uh I'll tell you a Jacob story which is my my young my young you know started with me at like 15 now he's been with me however many years seven he started as a low man on the totem pole and so when we would have lesser qualified leads they handed all of them to Jacob he's like I'll be the garbage man he's like I'll take anybody's leads he's like I just want to get good I just want to practice and so he's trying to
(44:31) take as many reps as he possibly could and guess what happened he started taking more reps than everyone else did and guess what happened after that he got better than other people did because he took more reps and he took every one of these as a [ __ ] gift which is what it is is that someone's going to give you the time to learn the skill of sales the business paid for that lead maybe it's less qualified they paid for it just the same and you have the benefit of learning the amount of people who want to learn how to sell better and are
(44:55) unwilling to take quote unqualified leads is ridiculous UL to me it's free practice with stakes and you still have the possibility of winning and closing a deal track data the best salespeople track data and so they're meticulous about the data they track and so let me explain this so you can judge and I've just seen this across my portfolio the skill of any person in any Endeavor that they practice by the quantity and quality of the metrics they track and so if someone says oh I'm good at sales i' be like cool tell me about the metrics you track now if they're like ah just
(45:28) you know close rate it's like well there's so many other metrics that you could track to understand how good you are at sales because the close rate is really just an outcome it gives you no leading indicators it tells you nothing else right I want to know what percentage of leads you're booking I want to know what percentage of of scheduled things are showing I want to know of show rate what percentage are you offering of offer how many of you're closing how many how many what's your average call to close are you doing one call two call 1.2 like what's your
(45:53) what's your average number what's your average number of cash collected like there's so many other metrics that you can track to know how well you're doing as a salesperson and yes for everybody like shout this from the rooftops if you can get their schedule rate up by 20% it's just as good as getting their Clos rate up by 20% and so there's so many other things in the funnel that the best sales people know about closing about how to increase the total number of sales they get by controlling all of the
(46:19) other variables that are under their control now the bad guys the dogs are like I only want these times and I want them to be spoonfed to me and and if I don't get them fed there and you don't pat me on the head I'm going to starve to death and die right that's what the dogs do and if you've got salesp people like that they're dogs I don't care how many how much experience they have they're dogs right tigers are like I want to be available to kill whenever because I just love the hunt I would do this for free I'm just happy I get paid
(46:45) to do it pro tip if you are somebody who's running a sales team if you want to increase the close rates across the entire team even more give the best closers the best leads and the way you do that is that you have to start by scoring your leads first which means you actually have to track data so you can say these people have the highest likelihood of closing when they have these three characteristics they close their way higher percentage and then you give those leads to the best guys so fundamentally you'd want the worst leads to go to the worst guy the best leads to go to the best guy and everyone in between and so by doing that you
(47:14) actually match the org and so I actually had a Salesman that I knew who was the top sales rep for a time share business and it's exactly what you think it is so it's a billion dollar plus company this guy was making three million a year in commission selling time shares and I had dinner with him and I was like what do you do you know differently and he said well I won the sales competition and so I got one hour with the CEO and on that one hour with the CEO which is the prize for winning the sales competition it was
(47:39) 3,000 sales people it was number one he said I just said if you give me the best leads instead of wasting them on these guys who are new he's like I will make you so much money and so the guy experimented with his little Division and he 5x his income as the sales guy and then they took it and they rolled it out Nationwide and they 5x the business and so there's a huge opportunity in every business to give the best closers the best leads because you make more money and what happens is is that the best guys will actually make more and more and more money which then creates a survivorship bias for new guys coming in
(48:15) and so if you know the best guy used to make 200,000 a year as the top closer but now can make 800,000 a year the amount of sales people that you will attract your opportunity will 10x now even though the entry level guys now make less than they did before the opportunity just like the lottery the same reason people buy tickets is they assume that they're going to get there and so by having it this way you'll have people come in willing to make less because they know that if they if they perform well they'll go to the big leagues now the other benefit of this is
(48:44) that you train your new guys on the worst leads so you lose the least money as a business but they also develop their skills because they've got to learn how to Big borrowed steel and squeeze blood from the stones from the least qualified customers and so when they get to somebody who's got a 700 credit score and actually has intent to buy they're like oh my God this is amazing because they practiced on somebody who's like missing an arm and missing seven credit cards and they are in bankruptcy and they're actually in the middle of a divorce and the real name isn't Al it's actually Larry and
(49:15) you know it's complicated I'm a little liquid right now I'm between thing you know whatever right and they're closing those people for lunch money uh and so when you learn how to do that when you get to like qualified prospects you're like oh my God this amazing but at that point the business doesn't bear the cost the salesperson does so that they can develop their skills because just being real you're still paying them to learn and I'd rather pay as little as I can so I can allocate the resources the best
(49:40) way possible in the business my biggest pet peeve and the reverse of that is my favorite thing about the best salespeople is they never blame circumstances so whenever I have a salesperson who's like the leads are bad or you know uh these These people aren't a good or BL just like whatever BS that they can come up with or like I don't like the commission structure we should change like just focus on the things you can control right and the guys that I love the most never complain they pick up the extra shifts they call the leads
(50:12) the most they work them the most they're like these leads are amazing I'm so grateful to have these and be able to practice and get paid to do it and there's a time and a place for giving feedback on stuff group calls not one of them if you are one of these sales people you give it one-onone with the manager say hey by the way I've noticed like some people get on the phone just objectively like their credit scores are just consistently lower than they were a couple months ago I don't know if we've changed anything on the marketing side
(50:37) I'm going to approach the leads the same I love The Practice just thought might be you know useful data for marketing right that's very different than like dude these leads are [ __ ] I'm I'm not taking these calls right that's just a primadonna and I hate that and so again the worse the leads the better you get to flex your skill and the best sales people take 100% of the control and the best marketers take 100% % of the control too and so if everybody is taking absolute blame for every outcome guess what you win if you want a tactical breakdown of scaling a sales team from Z to 40 we
(51:07) actually did that in one of our portfolio companies in just over a quarter we added $21 million in profit to the business our largest portfolio company and so if you want every one of those steps outlined in black and white on the Whiteboard I break it down enjoy the case study

Unconventional Productivity Habits That Made Me Successful - YouTube
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bkPwFqa89gE

Transcript:
(00:00) in this video i'm going to show you the handful of abnormal routines that i do that people have laughed at me for but that i believe will serve you first off right off the bat i'm not the type of person who does you know cold showers and like light stuff and red saunas and you know the orange glasses and the finger toe shoes and the biohacking and like all that stuff i don't i don't really subscribe to that kind of methodology i would say that most of the things that i've seen that have been quote productivity hacks
(00:32) really become to borrow something from my wife uh procrastination hacks it's people who love making spending all their time making lists and not really doing and so i'm i don't do a lot of things on a regular basis so i don't have a tremendously complex routine and that is i think because i would rather spend my time working i'll give you a handful of things that have served me well the first is that for i would say the first and this is where i think is more valuable to people who are coming up for the first probably eight years of my
(01:00) business career i woke up around four o'clock in the morning just about every day and part of that came because i started in the fitness industry and i was doing that anyways but also because i didn't have to talk to anyone until about 10 a.m and so that gave me about six hours of uninterrupted work time that i could really move projects forward and so yes that means the first thing i did every morning was i would wake up and i would start working and i think that the morning really actually starts the night before and so
(01:26) this is something i don't know if it's talked about as much but for me i can't it's it's more difficult for me to go to sleep until i have thought about what i'm going to do the next day so i feel like i have to clear my mental kind of like bandwidth and say all right what are the few things i'm going to focus on tomorrow and i've never really given myself more than three things to do and so it's usually one to three things people like was it two or is it three or is it one i don't really believe in making rules
(01:47) around that stuff so if i'm just gonna be editing my book tomorrow then that might be the only thing i have if i have a couple of things that are gonna take a little bit of time that i might have three things on the calendar right and that's about it right and so the first kind of habit around this is that i plan the night before i know what i'm going to do the moment i wake up and then upon waking up i pretty much just start getting to work and i have my first four six hours of the day dedicated to moving those things forward and for a
(02:13) lot of people that's hard but i think that so is being successful and you just have to pick what kind of hard you want being broke is hard so as being successful is just one of them you know might get you close to your goals so that's the first kind of habit that i would say that i do that's maybe atypical is that i don't have some crazy routine in the morning besides i drink a cup of coffee and that's about it the second thing is i try and decrease the amount of decisions that i have to make throughout the day and so for me i think
(02:35) decisions that we make over and over and over again i think are wasted ones especially if they're the outcome is pretty much moot and so one of those things is like food and so i eat the same thing every day for breakfast lunch and dinner and um that may sound crazy to you but uh for me i like what i have for breakfast lunch and dinner and so i look forward to it every day and i don't really have any stress that goes around that beyond that uh this is very very small but uh if you've acquired a lot of belongings
(03:04) over your you know time period trinkets and things like that i think you gain a tremendous amount of attention from getting rid of those things which is probably why if you've ever like cleaned out your garage or cleaned out a storage closet you feel better it's like ah all these like little attention that that was just like left there and every time i walked by i was like i should do something about that well try and clear as many of those things as you can so that you have as much of that bandwidth back and i think that that kind of
(03:27) manifests itself in just better higher quality decisions the third thing that i'll say that i would do is that's somewhat different so the first being uh the night before early morning wake up no real routine there besides just get to work and the second being like i ate the same things every day the third piece is kind of the the nighttime side of it which is i think it's more important to have a bedtime than it is to have a wake-up time and so you might you know hear me say yes i wake up at 4 a.m but that might mean
(03:54) that it's 4 45 some days it might mean it's 3 10 some days it might mean it's even 5 30 some days i'm more inclined to just go to sleep earlier and wake up when i wake up than trying to you know get myself out of bed when i'm exhausted and from all the very very wealthy people that i i know they value the quality of sleep that they have not that they're obsessed with it because i know that i can work on four hours of sleep for a very long period of time but i make better high quality decisions uh when i am well
(04:23) rested and so the third kind of habit around that is set an alarm for your bedtime rather than your wake up time it's a tiny little hack and i think it'll it'll do you a lot of good um and so for me you might think wow that's not a lot of routines and i think that there's something to that i when i hear about someone who says like ah unless i you know do a polar plunge and i and i walk outside barefoot and i have all these things that happen i don't think that i to me that sounds like you're not resilient at all and that you can't
(04:51) handle stress at all i want to be able to be resilient so that no matter what condition i'm in i'm adaptable and i can survive and hopefully thrive and so if i it's me against somebody who needs to have you know their that all of their pens in order and all of their you know their their 20 minutes of journaling in the morning and then they have to read their book and then after that they have to do their their their out loud ohms and they have to do this whole song and dance what ends up happening it starts
(05:13) creating superstition around how you work and that's bad because now you become reliant on that action in order to just be functional not above functional because anything that gives you like a short-term boost oftentimes just becomes a crutch over time and so i'm very very sensitive to superstitions and having crutches because i would rather just say hey i can wake up i can drink a cup of coffee and i can get to work and i think that a lot of times people who look into all these productivity hacks look into all
(05:41) these routines look into all this stuff many times use that as a crutch to lean on to feel productive rather than actually getting work done and so big picture those are the things that have actually yielded me disproportionate returns i've tried a lot of that stuff i've tried the gratitude journals i've tried the you know saying things out loud the affirmations i've tried all of these different things and the things that stuck were the things that were simple and i think that if you look at lots of successful people
(06:10) the the sleeping hours that they keep are wildly different there's some people who work do their best work between 10 8 you know 10 p.m and 4 a.m and they work night outs i've got a friend of mine who's a billionaire who does that and that's he's like alex i can't wake up and do work any time before 10 a.
(06:23) m and i'm like that's cool like that's how he does it and so i think it's more important to figure out what sleeping schedule do i get the best work done in and when can i allocate time that is just my time to think and as entrepreneurs like the higher up we go to more about the decisions we make rather than the actions we take and that's something that i've stuck with and so as always it's here alex ramos the owner of jim launch prestige labs and alan we've done you know 120 plus million we're on pace for over 85
(06:48) million this year i make these videos because i hope that someone uh learns from some of the lessons and doesn't have to fall for the the many traps along the way of uh the productivity hacks and the biohacking and all this craziness um that can just get in the way of just get it done do the boring work and you'll see the results i'll see on the other side

Million Dollar Equations - YouTube

Transcript:
(00:00) these are seven investing Concepts that will make you money starting with number one lifetime gross profit compared to cost to acquire a customer which basically means how much money you make in profit from every person who comes into a business compared to how much it costs to get them to buy to begin with this is the fundamental economic unit of the business you buy attention you buy eyeballs to get customers and then you sell those eyeballs something that you're going to make a profit from all the profit that gets generated from the
(00:27) business comes from this one ratio and so if someone has for example a 1:1 ratio of LTB to CAC they spend a dollar and they make a dollar back and so that's it you know let's say let's say a 20 to1 that means for every dollar they put in they get 20 back as profit this becomes a business that you can scale endlessly and becomes an incredibly attractive business getting really clear on what your lgp to CAC ratio is is core to Growing anything so let's define these terms lifetime gross profit has a couple of components there's Lifetime
(00:57) and then there's the gross profit component so lifetime is like okay well how many times is someone going to pay me within a product's business how many times does someone Buy on average over the lifespan Shopify stores things like that will actually just give you this metric which is like the average customer buys 4.
(01:13) 3 times if you have a Services business or a membership based business then it might be the average lifespan so how many months are they going to stick with you now if you don't know this because you might be a smaller business that doesn't have a CRM that reports on this kind of stuff I'll give you the back of napkin way to actually calculate this how many customers did I have at the beginning of the month now of these people people that I had at the beginning 30 days later what's the number of those people that I have at the end not the number of customers in
(01:36) total cuz you might sell people in between but I want to know of the people at the beginning of the month how many of them are still there 30 days later so if I had 100 people here at the beginning and I had 90 people at the end then I would have 10% turn and you're like okay wait is that the number no what we then do is we take one and we divided by this number which then means that our average lifespan in this example would be 10 months or or 10 intervals whatever interval you're measuring on cuz if I did this quarterly
(02:03) it would be the same thing or annually it'd be the same thing number of people at the beginning 100 number people the end 90 I lost 10 meaning I have a 10% churn 1 divid by 10% equals 10 so the average number of months that someone stays is 10 months everything that I'm going to show you today is stuff that you can do addition subtraction multiplication or division there's nothing else you don't have to be a genius to learn how to invest or build a business so now that we just covered lifetime now we need to figure out gross
(02:28) profit which is how much extra cash do we have left over from each customer after we do a transaction the simplest example I can give you is if this cost me a dollar and I sell it for $2 then I have a dollar of gross profit now I still have to take that dollar and pay other costs I have to pay rent I have to pay other fees that go along and then my margin is now squeezing from that 50% that was left over until what my net margin becomes at the end of the day with widgets or physical products it's really that simple it's just price minus
(03:00) cost of good sold and so cost of good sold are going to be all the costs that you have to incur specifically related to delivering the product all you're trying to figure out is that the basic transaction how much money you have left over now with physical products it's typically much simpler than with service-based businesses but I'm going to give you a service-based example so you can still understand it because you need to you need to if I sell customers for $11,000 a month and I have an employee who cost me $4,000 per month
(03:28) and each employee can handle 10 customers that means each employee handles $10,000 per month for 10 customers so now all we have to do is say what is our gross margin we're going to take the $10,000 we're going to subtract $4,000 from it and that gives us $6,000 per month gross profit which you'll sometimes hear expressed as a percentage which would be 60% gross margins both of these are the same thing one is an absolute number the other percentage you see seeing how $4,000 is my cost this is how much I make subtract the two that
(04:04) gives you the margin and that gives you the percentage now remember we figured out what our lifetime was and we figure out how much we make per customer or how many months they stayed in that instance now we combine those two metrics to get the one lifetime gross profit earlier we did the 10% chur example and so let's say that these customers stay on average for 10 months because this is for 10 customers we can divide this by 10 which gets us $600 per month per customer so I just div ided the $6,000 bu the 10
(04:31) customers to get my how much do I make per customer per month so that's $600 per month per customer in gross profit now we said earlier that they're staying for 10 months which means that my lifetime gross profit per customer is $6,000 of LT GP so now I know that customers are worth $6,000 so this is important because now this is all the money I have to go spend to acquire them and run the rest of the business this is probably one of the biggest mistakes that business owners make because what they do is they look at their lifetime
(05:05) Revenue per customer and say oh as long as it cost me less than that in advertising I'm making money but I'll give you an extreme example to point out why that doesn't work let's say I sell these for $10 this pen for $10 but it cost me $9 and the average person buys 10 pens so it's $100 in Revenue but it costs me $90 to sell the 100 but if my team comes to me and says dude we're killing it we're spending $50 to get a $100 sale we should do this all day but what's really happening I'm actually spending $50 to make $10 in gross profit
(05:41) lifetime not a good equation and so you don't want Revenue to confuse you and this is like one of the biggest misunderstandings I see business owners make which is why sometimes because they don't know this they don't know why they can't grow the reason lifetime value and lifetime gross profit get conflated or confused is because many of the most formal businesses that are out there come from Silicon Valley which almost exclusively is Tech and software and the gross profits on software are almost always close to 100% the two can flate
(06:09) but for everyday business owners who have people we have manufacturing we have inventory we have to pay for stuff to happen that isn't 100% And so we're not doing it off Revenue we have to calculate what our gross profit is because that's what we run our business off of so far we got our $6,000 lifetime gross profit cool so we've got one part of this equation this video is incredibly in depth and tactical because I break down every concept to its absolute base units so my recommendation to get the most out of this is to watch
(06:37) all of the concepts understand them so you see how they all work together to ultimately help you invest better and then come back through and then do each of the concepts individually so that you can apply them so now we're going to talk about how to how much it cost to acquire a customer this is another one that people mess up so what a lot of people do is they just look at how much it cost them to advertise to figure out how much it cost them to get a customer that's partially true but not completely for two reasons the advertising budget
(07:02) of you're running paid ads for example is only one of the many costs that go into a cry and customer the other issue is that you're not including the labor so let's say that we have five employees that cost in total $50,000 a month that's the labor and then let's say we're spending $50,000 a month in software and advertising like Facebook ads or Instagram ads that means that our total cost for as a company is $100,000 per month for all the customers that we acquired that month and so then all we do is you look back and say okay
(07:35) how many do we acquire over the last 30 days let's say this $100,000 bought us 83 customers so our cost to acquire customer would be 100,000 divid 83 survey says $1,224 so this divided by that equals $1,224 cost to acquire a customer let's look at our math if if we have cost us $1,224 to acquire our customer and that customer makes us $6,000 in lifetime gross profit we're killing it so that means that we have a 5:1 ltp to CAC ratio and if you're like is that good or is that bad 5 to1 is great you want to make sure that you're always at least
(08:19) greater than 3 to one meanings your lifetime gross profit compared to how much it cost you to make that money is at least three times greater otherwise you'll be too constrained to scale if this is bad I'm just not I don't need to look at anything else I can just automatically toss the business out and if this is exceptional I might be willing to overlook or forgive some other metrics that are coming down the line that aren't as strong but if you don't know these numbers in a business that you're buying or investing or
(08:45) business that you own find them out so I told you earlier that I was going to give you seven well it turns out that uh that was three of them because the ratio is one gross profit is another and CAC is another so we covered three we're already almost halfway there so number four is return on invested Capital all right what we're looking at is how much money does it cost us to expand the business there are some businesses like an accounting firm for example that the way that they expand the business is that they just hire more accountants
(09:14) there really isn't a lot of what they call Capital expenses which is why I tend to like service businesses now on the flip side if I was in manufacturing i' would have to factor in all the machines a new location another buildout that would go into expanding our capacity to make more stuff whatever business you have and I do a lot of brick-and-mortar stuff I want to know first what's the LT GP to CAC ratio at the customer level but then how much does it cost me to make a location and scale it so for example let's say I have
(09:44) to put $100,000 in to open each new location now underneath of that $100,000 is going to be the marketing budget to launch the location the cost to do the buildout hiring staff recruiters if we need that ads for Craigslist to you know get new people in everything is included because once you do this enough times you do have a pretty good idea of what that number is and you say cool it cost us $100,000 to open each new location and at month 6 we're here at 12 months we're here and at X months we're at capacity the question is first how
(10:13) quickly do I make my money back which is the payback period Then what is my one-year return and then what am I making once it's at capacity cuz I want to know how much cash flow this thing kicks off and so in this example I love to see at least 3:1 ideally 5 to1 meaning if I put $100,000 in once we're at capacity we're at 500,000 per year in profit I put $1 in I get $5 out and so this is the same concept as what we're doing here but just at scale so I'm not buying one customer I'm buying a custom printing machine how much does it cost
(10:47) me to build another machine that creates profit every single year and so from a returns perspective if I can pay my investment back for example in 6 months after that everything's gravy the part that people don't want to to talk about is that all of this stuff cost headspace right which is that you have an opportunity cost associated with any investment meaning what could you have done with the same level of effort and money in the same period of time but if at month 6 I'm breaking even and at month 12 I'm at let's say pacing 250,000
(11:16) a year and by the second year I'm at 500,000 a year in profit then great this is now a node that just kicks off cash flow year after year after year and then I think okay well I have $500,000 what am I going to do open five more locations if something costs very little and makes me a lot good now you might be like well the stock market gets 10% returns that would be putting $100,000 in and getting $10,000 back I actually really like to see at least I mean really 3 to one which means a 300% return per year kind of at minimum which
(11:48) sounds ridiculous but I'm putting time and effort in so these are not passive Investments for me it's different if I give someone cash and they do all the work and then I just get dividends then that's different but if I'm actively working then I have to account for all the time that I'm putting into this and so for me I want to make sure that I have a really strong return profile to justify the cost of time so there's two big variables that come into fast or slow payback period one is how much is this build out right if you have a
(12:13) massive buildout sometimes it going to be hard to pay that back quickly the second is how good they are at launching somebody might have five locations but not really have a new location strategy for a new city so this happens a lot in brick and mortar chains where they've got five locations in one city and they can they can drive to all of them but then really want to expand and going from 5 to 20 is a totally different game now mind you that's what we specialize in but you now have to go to a new market where no one knows you and
(12:39) actually have a launch strategy that ideally and this is what we like to do fill up the facility so I want to get to this capacity as fast as humanly possible and sometimes that means hey you guys have a a $10,000 budget for opening let's put 40 into opening so that we're opening full and then we're already at 500,000 a year run rate by month 6 so if you're a brick and Mort business by the way and you would like to scale go to acquisition.
(13:04) comom and to be clear this is for businesses that are doing at least a million dollar a year in profit ideally 3 to five so let's go through number five which is payback period simply put how quickly are you paid back for getting a new customer so we talked about return on invested Capital at the business level but now I'm going all the way back down to the unit of how long does it take me to recover the cost you acquire a customer remember said CAC was $600 if I spend $600 how quickly do I get it back and so if you had two scenarios one scenario
(13:31) where it takes you 3 months to get your $600 back versus another uh scenario where you put $600 in and get $66,000 in the first 30 days which one would you rather have well if both of them have the same lifetime gross profit you'd rather get the money sooner that number of how long it takes me to get paid back is G indicator of how cash flow positive the business is for the big fancy investors they don't care about as much because they're working with these massive companies and long payback cycles and all this stuff but small
(13:57) business owners that's how you live and that's how you expand what we try and do when we're looking at a business is okay what is the payback period and are there some easy levers that we can do to drive it Forward I'll give you a couple easy ones so number one is I could say hey with that example we gave it was $11,000 a month could we just get them to pay first and last month up front that' be an easy way to drive drag some of that cash flow forward and I could break even and make my payback period 1 month a
(14:24) second way to do that would be some sort of fee which is I say hey I have an onboarding fee enrollment fee an Initiation fee a setup fee but the point is that you charge a fee of some sort in addition to whatever the recurring revenue is third way to do it is you could have an upsell of some sort this is structured as a fee the other is an upsell this one is optional this one is mandatory functionally they're the same thing we're trying to drag more Revenue up front a fourth way you could do this is that you could get financing in place
(14:48) right so you get a third-party bank or financing partner who says I would like to make interest on some of these payments that you have with your business I will front you the whole amount that this person owes you but I'm going to take a piece for taking on the risk and so you basically give your risk away to somebody else they take a fee for that and then you get cash up front four easy ways that you can think about to try and decrease your payback period and in other words get more cash faster if we're looking at this from a timeline
(15:12) perspective so $1,200 was the cost to acquire if we spread that out the first month I get 600 so I'm still at negative 600 and then I have another 600 that comes at month two so now I'm at zero so it took me two months to break even in the second scenario I add a fee let's say another $600 and it's just processing fee I cost me nothing to do this all right so now my first transaction I make $1,200 back and I'm already at breaking even at zero and then here I get my 600 but I'm plus 600 now and so this business is a healthier
(15:45) business that will be more adaptable more resilient in a downturn than this one let's do number six six and seven are real short and then I'll give you a bonus one number eight so these are all about predictions so up to this point we've gotten a steady state of okay this is what the business is is 6 7even and 8 are all about what it can do in the future okay so number one that I love this one is sales velocity times lifetime gross profit which means how many units are we selling per month times what are these people going to be
(16:14) worth to me over the lifetime now you can also do this as LTV as well because that's also a good metric to at least understand especially if sometimes margins can improve with scale so that can be helpful to just know both let's say that I sell 100 customers a month times $6,000 in in lifetime gross profit and it was $10,000 in lifetime value right which is how much revenue they're going to generate remember because we still had all the cost Associated the nice thing with this is that we can see especially with this one where the
(16:41) revenue of the business is going to be at scale because especially if you have a recurring Revenue business it might take time for them for the business to actually get to its hypothetical Max and so the Assumption here is that if nothing else changes in the business they don't sell more customers and the customers don't become worth any more than they already are where will this business even out and so in this example $1 million a month now this is why this is so important if someone comes to me and they're doing 500,000 a month and
(17:10) they have these metrics then I know that the business is going to double without doing anything which is great on the flip side if a company comes to me and has these metrics which it still could and is doing $2 million a month then I know that it's going to shrink means that they were either selling more units earlier on in the past and think something happened their Facebook ads got shut down uh they got a bad rap on their content or and this is probably the more common one their delivery started to drop and so their turn
(17:37) started to increase and so their lifetime values actually dropped per customer because they couldn't scale well and so I can say even though you're at 2 million a month right now if things keep going the way they are it's actually going to go drop down to a million a month all right and so this gives you a really good idea of a snapshot of where someone's going to be versus where they are so you might be wondering how can the lifetime value of a customer change for a business will if turn goes from 5% to 10% then it means
(18:03) you cut your lifetime Revenue in half tough but that's why turn numbers in retaining customers are so important because if you go from 10% turn to 5% you also double the lifetime revenue of a customer and so this is why the health of the business based on what its hypothetical Max is can change and so the longer period of time you take the average over realistically the more accurate it'll be if you did this on a daily basis it would be really volatile in smaller businesses smaller businesses are volatile and so it's good to have
(18:30) snapshots of okay well what was it trailing 90 trailing 6 months trailing 12 months to get a much better idea and you can calculate this at each of those and then you can look at all three and say okay well this is what I think it really is and all of this helps you ask better questions as an investor so I'm going to give you the next one which is very similar to this one which is sales velocity divided by churn so churn remember we defined this earlier at the beginning number of customers and let's say it's 10% per month okay is the
(18:56) number of customers who leave and let's say again we've got 100 customers in terms of sales velocity this means that our hypothetical Max in terms of logos or number of customers that the that the business is going to have to sustain or maintain is going to be a th000 customers now remember we have 1,000 customers remember was paying $1,000 a month million doll a month these calculations work together this tells me how much money are we going to be making when we're at our hypothetical Max and this tells me how many customers are we
(19:24) going to have to be servicing at our hypothetical Max we're coming down and I say well dude right now you have the infrastructure to maintain 2,000 customers but we're going to be at 1,000 you're going to have to be looking at headcount which sucks on the flip side if we've got 500 customers we're doing 500,000 a month and I know we're going to get to 1,000 I might say hey how could we scale and make sure that we don't break on our way to a th000 because we're going to get there in X months that's six and seven and now
(19:48) we'll go to bonus number eight the secret bonus which wraps all of this stuff together this equation is really in relation to how big the opportunity is so Tam is just a fancy word for total adjustable Market which is how many people could I potentially sell and so when I'm analyzing an opportunity it's number of potential units times lifetime gross profit divided by risk and so this ultimately gets at how big of a company do I think this could ultimately be if we're servicing you know vegan moms with three kids who like powerlifting then
(20:18) there might only be 50,000 of them and so I'm going to have 50,000 potential units sold that's assuming we get 100% of the market to buy now that might not be true but that would be here is what's what how many could we potentially sell the lifetime gross profit is well how much do we make on all of these people this would give us an idea of how big the opportunity is this is all the good stuff the big question is How likely is that going to happen risk has a zillion categories so that's beyond the scope of
(20:42) this video but do I think that there's a trend are there going to be more vegan powerlifting moms in the future are there going be less vegan powerlifting moms in the future so for example right now I am looking at fertility stuff tons of people are having fertility issues I think it's going to be a booming Market in the future so something that Services anything related to fertility will probably have big Tailwinds behind it you can apply risk to each of these so from selling potential units is okay is the way that we're acquiring customers
(21:08) something that's really risky are there going to be platforms that are going to change do we expect that this method of getting customers is sustainable is there key man risk is there's somebody who's in charge of that department that if they left would' be screwed right all of these are factors of risk of How likely it is to happen in the future from the lifetime gross Prosper perspective are there other competitors that could come in and undercut us how strong is our position in the marketplace do we have a better product
(21:28) that can sustain a premium are there economies of scale that we can have or there is there shrinking margins which sometimes can happen at scale and so these are all risks that could affect our gross profit per customer over the long haul some people might think okay well how how important is Tam it is extremely important but the ability to assess it is very limited this is one of those uh important and unknown uh which Charlie merer and Warren Buffett talk about a lot which is like you've got things that are knowable and unknowable
(21:55) and unimportant and important and we just want to focus on the knowable and important the economy and interest rates very important is it knowable no so they don't try to predict it with Tam I see it kind of in that very important but not knowable and here's why the amount of companies that start with a niche and then expand and expand and redefine their customer redefine their Avatar most businesses have especially the biggest ones Amazon started as a bookstore now it's an everything store Facebook started as a social network for
(22:22) college kids and then became the everything social network and so many huge examples start small because they want to narrowly to find a problem for a specific Avatar and they expand over time but the main point for this one is how much risk am I exposed to that is knowable that I think could potentially break this equation from working in the future when you take the first seven and you plug that into this framework for assessing value or how big this could potentially be then you have a very good framework to analyze a business yourself
(22:49) or others to potentially invest in or say I'm a no on this one dog and by the way if you don't have something like this I'd recommend just put one s sheet together that tracks your numbers automatically every month because you'll get a much better idea of how your business is doing from a health perspective again if you're a brick and mortar chain doing a million dollars in profit per year or more and you've got a sound model and you want to expand we're looking for you right now we've done super well with brick and mortar chains
(23:16) expanded really really big and we're just looking for awesome businesses that we can get involved in so specifically service based businesses million plus ideally 3 to 5 million in profit so if that's you reach out to us we can make it rain together

Millionaire explains why time is NOT the most precious resource... - YouTube

Transcript:
(00:00) for three years i recorded two videos a week and i put them in a a facebook group uh because i didn't understand how youtube worked and uh over that time period i got better at communicating and things like that um but there was a specific video that was uh among the most watched and most shared videos um that i ever made and i thought i would share it here with you guys mozi nation uh for those of you guys who don't know my name is oxford the own acquisition.
(00:25) com you know portfolio companies that does about 85 million a year now in the video it's from the past so if you hear some of the numbers that are in there it's what i was doing at that time um and this specific video is incredibly valuable to me because it was one of the videos that really set me free in understanding the true single most valuable resource that we have as entrepreneurs and how most entrepreneurs are leaking it and once i plugged that hole for myself is when i started seeing explosive growth uh in my business but also in my life overall and so i wanted
(00:53) to share this video because i think it's incredibly valuable and the the marketplace of attention has said that this was one of the most valuable videos ever made and so i wanted to share with you hope you guys enjoy this is a little bit less common for me i'm uh i was i'm going to make a video or i guess podcast depending on how you're consuming this on a pretty pie in the pie in the sky topic um and i titled this the new entrepreneurial golden resource and how you're probably leaking it so a lot of people don't know this
(01:22) but uh i probably i would say a mentor four or five people on the side not in a formal business setting in terms of like them paying me or anything like that but just people that are have become friends that i've taken interest in their business and i've helped them along and invariably and what's interesting is that the higher up you go the less tactical the mentorship is and so i have so i've had i've had the fortune of actually connecting and befriending my my first billionaire friend which is cool and what's
(01:52) what's happened as a result of that is that like i i obviously obsessively look at what people who are doing better than me are doing and then when i'm relaying to the people who are who i'm trying to help there's this one resource that people who make a ton of money manage extremely well and people who um do not do not and a lot of people i would say mistakenly think that the number one resource is time right everyone's like time is money time is money time is money and i would argue that that's not necessarily true i would argue that
(02:22) attention is money that is the golden resource so the billionaire friend that i have he's actually been helping me on um the new endeavor that we are launching to our gym lords uh soon which i think will change the industry anyways he's been helping me with that stuff but like here's an example on his phone his phone does not ring unless you are already a contact that has been whitelisted his phone doesn't ring it's he is impossible to reach the more successful the more the the larger your company grows the more you scale the more you
(02:53) need to scale the only way to scale you is because you do have a finite amount of attention and so what happens is you have to decrease all of the other things in your life that drain attention because you can have as much time as you want but if you're not there you're not potent you're not able then you can't get anything done with that time that you're supposedly allocating which is why a lot of people end up in this in-between state of always everywhere and at the same time nowhere right and so they're they're
(03:19) everywhere but they're not paying attention to anything and that's and the reason that it's difficult to focus is because entrepreneurs the character trait that made us into entrepreneurs is that we're go getters we're we're risk-averse we're creators we're innovators we're builders right we have all of those traits but the difficulty is is that the thing that gets you from zero to one is not the thing that gets you from one to two right and so one of the the reason that you have to totally morph and why you have to be a growth
(03:44) oriented individual is because you have to change your own individual character traits in order to progress as a business owner and so like i said the things that got you here are not the things that are going to get you there the things that got you here which is your own internal skills are not the things that you need to pass on to other people so the only way that you were able to grow your business at a certain point is by growing other people right and the only way you can do that is if you have the attention and the bandwidth
(04:06) in order to do so and that's why if you look at a business owner and like the more i obsess on looking at billionaires and people who are doing better than we are is i look at how quiet and how clean they keep their space and i mean that both both in a literal sense that like their surroundings their office their house their homes their cell phone their computers right there it's it's it's quiet right everything like it's it's pristine and when you talk to these people there's a certain amount of of tranquility that's there and
(04:38) and they just they just have very low tolerance and it's not that they're trying to be impatient with you or impatient with the world it's just that they understand that they have so like they're they're operating at such a high level that there's so many things that are demanding of their time and attention that they just like they can't and so they have to forcibly remove themselves from so many different situations and i'm going to give you an example so one of the people that i'm i'm i'm somewhat mentoring right they had they had four
(05:04) businesses and this is something that that happens so many times it lit like like you want you want a hundred thousand dollar coaching this is what happens in hundred thousand dollar coaching sessions and i'm being honest with you what happens is someone who's coming in usually doing between one and three million dollars a year um can't get past a certain point right and the reason they can't get past is because they only have so much attention they've spread between four or five different cases that's when the gym owner has four
(05:29) gyms and is making less money than they did when they had one gym because the amount of attention that they can allocate to one facility has gone down so much that with fixed costs they basically are breaking even right and so the same thing happens now that entrepreneur is probably making one to three million in gross revenue but not taking anything home because they don't have the attention actually put onto things and so in order to grow you need to do less in order to grow you need to do less and that comes from both delegation and
(05:56) also choosing what not to do the better you get the better the opportunities that you have to say no to imagine the level of opportunities that we have now i'm just being honest so imagine how many things we could do or trying jv with or do a partnership with or whatever because of the distribution network that we have and the trust and the goodwill that we have with the gym owners um that we have in our network right a lot i get i you know how many people cold message me like i have an opportunity for you i'm like really you
(06:26) have an opportunity for me and so the better you get the better your opportunities you have to say no to which is why becoming a higher and higher and higher level entrepreneur is more and more difficult because it requires discipline it's not about doing more it's about doing less because we innately want to do more so doing more of your own internal characteristic if that was what it took to get to be more successful then everyone would be more successful because it would be something that does not take effort because that is
(06:51) something that we already do it's like man i outwork anyone i've got all this work with it cool that gets you from zero to one it's not gonna get you any further than that so stop identifying with that it was something that i used to identify with i was like i'll i'll outwork anyone or whatever like that was something that i used to think about and it was a character trait it was an identity thing and the more you grow the more you realize that your identity needs to be fluid because what it needs to be is exactly what it needs to be at that
(07:17) given time of development because the character traits that i'm going to have to emphasize in a year are going to be different than the ones that i have to emphasize now the skills that you need to learn like delegation leadership those are things that are not the things that take you in the beginning you have to be independent you have to be a hustling you have to be grinding you have to be willing to put in the work because no one else will do it for you especially if you have no capital to start which most people who are on here
(07:40) are in that situation to reel this back in the number one thing that you have to be paying attention to is where you are paying your attention right like you spend attention that's why they call it paying attention it's because it is a resource and most people don't pay attention to that right and so one of the things that a lot of people don't know about me this one's going to go along um some of the things that a lot of people don't know about me is that i for nine months paid a coach to teach me one thing which
(08:10) was to manage my attention was to teach me how to think and so for 90 minutes every single day all i did was talk about what i was thinking about think about that every day i paid attention to where my attention was and when i did that all of a sudden my business blew up right and i realized that i had toxic relationships i had toxic relationships with parents i had toxic relationships with friends or pseudo friends things that i that were taking my attention past things that i had on my mind that i knew i had not handled so those are
(08:45) called like open loops or open cycles right so when you have something that you like i haven't resolved this then you need to handle that and you'll get that attention back because what happens is you have this bowl this tiny little bowl of marbles that each of those marbles is is a unit of attention right if you had to measure it and so you put little marbles of attention on your childhood traumas you put little marbles of attention on your marriage you put little uh marbles of attention on your health you put little marvel's attention
(09:11) on your spirituality and then massive marbles of attention on your business but the thing is is that sometimes you need to quiet and collect all of these other little marbles so that you have more potency more potential energy more potential units of attention to spend on the one thing that you're trying to grow which in this case would be your business and what's interesting is that what happens is that things that were perceived as difficult become really easy and i don't know if you've ever had this happen but like if you were in
(09:37) college or you were in high school and you're like man i can't solve this problem this math problem and you were exhausted then you go to bed and you wake up the next morning and then all of a sudden it seems really easy you're like i don't know why i didn't see that before because attention gives you the ability to see right like if you're if you think about wisdom right wisdom is an ability to see what other people cannot see right two people are presented the same situation the wiser person sees things that the other person doesn't and how
(10:02) can you see better you see better if you have more ability to see which comes from your most valuable resource attention how much horsepower do you have and so look at the things that you have in your in your life right now like if i see someone who has a messy relationship life who's got a messy love life who goes out every weekend and gets trashed right like i can tell you billionaires don't do that that like the whole tony stark like vision of the entrepreneur is a farce it's not true don't believe that every
(10:30) single billionaire every single high-level entrepreneur is quiet unbelievably quiet they keep themselves completely isolated they have a bubble around them of of layers of protection they're like like for me it's it's me and then there's layla and then we have our co and then we have our executive assistant team because we have a team of eas at this point we have four um who work the next level there's no one who has direct access to me including our employees no one does and that's because it's it would disserve you
(11:05) you guys our gym owners if everyone had access to me the reason that i don't respond to facebook messages is not because i don't want to it's because i literally can't and if i did i would be disturbing everyone because then my attention would be split because someone can't generate leads in their mind or whatever you know what i mean like because these little things these little things that are perceived as huge issues to you in that moment because you have a little bit of attention you you have so little left that
(11:31) everything seems like an explosion but when you have lots of capacity big problems seem small and small problems seem big and it sounds reverse because what you do is you start seeing that all of these things are attention drains and you just say i don't want to play anymore then you stop playing and then all of a sudden everything gets really simple because the only things you have to do become really simple at our gym lord's event one of the things that we had to do or that i had everyone do was simply define the number that they
(12:00) needed to have in their gym number of efts in order to have the lifestyle that they wanted to have really simple simple process most people didn't have that but it's amazing what happens when you have clarity because then it allows you to put your attention in one direction right and then it gives you a litmus test will this help me grow this number yes or no yes cool let's do it no ignore it right and it takes discipline to say ignore it it takes discipline that's why it's hard that's why most entrepreneurs aren't successful that's
(12:30) why most entrepreneurs don't grow is because it's hard it's counterintuitive it's counter your character and so you have to learn how to not be yourself in order to be the person that you want to be and that's why that's why most people don't do it and so to go ridiculously full circle on this every time i meet with an entrepreneur and i told you we i coach is probably a loose term but i'll meet with um a few a handful of entrepreneurs um on a semi-regular basis and just see how how's it going and the question that i always ask is what's
(12:58) your attention where's your attention and if someone comes in and they seem really really like scattered i already know that their attention's all over the place they're super spread they're less able so of course they can't grow their business because they don't have the very horsepower the main resource that allows them to grow and push right and so look at your life look at your relationship with your spouse loved one look at your habits how you wake up how you eat how you exercise do you drink here's an example
(13:26) for why we stop drinking all right and it has nothing to do with any kind like there's no religious anything regarding this we stopped drinking because i realized that i would drink at night on a fairly regular basis not like i always had some issue with it i really didn't i mean i drank a lot but i just whatever the point is this is that i would i would drink in the evenings because i would it would it would help me just de-stress but help me unwind but what that does is it masks the thing that is taking my attention that i have
(13:54) anxiety on right and so if you need to take a drink to unwind then it means you have things that you have not resolved and so one by one what happened is that when i stopped drinking everything got really loud and so i had to face and confront the things that i had not resolved yet and so in the beginning it's the hardest but then what happens is once you've actually resolved all of those things the desire to drink goes away because you're like well i actually feel really good right now i don't want to mess that
(14:22) up and so it flips but it took it took probably six months for that to happen from it um and so i'm just giving that as an example of um of what of what having your attention split and kind of getting gaining that attention back can be so look at your life look at your relationships look at your habits and the things that are taking your attention you need to handle complete the cycles and get the attention back so you can work on the one thing that you're trying to grow and if you have side hustles and side businesses
(14:50) get rid of them kill them that's what people like people come and they pay tons of money to tell them do one thing and the only reason that they listen is because we make one and i'm telling you right now that's what i would tell you do one thing focus do one thing focus saying it again that's why most times uh when someone comes in they're like hey i want to start an online business in a food prep business and and and uh whatever right all at the same time because one of them is going to take off it doesn't work that way all
(15:21) of them could take off you could have a billion dollar uh food prep business you could have a billion dollar gym business like your business like having more businesses is a farce i was talking to a gym owner the other day and he's like yeah i mean two paychecks is better than one and i was like no one fat paycheck is better than two you can have a hundred million dollar roofing business right that just repairs rooms you don't need to do general contracting and also windows and also gutters and roofs you can just do
(15:48) one thing and be really really really really really good at it and make as much money as you want and so just break that belief of yourself of like i have to have three things in order to make more money you know you don't you don't it's not true you need one thing i had someone who's in the real estate space who was doing real estate coaching after uh her first month of being in the coaching uh called me up and was like there's just not enough real estate agents she was doing like 200 000 a month and i was like real estate agents
(16:13) i said how how how small of a market do you think micro gym owner is i was like you literally outnumber my market a hundred to one and i was like and we are out doing outpacing your revenue twenty to one it's it's just these beliefs that we have that are silly and i can tell you that the the higher up you go all of those limiting beliefs disappear and you just see people who operate a very high level very quiet very clean they they're like if someone walks in the door and there's any negativity those people just
(16:39) get up and late nothing personal i just can't have that in my life right someone complained someone's negative oh this weather ah traffic stop like no worries i'm just gonna get up and go it's nothing personal right that's how they handle themselves so um thank you guys for your attention um i hope i gave you a positive return on it that was my intention um this wasn't a normal uh type of uh video that i would normally make but it was something that was like on my mind and i just had uh two or three calls recently where i had told people to
(17:07) consolidate their businesses get rid of one two or three businesses and then within a matter of 30 days two of those people had a multiple of 3x on their total revenue between of what they were doing before within a 30-day period just by getting their attention back look at what you can consolidate lots of everyone i appreciate you and um shoot a like for someone who feels really distracted or if you have a spouse and you're like we should clean up our stuff tag them so that you can clean it up and uh have to get some attention back all
(17:39) right that's a lot have an amazing thursday and i will talk to you guys soon all right

Transcript:
(00:02) mosination this is a day in the life for Layla and I we flew out to do two Keynotes in Orlando Florida I think you'll dig the presentation on branding I've never talked about a pumpkin the first time we took a private jet was out of necessity we were in Puerto Rico and it was right as hurricane Maria was hitting we see the news about it and I check flights and the flights are all like multiple connections so we drink a cup of coffee and then like more news is like this looks like it might be really serious and I checked the flights again
(00:30) all gone all right well we're going to be here you know it's fine and then we go to the grocery store to like pick up some water or whatever and two people are getting a fist fight over water in the island people are [ __ ] sprinting around the store she's like we have to get off this island I was like dude you don't want to be here when they're dead get back to our house and this old guy has this massive yacht he's our neighbor I was like oh what are you gonna do with that he's like oh it'll just get destroyed and I was like what oh he's
(00:52) like you should be fine I said just go to the third story first two floors of quad and Layla at this point is just like we're getting off this [ __ ] mileage she was like Charter a plate and I was like Mindy this is like the beginning of our wealth and I was like I Googled I call a plane I put it on speakerphone you need to get off where do we go he was like it'll be 70 grand and like we both looked each other and I was like so we're excited she was like yeah we're decided we both had come to completely separate conclusions from
(01:15) that number I was like so we're staying and she's like so we're going right and then she looks she's like what is my life worth to you I was like are you [ __ ] kidding me 35 Grand to save my life okay well it wasn't 35 it was 70. so I call like three other Charters and I'm like I got a guy who says he could do it for 50.
(01:33) and he was like I'll do it for 40. I called Other Guys by the way this is the last day you can get off the island and so like literally like he's like I gotta call some more to get a price I was like oh my God can we have four hours I got a guy who's like I'll do it for 28 and I was like cool he's like but you have to leave in two hours went straight to the airport and they were like oh actually it's coming faster we thought like these will be the last planes out we got on the plane and it was the first time in my life where money actually did something like
(01:55) useless [Music] okay [Music] for a Guana spotting I was getting in my car at the gym the other day I get in the car and I have the window down and this guy's like hey and I was like so like I actually announced my presence like whenever I walked through him I'm like I'm here if she doesn't hear me she just freaks up when you sat in the chair in the [ __ ] dark like a psycho and then you got mad at me when I cried he scared me so bad I started crying I woke up and he wasn't in bed right then I go to the bathroom I come back out I
(02:36) just assume he's left I just hear Hey scream and like cuddle and then I just start crying and then he's like what the [ __ ] I was trying not to wake you like I'm awake [Music] I made podcasts for four years going on everybody I am coming to you with one uh that I am excited about and like real talk they were just as good as the ones I have now years not like oh I did it for 90 days four years two to three podcasts a week every week and then on the fifth year it hit the real real it was just packaged as gym specific I'd say like my biggest
(03:18) learning of even the last year to two years of my career has been packaging everything I was taught early in my career is Niche down and so I did that and I maximized a niche but like at some point you maximize a niche and you have to go further I always am like slow to make those big moves because I want to make sure I'm not doing it out of being add that was a super tough call September 19 September 20 rebranded it as the game I just remember there was one day I was like I don't feel like talking about gym stuff anymore I can
(03:47) talk about business but like a lot of it for me has always been I'm so afraid to talk about something that that like I want to make sure I'm Legit if I'm gonna talk about it when I had the gyms hey guys I'm Alex and I'm the owner of United Fitness I had six I did six and then I did 30 plus turnarounds before I ever made a single piece of content like how you could run a gym better so I was like okay well I've been to 30 plus markets I had six on my own I was like I feel confident in saying like these things work better than these ones I
(04:10) wanted to over credentialize myself for whatever content I was going to make so that I felt like I could take whatever heat someone was gonna throw at me because I'd be like well here's why I think that like here's my evidence and I think that approach has been good it just takes longer I think the jerseys are dope can I try that on I could Rock a little a little double double if you look at McConaughey when he went from rom-com rom-com rom-com he basically like disappeared from the scene and then came back and like did
(04:36) Dallas Buyers Club Wolf of Wall Street and these other movies where he took like serious roles on Etc I was making all gym stuff I wanted to push myself away from all gym stuff kale became more public-facing I kind of slumped to the background only thing I produced at that point was the podcast which I'd rebranded as the game but I still wasn't doing anything else that was public and I was like a year or two and then I started making content publicly so I feel like sometimes you have to like give a little bit of distance kind of
(04:58) like reset and then you go out with like whatever the new kind of Direction you want to go is to me exactly what I did at the Q a for the VIP day I'm gonna get up there I'm going to write all of the topics I want to talk about and I'm just going to like hit them in whatever order feels good I feel good about it or it'll blow I envisioned a day where we have like the shareholder meetings where all the companies come out and we had that big Convention of all the portfolio companies that'd be cool the whole theme of the
(05:29) presentation is actually on strategy which is like I'll be like what the [ __ ] would that mean and then I'll break it down but like it just means do anything get the Mustang for the buck dude you guys are killing The Vibes I heard the Vibes like yeah I'm gonna briefly hit on brand it's like if you build a personal brand then you'll make more money from that than your gym but then if it's like what are we solving for you know what I mean it's the principle it's not about yeah [Music] rather than do slides which is normally
(06:03) what I do I actually want to draw the stuff live with you and I think it's more engaging that way if you've ever seen like a math problem on a board and it's just like all done versus like someone walking through the math it's different that's at least the theory and if it sucks you can tell me at the end brand isn't actually a thing it's an association we make between things that we know and things that people don't know which is usually our company if you think about a brand like a bouquet of flowers a bouquet of flowers isn't
(06:31) actually a thing it's many things put together and then we put it in our heads as an idea as one but it doesn't it's not actually anything because if you spill it on the floor it's not a bouquet anymore think of a brand as a bouquet of flowers but it's your bouquet of flowers and what you're putting inside of that bouquet are the individual intangible ideas that you want to associate together with the thing that people don't know about which is usually your company and so if I were to say some things about my brand you'd probably
(06:56) know that I have the best calves ever right so that would be something that's like associated with my brand dessert that's something that's associated with my brand now those are like fun little doodads but hopefully some of the things that you really associate with my brand are giving first providing value being patient doing the boring work and the reason brand and reputation is so hard to maintain is because so many people want to rub their [ __ ] on yours so let's say here's my bouquet then I've got this sad flower so
(07:27) this is a sad face flower if I handed my wife this bouquet all of the Roses are perfect and there's this one that's just wilted and dead the bouquet the brand the perception of it massively shifts even with one [ __ ] up flower and so that's why creating a brand is much more about cultivating deliberately the associations you want to make with the thing you have that people don't know with the things that your ideal audience likes that you want them to like too thank you [Music] oh thanks huh oh yeah good different
(08:08) it was great because you were just yourself cool this used to be the first song in my uh playlist for working out get my calves going I can choreograph way more like Symphony of feelings and visuals and charts and graphs when I do the presentation I mean from a prep time though way less my presentations are typically five slides per minute because I actually think about it as like a movie I'm gonna do a voiceover on a film there's this amazing video I think it's called Death by PowerPoint it was basically just like one idea one image
(08:37) that's it next idea next image that's it can you do that you're like that's only like 30 40 seconds and you're like that's why it's so many slides yeah I mean you saw 840 slides for the training thing we're gonna do that's how you build great training I always enjoy meet and greets with mosination because I get to hear like the real problems that you guys are going through but I get to go a little bit deeper than I normally can on like comments or like a short piece which makes it one of my favorite ways to interact just in general what would
(09:00) be your number one advice on how to get the attractive talent because some people say you want to make yourself some people say you want to try to post from other places I think you do both I think it's an and you want to have all the training you can because that gets you cheaper talent that you then level up but it costs time the more money you get the more you buy Talent rather than building it and so there's times you spend all this time training somebody then you realize that they're a [ __ ] dumbass if you were to internalize it
(09:24) it's like I'm not good at picking the right people I'm not good at training them like because those are controllables rather than the other person if you internalize it so for a gym for example writing ads on indeed and Engineering like that or hiring like within your clients I think both there's all those ways you can reach outs you can do content you can run ads like just like you get customers you get employees same exactly are you talking about your store with your dad consulting job with the government and
(09:53) it seemingly fancy but yeah you just weren't happy yeah but we'll give you the courage to be okay and disappointing your dad I just didn't feel like being alive anymore for me that was my that was my thing it doesn't have to be that for you but for me it was like well I don't feel like being alive and so I like the actual phrase I kept repeating myself was like I have to die to him in order to live for me I needed a new life and if that many wasn't gonna accept that new life which you didn't in the beginning
(10:15) I just had to be cool with them and I think that's a lot of that's like the the journey for a lot of guys like becoming a man is like when you start valuing your own opinion of you more than your father your cousin or whatever's so it's like you basically elevate your own opinion itself than other people's and then you become more independent like that's how you become independent it was my hardest thing oh I think I got a job I did we got one pick one all right all right guys I gotta head oh you're good you're good you're
(10:38) good I gotta go all right [Music] I actually really like the Explorer mine's got like fighting bodybuilding it's fighting a bodybuilding comedy is harder to click on because the other two are so much more visual if there's just a dude with a mic I'm like I don't know if it's gonna be funny but I do know this guy's jacked it would be interesting if if images make a comeback because I will say this when I look at someone's their profile I actually go only for the images because I don't feel like watching videos it just feels more
(11:08) chill so my next book is coming out and I'm stoked so here's a sneak peek it'll be interesting because I think part of what I want to talk about maybe even at the just I don't know if I want to do it maybe it'll be like they're probably because it's gonna be like raw maybe post I'll be like how to get the most out of this book when I look at my audience 76 of people want to start a business so like you should read it from the beginning to the end because you won't have context on any of this if you have a business lead magnets referrals
(11:36) because everyone has customers the core four-way that you advertise and then the way to make that way better which is the core foreign steroids and then from there you know read the other ones hey sweetie hey boo boo hey supermodel 's doing her thing that's my wife I see that yeah I'm starting to connect with the whole thing she's the range in the operation right yes she is I'm the pretty face you guys there you go what I want to do today talk about how to get other people to do stuff like making money these are the
(12:15) principles like I said that we have used to build gym launch Prestige labs and now acquisition.com [Music] [Applause] your book helped me make like 300 Grand this year so really appreciate that again really it could be really good acquisition.com no it's great no that's super sweet thank you so much man all the carnival guys are like vegetables are actually bad for you do you want to be a bird so it's just you and me on stage last week we'll just do it like we always do we're coming can't hear them doing Q a in front of a drawing board
(12:56) that is my happiest place I was incredibly impatient and it's really tough because a year is five percent of your life when you're 19 and so it feels like a really long time and so the idea of waiting one year two year three years just like 15 of your life you're like holy [ __ ] there's a reason that the sayings like good things take time like Rome wasn't built in a day those settings exist because good [ __ ] does take time to build and when you have that massive list of should Do's it does take two years or three years to
(13:26) build something exceptional and that's the reason most people can't do it it's recognizing that when you're 19 you absolutely are in a season of learning not a season of earning which means you should be willing to work for Far Below what you believe you are worth in order to learn to increase what that worth is and I had this exact conversation with my neighbor who was 16 at the time and I just said I can guarantee that you will be a millionaire when you're 30 if you'll give me 10 years I was like well you sign that contract
(13:52) he said yeah I was like okay then you're gonna eat [ __ ] for 10. and 10 is a long time because he's three years in and he's like seven more not being in a rush is the single thing that I would tell my 19 year old self and being willing to do anything to learn new skills who to hire what to hire as far as offloading service you're always making a trade with your time to do stuff to get money back at least from a business perspective and so if you're paying someone with money to get your time back they need to have an
(14:24) alternative vehicle that's going to get a higher return than what you're paying them right that's the fundamentals of when you're trading your time for money the order that you trade or replace the time is if you look at your entire week of activities and Layla has a great activity around this which is doing a Time study make an Excel sheet you don't need fancy software to do this and you have all the hours of the day put into 15-minute increments and this may sound tedious it's also really effective and will make you more money than it costs
(14:49) you time because when you actually have to write what you're doing every 15 minutes you realize that you are not going to waste seven hours of your day not doing [ __ ] because you want to get credit for it in your own head you do your 15-minute increments you write down the [ __ ] and at the end of the week you're like okay of these things what is the single largest block of time that I can give away for the lowest amount of money Million store for excellence tonight what are your prayers to your life I'm gonna hit this one really quickly of
(15:18) course meaning of life um so real quick answer for me my purpose of life is to learn and I defined yesterday learning as same condition new behavior and so I think that the majority of my life will continue to show me similar conditions and if I can become and behave in the way that ideally want to do at the end of my life then I've become the person that I want to become and all of the stimuli between the damn born and the day I die exists to help shape that person thanks would you like to talk about the meaning
(15:50) of your life okay I don't know a lot of the people there were like just mosination and were not Demars not a single questions about chips I was I was surprised last day here at Jim con I've got one more talk and we're gonna go and ask some of the attendees for more questions about their businesses I had this class in music teaching everybody a project basically just like really heavily researched one song and that was the whole class it was like one person would research the song they'd play the song for three minutes
(16:18) or whatever it was and then 27 minutes would be them giving like a full report and now that I say it out loud I think he just figured out how to not teach anything brilliant like I've got the highest grade in the class did his thing on hurt as soon as you play that song I'm like yes like honestly I think that was one of the best things ever happened on Nine Inch Nails the fact that Johnny Cash covered someone else's song have you seen the music video that I'll play for you it's sick foreign so good dude he died seven months after
(16:54) this video These are some sandals Water Sandals I think or hiking sandals I wear these because I can wear these in the most environments because I can wear these to the gym which I actually really like I can walk in them I can wear these in water I can wear these on the beach they're closed toe so I can wear them most restaurants and I don't have to wear socks what else do you need you many times I go to the pool and come out and go to a restaurant after going to the gym and presenting all the same form dude this is a [ __ ] Darwin outfit
(17:19) literally yesterday we did the talk and then I went to the pool and then I walked and then went to a fancy restaurant drying like 20 minutes yep and these are stretchy they're elastic it's the best everyone else's shorts are inferior one you don't even know about that like yours not adaptable we get wet you're [ __ ] you go to a nice restaurant you're fine I go to the gym you're fine all right I'm up the third time I've been introduced [Music] thank you we're gonna do a cool Deep dive together on a topic that I hold near dear to my
(17:51) heart which is closing the difference between help and manipulation is intention either way you're going to change someone's Behavior or your intention is to change someone's Behavior if the prospect knew everything that you knew they should make the decision to buy if you're being really honest with yourself if the prospect knew everything that you knew and then they would choose not to buy then you are deceiving them which is no bueno but this presidential will be the best resolution on sales you've ever heard
(18:12) the worst presentation on sales you've ever heard or somewhere in between that is a promise Charlie Munger big hero of mine he said we have a high moral responsibility to be rational sometimes you've got logical buyers sometimes you've got emotional buyers there are different types of people who buy in different styles just like their different selling Styles different buying Styles people want to believe you they want to buy you just have to help their logical brains justify the decision like most people are like hey I
(18:34) can make you a lot more money they want to believe you you just have to help them justify hey I can help you get into your high school jeans I can make you look the way you did 20 years ago they want to believe you make the decisions help yourself Implement like crazy take over ownership realize that there are no silver bullets but some things can move you closer to your goals and when those rare acceleration opportunities come in life take them because either win or you learn and both of those get you closer
(18:56) to wherever it is you want to go thank you overall it's an awesome trip above Jim Khan it's great to see the gym owners and our community there Jim Lords comment below if you want to see more Vlog stuff like this bye

I Tried This Simple Business Strategy for 60 Days. This is what happened - YouTube

Transcript:
(00:00) I own 13 portfolio companies and in one of them I unlocked $6 million of Enterprise Value in 60 days by solving three problems and I did it with data so this is actually a sequel video and you may remember our three wise men they came and they were sad because they had problems that they wanted to fix and they're already making twice as much money just from the fixes that we did from the sales so we went from 56 units per month sold to 93 units again in 60 days and so the problem that we encountered after we doubled the sales
(00:27) now they had twice as many people going to get fulfilled on whatever ever the thing is that they sold what was once shaky had completely been obliterated because it was already tough when they had the current amount but with double they were completely lost so one of the never ending issues in business is that there's something called the problem solution cycle it works like this you got problems you've got Solutions that's ugly as [ __ ] anyways so the problem is when you solve a problem with a solution you then create another problem so if I
(00:52) 10x your sales what's the next problem going to be and so we had to fix that problem now we wanted to track these three stats because they didn't even have LTV track the the first was time to First value the second was customer satisfaction and then we had our Ascension rates or the absolute amount of money that they were making on the back end which is after someone buys the first thing they buy the second thing right so let's start with where they were at and by the way this e is not something fancy it just should be there
(01:16) but y'all are cool so we we'll go with it all right time to First value is a really interesting statistic it's probably one of the one of the ones that I care the most about in any kind of service so in the world of content like watching TV there's different shows that you might watch so each show they calculate an actual retention point and so Breaking Bad for example is one of the best shows of all time they found that if someone made it to the third episode they had like an 87% likelihood of finishing the entire
(01:43) Five Seasons if they got to that point and so different shows have a different retention point that hooks the viewer for the Long Haul and so that's what we're ultimately driving towards you can call it a retention point you can call it activation you can call it whatever you want but there's a key moment that transforms the customer relationship into a long-term commitment with you and what your goal is to pull that as for far forward to the present as you possibly can you don't have to deliver the ultimate result immediately I mean
(02:08) the faster you can do that the better but what you want to do is break it into many small chunks and show leading indicators of success so in other words progress and the more times that you can break down an outcome into tinier chunks the more reinforced the customer will be for staying with you so for example if I was in a high touch agency so I did marketing services for someone and let's say we touch base once every two weeks right now I do a lot of things between those two weeks for the customer but if
(02:35) every two weeks I correspond with them then they're going to get reinforced every 2 weeks for me doing stuff now consider a different way of doing it I onboard them and then every day I send them what I did to work on their behalf at the end of that 2 weeks they would have had 14 different positive interactions with me versus one you can take what you're currently doing not change much about it and simply communicate it differently so that they can perceive a faster time to First value value that's the idea here for
(03:01) example in the gym launch world in the beginning it was if we can get someone to do a high ticket sale in the first 7 days it would triple the LTV for us so then instead of trying to think about churn or any of these metrics we said let's just try and make sure every single person gets that sale as fast as possible and so that's what we'd measure the way that we eventually would go to was how quickly they would launch an internal campaign for us and how much they generated from that so our goal then became how quickly can we get them
(03:26) to send the emails that we want them to send that's two different examples of different time to First values and without further Ado let us show you the before data so for the time to First value was 47 days got to improve that imagine you buy something and it takes you more than 6 weeks almost 7 weeks to hit that first real value the second way was the customer satisfaction score and survey says what was their customer satisfaction non-existent cuz they didn't even track the data I'm giving you the real stuff here ascension all
(03:56) right so what percentage of customers do they send or how much money were they making from ascensions on the back end survey says $0 because they didn't have a back end when I say backend I mean again the second thing or the thing after the first thing they were selling these are not pretty statistics that's okay though this means that again for us as investors huge opportunity for improvement and that's where I get great returns so product problem number one hi churn what's churn Alex great question it's the percentage of customers that
(04:22) leave from this month to next month so if I start the month with 100 customers those same 100 customers a month later how many of them choose to renew so if 95% of them choose to renew then I have 5% CH so this particular business was a 16we implementation so 16 weeks is how long people were committing to on the front end the problem was people weren't even making it through the first thing all the way the reason this is so important is that is one of the largest profit drivers in a business so let me give you an example if we had two ways
(04:51) to make X all right and X dollar from keeping a customer means they stay for three more months an xll from getting a new customer means we have to pay to get a your customer so we pay Mr YouTube or we pay Mr Facebook $11,000 to get X or we could pay $60 in staff or labor to get the same xll so let's say I had to pay for an hour of extra work per month for my team to reach out or hop on a phone call or two 30 minute phone calls with the customer per month so we got 30 minutes * 2 30 minutes * 2 30 minutes times 2 now you might be like man that's
(05:26) a whole lot of work well let's say I'm paying 20 bucks an hour and so this is $20 this is $20 this is $20 going be like wow again so much work but look at my return the $60 to get the X versus $1,000 to get the x is like 17 times more profitable and if I'm an investor which everyone who runs a business is just on a micro level that's a way better return and so I should be allocating as much effort into that bucket until I can't do any more in this bucket and then go to my less efficient ways of allocating Capital the biggest
(05:59) and easiest problem that that we identified was that their customer success team was arbitrarily checking in all right meaning they would just be like hey what's going on let me go take some of your time with No Agenda rather than being one proactive and two knowing what problem the person should already be experiencing at this point in their 16we implementation cuz after all for this particular product they were taking everyone through a choreographed experience except it wasn't a choreographed experience which is not
(06:26) the way to do business so if you know that everyone in week one or two is going to be suffering from one of these two problems then you'd start the call with saying hey most people this point are at Point a or point B where are you right now and they're automatically boom you're right into it and they're like this is value additive this is actually helping me whereas you're like what's going on John and it's just like uh everything sucks and you're like oh why does everything suck it's like you don't seem informed you don't seem on top of
(06:49) it you don't seem proactive and just by doing this it sets an entirely different tone for the customer relationship because they're like these guys know what they're doing and I feel better about paying them and this is why knowing that key Milestone that you're driving towards that activation point that time to First value is so key because what you do is now all of your communication and all of your efforts are going to be targeted and optimized to get this one single outcome right so if I know that I need to get somebody to
(07:12) get their first sale in 7 Days that's high ticket in order to Triple their lifetime value think about the resources that I can put there so if someone goes from $177,000 in LTV to $50,000 in LTV which is much more like the stats were for gym launch I have 20 $33,000 of resources that I have at my disposal of almost all profit to deploy to get that one thing to happen so how many resources do you think I should put towards that a ton and so when we get on the call we're like hey man let's send that email out together right now they
(07:42) like oh I don't know how to do it don't worry I've got my tech guy with me here we're going to connect the things that you were probably struggling with were you struggling with that oh my God this is great wow they're on top of this cool by the end of this call we're going to send that email and then the likelihood if they sent the email that they' make the sale extremely high and that's how you can drive towards this outcome if we haven't even even Define that we're like hey where are you at in the steps and
(08:03) they're like this and you're like okay cool well I haven't I haven't been able to get to it yet okay don't worry about it you know take your time I don't want to overwhelm you like waste of time waste of your time waste your staff's time and you're ultimately not going to extend the LTV and get them a good experience problem number two survey says no backend all right remember back end is the second thing you sell what these guys were doing and it's a it's a very common mistake is to say hey after the 16 weeks you can stay in the
(08:28) community participate in all the stuff that we have absolutely free and that's usually just an attempt to sell more people in the front end but it actually creates lots of problems because what you do is you create an endless liability for a onetime income right so if I say hey I'll personal train you for free after 6 months if you pay the first 6 months it's like well sure I got the first 6 months but now the rest of my life if I'm want to be a man of my word I have to train this person that's a terrible unending liability even though
(08:52) in the beginning it feels like it's a good idea the other issue is that it actually drives less client success so let me explain if I know that I'm going to have to to start paying more at a certain time in the future I'm going to be more likely to take action faster right if I know that I can do it whenever it means I do it never so the idea is we want to have that sting at the end that they know about so that we can drive forward that time to Value so you remember this little problem solution cycle I was talking about we
(09:17) got our problems we got our solution well the good news is is that you can actually use this to make more money because if you properly solve the first problem that they're presenting with with your solution then you should also introduce the next problem and here's the key point you should know what that problem is better than your customer does why cuz you've done this a zillion times and so they might think hey once I lose weight all my problems are going to be gone but that's not true there's a lot of other things that they're going
(09:42) to have to do as a result of that they're going to have lose skin they're going to have to change their wardrobe now they want a sixpack rather than losing weight you're just going to introduce new problems and so after you get someone down to their High School weight the next solution you might have for them would be our six-pack program right and so you lead them down to their ultimate goal but if you said hey when someone walks in the door let me get you a sixpack they're like dude I'm just trying to get my high school weight and
(10:03) so you have to meet them where they're currently at and so this is how great businesses continue to stay and profit from customers for years is by knowing well one effectively solving the first problem you promised that you were going to solve but then because you're so good at solving the first problem actually creating the second most businesses don't solve the first problem and then don't give themselves the opportunity to solve the next one and as a result don't make nearly as much money as they could problem number three no metric tracking
(10:29) seems like a common theme doesn't it and given the uh the sheet that I showed you earlier two out of the three were basically not tracked or non-existent right and honestly it's more common than You' think you know what I can absolutely promise you is that if you don't measure a metric you're not going to improve it and so one of the beautiful things about once you start tracking the metrics is that then you can tie incentives to achieving those metrics so both on an individual level and at A Team level because incentives
(10:51) is what's going to drive behavior and so if you want your clients to have this Milestone which we can now track with metrics then we can incentivize and put real resources behind making sure that they actually achieve them and people are willing to take the extra step go to the extra mod to make sure this happens because they get compensated for it but if we don't have this up front we can't do any of those things so we went over three problems on their back end right is that they weren't delivering on promises and we knew that because they
(11:17) had high turn they didn't even really have a backend and they had no metrics around success right you can predict how good someone is at whatever skill is based on the quality and the quantity of the data they track and these guys track none of it so we can kind of guess how good the back end was and mind you that's okay right like we still chose to invest in this company because we saw opportunity we saw the Spirit of the founders we saw the desire to get better and that's all I really need as long as someone has work ethic and they have
(11:40) desire to continue to improve cool we can hop this stuff like that's why we do what we do but if you're at like $100,000 a year $500,000 a million a year like it's normal to not have all these pieces that's why it takes time to build something great I don't want this video to be taken as like I need to stop what I'm doing and start doing this this might not be the constraint of your business but when you are there you'll know what to do all right all right so let's look at our handy danda data sheet and now you know what's going on you
(12:04) have some context you know what the problems are and you know what our current stats are with our weird before put in the comments below what you think you would do to fix these problems in this business I know you guys want to see the after numbers and I'm going to show them to you in a moment but before I do I'm going to show you step by- step which Solutions we did in what order so that we actually achieve those solution number one improve C customer onboarding what we did was they didn't have an onboarding process for getting customers
(12:33) to start they got sold and they got tossed into this big bucket of other customers it's obviously not good and so what we did was we created a choreographed onboarding process and that was from the moment the sale closes the moment they got off the phone all the way until they begin implementation so here's a fun stat for you people will make a lasting impression about your business within the first 24 hours after the transaction wild so many people maybe you watching this don't really have any good communication or process
(13:00) in the first 24 hours you might be like oh yeah Sandra's going to touch base with you in 4 days dude way too long from now so if we sell someone we want multiple points of communication multiple points of open and closed loops and what I mean by that is saying I'm going to make this promise and I'm going to keep this promise I'm going to make this promise I'm going to keep this promise I want to get like four five six promises opened and fulfilled within the first 24 hours cuz they're like man these guys are on it even if something
(13:23) that you would do all at once just take that one thing that has six checkpoints and make it six individual promises and fulfill all of them there'll be so much more impressed with you so we did a lot of things to fix the back end and I had my team actually write down the things that we did in this business so that I could have all the up-to-date details for you so we did four things just to improve this customer onboarding experience so number one is that we created a sales and CS team synchronicity meaning we just aligned
(13:45) both teams through the internal handoff process we actually created a handoff process so that it's like hey before we go I'm going to connect with Sandra Sandra is going to be your point of contact and as a way of life I'm going to give you this this thing that you can give to your team bam famam book a meeting from a meeting there should never be a who's in no man's land they should never be lost in the process they should always know when the next communication and the next correspondence in terms of meeting is
(14:06) going to be the next thing we did was we started tracking all client goals so on the sales call we would ask client what their goal is we could understand why they really wanted to buy this thing then what we did was we passed it on to the customer service team and when they would hop on with the customer they'd be like hey Johnny told me that you're trying to retire your wife or hey Johnny told me you wanted to clean your house or whatever it was because you have a wedding coming up and so you have this clear reason why that we reiterate to
(14:29) the customer and they're like wow I didn't even have to tell this person these guys are on it notice this recurring theme is that they're like wow these guys are airtight they go above and beyond the third thing we did was reset expectations with the customer so the sales team is going to set expectations obviously CU they're selling but now that they're on the other side of the pay wall you get to reset the expectations and this should be restating and reemphasizing exactly what the salesperson said if you're
(14:52) disconnect or to disjointed between sales and CS it creates a lot of dissonance and people like wait this isn't what I signed up for and that's what you don't want so right right now you get a lot of cold feet or back outs or people asking for refunds really early it's usually because there's a disconnect between first transaction or first conversation and second conversation then after resetting the Expeditions we would resell them on the purchase and this is important because especially if it's a big purchase or
(15:13) it's an involved purchase meaning a gym membership isn't a big purchase but it's a big commitment for the customer and so we want to resell them on their why and why it's going to be worth it tell them some stories of people just like them who were in the same position who saw the outcome they ultimately want and the fourth thing we did to improve the onboarding process is that we set the outline of steps to achieve the target this is really important as we're saying listen you want this thing let me tell you what the steps are going to look
(15:39) like and once you outline them we continue to engage the client throughout and so that whole process became standardized and that was the fourth process step that we used to improve the onboarding process so you're like wait a second we have one problem we have one fix but this fix had four pieces to it and the answer is yes is that you're not going to fix churn with one thing it's going to be many small things it's going to be many golden BB's no silver bullets product fix number two over here so we implemented a CRM
(16:08) and customer kpi tracking so if you don't measure it you can't improve it or rather you won't know even if you did we have a lot of pros at holdco for acquisition. comom and so when we take a company on we're like listen let's put all the systems in place and just install that stuff so we can prove all these metrics it's one of the easiest ways that we just provide tons of value and grow the Enterprise value of the business overall so that's exactly what we did and my team gave me some notes to make sure I can give you even more
(16:31) details on it so we started tracking time to value and we started tracking turn within the CRM automatically and so this allowed us to in real time see how many customers are hitting their activation points and how many customers are leaving there are two types of indicators in business youve got leading and lagging all lagging indicators are like churn is that you don't fix churn churn is a result so you have to do things before the bad result happens to fix it and so we know if someone doesn't show up to the gym for a month that
(16:58) becomes a leading indicator that they're going to cancel if someone doesn't log into Netflix for a long period of time the likely the cancel goes up compared to somebody who logs in and watches every day one of the biggest unlocks in a business especially in a recurring Revenue business is figuring out what are the leading indicators that get someone to leave or stay and then driving towards those leading indicators to make sure that they don't leave and with the CRM we were to automate customer satisfaction surveys to all
(17:22) customers in real time so we could see how we were doing and segment it by customer service representative and so we could see okay the teams X but Sandy ain't dragging her weight and she is sandbagging true to her name and so we have to give Sandy the boot or you know get Sandy up to Snuff so that she doesn't drag the whole team down but we wouldn't be able to do that unless we first were able to show Sandy hey Sandy here's a stat that says that you are worse than everyone else which means that you have to do something better or
(17:49) do something different than you currently are why don't you follow the process that everybody else is following you'll probably be able to win too which Segways almost perfectly into commissioning the team for customer success now a lot of people think that the only people who should get commissions are salese and I think that's silly cuz believe it or not a lot more of your profit is driven from customer success so we did was with the new CRM that we had implemented notice how these things kind of happen in
(18:12) sequence right like we had to hit the CRM once we had the CRM then we had the metrics now once we had the metrics we could say hey these are your metrics that you need to improve and this is the Target or range that we want your metric to be in and then we can commission them weighted against how far into that range they were so if you're at 100% you're going to get 2x if you're at 50% you're going to get X if you're at 0% you're going to get 0x that's the idea with this implementation program it was 16 weeks and if people are getting to 12
(18:41) weeks then it would be weighted as 12 versus 16 so it's going to be weighted at 75% I'm giving this as a simple example but you can use this concept to commission anyone for any particular metric that you want to drive so the whole idea is that once we had the few metrics that we knew drove success we would get more people to become successful which got more people to stay and pay longer and then would naturally lead to the next problem which is that we now had all these customers who were finishing and had WIP or willingness to
(19:10) pay and be sold more stuff and so that's exactly what we did survey says no back end built back end and so what we did was we actually did Implement a wall at the end of the 16 weeks so rather than saying it's 16 weeks and then after that you just get this community we said you have to pay to stay but we had driven all the other metrics to make sure that people were succeeding prior to the end of that so we had people who were ready to move on and saying hey what's the next thing and so what we did was we rolled this out
(19:35) really slowly because we didn't want to shock the system and so right as soon as we rolled it out we got 10% of customers to ascend into the paying option which is great and then as we tracked it over the next 60 days we got it up to 27% of people ascending into the paid option this is pure created revenue on the back end for no real additional cost besides the cost of this commission that we had to add the customer customer service team and a onetime implementation of a CRM so think about this on returns on
(20:02) Capital you'd have this backend that would continue to stack and stack and stack over time and that then translates to how much more you can market and sell on the front end because if your cost to acquire stays the same but you double your LTV you can sometimes Market 10 times more not just twice as much so in this particular instance cuz I told you in the beginning that we added $6 million in Enterprise Value there's two elements that add that really drove EV one was when you add a recurring element into a business it decreases the risk
(20:29) that Revenue will disappear right so if there's recurring Revenue it will become more valuable and so this back end was a recurring backend the second way that it increase Enterprise Value is that not just changing the nature of the revenue but also changing the amount of profit that we were making because that added Revenue that we added to the back end per month ultimately became profit to the business on the bottom line and so we have profit which then gets multiplied by high multiple because it's recurring and so those two things
(20:56) together unlock even more Enterprise VI value which is why some of this incredibly boring stuff like customer success can make you a ton of money so let's talk data boom all right so I told you before we had our time to Value this should be time to value by the way but it's okay so we have time to Value we have our customer satisfaction and we have Ascension before we had 47 days non-existent and $0 so we did these things and our time to Value went from 47 days to survey says ugly ass hair 34 days our customer
(21:30) satisfaction went from non-existent cuz we weren't even tracking it to survey says and we were able to do this because we had implemented our CRM 98% so we actually had pretty happy customers overall which is pretty cool now if I were to piece me all this out 98 I'm like a little sus what I'm guessing is this is probably right after our really good choreographed onboarding is that we did the customer satisfaction surveys when you want to start parsing this out you can start tracking them at uh week zero week 2 week 4 week 8 week 12 now if
(22:00) you do that many surveys people will start resenting the fact you're asking surveys so it's really kind of a push pool of how able you are to collect the data and how you collect the data so for example if I already get on a call which I do have regularly scheduled and say hey by the way on a scale from 1 to 10 how likely would you be for a friend they might give us a score now that score might be different than if it was sent to them voluntarily the other part to add even more mud to the water the only people who choose to respond to a
(22:23) customer satisfaction survey are typically either very happy or very sad but you usually lose the metal so this is just all to say it is a metric that you can track it doesn't mean it's the end all Beall so I could try and like brag and say look 98% we totally crushed it I I would suspect that this is because we put it right after a choreographed process which is good all this tells me is that people enjoyed the onboarding which is better than not having one to begin with and the last one was ascension all right and
(22:49) if you're like wait where did these $6 million Enterprise Value come from gr roll please from $0 to $140,000 in backend that we're able to create so this is over 60 days so it's two months and this will continue to increase but if we just split this in half in it's $70,000 a month in profit that we were able to add to the business over the year that's just under a million bucks and if you multiply that by six which would probably be a standard Enterprise Value multiple for a company of this size then we added about $6 million in Enterprise
(23:19) Value to the business but we could not have done this one if we hadn't fixed all of these other things first we improved the customer onboarding we then implemented the CRM and created kpi tracking so that we could then commission the customer success team on the activation points and the leading indicators that would ultimately Drive success for the clients and we had the customer satisfaction surveys that we could also Implement to make sure that people and their reps in any ways even from a behavioral standpoint just them
(23:47) knowing that whenever they talk to somebody they're going to get surveyed afterwards and you can segment it by rep it just keeps people more honest so they're more on their game they're prepare for the calls they say hey I listened to your last call I have these steps I outlined how we're going to support you and how we're going to reverse engineer your success all of these things were only possible from these first three steps and then when we make the next ask because we fulfilled our first promises a certain percentage
(24:10) of those customers were willing to say yes in the beginning it was 10% and now it's 27% and it'll be even more in the future as we continue to get more and get better processes in place to win and if this stuff was interesting to you you might be wondering why I have the mosy Lisa in my hands this is a mega video that I just made of how to build a $100 million plus company and if that sounds just ah I'm showing you some hints there's way more where that came from just click on my face and you'll find out more

Transcript:
(00:01) I've lost $100 million over my career and in this video I'm going to break down every single one of my mistakes so you don't have to my first big loss was crypto and I'm going to be order these roughly lowest to most amount of money at the very end I'll give you the Big Kahuna the one that I lost absolutely a shitload on that you'll probably be able to learn the most from in 2017 a buddy of mine was like hey man you should buy this stuff called ethereum it was 100 bucks I set up the account I put a million dollars in and like right before I'm about to click per purchase at $100
(00:32) it like went down to like 93 and I was like ah I don't know about this and so I decided not to pull the trigger long story short and then you know 30X from there or whatever it was this next time around a few years later it had been going like this and then right here Bitcoin was at $60,000 ethereum was really high too I called my buddy up not the same guy different buddy and I was like hey man I'm going to get it on this and he was like I'll put a million bucks in if you do and I was like fine so we put a million bucks in and then lost 500
(01:03) Grand in a matter of weeks but there's two things that I think were good reminders for me from this whole experience the first is that me making a million dollar bet at the time was not a huge percentage of my income or my net worth and I made more than that every month anyways I didn't plan on having this be how I made money I made money doing stuff that are fundamental business things and then I basically made a bet or a gamble which realistically it was just gambling the second big point was that warm buff and Charlie Monger talk about your sphere of confidence business is very much within
(01:34) that Marketing sales acquisition pricing product those are the things I'm very good at now outside of this is probably real estate and crypto and a bunch of other things that other people do and have spent lots of time developing their skill set those people should do those things I have no idea and I have just noticed the further away I get from my core the more money I lose and the closer I am to the core of what I'm good at the more money I make I will give you a a little tidbit that a a mentor gave
(02:07) to me if you know how to create wealth just create wealth don't [ __ ] with investing if you know how to make money and he gave that to me as advice and I try to remember that as like what am I good at and so I think it's important to think about what are the themes that are going to be around these mistakes cuz you're hopefully not going to repeat the mistake I'd rather you just get the lesson without the scar right and so number one out of my sphere of confidence number two I latched on to fomo I saw these people like man I would like to make quick fast easy money too when everyone thinks something is a good
(02:38) idea it's usually a bad idea whenever you feel that fomo I've now learned pause so the second big mistake I had uh was in real estate and you'll notice there's multiple big mistakes that I will make in real estate over my career and hopefully I sto making them this one was actually my first ever real estate investment so L and I have been making a ton of money uh in gym lunch for a few years now I think at the time we probably had I want to say like 20 million bucks in cash so buddy of mine's like hey I've got this guy he sells
(03:05) houses in Ohio cuz houses in Ohio are actually really cheap when I got on the phone with the guy and he said yeah I buy them for 30 I fix them for 10 grand so I have 40,000 and then I flip it to you for 50 so I make 10 on the spread he's like that's my business model I just sell a lot of them I was like okay that's cool he's like well do you want to buy five do you want to buy 10 what do you want to buy and this is from a lesson that I had learned earlier on less money I was like why don't I dip my
(03:29) toe in like let's not lose a shitload of money if this doesn't work but I said why don't I just buy one of these houses and see what happens it turned out that the house was not in fact a three-bedroom it was actually a two-bedroom house and the third bedroom was actually in a closet that they had put a mattress into the house did not actually have electricity they were running it from the neighbor's house illegally the driveway was so in shambles that the people couldn't actually Park on it so tenants couldn't park there fixing the driveway on its own was like 7,000 now for a house that
(04:01) cost 5050 that's a huge chunk of what you put into as an investment now remember I'm trying to get like 6,000 a year uh a friend of mine who is in real estate different friend looked up the county records or whatever and found out that the guy who had sold it to me actually bought the house for $199,000 and had put no money into the house and so his business model was buy it for 19 flip it to 50 to people who don't know any better that was me and the tenant's paying $700 a month now all right so that was what we got we were able to rent this place for now $700 a
(04:27) month doesn't cover the the driveway that I had to repair it doesn't cover the electricity that I had to actually run from scratch into this thing to make it livable and honestly really kind tenants they were like hey you think you know it'd be nice if we could have our own electricity and like of course they [ __ ] should I didn't know I I was buying it out of state what did I have to do because he was unlivable I had to put him up in a hotel while we had to basically make this place livable and so
(04:51) that took like 30 days this family isn't hotel that I'm paying for this whole time as the landlord selling the house with the tenant in it I think for $20,000 because I was like just get rid of this [ __ ] thing but the thing that I lost Beyond just the 30 or $40 or $50,000 I lost in the deal was the amount of time effort and energy and emails and phone calls that went back and forth about this [ __ ] thing and for context at the time I'm making 50,000 a day in profit like I like I was like just [ __ ] get this out of my life what a mistake so anyways I called
(05:23) the guy up who sold me the house and I was like dude like what the [ __ ] and basically sto responding to my my attempts to reach out to him because it was apparent what he had done and I basically was like I just want to let you know I'm really grateful that you taught me this lesson for so cheap and he being the scumbag that he was said you're welcome he very much was aware of the fact that he was totally running a scam let me walk you through some of the lessons that I got from this so number one is that if it's too good to be true
(05:51) it usually is now he was telling me about 25% plus cash on cash returns right I caught a a buddy of mine who owns a billion dollar fund and I was like hey what do you think about this thing he he was like this doesn't make sense he's like cuz if he really was doing that he should just own all the houses like why would he why would he sell these houses and I was like no man you're just not a Believer too good to be true all right usually is and the thing is is the hard part about this one this one's really deceptive is that if
(06:14) you're in early on something sometimes it is really good but the thing that makes it the to be true part is that if no one else is aware of it there's this double-edged sword of like am I seeing some opportunity that's going to close in the marketplace or am I just about to get [ __ ] robbed blind the second thing is you'll see this lovely recurring friend we have here is that I saw my friend making money and I was like oh man I should do it and he was a business guy and I was like oh if he's a business guy he can do it I'm a BS guy I could do it he lost his ass too which leaves me to number
(06:41) three which is now if someone tells me about an opportunity that they're doing for investing which for me is now a much longer time Ron I say how long youve been in this deal for if someone says they've been doing it for less than 2 or three years I don't care point three is that what's the hold period if I'm hearing about something from somebody they better be doing it for multiple years before I'm going to even consider it and so what I would say I do now with these types of things is that one I'll do it with somebody but I want to do it with the guy so that guy who was on the
(07:10) phone with me selling me the property what I would do now is to say I'll buy a property that you buy and if they don't want to go on with me great then I'm not doing a deal in the beginning I was really greedy I was like no I don't want anybody have the upside now I'm happy to give Partners the upside because the more money they make the more they want to make it with me and we'll do it together and I'd rather have a very sure 20% than a really risky 40 and whenever I feel that little tickle in my stomach
(07:33) or the back of my neck where I'm like ooh I feel like I'm missing out I literally just stop and I say wait because every huge amount of money that I've made has never been from any investment it's been from me seeing an Arbitrage opportunity in marketing and sales and seeing that I can acquire a customer for $10 that's worth a th000 and then saying great let's Jam as much cash as humanely possible into that but that takes lots of iterations to get there and I was there every single step of the way it doesn't just appear on some spreadsheet showing how rich I'm going to get so mistake number two my
(08:02) little house in Ohio for $50,000 that taught me lessons far more valuable that have saved me way more than $50,000 over the rest of my investing career so $50,000 goes survey says goodbye so my third lovely mistake that I had was terrible Partners now I'm going to go through a few of these um and I'm going to ladder up to the worst partnership I had the first Partnerships I made I made because I was insecure I made them because I didn't think I could do it on my own I just partnered with people that I thought would know more than me just because they were there more or less and this is not any
(08:40) disrespect to those people it was my mistake not theirs I have had nine failed Partnerships in my entire life before I started making money nine different people that I was partnered with I'm going to give you the the nitty-gritty of every lesson I learned from all of them so the first partner that I ever took on was an adviser to told me hey you should partner with this guy to start a gym all right my very first gym and he said he's already got a gym in the neighborhood you want to be in you can start with his client tell base and just go into a bigger gym and come together and I was like okay that
(09:11) sounds good and he's like yeah you guys both have the exact same skill set and you have the the exact same business you guys should just split it and then I will take 10% for putting the deal together so you'll be 45 he'll be 45 and I'll be 10 for advising and putting this whole thing together and we both said sure now guess what the worst way to start a business partnership is you both have the exact same skill sets and you both bring the exact same thing to the table we're both bringing work and very little Capital to the table where we have the same business that we're trying
(09:42) to do and guess what most people do when they start a business exactly that so lesson number one of Partnerships they have to have something you don't so they either have to have time you don't they got to have money you don't or they got to got skills you don't that's it if they don't have one of those three things one of you isn't needed all right lesson number one they got to have something don't lesson number two you lose the most Equity day one so most people are so anal about how they want to sell their company for this amount of
(10:07) money and blah blah blah blah they're thinking about their Equity but day one they Lop half off and give it to somebody they L 2/3 off and give one/ third here and one/ third here because they've got three buddies and they say hey well there's three of us let's cut the pie into thirds and we'll go into business together doesn't work that way because often times the economic contribution is not Equitable if you look at time money skill between all the people that are going to get into business together if you have more than one of those and they have more than one of those well who how much is each
(10:32) person contributing now part of that comes down to negotiation being really honest about it but people want to avoid these hard conversations early on CU they're like well if hey if it works out we make a lot of money it's not going to matter I [ __ ] promise you the more money you make the more it's going to [ __ ] matter I'm not living that from experience you lose a lot of equity day one Equity doesn't need to be equal so for example if you did want to bring Partners in you could have a 955 split just make sure that what people are
(10:58) doing what they're investing in time money and skills is appropriate for their contribution and if they bulk at that then thank [ __ ] God you said that on day one so you don't have to deal with it later now you have this fear well what if I can't do this business without them I promise you you can do the business without them all right every successful business I had during the period after my nine filed Partnerships I did on my own with Lila my OG ride or die partner so I give half no matter what that was from my first two Partnerships that I had the second two Partnerships that I had when I got
(11:28) into business with these guys I was going to run the business all day every day I was going to be there I also invested capital and I was also the one who knew everything about Fitness and the individuals didn't know either of those things and weren't going to be spending all their time in the business like I was they didn't take a salary because they had other income streams they were far wealthier than and far older than I was and I didn't and so I had saved up about $70,000 in the first you know 6 months or so of my business so you're like wait a second you were making money and the business was growing and then you brought Partners in
(11:57) damn straight I did and then I sold 2ir of my my business for the cost it cost me to start it not for what it was making me every month I made 2third of what I got paid for the entire two-thirds of my business because I was a [ __ ] and so not really I was in experience that I didn't know any better it was me paying down ignorance debt which is why I'm making these videos for you so you don't have to do it either okay and if you're the one who's in the business you should get paid as an employee as well like there's ownership and then there's working in the business if you're saying Hey I want to be 50/50
(12:29) in this business but I'm going to be working in in you're not for example which happens a lot I'm 50/50 but I need a manager salary because this is what this would be and that basically makes up for the fact that you're doing the job and taking the risk on make sure that if you're in the business and you're doing a job that you get paid like you're doing a job the amount of times I talk to entrepreneurs who like I'm like how much you take home this year and they're like nothing and I'm like why they're like I'm reinvesting everything in the business I'm like okay not making a profit is not reinvesting everything in the business it means that
(12:56) your business sucks and it's much harder to say that and it's wayte sex here when you say hey I'm reinvesting all my I'm reinvesting in growth but if you're actually reinvesting in growth then I would say then what's your return on Capital and if you don't have the answer to that question you're not [ __ ] reinvesting in growth you're just not making money I'm still going to come back to Partnerships I'm staying on this page cuz it's it's going to be a recurring theme mistake number four getting fancy so my first location in
(13:18) Huntington Beach cost me $37,000 to open I had duct tape sandbags from Home Depot that I used the sandbag I couldn't afford the nice ones like I was I had so little money to start this thing thing what's crazy though is that within 6 months that business was making 20 $225,000 a month right in profit it was making good money but the thing is is that once that business my hunting Beach location started making money I was like okay my next location is going to be really sick so I went from a 5,000 ft
(13:43) Warehouse that was behind an auto shop to an anchor location in a retail Center that was 7,000 ft so bigger more expensive rent big storefront I spent $250,000 to open it up I wanted to be we got glass Lobby we like we [ __ ] you know we did it all up it made the same amount of money as my first location and so the lesson for me was like I literally just burned money so I could say I was investing in the business but all I did was buy [ __ ] that didn't necessarily turn into revenue and so that's why and this is the lesson here so this is D or whatever we're on right is roic I want you to write it down
(14:21) that's return uninvested Capital if you're going to spend money in your business every expense you have on your expense line you should be able to say how is this making me money how am I getting a return on this right if you buy cost of goods you buy you buy products for 10 bucks and you sell them for 30 you have a return there you're tripling your money that's a great investment if you can get if you can go from 10 to eight all of a sudden becomes three and a half or whatever it is right whatever the math is there but where you
(14:42) lose is where you spend $25,000 on something and you do make $25,000 over the next 10 years well [ __ ] that means you make $2,500 extra this year you're just down 22,5 and in a small business you should be making 3 to1 5 to1 10 to1 on the dollars you spend because you can when you're small you can be way more more efficient than big or organizations can you can buy leads for a buck and sell $500 things to one out of five spend five bucks spend 20 bucks make 500 like you can do that flip and that's
(15:09) where you can make crazy money really quick and that's where that's the main economic engine and so the rule is don't be fancy do the basics all right so I had a really interesting uh business Mentor who uh I called when I was considering selling my uh selling gym lunch years later he had been private Equity CEO and so all he did was basically they Dro this guy in when they buy a company and then he would have the job of tripling it in three years or so and he had done it three times and so I'm on the phone with this guy and I was like so what's
(15:40) your secret man and he's like don't be cute backyard football he's like everybody tries to get get cute get fancy you know when you're you're a kid and you're like okay so we're going to do with a double deep fake and we're going to go AI to the right and we're going to we're going to spin it back and then you're going toss it back to me and then and then Johnny's going to go to the left and then we're going to we're going to toss it to him and then and then we're going to get the he's like what happens I was like I don't know he's like you [ __ ] fumble and you lose the ball right and you lose the
(16:03) game he's like no we play fundamentals football he's like two fat guys in the middle to the right he's like that's how we play he's like don't be cute I did I get too cute right I get fancy with my expenditures right but I also get too fancy in my strategy just saying like we want to provide Superior Service very easy to say very easy to understand and if you do it well most people get it if you do a good job people tell their friends they come back like it makes sense but really hard to do how do you
(16:29) get all of your staff to smile how do you get all of your staff to remember people's names how do you how do you write handwritten cards on a systematic basis so that people see that you're going above and beyond like how do you do those things like that takes systems that takes effort right but the idea of just doing backyard football of just hey if we treat customers well they're going to come back if we provide a good product they're going to come back right we think through the details we actually drink our own Kool-Aid we eat our own dog food so that we know if something
(16:54) comes off I could write a book on business that if I just gave it to people who buy companies it would take me way less effort because I could just write it for them but to be able to write a book that somebody who has no idea how to run a business and somebody who buys companies can both get five out of five value from takes a shitload more work and so that's the kind of obsession that happens with product that when you start getting fancy you don't have time for it a 4.4 product compared to a 4.7 product on Amazon in the same category
(17:24) the 4.7 might get 10 times the sales if you see a 4.4 and a 4.7 which one you buying it's like it's it's obvious you're not buying the 4.4 neither does anyone else it's just the game of incremental improvements on the Big Basics that if you just get those right nothing else matters and I got really fancy and I got distracted from the thing that mattered most whatever that was me being fancy now let's go back to Partnerships so I had two different Partnerships um after the first four that I talked about where uh I just was like you know what I've got my gym business thing going I'm going to start doing launches too and then I'm also
(17:53) going to start these agencies right and so I'm going to get partners cuz that's what smart people do I was still the main economic driver in all of them and so I was the one who was doing the sales and doing the delivery what is the partner doing right besides having the idea that we should start a business together all the parns I've had I've learned a ton from and I I wish all of them the best um and it was my deficiencies it was not their fault it was my fault like I shouldn't have made these these mistakes which is
(18:20) why I'm making these videos so that you don't have to make them too I was the rain maker if you're the one who brings in the customers and makes the money you should get a disproportionate share of the proceeds if the business can't function without you but it can function without them you are needed they are not and here's a really hard truth you might think man I need an accountant okay cool most businesses do in fact all businesses do but it doesn't mean that when I start a business I partner with an accountant just because I need it doesn't mean that they have to have equity in it and so just because you can
(18:50) identify a function in a business that is required in the beginning it doesn't mean that you have to have give Equity there like you can hire these people you can have vendors right you can have other companies do this for a living and then you just fractionalize the cost and you pay to them and they have systems in place and at a certain point maybe you bring it in house maybe you don't right but these are decisions that early on I made mistakes for and so the partners that I had had functions that they could do they just weren't core to the business does it get customers in the
(19:14) door is it part of how we deliver you acquire the customer you deliver on the customer that's it and so if they are not core to those things they are probably not people that you need to give Equity to in the beginning or at least any meaningful share to a a completely makes sense partnership is is where one person handles product and is like I will just make sure our thing's absolutely exceptional and the other person's like I will go tell the world about it a phenomenal split a great split that many people do now I'm going to get to the bad one now because I know
(19:40) you guys were waiting for it so I lost a lot of money a lot of money a lot of money and a lot of brain power when I got in bed with a very bad partner so I'm going to tell you what I did and what I did wrong all right so this is number five bad Partners now I had Partners before and they were good partners we had bad Partnerships this is bad Partners so I want to be really clear about the difference all right all the partners I had before ethical fine people nothing wrong with that we had a bad structure and so you have the person and you also have the structure of the relationship that both have to be
(20:12) aligned the bad Partners I'll Define as people who have nefarious intentions who actually want to hurt you this was actually the last partner that I took on so this was punishing enough that it was quote traumatizing it permanently changed my behavior and so I had just sold um so I had six locations at this time with my gyms all right I had bought out some of my past partners which cost me a lot of money and so I had six locations now I shut down one because it was too new and I decided to switch gears because I wanted to start the licensing business and then I sold five
(20:39) now I had big pile of money this is now like basically my egg what I have to show for it for all this work and all the sacrifice I've done at this point I've got this S I was doing gym launches at the time so this is why I made the transition I started flying out to gyms I started making money and I could do like $100,000 in sales in about 3 weeks and I would keep that cash for myself because I had almost no cost besides my airfare my hotel and the ads Bend which usually for me was like 1 to three grand
(21:01) so not a lot and one gym owner was like hey you're leaving so much money on the table red flag number one so much money on table you can't pursue every opportunity so it's the definition of Entrepreneurship that you have to say no which means there's always money you could make you choose to leave small amounts of money on the table so that you can have the one pile of money that is on the table that you're choosing to play at get bigger he's like you're opening these gyms and you're filling them up to full capacity he's like you
(21:29) should own them average gy owner makes $36,000 a year for a full year of work working 80 hours a week I was making 100 Grand in 21 days and walking away way better business me being a [ __ ] I was like sure this is what a [ __ ] would do so I should do it he says how about this I used to run this gym $4.
(21:47) 2 million year out of I know how to run a gym I don't know the Marketing sales stuff you go to the Marketing sales I'll come behind you and I'll run the gym after you so he's like every month you open a gym you fill it up I'll come behind you I'll staff it he's like every month you can open a new gym and I was like man that means at the end of the year I'll have 12 gyms that means that my ego will go up and I can tell people I have 12 gyms so I launched his gym crushed that and so he's like hey so now let's do this next gym as we're about to sign the lease he says small detail you know I had a little bit
(22:10) of a bad credit situation big misunderstanding but you're going to have to personally guarantee the lease sure makes sense we're Partners I'll personally guarantee it also I mean you just made all this money on my gym you should front the cost for the new location and I said of course also you should run the whole thing and then I'll come after you I was like okay so I'll take the risk do all the money and do all the work and then and then you'll have half and he was like yeah I was like oh steal what a great partner and so I crushed this launch did 370 sales in like 6 weeks like new members I put
(22:39) all the cash into the account like all this cash my big Easter egg because I didn't understand how money worked and so I put all the money into the new bank account for the new nty cuz I was going all in on this new idea and then I wake up one morning cuz I would always check the bank account every morning cuz it was a habit all of a sudden it was at zero or close to zero it was actually just one withdrawal and it was to him huh and he was like oh yeah I was just taking my hat I know you're taking your half off the top he's like I'm just taking my half he's like I did the math
(23:04) he's like this is how much my half should be and I was like first off you're accusing me of stealing second off what I had a coach at the time and I was like dude what should I do print out the financials go line by line and show them where all the cost were and I was like okay so I printed all the all the expenses took me like 3 hours itemized everything and I was like let's go have lunch and like let's go over this I put the papers down and he pushed them off the table I don't need to see that [ __ ]
(23:26) and I was like oh I just got robbed he ended up sending the money to his girlfriend in Sweden and filing bankruptcy so I can Su him so remember when I said like he said oh there's this big misund understanding early on with the whole lease thing he had been indicted for fraud before that I knew about it I have my own demons of like I [ __ ] up in the past two and I'm trying to you know do good now and so I want to always give people that benefit of the doubt and I'm going to say something that probably won't be popular I don't do that much anymore there's just plenty
(23:54) of people I can partner with that I don't have to deal with that for here's my little tldr lesson on this this if someone shows you who they are believe them the first time red flags are red flags for a reason I'm not even going to tell you the amount of money that I lost because I will tell you what's more important is that I lost all my [Music] money and what felt like years of work and so from a loss perspective it was the amount of money was one of the smaller ones in terms of total dollar amount that I lost but in terms of emotional significance I went from a multilocation gym owner to successfully
(24:29) exiting my gyms to losing everything that I had spent years building in 6 months use that lesson so you don't have to have the scar mistake number six is the classic example between push and pivot all right so if you don't know what the the push and pivot dichotomy is for most entrepreneurs most people in general that there are some times where [ __ ] gets hard and you need to push through it and there are other times where your fundamental assumptions were wrong and you need to Pivot you need to change directions because the thing that
(24:53) you originally thought was true is no longer or you found out that it isn't and so the hard part is sometimes when you're in the thick of it you're not sure if this is a push or this is a pivot it's one of the hardest decisions in entrepreneurship there are dead bodies on either side of this road and it's hard because you just got to use judgment to be able to make the best guess you can and the thing is you can never replay the game so I graduated three years from vanderbelt and I got a job at a management consulting firm that did space cyber at least the projects I worked on was space cyber intelligence
(25:17) with the military so it's a PT firm defense Contracting that's what I worked on sounded fancy that's why I took it when I was there I had the desire to learn I did learn a lot quickly in the beginning after that period of time which maybe took 6 to9 months I didn't feel like I had more to learn and so I had two options and I took neither of them and I think that was the real mistake I didn't push and I didn't pivot I did nothing I coasted I was actually in that job a fairly bad employee you can look at work environment you can look at people you
(25:52) work with I was a bad employee and I would actually agree with them I didn't get challenged in that last period and so I just read books all day at that point it was either go to business school um or start something else and so that's why I decided to start something else if you are somewhere where you know deep down you are you are not living up to your potential and you are cutting corners and you're looking at the clock and you're trying to just like count minutes and you're like holy [ __ ] it's only been an hour I have seven more hours of this [ __ ] like if you were
(26:14) living like that leave whatever the alternative is is better it was one of the most costy mistakes I made also because of what I started feeling about me you know what I mean cuz I was like am I a slacker do something just don't do this push pivot push being go up let me learn more give me a challenge pivot being I'm going to change career paths I did nothing until it was forced upon me so that was mistake number six where I lost a lot of time and honestly a lot of self-confidence during that period of time which cost me dearly
(26:46) later so my seventh big mistake was actually getting into the food business now the food business per se is a mistake cuz you're like what does this have to do with me it actually has much more to do with getting into a product that I had low understanding of and so I thought okay I'm in Fitness I talk about nutrition I can start a food company right because we have this big distribution base of gyms they already sell our supplements I went all over the US tried to find co-packers who could uh handle the volume that we could do basically overnight in scale which means I had to go to really big companies that could handle that kind of volume we did
(27:18) this big launch we did this big buildup the first month sales were a little disappointing for me so we did like 600,000 the first month now you might be like that sounds like a lot of money but let me walk you through the margins of this business so $600,000 and you're like okay where's the M mistake coming from don't worry we'll get there the average meal was 10 bucks so we were selling 60,000 meals per month it's a lot of meals right a lot of meals you think wow this is a successful business well sounds good right times $10 now here's the part that no one wants to
(27:47) talk to you about in the food business my cost was $9 I had to cover every expense that I had in the business marketing sales payroll customer support refunds for [ __ ] that went bad boxes that broke all of that on this $1 I was able to make in this business somewhere in the neighborhood of 7% profit margins that's because I ran this as a skeleton business cuz I knew that it was low margin and I already had the supplement infrastructure for support and so that was a little bit of a help for why I like didn't lose my complete ass on this
(28:23) here's a little fun stat for you 80% of my customer support complaints came from this 90% of my profit every month came from my supplements from that line of business so you mean to tell me I just 5x the amount of headache for an extra this much profit just because you don't lose money doesn't mean you didn't lose money honestly I might have made 500 Grand on this whole thing but for the amount of work of me building up to a launch using some good will with my audience to say hey use these meals I had a whole separate website build out one if I had just done nothing and
(28:59) taking all of that effort and just put it into the other one that was making 10 times more money could I have made 10% more on that business to make up for this [ __ ] yeah I could alternatively if I had just done a different opportunity to go pursue could I have made more money than I did on this one and the answer is yes and the main culprit was that I did not know what I was getting into I didn't talk to anybody in the food business and say hey tell me how you make money real talk the only guys I did know were losing money the co-packer that I that I did this go with was
(29:29) losing money he had to keep raising funy he was not profitable I didn't understand what I was getting into and I split focus and so right now remember we said earlier about there's money on the table there was money on the table and there was this tiny little pile of money and I decided to take my off the big pile of money and go on the small pile of money and I lost a year of effort and buildup and marketing and sales that I could have just directed towards the big money and maybe grow that by 50% here I did
(29:59) all these new things had to figure out all these new problems from ground zero and that's one of the biggest mistakes I've made so many times in my entrepreneurial Journey that now I'm so obsessed about you hear me talk about more better more better more better because I had to learn the hard way of how many times I lost money splitting my focus when I could have doubled down and made so much more so this mistake realistically cost me probably about10 to $25 million reason being I ended up selling gym launch and we had a big multiple on that and so if i' had been able to just make two $3 million more in
(30:29) profit on my main business it would have resulted in $10 to $30 million more in money to me that's not hypothetical money like I did sell that company and it was based on profit and that took away from the profit that I would have made so don't do that this is mistake number eight all right so I'm actually going to do this as a two-parter these are two separate mistakes that actually stem from the same principle so I had my lawyer situation and I had my payroll situation all right so I'll tell you both I wake up one day and I look at my emails and
(31:01) there's this email that says cost of living adjustment huh I look into it and it said you have a 0. cost of living adjustment so I meant I had no change and I was like I wonder if this was like a payroll change in entity thing like they were reorg something whatever so gas who's one of our employees who's our executive assistant was like hey I just got a $6,000 raise um thanks I was like Leela what she was like I don't know I'm figuring out right now we had a director of HR who lived in California and she
(31:31) had asked for a raise she was denied a raise because she didn't have enough experience which you will soon see why and so she took it on to herself to say well I deserve more money because I live in a more expensive area she then ordered a cost of living study on my dollar took that very expensive cost of living study and then looked at everyone's pay and said okay if you living in an area where it's cheaper we're not going to change how much you get paid but if you in an area where it costs more we will pay you more now
(32:01) after making this decision unilaterally the way she chooses to announce this is just a blast email to everyone with just the amount that they got paid more so like if I were actually going to give everyone a raise I want to get some [ __ ] credit for it you want to tie it to something that someone does so you can reward behavior that cost increase cost me 600,000 a year of profit for zero additional anything by the way she was in California and so she got one of the largest cost of living increases unto herself she costs me $600,000 a
(32:35) Year everybody just gets erased you now then say like just kidding she's an idiot like what do you do right like just kidding you're actually all not getting paid more very tough situation that I got put in so what we did was we got rid of her so she went from getting a $10,000 raise to getting a zero pay the reason I lost money and this is my principle I'm going to give you know where the bodies are buried if you're too far away from the Apartments if you say hey what's going on and they say oh everything's good and you don't know how to go one layer deeper because you are
(33:05) too far away it means that you don't know where the bodies are buried I don't need to know everything but I do need to know what problems that every department is struggling with just so I'm aware so I can keep Loops like updates on what's going on because I was so far away she was able to carry out a cost of living analysis and execute a companywide pay raise all without me even knowing until it was way too late second mess up my CFO Suzanne came in uh to gym launch and she said hey are you guys in a lawsuit and I was like and I was like why do you say that she said well you have a legal
(33:39) expense that's $120,000 a month yeah that's like you're on a full-fledged like multi-million doll lawsuit that's going on with like litigation arbitration all this [ __ ] and so she's like that's how much that cost I was like oh I just delegated compliance to my team so then I clicked down a level and I was like hey what are what are we doing that's causing all these lawyer bills they're like oh well we do a uh we do a bi-weekly meeting with the entire legal team it's $150 an hour lawyers two 1our meetings a week and you're like well that doesn't that just wait and then
(34:11) what they're reviewing is all the work that their smaller attorneys that were getting built at 200 to 500 an hour are reviewing every piece of licensed marketing that we made and that we gave to our lenses and so we were creating tons of marketing hundreds of ads every single month we're creating tons of trainings hourlong trainings two hourong trainings so if I did a 1-hour call every day to help my licensees I had four lawyers watching every hour and then sending notes on what I could have done to be more compliant now guess what I never read any of the notes and guess
(34:48) what neither did anyone else but because I said we need to make sure that we're compliant they said great lawyers what do we have to do to be compliant they're like well why don't you just have us review everything and because I wasn't signing the checks and it was someone it was Uncle Alex's money they were like oh great instead of us doing work we'll give it to this Law Firm they'll do the work for us and not only did they not actually Implement anything from all the notes that came in from this they were happy to just have the meetings every week cuz they started getting their buddy buddy with them and of course they were when you pay someone
(35:18) a million dollars a year they'll be nice as [ __ ] to you know where the bodies are buried part of the reason I brought uh CFO in because I was doing other stuff she saved me you know her first month she was like well paid for myself I already saved you a million bucks a year which is true she did save me a million doll a year and I was very grateful for it I didn't have the ding on that because I was able to solve it but it cost me $1.
(35:42) 2 million so that's mistake number eight multi-million dollar mistake let's go number nine you're like does it get worse oh it gets so much worse I started a software company Allen uh use Allen it was because I wanted to solve the next problem that most gym owners had which is that they didn't work their leads so we could get leads for them or give them ads that they get leads for themselves but they wouldn't work the leads and if you don't work the leads you don't make sales it's kind of how it works I saw where AI was going and where
(36:05) messaging was going versus pickup rates and I was like I thought that we could create like a really strong automated bot with enough data and enough conversations that we could probably do as good of a job as kind of a low- skilled employee it turned out that we were right and so the average front desk girl at the time or guy at the time would get 10% of leaves in the door and we got 19% of the door here was the mistake that I made so Allen was a purely software business I had never built software before I've never written code before and so I did what all very
(36:35) impatient Founders do I just said I'll just go find a software company and just have them build it for me and then I'll charge for it here's what actually happened so I went to the software vendor I went through this really long competitive process for people to uh bid the software out someone came in and said I can build it for you for 100 Grand or something like that I said sure fine let's do that the 100 Grand came in and uh the thing wasn't built yet but now I have Sun cost fallacy so now I've put money into it I made promises and so I'm like fine we'll keep going and so when it was said and done I think I put 1 point something
(37:11) million into the software now you might be like okay well you spent a million bucks to a software company you had a big distribution base it might have made sense it probably would make sense except once the software was operational and started making money who maintains the software the outsourced development team if if you're an Outsource development team and someone needs you to make money and guess what they can see how much money it makes what do you do to your fees you just raise them you just keep eating it up and what else did they do
(37:39) they didn't document any of the code which meant that no one else could go in and start working on it we couldn't have an outside firm come take this offer over because there was no road map it was like writing a book with no table of contents they just consistently increase their fees to consistently reduce my margins until they ate up everything the mistake that I made in this big one was that you need to have a technical founder and the reason I believe that is that name me one massive software company that doesn't have a technical co-founder name me one I'll wait a technical co-founder can hold them
(38:14) accountable right so you could have a technical founder and then have part of your team outsourced but the technical founder keeps them honest keeps them accountable make sure they're documenting things correctly keeps bidding things out and then over time you can start hiring people inh house and inh house doesn't even need to be us-based inh house could be overseas but they still work for you they're loyal to you not to whoever their boss is who writes the check who's not you this time obviously with school I'm not the person
(38:37) who is the technological person nor am I trying to contract that person I found the product just amazing amazing developers and they already had an amazing product and then I'm coming with it right I'm I'm boosting on top of it remember I said the core engines of a business you either have to know how to get customers or you have to know how to deliver I was trying to Outsource the core value generation of the business to an outside company that is a fundamental mistake these guys businesses these Dev
(39:01) shops they rely on you making this mistake unless you have a clear plan of having somebody in house who knows more than them about software who can hold them accountable who probably has to have Equity to give a [ __ ] you are just going to be at their Mercy over time I was able to sell to an actual software company that did have developers who could actually read into the stuff and they were able to retrofit the software and incorporate into their business so again I had this big pile of money that
(39:26) I could have just worked on doing more better of and yet again got distracted and if you're like keeping track here like wait there was a food thing there was a software thing yeah like [ __ ] all right so like I I share these lessons so that you don't have to as well okay multi-million dollar mistake number 10 vendors this was one where we had a company and I can tell you the amount lost $15 million real money all right so not not hypothetical not opportunity cost cost lost money we were building up for a big product launch in um one of
(40:01) the companies we paid $270,000 for a vendor literally for only one purpose was to have insurance that they could handle the volume that we were going to push through this particular company was like we're pros of this this is all we do that's what I'm paying this insurance bill for is just that it goes okay as the launch approaches I hopped on like one of the vendor calls and the this was now one level lower so this wasn't the owner of the company this is one of his employees he's like oh yeah this is crazy this is breaking all the records we've ever seen we've never seen anything like this before and I was like what I thought
(40:34) this was going to be like another walk in the park like that doesn't that doesn't sound good we're we're having to spin up all these extra systems just to handle it but now we're like 24 48 hours out we wouldn't made able to change this I think it would have been more risky to change it at that point we we do the you know we do the launch even though it went quote well 75% of the traffic That was supposed to go to the launch didn't make it there after all the marketing after all the the leaking of the you know the stuff and the Goodwill that was built in that company 75% didn't make it they lied
(41:05) just straight up they lied they lied because they wanted to build their resume because they wanted to say that they they were you know doing something with that particular company um and put it on um on their on their website or whatever if you're going with vendors what the founder of the company didn't do is that he didn't look for references didn't ask for a single person who had done this before at the size that they claimed they had done I want references just like me right just like just like whatever you're doing right references like you not just references but
(41:35) references like you or your use case so number one that never happened number two if someone shows you the way they are the first time believe them the first time all right there were flags that had happened early on we probably should not have ignored those flags I should have listened to that and I [ __ ] up that was on me everyone will lie to you and they'll lie even more if they benefit from Association and and so when you have a bigger company people will basically just promise that they can deliver for you because they want to stick your logo on their website references just like you who have done
(42:07) what you want to have done and if you have any semblance where the story doesn't match up when there's bad news it's always worse after it happens than when you think it could happen so as much as it could be bad news beforeand because it's going to be more work for people it's a fuckload worse to lose $15 million on something that you spent N9 months building up to lesson number three that I've learned about this referrals mean jack [ __ ] so if someone says hey I've got a great guy for this I say great I'm going to treat you as though I don't know you I'm just going to give you the call I think setting that stage up front with any potential
(42:37) event even it's like your closest friend has this guy who did all my IT services or whatever it is or this guy did all my marketing Services whatever I want to be really clear you helped Mike out you helped him out in a big way that's why we're on the call today but from this point going forward I'm gonna act as though I've never met you before and I'm going to ask you for a lot of things for assurances to make sure that this goes well if someone gets weirded out by that walk away since this was $15 million we
(43:01) got into eight figure losses now technically we had another eight figureure loss earlier we're going to start using $10,000 bills that we're shredding all right you can take that to the bank the last mistake this is the big boy this is the biggest Kahuna the worst mistake of all you're like could it get worse than that it could get worse than that give you the biggest mistake I've ever made before I get into it I want you to think how big of a mistake do you think it was was like how much money could Alex really have lost well you will find out shortly this one
(43:32) mistake lucky number 11 I actually made a pricing error this is 2019 things were going well business-wise but like I felt things are going well on paper now but I feel like the trend is wrong like the vibe doesn't feel right like the comments I'm seeing we're losing steam we're losing momentum there was a competitor in the marketplace who basically took all my top gyms and offered them a partnership and said just teach Alex's [ __ ] as though it's your own and then you guys can run this business business I'll do all the ads and sales and then you guys do all the
(44:01) delivery they undercut me on pricing what I decided to do was I was like okay I'm going to look at all the stuff that they're doing and all the stuff I'm doing and I'm just going to take everything they do and just add it on top so I'm going to do all the stuff we're already doing and add in a huge level of oneon-one which i' had never done basically accountability for all the gym owners so I took I took 35 of our best gemms and basically gave them status around specific skills that they were good at and then created groups based on revenue of the gyms and grouped
(44:30) them together with the gym owners that were a little ahead of them so they could kind of help them with the next step and then once you do that you level out you go to another group that was kind of the thinking behind we had all the stuff that we were doing that grew gyms already and we added this huge accountability like very operationally complex component on top of it I thought to myself well not only am I going to give more I'm going to do it for Less I went from $1,000 a week so 4K a month to $800 a week now this doesn't sound like a big difference I made this
(45:00) change so I said I'm going to do X I'm going to do y I'm going to do Z I'm going to do W I'm going to do V I'm going to do all of these things plus this this this that everyone else is doing and I'm going to do it for Less the first comment was a complaint they were like you could have been charging me this the whole time [ __ ] you which taught me lesson number one which is that whenever you change price people complain I literally lowered the price for everybody like grandfather lowered not like new people everyone just pays me less tomorrow for the same thing but
(45:30) better and more the second thing that happened is that when you lose 20% of your Topline revenue and you run 40% margins you lose half your profit you run 40% margins all right and if you take off all of this and then you deliver more this is your new margin and so the difference between this and this even though it doesn't seem like a lot changing from here to here lost me about 5 million a year in profit I never recovered the additional $5 million in profit per year and so when I sold at a multiple that $5 million difference got multiplied by a big number that would be the entire
(46:12) suitcase worth of cash by a lot one all pricing changes people don't like and it's more so that they just don't like change the second thing is that I was not being proactive I was being reactive it was one of the first times in my business career where I was trying to respond to the the market rather than trying to anticipate the market I was looking at other people's ads looking at what they were doing looking at what they were talking about and I was like oh shoot we need to do that people were like you got
(46:35) to pay attention to your competitors I you got to pay attention to your customers if you pay attention to your customers your competitors are kind of relevant I think Paul Graham said this he said every business problem can be solved by talking to your customers every business problem you can solve at the end of the day by talking to your customers Core Business problems finances go get a financial person but like the point is is that the core engine you got to talk to customer customers that a mistake I only want to make once so I'm going to take some more of this money and we're going to feed it
(47:03) in here and we're just going to keep feeding it in while we have while we have this time and just really think about this lesson that we all learned together about listen to our customers and not our competition keeping awesome love you I'll see you in the next one

Transcript:
(00:00) today's topic is going to be preparation within the context of work and so what I want to do today is actually reset your bar for what preparation looks like for the highest achieving people that I know within different context so whether that's sales whe that's marketing content whatever customer success all of these contexts have different types of prep there's two different ways to prep that I'll talk about and give you some tactics that you can use and maybe send to your team as well because hey if they
(00:24) prep more you'll make more I'll give you uh an example of like a resetting that just recently happened for me so I'm obviously very big on uh the amount of reps that it takes like volume negates luck is uh is the is the number one uh quote that we have in the sales team wall so that the guys understand like it's just about the Reps and we just say it all the time it's repeated over and over again because we also believe uh repetition of the same beliefs is something that will drive them to remember this thing because we need to
(00:50) be reminded more than we need to be taught but recently even getting into this content game this is about a year ago um I was talking to arak and so arak's a um a content creator who has I don't know 10 15 million subscribers something like that on YouTube and we were saying I was like hey what can we do to make our you know make our YouTube YouTube videos better and so he said oh just send me over your your your prep case for the videos and I was like um what do you mean I was like you mean like the notes on my phone he was like
(01:24) uh no and I was like can you send me one of yours so I know what you're talking about and so he sends me his most recent crap for one of his videos and it was like 22 Pages for like a 15minute video and I was like oh okay so my understanding of how much work it takes to do something at this level is wildly under what the reality of it is at at that level and so I attended something he invited me to like a little Creator meet up with some of the the biggest guys on YouTube I'll just I'll just say it this way you would
(01:58) know everybody in the room um and when we were there they were all discussing how much time it took them to prep for videos and a lot of these guys were spending two three four straight weeks of 12 hours a day to make one video per month and I will tell you this is that it was in no way surprising to me after going there for two days what it took and why those guys were the number one in that industry for making content that was exceptional and so it completely reset my standard reset my bar for how much preparation was
(02:30) required to be exceptional and it was because and this is why it's so silly for me cuz I feel like I keep learning and relearning the same lessons but just in new domains is that the people who are doing way better than you are just working so much harder and the thing is that people think that someone's working like two times as hard or three times as hard because we tend to think in increments we're like okay well I work I work this much someone must be doing twice as much work but it's not even close to that these guys are doing like
(02:53) literally a hundred times the work and it's not only that they have a team of 10 people spending four weeks to prepare one 15minute video like the order of magnitude in terms of effort there you multiply by 10 times times 12 hours a daytimes 4 weeks all of a sudden you really are at a thousand times the work 1,500 times the work to create to be fair an outcome that is 1,500 or 10,000 times better than the average YouTube video or whatever it is that you're making and obviously I'm just using this as a Content example but it applies to
(03:24) anything applies to sales meetings it applies to how you prep for a date applies to how you meet the parents or the in-laws and so I'll tell you a second story so I um I used to do uh some consulting stuff um and I had a guy who uh was uh a friend or was you know business acquaintance who said hey man I would love it if we could spend a day together and I was like I really do that and he's like just name her price and I said fine um actually total fun side note story with this um I was like fine I'll do it for 50 grand um this was ages
(03:55) ago and he said uh he said uh how about how about 35 and I said how about 75 and he was like all right 50 is cool and I was like all right and so just a a side note when someone says hey can you do it for Less you can always say hey I can do it for more and every single time I've used that overcome it has worked so right now it's like 100% overcome for using that highly recommend using it in a sales uh situation because people were like okay I got it understood like I'll that's your price so that was first half
(04:22) of Story number two with the Consulting day so when I when I did that day um what I did was I started that morning I think that we were going to start meeting at at uh 9:00 and so I woke up at 5: and I spent 4 hours reviewing his business right cuz I figured my day was going to be shot this is going to be my day like I'm not going to try to do anything else and so I spent the four hours prepping um and I I came in to the day with I think four or five pages of notes of like okay here are things we could do here that would be better
(04:49) here's things on your follow-up sequence here's things on the on on your on your on your landing pages here things that you can do from a Content here's how I think your CT could be better all of this stuff right and so I came in with it and the next like 4 hours I just spent showing him what I had spent the morning going over and at the end of the day he was like I have genuinely never had anyone come this prepared to something and to me I was like it was 4 hours of prep it wasn't like a crazy you know I me to me 4 hours perhaps nothing
(05:18) you know what I mean in terms of work but it was really confirming because this guy obviously had the money to to spend 50 grand for a day or whatever and um that he had not had that type I was like it still bewilders me and I see that more so that it is remarkable how low the bar is to beat everyone else and so that's what I take that my takeaway from that um like on one hand you've got aak and some of these super creators who are spending thousands of hours on a one single piece of content but I think if you like do consulting or you do some
(05:49) sort of work where you do the same thing over and over again like you can have like a 4:1 ratio if I go into a meeting and it's a 60-minute meeting you can take 15 minutes before you get into the meeting and I think like a 4 to1 ratio is really are 1 to four ratio like if it's a 8 hour day spending 2 hours if it's a 60-minute meeting spending 15 minutes if a 20-minute meeting spending 5 minutes before you get on um will'll make the 20 minutes two three times more effective by just having that little bit of block to say who's on this meeting
(06:16) what's the background of this what's the agenda what problem are we trying to solve it just it just absolutely focuses you and makes you a driver in the meeting I can just absolutely like promise you that now um third one when we have Founders who come into the portfolio so when we invest in a company one of the things that happens most commonly is a lot of them are running paid ads or they start running paid ads so it's either way so either they're running ads and they hit some sort of plateau or they want to get into running
(06:43) ads and so I'll tell you the story that I explained to almost all of them which is I say all right how many uh you know what do you what do you guys spend in a day and they're like all right we're spending 5,000 a day okay fine so how many new ads are you making per week and a lot of time they're like oh record ads once a month and I'm like okay well how many ads do you make they're like usually five or seven ads and I'm like okay so let me give you some context we make uh about 30 ads a week new and that's new unique video now
(07:16) that's not repurposing of that that's 30 core pieces which then get zillion out in terms of like let's take the hook for number one and put as number three and then redo the same video those would be permutations that go from 30 to like 100 pieces of creative and as soon as I explain that they're like oh and I was like so you're doing 5 to seven and you're complaining that you can't scale but the reality is that you just can't scale given this level of creative like if your creative is a 5 out of 10 you can get to 5,000 a day
(07:43) profitably but you're not going to get to 50,000 a day profitably because you're not getting that one out of a hundred ad that can scale to colder audiences or newer people and so it's just the like if you have a mediocre ad like many of you guys who start running ads are like oh I get it to $100 a day but I can't get it to be profitable at $500 a day it's like yeah because your ad is so bad it can only go to the absolute hottest audience and then as soon as it goes outside of that very hot audience that kind of knows you a little
(08:10) bit it stops working right and so if you had if you went from a five out of 10 ad to a seven out of 10 ad then all of a sudden it's like oh I can get to $500 a day and if you get to an eight out of a 10 ad you can go to a $5,000 a day right but the nine out of 10 and the 10 out of 10 ads like that's what converts the world but in order to get that 10 out of 10 ad you have to do so much more preparation before you do the ads and total volume of work of doing the ads itself and so I share this stuff because my entire goal of this right now is to
(08:36) reset your expectations of the amount of preparation that it takes to be good because it's so easy it's like mediocrity is the is is so easy to do because you just do something and hey anything's better than nothing so if you're doing nothing then absolutely start but what happens is people are like why isn't it working for me and it's not working for you because you're not working nearly as much as you as what is requ required to get that level of output right so let me tell you a different story so I had um a uh a buddy
(09:07) of mine's a a billionaire and he's he wants to start making content which is I I'm I'm a huge proponent of this because he actually has stuff to say um and but he's still learning the content game right and so he's like hey man can you look at my Instagram and tell me or sorry can you look at my he said can you look at my social media and tell me what I'm what what I'm doing wrong or what I should be doing better and so before I pulled up his thing I was like well how many posts are you making a day across all platforms and he was like one I'm
(09:33) doing one a day right now um and he said it like that kind of like he was like yes I'm doing one a day right now and I was like all right man um we make at the time we were we were making 50 a day we make more than that now and he just looked at me and he was like you don't need to say anymore he's like I got it like he understood in that moment the same thing I did when I when AR act told showed me his prep case for his YouTube videos I was like I get it like I'm I'm I'm he said Thank you for resetting my my uh my measuring stick that's what he
(10:03) said he was like my you reset my bar reset my expectations of how much how much work it takes to get to that level that I want to get to hey if you want to get around people who are actually winning who look like you who smell like you who talk like you and are doing what you want to do I'd like to invite you to the the school games community at school.
(10:23) com games I take calls in there I put content that's like this and more personalized inside of that community and I drop a huge amount once a month in eight hour training on how to actually take this stuff and win anyways and so if that's interesting school.com forgames see you in there I share this stuff because I think one of the biggest Gifts of surrounding yourself in a championship team so there's a book by um Angela Duckworth called grit um which is a good book um but one of the things that uh they talk about in the book is that one of the best ways to develop
(10:53) grit is to surround yourself with people who have grit so one of the for sure ways to get better at a skill is surround yourself with people who already have that skill who are ahead of you and so that's why joining a championship team is one of the be best things you can do to understand what is required to win and so when you're the the story that she tells in the book is uh swimmers who want to get better at swimming if you can make the the State team or whatever of like a championship team all of a sudden there's standards
(11:20) of work that you didn't understand is what everyone's doing so you go from like oh well I'm swimming twice a week and that's what you can do to be best in your high school or whatever I'm making up the the number but when you go to the championship team you realize that they do three hours a day twice a day and all of a sudden you're like oh and it's that same moment I had with era I was like oh in the same moment my friend had one when we talked about the social media was like oh it's just this massive bar reset of like oh
(11:46) this isn't like a two times as as much thing this is like a 50 100 times as much and so it's just when you realize how much work it takes to get good you realize how few things you can get good at and that's where the focus becomes so important because the only way to get that good is to do a few things and so that's where the strategy of picking or prioritizing the things that you want to get good at becomes more important because you just can't do a hundred times the work on a hundred different things and so making sure that you're
(12:15) allocating your resources to the one thing that matters most which then forces you to prioritize what you're spending your time on which by the way I think is a really good activity if you can spend a day or a week saying okay if I could only have one thing be true about our business if I could have like if we have more traffic than anyone else we will win based on this model or whatever it is that we have if we have more referrals than anyone else then we will win no matter what if we have the best advertising in terms of paid ads if
(12:43) we just had that one thing we will win if you can be very clear about that one point of Leverage then you attack it with absolute onslaught of hours of work and repetition and preparation for those repetitions that then yield you even more and so it's like I'll give you the ad example I was saying earlier if I if I'm doing 100 ads a week and my competitor's doing seven ads a month I'm doing 400 to his seven all right so I'm doing I don't know what the math is there but a lot let's it's at Le 50 times 60 times more right um than he is
(13:15) in terms of volume but not only that but when I go into that advertising day what am I doing beforehand I'm prepping all the I want to prep all the hooks ahead of time I want to do research of of past ads that have done really well I want to take different ad styles that I've seen across social media in general that I liked I'm like I wonder if we can make a version of this for how we're going to advertise our thing and by the way I love taking from other spaces like seeing a hotel ad or an Airbnb ad and be
(13:40) like o that would work really well in this software company that we have oh we've got this you know we've got this dry cleaning business that would work really well this ad for a gym or whatever right and I have this little swipe file on my phone where whenever I see an ad I like I I save it and then I also screenshot it so that when I get into my prep sessions I already have my stuff that I want to use to prep in front of me and so one of the one of the big other things besides resetting your bar of expectation of how much prep it
(14:08) takes to win is that the more you prepare for Stuff the more frequently you do it the better you will get it preparing so preparing in of itself is a skill right and so like the first time you prep for making ads the per time you prep for making content you it's going to take you longer and you're going to be less efficient at it but if you know for example this is your 100th time preparing for making a podcast or whatever like this is my prep for the this little this little podcast here I wrote this out ahead of time I was like
(14:32) these are all the things I wanted to hit on because I think they were important right and so I think in terms of resetting the bar start thinking in hundreds rather than ones and twos so it's not that somebody's doing twice as much work or three times as much work they're doing a hundred times the work and in the example I gave earlier sometimes way more than 100 times the work two more quick things on this and then I'll I'll let you go about your day so you can start preparing so Elon Musk recently talked about something uh well not recently but
(14:56) I've heard I heard an article or an interview from him that he said um he referenced Parkinson's law so Parkinson law for those of you guys who don't know is that work expands to the time allotted right and so I think what you don't want to do is over prepare for the wrong thing and let me let me put my caveat there is that I actually think there's tremendous Roi to cramming meaning he uses Parkinson's law in Reverse which is that it also if if work expands the time a lotted it can also shrink to the time that you shrink to
(15:25) and there's a reason that kids cram it's because it's really high Roi on their time right if they if they pref for weeks and weeks and then they they take the week before the exam off and don't look at anything sometimes they do worse than just cramming right before the test and so people aren't idiots like we know that cramming Works which is why we do it but I think I'd highly encourage thinking about prepping is cramming I actually think it works amazingly well in a business context but people somehow somehow have said it's like a bad thing
(15:52) because I don't even know why teachers say it's a bad thing at the end of the day like you either AC the test or you didn't and so whatever now in terms of longterm like I think you know not sleeping the night before probably impacts your if you like probably impacts your uh performance more but if you just study the day before and you study the morning of I'll promise you that the studying the morning of will get you more than what you did the night before in terms of immediate result on the test more than long-term retention
(16:18) which is different just to be clear but the thing is is if you're doing a meeting you're going to take notes and then you're going to delegate stuff and so you being able to run that meeting effectively based on you cramming for that meeting super high Roi on your time and so I absolutely love the concept of cramming within within the world of business because a lot of times you do have something you just need to do once and you need to impress the client you need to impress the boss you need to you need to just come prepared for a company
(16:42) uh presentation that you're doing in front of a whole team or the a department or the whole the whole company entirely going back to the two types of work there are is that or two types of preparation you have you have preparation for things you're going to do that you do many many many times which you get better and better at preparing for it which means you can actually shrink the amount of time you need to prepare and I think the closer you do the preparation to the event itself the more valuable it is and so
(17:04) that is why take the 5 minutes literally actually take the five minutes before the meeting to say okay this is John let me look at his profile real quick okay John's uh he's out of Milwaukee okay the Bucks are doing well let me see if he if he follows the Bucs okay he taged something there and um and his wife's name is Joyce okay got it so you get on the meeting you're like dude John how's it going dude the Bucks are killing it oh that's fantastic how's Joyce doing she's good great and uh I saw um do is this Mike is this he's your uh he's your
(17:31) VP of customer success hey Mike nice to meet you man um I was just looking you guys up before before I got on uh um really cool stuff that you guys are doing to XYZ Corp right as soon as I say that they're like immediately in 60 seconds they're like this guy prepared and that's what it communicates and the thing is is that the idea that someone knows that you prepare literally separates you from so many other people who just show up and they're like oh what are we going to do today right and so sure you should absolutely have be
(18:00) prepared in terms of the agenda in terms of your scripting for how you run these meetings but you get so much return on demonstrating that you prepared like people know if you prepared it just it completely blows them away and I still to this day I get people are so they're like dude thank you so much for taking the time like you I feel like you knew our our company I feel like you knew our business like even better than people that I've spent you know I've had all you know had vendors who did all this stuff and I was like yeah I mean I'm not
(18:29) going to walk into a meeting not knowing who I'm talking to like what are we going to do spend the whole the whole time fact finding before I can actually make a recommendation around something well that's such a waste of time for you and me because I know what I'm looking for and it's going to be really inefficient for you to exchange it via VIA verbal and I can just click around and find out what I need to do especially if you're looking at it from an external way in to like okay why are prospects not converting well I don't need to talk to
(18:52) you I should look at what somebody who doesn't talk to you would see so that I can make the recomendations or conclusions and sometimes that kind of is more valuable because they're not going to color they're not going to give me the wise and the why it's difficult because I don't care I'm a prospect right at least I'm going to put those glasses on and so back to the the The onetime Thing versus the many time thing if you do it a lot of times you're going to get better better at prepping and I would say prep as as as close to the
(19:17) event as you can and I think a 4:1 ratio in the beginning is good 15 minutes to 60 1 hour to four hours in terms of prep to how much work you're going to do for whatever the thing is and over time it can shrink a little bit so you can be like one to 10 so it's 5 minutes for a 60-minute meeting um but for the things that you're going to do one time that you have never done before that's where it actually expands the other way it goes like 10 20 hours of prep for one hour of presenting and so the to determining how much you're willing to
(19:48) prepare for something that you're only going to do once rather than something that you do all the time in my opinion comes up to the stakes and the returns and so if you're going to go do a speech in front of a thousand people and you've never spoken before and it's a ideally hopefully it's a topic that you do understand but you just haven't spoken in that environment before then I want to control for every other variable that can approximate me speaking in front so one I want to know I want to master the material for sure if you're getting up
(20:10) there and you don't know what you're what you're talking about or like the things you're going to talk about well dear God you know like no wonder that you suck at talking right now beyond that it's how many ways can I approximate this like for example going live on social media can help you approximate a live audience in person is it perfect no but is it better than just talking to the mirror probably now if you aren't going to now this is a real one this is actually from the Fitness World if you get used to squatting for
(20:38) example I'll I'll bring it home if you squat in the mirror every day and you can see yourself and you're squatting if you go to a competition this actually happened to me in my first competition I I worked out at a gym that had a mirror in front of the squat rack and so I just I just always squatted there I didn't think about it when I got to a competition I had the squat rack and when I looked out there was no mirror it was just a crowd of people watching me Squat and I was like oh oh this is weird cuz I didn't even realize but I I it was
(21:02) actually so different from how I trained and so from that point going forward I turned around in the rack so that I would be facing the gym at least so that I wasn't looking at the mirror so that it was closer approximation to competition and so as many of those variables as you can control for you want to have in the prep so that the prep as closely as possible approximates the performance and so there's cramming for for like you having information that'll better arm you for Consulting sales customer success whatever which by
(21:30) the way if you're in customer success like spending 5 minutes before you get on the call with a customer like reviewing the call notes reviewing the the notes from the sales team looking the person's profile before you get on dear God will they think it's absolutely amazing and it takes this much work like you'll you'll like they will think you're three times cooler with 5 minutes of work for a 60-minute call like I almost think that you saying hey give me five minutes at the beginning of the call and starting 5 minutes late will
(21:53) still even though I hate starting late would still yield you a better outcome at the end of the 60 minutes than starting on time and not being prepared it comes down to the return on effort and return on time and so if you're going to talk to a thousand people and this and these are let's say your ideal customers well if I was going to have a, 101 meetings how much would I prepare for each of those one-one meetings that was 60 minutes I might prepare 10 minutes right well if I have 10 minutes times a thousand that's like I don't
(22:22) know 167 hours right something like that and so if 167 hours of prep for that one thing now realistically that might not make sense because you do have diminishing returns and so that's why speaking one to many is higher return but just to give yourself a context is like when we did the the book launch I was like dear God how much do I prep for a thousand person audience and I'm going to have half a million people there I'm going 500,000 have 500 times well I better not waste anyone's time while I'm there and make sure that every second
(22:50) the value per second is super high and so I think again we have to reset our expectations of how much work it takes to prepare for the one-time performances based on what you expect to get from it so if it's if if you're going to do a one time performance to 10 people then maybe maybe you prepare for 4 hours right but if you're going to talk to a th000 people then maybe you prepare for 40 hours and if you're going to talk to 10,000 people then maybe you do prepare for 400 hours or it does have a diminishing term so maybe it's 200 hours
(23:18) right but I think what most people miss out on is they get up and they say their talk once and they do it once to their wife and once to their dog and they're like you know I'm super nervous and so I'll leave you with this you are not nervous you're underprepared it's not that you have anxiety it's that you didn't do the work that you know you should have done and so if I have anxiety about something that's coming up that has become my Telltale sign that I am underprepared that I didn't do the work that I know I
(23:46) should have done and that's when you get nervous when you can get up on stage and you can do or whatever whatever your your your version of the performance is and have absolutely zero anxiety it's because you absolutely habituated to the stressor and so for example if you want to get someone to stop being afraid of spiders the fastest way to do that is get them into a room with spiders and let them sit there have a [ __ ] panic attack pass out wake up again pass out wake up again until eventually they habituate they just
(24:13) realize that they don't die and they're still there and there are spiders and they keep living and then the phobia is gone they habituate and so what you want to do or at least I like to do it is I want to habituate to the stressor which is if I'm stressed about this thing then it means I haven't prepared enough and so it's it's it's not impostor syndrome you're just inexperienced you're just not good enough yet and so I want to make sure that I can control for all the controllables first and then leave room
(24:41) for the uncontrollables but have all of my bandwidth available so that when the mic cuts out or the the presentation isn't working or my clicker runs out of battery all of these things have happened that I still I'm still prepared enough that people then are like damn he handled that really well it's because this wasn't my first time and that's the difference is that like when you you don't want people to think it's your first rodeo and so many of you are going into every meeting every call every appointment like it's your first
(25:10) rodeo and they can tell everyone can tell and the people who can tell the most are the people who you want to impress the most like it's very easy to impress poor people because they don't know any better much more difficult to impress a wealthy person because they know how the game works and so I see this with the uh like the the Rolex Flex or the I rented the lambo for the day and look at my Instagram picture anybody who's really in the game is like dude my jet cost 500 Lamborghinis like I could give a [ __ ] what you drive right like
(25:42) the way you impress them is you outwork them so to impress poor people you outspend them to impress wealthy people you outwork them that's the difference so if I see a kid who's not flexing any of that stuff but I see how hard this kid's working that's what impresses me if I if anything I see a younger guy who's like blowing cash to like Flex I'm I'm not even neutral I'm less impressed I'm like dude what are you play like who immediately I'm like who you trying to impress and then whatever they say I'm like it's the wrong person
(26:13) man cuz the right girl also is impressed by how hard you work because they know what that leads because people take wealth as an approximation for character and that's not true they say I have this Lamborghini therefore I work hard but if you just Way Beyond your means which is what I see it as especially if you're younger I just see that as irresponsible and insecure and so it's making sure that you're putting the right bait out and the best bait for getting the right people is the effort that they know you put in when they weren't looking and you
(26:50) only do that by when you show up the first time it looks like it's your 100th time and they know it's the only meaning you have with them and that you took 20 hours to prep for it they're like all right this kid's got it or this guy's got it this gal's got it she gets it like that's all I look I'm like immediately it's just like I had that conversation with my billionaire buddy he was like you don't need to say anymore I get it and I feel that way with vendors so if I get on the phone with someone and they have clearly 10
(27:19) hours of preparation 20 hours of preparation for that call they don't need to sell me that hard I'm like I get it you've demonstrated in advance the value that you want to provide before started working together like I get it like whatever the bill is send the invoice team will take care of it let's start working together when someone spends all their time trying to sell me and I'm like what did you do to prepare and they're trying to overcome with their words you already lost and so so many of you guys are losing before you step into the arena
(27:47) you're trying to ride a bull for the first time on your first rodeo and then thinking that you need to have some special talent or some natural whatever that's going to make it make it work like why why so so is different or better it's because that guy has spent 3 hours a day morning and afternoon every day for the last 2 years riding bulls and so he doesn't have to think about that his only thing that he's thinking about when he's on the ring is the uncontrollable so that he can use 100% of his bandwidth for oh I had the
(28:16) meeting and then he brought two people I didn't expect well tell me more about that oh that would work well with page two if you turn to page two in the in the in the prep file I have I think this will be really applicable for you and when we get there I'll I'll definitely need your Insight oh wow he included the but if I didn't have that prep ahead of time I'd be like oh wow I had a game plan and now it's totally screwed because there's two other people who are stakeholders so tldr you're underprepared most of the time most of
(28:42) you and I'm saying this because I talk to you guys a lot five minutes of prep for a 60-minute meeting will do more than trying to razzled Dazzle your way through with your words once you're on I think Sun Su said every battle is won before the battle begins

Why MrBeast Will be Worth $100 Billion - YouTube
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPre_XMgKjs

Transcript:
(00:00) Mr Beast is going to be worth over a hundred billion dollars and it's going to happen faster than you think so Jim this is me calling my shop for you there's eight points that I want to make and stick around to the end because I'm actually gonna react to one of his latest videos with Tom Brady and Pete Davidson over a nice lunch of feastables never scoop dessert so first is he has massive leverage in terms of what he puts in versus what he gets out so he may spend a million two million even four million dollars on a video but the
(00:24) amount of Impressions that that one video gets across the world because he also translates it is worth hundreds of millions let me give you an idea of what Beast Industries is all about in terms of the ecosystem across like four five six YouTube channels he's got 183 million subscribers and that doesn't include the international channels which are more than half of his audience on top of that he's got Tick Tock he's got Instagram he's got Twitter and in aggregate he's got over 300 million plus subscribers they're also incredibly
(00:53) engaged no I can't even hear in 2022 Mr Beast had the fastest growing account on Tick Tock and YouTube two of the platforms that has the most eyeballs right now he has the most of them you think about the amount of creators on each of those platforms and he was literally number one on both his biggest videos are bigger than the Super Bowl it's hard for people to comprehend that on the business side he's got Beast Burger which is a ghost kitchen which basically leverages the network of restaurants that already exist and then he uses his
(01:24) distribution base of customers to buy stuff on an app and then it gets delivered and filled on from whatever local restaurants he's already partnered with the next thing he's got Beast gaming which is where he'll try and make apps and video games because he has a big gaming audience but I think we're the real winner for him is going to be and this is what I would make my bet on is that he's going to be going all in on feastables number two is that when you have a media company your product is your marketing which is one of the
(01:46) unique advantages that only media companies have meaning the more you spend on your product which is your media the more marketing ends up happening if you don't know who I am my name is I make these videos because I hope to attract other business owners towards us that are doing over a million dollars a year in profit so we can invest in your business in office scale there's a ton of Leverage for media creators because what they sell and how they Market themselves are one in the same and with that leverage he's able to gain access
(02:12) to other people's massive distribution Paces he was surprised how much Joe Rogan's podcast with him you invest so much money into the show yeah I don't I don't I don't why do I need money how many older people started recognizing him from that podcast he can get on Joe Rogan he can get on flagrant one trillion dollars I give you right now I bought everything I wanted in life he can get on impulsive because they know that if he's on their podcast that podcast will crush because he brings his own audience and so whenever he does
(02:42) knock on the door the door is open for him number three is that cpg makes a ton of sense for him because so many people eat chocolate eat chips eat pretzels and a lot of those people are in his audience right now feastables is probably going to pay three to four hundred million dollars this year in sales manufacturing chocolate bars or chips or water is not overwhelmingly complex compared to making a software or an app or something like that what we are seeing with feastables just with chocolate is a drop in the bucket
(03:10) compared to how big this brand will be once he enters bigger more profitable categories what I mean by that is how many chocolate bars does the average person buy a week now how many sports beverages or water do people consume per week and purchase per week significantly more and so if he goes into those categories even if the same number of people purchased get 10 times the revenue he's currently getting with chocolate bars and right now he's selling out faster than any other brand my team had to go to a zillion different
(03:37) grocery stores and we still couldn't find these nuts because they're sold out almost everywhere he's taking up more shelf space and pushing through his product at a faster rate than any other brand on the category it's been absurd face whatever I thought we were gonna sell we're doing like five times better it's kind of shifted my whole mindset like retail space when you have a brand this big it's just so op if Jim has realized the power of cpg and the reason that it's so powerful in the influencer space is that most people don't have
(04:04) incredibly strong Affinity to the brands that they consume most brands are really old they just like have been drinking it because they've always drank it not because they actually made a conscious decision I could go stand in any Walmart in America and I would have to take 100 photos so those same people when they go into Walmart will buy my products it's just because people are like oh it's that guy from YouTube and they buy it but as soon as one of the influencers that you saw come up and that you were a
(04:26) fan of or even recognized you'll be more likely to take it currently these work out at 2 pound 90 per bar which is obviously more expensive than your average Supermarket chocolate oh it smells good and maybe even pay a little bit of a premium on top of the Commodities product and you can measure the strength of a brand based on how much of a premium you can charge on a commoditized product if I have two white t-shirts and one of them has an LV logo on it and this one can go for a hundred dollars and this one goes for one dollar
(04:54) then I have significant branding and pricing power as a result of that well right now the richest man in the world Bernard Arnold owns the Sprint and a zillion other luxury Brands because she understands the pricing power of brand and those gross profits that you can generate for selling the same thing is what you can then reinvest in Innovation staying ahead and marketing even more to reinforce the brand and that's what becomes the brand flywheel is that you to create a little bit of a premium you make the spread you reinvest that into
(05:24) The Branding itself then that reinforces the brand you can raise the price more increase the spread and then around and around you go until you have this incredibly strong brand that's established that consumers in general are willing to pay more for number four is that he's able to monetize the widest base of his audience at the most basic level every single person who views this video he gets some money off of his media his content touches the broadest audience which is simply entertainment everybody can watch Mr BEAST's content
(05:48) and so his products as a consequence he gets to reach everyone with what he sells but what's the level underneath of that if someone paid Mr Beast for an integrated ad inside of one of his videos we have a very serious problem my mom is currently online shopping and I don't think she has honey installed on her computer they believe they're going to make significantly more than they paid him off of that ad he would then make more money promoting his own thing and make up the Arbitrage you have to try these nuts so if someone gets 10 to
(06:17) 1 or 20 to 1 by paying him 20 million dollars a year to Market their their thing then it means that he might be able to get 200 million or 400 million a year marketing his thing because it stays within the brand and it's congruent number five is that Jim is smart enough to know that he doesn't know everything yeah for the most part I don't know what I'm doing trying to absorb knowledge as much as possible and I'll just call people I'll be like I don't know what I'm gonna learn off to you I'll do everything I can to add
(06:42) value to you in exchange just teach me everything you know like people who run a snack business and I've done that like five hours a day it's actually really hard for me to imagine being one of the most popular people on planet Earth in your early 20s and not letting that get to your head and having had many conversations with him he's confident that he can kill it but he's incredibly open-minded to listening to people who he feels has expertise outside of what he has mastered he hits up people anyone who he thinks he can learn anything from
(07:08) and he doesn't judge the fact that he's further ahead than some business people because think about this if he raised at one and a half billion or 1.6 or whatever it was for Beast Industries he's technically a billionaire on paper why would he talk to somebody who's not a bill dinner on paper because he still feels like there are things that he can learn from them and then Implement into his machine and instantly get to 10 or 50 or 100.
(07:31) he still texts thumbnails for his videos to some of his close buddies just to get their feedback because at the end of the day he cares about winning more than being right number six is that he's trying to hire a god Squad and he's doing it aggressively so he wants the uh Avengers of business and content to be on his team in-house he will do whatever it takes to win no matter what he gets people to move in with him in his house so that he can indoctrinate them into the Mr B's way of doing things which is just when it all costs without hurting
(07:57) anyone and do good while you do it smart people recognize the fact that he's growing like crazy and they want to get on the ship number seven is that it's amazing how collaborative rather than competitive he is now don't get me wrong he's super competitive as a person but I think a lot of his him against him but he's willing to collaborate with other creators rather than cut them down he helps people out on their first Channel with no subscribers he does tick tock videos with tick talkers that aren't nearly as big as him he sees the world
(08:24) as larger than a zero-sum game meaning we can just both win and I think that's actually been one of his low key secret to success is because early on he was masterminding with all these guys who were all together they're trying to get millions of subscribers and all of them did we're all super small YouTubers and we basically talked every day for a thousand days in a row and did nothing but just like hyper study like what makes a good video what makes a good thumbnail what what's good pacing like how to go viral and we would just call
(08:52) it like daily masterminds you know this is me just putting my theoretical hat on but I'll bet that him seeing that all of them could win when they all worked together and they all won faster and bigger than if they worked on their own probably changed the way he saw the world in terms of how he creates and how everyone can win together and number eight is that Jim is playing an infinite game and what I mean by that is that he's in the game to play the game by any stretch he doesn't need money anymore and if you lost everything tomorrow
(09:23) he would still make YouTube videos and the reason I know that is because when he had nothing he made YouTube videos I'm always gonna be making videos yeah 100 I'm stupid and there's also just like I'm like Predator this thing all right have 30 years of my life I don't care when I look at you like a parallel storyline where I wonder will he ever stop making videos yeah cause he's 25 now I know 10 years from now I'm like you know I'm 35.
(09:46) 10 years from now I'll be getting started and because he plays the game that way he's gonna have one of the biggest piece of Leverage that everyone underplays which is time he's already got almost a decade of experience under his belt in his low 20s in terms of like entrepreneurial years he's actually older than people give him credit for but still has 60 70 years ahead of him where he can continue to compound that he's just getting started and he's a master of content and over the next decade he'll become a master of business now let's
(10:16) talk about what that means from evaluation perspective a company that's fast growing that has significantly better margins because they don't have nearly the marketing costs because most times when the biggest costs in them is inventory and marketing and so if you can cut out an entire massive cost center and get instant National recognition or International recognition the the potential of the brand day one already becomes a billion 10 billion Etc and for that reason I think that Mr Beast will be a sense of billionaire and
(10:47) it's also because he has so much time to do it all right so I'm going to enjoy a nice Mr Beast feastable chocolate bar while I watch one dollar versus one billion dollar yacht thank you and after stepping on board it was pretty clear why this yacht only cost one dollar if you have to ask how much it costs to carry a can't afford it you crack a windshield it's like there's 200 Grand I don't need this giant ship all to myself so I wanted to share this experience with you guys my subscribers this is great you know everybody makes
(11:16) interesting stuff and he's able to like Find humor in everyday things and like I just I always know like man I'm like God I gotta be better I'm not sure used to be a melter if you like this video then you'll love the next video how you can get rich in the new economy breaking down Kylie Jenner Mr Beast The Rock and many others that are capitalizing on this huge influencer wave

Transcript:
(00:00) in this video I'm going to show you how to turn $11,000 into $45,000 through email and over the last 90 days we spent just under 10 million emails from acquisition. comom and we generate tens of millions of dollars across our portfolio using email itself and in this video I'm going to break down emails that I've sent and I'll give you the 10 tactics that have worked very well for us so far first things first here's why I think you should do email I was a and decided to not email for the vast majority of my life because I hate
(00:30) money apparently and so the average Roi for email depending on the source you look at is between 35 and 45 return so that means that for every dollar you spend on software or putting time into your email you can get like $45 back like imagine if there was a stock investment that you could 50x in a week well that's kind of like what email is and people still don't do it myself included and part of the reason that making money on email is more profitable is because you actually already spent the time to acquire this contact and in
(01:00) a lot of ways emails just follow up and so you spent the cost to acquire the lead now you're just reminding them that you exist and so basically the only real cost is just whatever software you use and whoever or whomever you may have to pay in order to write the emails that's pretty much it and so one email writer can send an email to 10 million people and that is a tremendous amount of Leverage that you get in your business that a lot of people ignore on top of that email is one of the most consumed
(01:26) media platforms and it hasn't died down so 61% of people check their their email multiple times per day 20% of people check it multiple times per hour it has almost the same consumption rate as social media in terms of how engaged some of the users are of people reading their emails every single day and what's cool about email is that it's actually uh uniform across age groups and so you can see between 15 and 24 25 and 44 45 and 64 and 65 plus pretty much everyone 90% you know plus or 84 the very end bracket there read email all the time if
(01:57) you're going to master something it's one that transcends age groups and I'll bet you even though we don't have the metric it transcends countries as well I would bet you that UK people probably respond similar to us people probably even respond similar to Chinese people in terms of their email consumption and I know just because I've gone back and forth with Chinese you know uh providers and warehouses and things like that they're pretty responsive on email too and so a massive very invisible platform
(02:22) and so as I think about email the objective of the email has one of two purposes one is to increase the likelihood that this person purchases in the future or that they purchase that's fundamentally it and so basically has the exact same objectives as content and so it's just a different form of content consumption except where you can guarantee that you get delivery whereas when you make a post the algorithm decides who gets to see it when you send an email basically your past performance determines whether or not they get to see it and there's a couple little
(02:53) tricks to make sure you get in the right email inbox and not get in the promo tabs we'll go over some of that stuff but big picture you actually have the list and you send it directly to them and if you're embarrassed by the way that you haven't sent email then worry not because I am too and I will show you the first email sent to my list just not that many months ago that's obviously within acquisition. the portfolio company send emails all the time but I hadn't sent anything to mosy nation and so this was it so I started with subject
(03:18) is this on and I just said that because I thought it was funny I started with a quote that I like a lot which is it only takes 20 hours of fol effort to get proficient any skill the problem is most people waste years before they start the first hour so I've been making content for four or 5 years now and I had yet to send an email and so that quote of mine felt rather appropriate for myself the thing is is that I think you can model something like this like if it has been a minute for you like you're like I should have been emailing it's okay you can start whenever you want and the day you start is the day you start getting
(03:45) 45 plus Returns on the time and money put into it so I said after 13 years of business I'm finally going to write you I know a while the fact that it's taking me this long is doubly stupid considering people think that I'm an author and part of the reason I actually didn't send emails before is that I'm so select with your attention I don't want to waste it ever and so I would rather not send you something at all rather than send you something bad that's number one number two is that I'm very picky with written word and so if you
(04:09) ever see written word across any of my social channels believe it or not I wrote it it either came out of my mouth or I physically typed it it's directly from me cuz for some reason I feel like written word carries more ump than anything else does and it's probably why even in like legal discourse if you have written proof and contracts are legally binding it's because it's written there's something powerful about words I basically break this whole down and say hey I'm starting M money minute which is basically the name of my newsletter so
(04:33) my whole goal was how do I provide value in under 60 seconds so someone can read it and immediately get something that they can use in their business and so my goal is that I hope I pay for myself with every email that I send and I also include one thought that's improved my life and so for here if I were to like apply this to this it' be like okay this is kind of the thought that improved my life and this one I uh I don't have a tactic that improves their business but maybe just reminding them to send emails
(04:56) would be the first thing but everyone after that that are officially mosty money minutes do so let's dive into those now let's talk about different tactics so first things first everybody wants to talk about how much you can make from email but no one talks about unsubscribing right no one wants it's like the dirty oh yeah people UNS every time you send a communication out there's going to be people unsubscribe and I don't see unsubscribing nearly as negatively as other people do and I'll explain why when I look at our people who show up to workshops a lot of times
(05:20) they are people who unsubscribed so it's not an insult it's like they know who I am and they they're they're in I don't see it as a negative per se also every single day thousands of people unsubscribe from my Instagram thousands of people unsubscribe from YouTube but I just have more people who subscribe and so I just see the process of advertising is letting people know about your stuff and so if someone unsubscribes they absolutely know about you and your stuff and it doesn't necessarily mean they don't want to buy it just might not mean that that form of communication or that particular inbox they opted in with is
(05:50) the one that they want to use fine no big deal so instead of trying to hide it it's like probably the the like I if I see a brand try and make unsubscribing hard I hate them and so I have always tried to do the opposite of that I think number one is that you want to make unsubscribing easy don't keep people captive and let me explain by that is I don't want to keep sending emails to an uninterested segment of my list because it'll actually make my domain deliverability go down long term by sending it for vanity metrics of look I sent more emails I actually decrease the
(06:19) likelihood that the people who do want to read my emails actually get them and so that's why you want to make unsubscribing easy because if you make it hard they might not unsubscribe but then they go dormant which is actually worse for you so make it easy I want to be real with you for a second if you haven't sent email or you really don't send off in like once every six months or something the first time you send an email you're going to have a higher unsubscribe rate than normal and that's okay I call it shaking the trade it's basically like pulling forward churn
(06:44) it's the same thing if you correspond with customers who are on a recurring Revenue business and you haven't been emailing them or haven't been reaching out to them you will always get more turn you'll get next month's turn and this month's turn all at once and so the highest turn I ever had was on the first email I ever sent and so it was like just over 1% which is crazy right but now it's like 042 unsubscribe rate per email which is fine as long as we grow higher than that between emails that's a
(07:07) that's a good Roi and it's like you have to take the logical extreme here if you are unafraid to email because you don't want to get unsubscribed why do you have emails to begin with it's kind of like saying well I don't want to post content because then people would stop following me it's like well the only point of them following you is to advertise your stuff and so if the logical extreme of this is just never do anything then that's probably not the right conclusion number two two and this one is a little bit more advanced but very worth it so
(07:33) hopspot ran a really cool research study where they saw that they had an incre so already insane Roi for email they had a 791 per increase in Roi from email from one thing which is people who segmented their lists got way higher Returns on email which should be somewhat unsurprising right like if you send the right emails to the right people then they will be more likely to buy your stuff so if I send a beginner email to a list of advanced people they'll be like this is not for me and to the same degree and also it doesn't have anything to do with the email just might not be
(08:04) right for them and to the same degree if I send an advanced thing to people who don't have a business or want to start a business then they're going to be like this doesn't apply and so it's way less about how good the email is and so much more about who's getting it and so segmenting the list is basically like if you have any qualifiers on your optin so like revenue or if they have a business or don't have a business which are some of the ones that we have in our our opt and process this allows us to send content that's more applicable to those
(08:27) people and so when we have our list we say oh let's just send this to the 500k plus let's just send this to the 5 million plus let's just send this to the 0 to 100K and so a lot of people want to lie cuz they think they're going to get like a better experience if they go up but like you're just going to get stuff that doesn't apply to you so just be honest when you're putting your info in so let me pull up a sample email so we can break down the structure so you can think about it now to be clear you don't have to do this I'm just going to explain what I was doing and if it's
(08:50) useful for you great number one on the subject heading I thought a lot about this because on some hand there's a lot of Internet marketers and and and and digital guys who you know they they split test that the hell out of their subjects and I thought about this more as like a podcast where it's like podcast episode X and then it just keeps going because my thought I'll explain was if I can basically develop the brand of mosy money minute to be very strong then eventually it will get to the point where independent of what I have after MOS money minute when people know that they always get value in the past when
(09:19) they read it they'll just click going back and forth on this I was like I want to build the brand of my email to be strong and so on one hand you could say well if they know it's from you then that could be the brand but we sent other emails as well that are not mosy money minute so I wanted mosy money minute to have its own kind of like little space in someone's mind that was a choice I made you could obviously just have your subject be proof over a promise that's your call but that's why I decided to stick with it and that's what I've done so right off the bat I
(09:44) think about everything in terms of feedback cycles and reward and so I want to reward every action that someone's takes and so if someone first reads the email then if they've been rewarded in the past from asum minute they'll click and they'll open it now I need to reward them for that so a lot of people think about Behavior as what happened before that triggered someone to do something but that's actually not how Behavior works and that's been proven the way Behavior works is that you did that thing because you did it another time in
(10:06) the past and rewarded for it so if you want to see why someone does something look at what happens after they do it because when you do a behavior do you do it to get something to change or to improve your life in some way right words I like I start the email here because I want someone even in less than the time it takes to read the email to immediately be rewarded for clicking an opening for me a a quote or a tweet is something that's in one glance they can be rewarded for taking the first action
(10:31) that's the first thing I'm doing now the next thing is that I have kind of the meat of my email now for me my me to the email I keep under I think 200 words because it's roughly a minute and so that's been kind of like the mosy money uh minute kind of promise that being said we also send other emails that are really long so Lila sends emails to the kind of like the most qualified businesses on the list uh that we have that you know generate the most revenue and hers tend to be a little bit longer and that's because she tends to teach more via story I have a little bit more like tactical style her emails do great
(11:02) too so I want to make sure that this doesn't seem like rule of law I want to explain why I wrote my emails this way so we have our tactic and I very clearly there's a lot of times where I'm like man I could put this other thing in one concept just keep it on one thing because as soon as you start in you're not writing a book here it's just what is one very clear thing and I just keep cutting it down until it's like this is what's happening and so you want to basically introduce a a problem or condition that makes the solution viable
(11:28) so no matter how good your product is a stranger won't believe you because you're biased okay so that's a problem if strangers don't believe you okay so the easiest way to overcome this it's overwhelming social proof okay there's a solution but now how do I do that and so then I put a little extra line and de so so few businesses do it here's an easy tactic to display tons of proof you already have but aren't showing this is one where they already have all the stuff they're 6 in away from gold and we just need to cross the barrier and so I
(11:52) just said cool if you're bricking mortar print out every five star review screenshot it across all review sites online then frame it with $1 frames you can get from the dollar store cover your lobby Flor to ceiling with them and see the PS statement for a realer example so that also and that's a little bit of foreshadowing I'll show you um for something else that we do in the email now if you're online then you read the one for online after that it's like cool I delivered my one minute of value that any business owner can immediately use in their business because almost every
(12:14) business has a few festar reviews on some platform that they can immediately repurpose to get strangers to believe them more and then ultimately some more stuff I have my little sign off and underneath I have a CTA so if hey you're scaling your business go here if you want to start a business go here so this us this goes to school this goes to acquisition.
(12:32) comom for workshops cuz that's for businesses that we're not necessarily going to do a deal with or maybe we'll do one in the future it's just an easy way for us to meet them so it's just like cool come fly out we'd love to meet you okay so PS I always have a PS statement in every email because beyond the headline it's the most read part of the email so not having a PS statement is PS stupid so have one the thing is is that I think about this as again what have they just done so they have Now read my email so I want to reward them for reading my email and I want to encourage people to click
(13:01) because one of the things I think a lot of people try not to do is try to get people not to click or send too many links so sending too many links is a bad thing so that's true in terms of getting someone to click you want to regularly get people to click because you want your audience to be rewarded for clicking in general and so if you have a Blog that you send out don't put the blog in the email put a really interesting nugget from the blog in the email and then click there so that they can read it and so you're just you're
(13:23) training the audience and rewarding them ideally if the blog is good they will do it again just like mosy money minute if your blog is good it'll increase the likely they do it again if your blog is bad or your emails are bad they'll decrease it and so this is why I see this very much as content because it has to be good and I and think about the alternative scenario if you have four good emails and then one terrible one it can just like that one was just so useless that they're like ah I'm not going to do this again I would rather
(13:46) just extend a period of time where I haven't talked to somebody and just make sure that what I send them is good and long term if people don't open your emails then you'll eventually end up in the promo tab which is kind of like email death like no one ever really checks that even if you have good stuff and so you want to obviously get people to read your emails quickly so that's one email now let's talk about a different tactic so mobile optimized design so right now 58 60% of global internet traffic is mobile devices and what's crazy is that a lot of people's emails are not optimized for mobile
(14:19) viewership and that's where a lot of people are actually going to be reading your thing and so you want to make sure that you look at your emails on a desktop format and on a mobile format so that they display the right way for for the viewing platform they're being viewed through when you do that all you do is first objective of email increase the legy they convert and this is especially true if you had images to your emails this is more like e-commerce does a lot of this that's where like images can get totally messed up not look good it just looks unprofessional and totally plummets the clickthrough rates for your emails number four
(14:48) consistent layout SL format I tend to love templates I love to just figure out what works and then do it over and over and over again so in the beginning you might experiment a little bit but if you see that a certain form format gets more responses or more click-throughs then it's like cool let's just do that over and over again and so you'll notice that the mosy Monday minuts more or less have the same format they have the thing they have the content they have the CTA and then they have some sort of PS statements or the CTA is the PS statement but that's included in every single one of them I want people to know
(15:16) what they're going to get think about McDonald's it's like I don't want any surprises I'm expecting Big Mac I want fries I want my Coke and so today's Big Mac fries and coke is different than yesterday's but I don't want it to be different it's not the same Burger but I want it to still be just as good so let's rock on to the second one same thing mosy money minute 391 per increase in sales from one change okay that's interesting I'd be like I would click that so words I like so this is the immediate reward ideally for them
(15:39) clicking so they're like cool I got some value from that and I just use tested stuff because I just use the tweets that I know that people have shared the most and so hopefully also you might get people who share your newsletter or your emails as well which is kind of the point now after that I've got my my content bucket again this is under you know 200ish words I just try to remind people that I keep this this promise like that's all kept this under a minute awesome then I have my TTA and then I have my PS statement and so you'll notice this very common theme so similar
(16:04) subject reward them for that meat of the content CTA PS statement you can alter like where the CTA is where the PS statements like these things I think you can alter around cuz a lot of times I just make memes uh for my for my PS statement I don't think there's any science around it I just think it's fun you can do that or you can obviously have your P your PS statement B your CTA for whatever it is all of those are kind of viable I don't like rules in general the fundamentals are always going to be to reward for every step in the process
(16:29) so because I can provide value to you in under a minute I'll also tell you what this tactic was so speed to contact so I believe in this so much I started almost started to fund a buying businesses just to implement this one tactic so it's simple to understand it's hard to do but if you can do it in a few minutes so you call leads within 60 seconds of opting in so Harvard Business Review publish a study that demonstrated an average of 391 per increase in sales 3 91% increase in sales so let me ask you this right
(16:53) now is there anything else that you have on your docket that could quadruple the sales of your business no well then that would basically mean that calling leads fast should be the first priority that you have because it could quadruple your sales CU if there's nothing else that can do it then that should be the priority of the business and if you're like man I don't have the sales staff to be able to to have that kind of coverage well you can afford that sales staff with the 391 increase in sales that you're going to get as a result I love tactics like
(17:22) this that are just massive unlocks in businesses and that's the type of stuff that we go over in our scaling workshops which is why that was the CTA next Tactical nugget so optimize preview text so this is one that I actually learned more recently for our stuff so maybe embarrassing whatever optimizing preview text for the email so you know when you look at your all of your emails you see the Bold subject and then after that you've got like that little bit of text afterwards that little bit of text is kind of like the when you hover on a a
(17:47) YouTube video and it shows you a couple it's preview right and so that preview has a big impact on how many people choose to open the email and so right now it has for us had an increase of 24% % and just to give you an idea here 24% of people so one out of four people check that text before they even open and so uh that's what they reported I would bet it's even higher than that it takes 10 seconds to do this and is so worth it because if you don't then it'll just take the first 150 characters of your email which may have just like hey
(18:15) John blah blah blah like it doesn't it's it's not valuable right and so we want to pull the the most valuable nuggets forward especially things that induce curiosity next tactical nugget clear CTA so I'm not going to harp on like of course you want to have a reason to do it and you have a reason to do it now and tell them exactly what they get those are you know CTA 101 but I think that having basically a continued interest CTA and then have a I want to take action and buy CTA are not terrible ideas to have in an email and so I'm not saying like I don't I'm not one of these
(18:45) people who's like only have one link only have one CTA I think you can have more than one but it's more that you only want to have one per audience or per objective now if you have five then that can get you know kind of aggressive overall but I think one or two you're safe as long as there's a clear reason that someone would click one versus the other all right let's rock another one so mosy money minute so easy 21% profit increase for recurring businesses so boom reinforce if you grow your business without fixing your problems you grow your problems instead all right so annual renew fees
(19:15) so this works for any business recurring or reoccurring but especially recurring obviously so if you have a membership or recurring Revenue model and keep people over year this is a great profit tactic that adds a ton of Revenue so it's a onetime annual fee on top of your monthly so it doesn't interfere with with Front End Sales cuz it happens a year later so it's not immediate so people don't not sign up because of this fee and if someone stays a year they're also very unlikely to leave and so the fee is usually the price of about 1 to 3
(19:39) months and by adding it in you add 8 to 24% to your Revenue without incurring any cost so if you have a call it a 20% margin business and you add another 20% to revenue with no added cost you double the profit of the business from one thing which is by adding an annual renewal F in and so this allows you um to keep your advertised your adverti pricing because that's what influences your conversions whatever your monthly price is but then also get the benefit of having a of the profit of basically a
(20:04) price that's about 8ish to 25% more than your current in terms of annualized and so for example if I charge $39 a month I might make my annual renewal 99 so that's 2 months this takes my annual revenue per customer from 468 to 567 that's a 21% increase and so it makes my effective monthly rate 47 per month so look at the difference here but if I had it 47 I might convert significantly fewer customers and so this kind of Blends the benefits of a lower cost up front but gets the benefits of the higher price and that's why it's such a cool tactic very effective if you use it well so again CTA and then this one was
(20:39) a funny one where the other ones were more tactical this one is like hey here's how it's just a funny meme so in the spirit of PS statements if you like these types of tactics and want 60c things that you can immediately use to make more money in your business you can just go to acquisition.
(20:57) comom newletter and you can opt in there and I'll just keep sending you this stuff twice a week which actually brings me up to the next point point before I get to the next email which is how often should you send email and to whom should you send it big picture after talking to the best email marketers I knew before deciding to start my uh newsletter number one is the perfect Cadence seems to be around three times a week all right now again I don't like rules and if you hate rules as much as I do then nothing is a rule all right you could send two you could send one whatever but most people found that basically the more often you email the more you will convert it's kind of like
(21:25) more content but there is a spot where people are like I'm getting bothered but the thing is is that's where I feel like like putting more effort into making the emails high quality pays dividends because think about it like this if you send someone stuff that always makes them money then how much would they like you to send them tons and so that's why I I'm a big fan of like I don't really have promotional emails per se I'd rather just have every email be valuable and then just say like hey if you found
(21:50) this valuable you can go here and that way I don't have to balance like what's my give ask Ratio or anything like that it's like I'm just going to only purely provide value here just like content and if you want to take next steps towards doing or working with us or something like that then you click the link that's made easily available to you so to me I see like just having your link or like what you do or whatever your lead magnet is in there is kind of like having your link in BIO so like if they want to find
(22:13) out more you just make it easy for them so Cadence wise if you haven't started yet start with once a month and then you can move on but I will say this and this is the thing that broke the barrier for me is that I actually was like okay how many emails do I want to send and so I said okay I will commit to twice a month and so I actually sat down and wrote 24 emails and it took me like half a day and then I thought well shoot I could have been doing this off a half day's work I could have been emailing my whole
(22:36) list for a year and so after I saw how I don't want to say easy it was but how I could do it I then decided to commit to doing it and now we do significantly more than that but that was kind of like the if you just write 12 emails and you're like cool I've actually written all my emails for the year and then everything else on top of that's bonus and the reason I'm even making this video because it's it's not typical for me to talk about something that I haven't done for an extended period of time but I had had such a positive response from uh mosy Nation from the
(23:01) mosy money minute that I thought I would make this video for you cuz honestly like this is one of the I would say honestly one of the biggest mistakes I made in my career was I waited so long to email and actually almost all my businesses like gym launch I didn't email until like 2 or 3 years in which is insane it's it's just saying no to money and I should have just done it it was just the amount of effort that it took I didn't want to add something else to my plate cuz I was always so spread thin but now that I understand how much
(23:26) the return for email per unit of effort it's totally worth it and I'll give you a side note like we didn't do any email follow on school for a different reason we had some technical stuff because we wanted to do it through the platform and then as soon as we started doing email followup we got a 40% lifting conversion so it's like dear God like what else is going to get you that kind of lift and again it's free strongly recommend doing it start with once a month get them all just block them all out and be like okay I've got that done and then every time you feel like motivated to do one you can just add on top and it's just gravy
(23:56) it's bonus I personally also don't like committing to a Cadence I don't really commit anywhere to a Cadence I never want to feel like I have to make something because then whenever I have to make it it's not as good as I want it to be and so I'd rather just have a quality threshold that if I've got two good ones in me then two is what's going to go out if I've got four in me four is what's going to go out but if I've got zero it's zero let's talk about tactical nuggies which is the actual stuff inside of the email and so we want email if you
(24:25) think about the hypothetical ideal email it should be one that looks like emails that you would exchange every day and so often times emails that you exchange every day are pretty much all text a handful of sentences and then that's about it maybe a link maybe not a link there's usually not a lot of images and so we want our emails to approximate that as closely as possible because the equal opposite of that is that it looks like the Vegas Strip inside of the email right that looks like 100% promotion which then the algorithm you know AI is pretty smart nowadays they're like oh this is just promotion and so that they
(24:55) can put it into the promo Tab and so you want it to just look like an email and so you want it to be as much text as possible for us we don't send images and if you do have the link it's you've got one maybe two links in there Max and we've also noticed that if we put more money stuff in an email it tends to get a higher percentage in the promo Tab and so I try to remove money language from the text itself to increase the likel to gets in the right place if you're like why am I why do I even bother making it only plain text why do I even bother only you know limiting the number of links why do I bother having you know
(25:25) less money in the title why do I even bother asking them to reply why don't I just send it to them automatically for whatever the lead magnet is well I'll tell you why right now for B2B 16.99% of marketing emails don't even get into the inbox let alone promot tab they don't even make it and so that's because of your domain Authority and so basically you want to have you have a reputation with the email servers on how good or how high quality the emails that you send are and so by doing these steps it's it's kind of like 100 golden BBS there's no one one silver bullet that solves all this stuff it's just
(25:55) consistently providing emails that people engage with and that they do click and they do open that they do read those are all indications that the stuff that you're sending is high quality and that it's improving their overall email experience and so just like every other platform I I will make this very strong statement which is don't try and figure out hacks try and simply align what you do with the objective of the platform the objective of an email provider is that they provide the highest quality
(26:20) email experience and sift out the fewest important emails cuz that think about a terrible experience if someone's like hey I sent you this email and I'm like I didn't get it and they're like yeah I sent it and then I look and I'm like I'm not I'm I'm you know Google is is is taking all these important emails I may consider switching servers I would say that's the worst thing that can happen so that's why they they like they will let emails through the equal opposite of that the false negatives is when I'm like man this the the filter on this spam is so weak I'm just getting all
(26:47) these spam emails constantly now that'd be less likely than the first scenario but still an increase in likelihood that I might consider switching email providers and let me give you a 2011 Advanced TX itic if you want an even higher clickthrough rate and deliverability rate make the link something that's Google native and so if I want to send a YouTube link then that'll probably have a higher deliverability if I want to send a sales letter I can have it be accessed in Google Drive because they understand
(27:12) what the file is if I want to send a vssl I can also have it uploaded to Google Drive and so sometimes these kind of like Hokey more duct taped look together type assets that you might send sometimes they actually convert even better so if you haven't tested it out worth a shot next nugie is AB testing subject declines so I told you that I'm trying to build the brand of mosy money minute and so I'm willing to sacrifice a little bit of short-term open right so that longterm the audience that becomes hardcore about mosy money minute will just always open the mosim money minute
(27:39) but even so the things after mosy money minute will still have an influence on that and so having an AB split test for your headline or your subject will test for a small percentage an AB and then once it has the winner will then send the rest of the list the the winning combination and this more and more platforms are getting intelligent about this like YouTube does the same thing for thumbnails and uh headlines cuz some of you guys are like I I see you're switching this out it's like duh there's a split test tool of course we're going to split test it but the same thing works for email so that's a perfect
(28:09) segue to okay well how do I get people to opt into my list and so what I want to do is I'll read you the email that comes in um after you opt in and so one of the things that I do is I like to PE like when I write my books I always inevitably write a couple chapters that are really valuable chapters but don't like really don't flow with the whole books kind of theme but they're still really good and so rather than just like toss them or use them as like a YouTube script I still finish them and make them book quality but I just peel them out and say hey I'll just give this to you
(28:39) when you opt into my list and I have other chapters that I've written that like when we do our next launch I'll have those as bonuses for doing it and so the only people that get them though is the people who are on the list and so I like to have little bonuses that are platform specific that give people reasons to also be subscribed there and so it's like if I could do something like that on YouTube I would but I have to do it through a link so at least on email I can make something that gives people a recent to sign up Beyond just immediately getting tactics that will always make them more money this one breaks the mold but I want to walk
(29:12) through why I think this this email is important and so first thing is I have a little bit of anticipation I've got a big announcement that's coming right and as long as you're subscribed you're going to find out about it first on top of that I deliver on my promise that's reinforcing them opting it in general and then on top of that you want them to engage with the email so there's a couple things here so when you reply to an email then remember I said earlier about the promo tab well when someone replies to an email then you kind of like Get reinforced in terms of the
(29:36) algorithm of the server like oh this is something that they're engaged with and so you want people to engage and so for us once you reply yes then we send you the chapter so that gives them a reason to do it and so you can have your opt in have a widget when they opt in explain the value of why they should stay on not just get the widget because I think that's just as or more important if someone opts into your list just to get the lead magnet then they just want the lead magnet they don't want regular
(29:59) communication from you so I want to sell them on regular communication from me plus by the way here's that thing and I put that near the end because it's like you have their attention until you give them the immediate reward that was promised which you obviously have to do but I would rather say hey by the way here's the other things that you're going to get that I didn't tell you about so it's like I want to surprise and Delight with the stuff that I'm providing them before I give them the other thing that of course I'm going to provide it's like you have this tiny
(30:23) tiny moment where they have huge motivation and so it's like you just want to capitalize on it and think about everything as re enforcement loops and so people opted in for this lead magnet they can get the email by replying yes now I also want to resell them on doing this so inside the secret chapter it reveals things like how to get people to engage with your stuff who otherwise wouldn't so whenever I get a new market I almost always start with this how to make your advertising 9 and a half times as profitable there are two things you need to pull this off and it's on page
(30:47) five so putting the actra page is like oh this is actually like it's right in there the most powerful off of all time this will never expire five ways to add Hoops that increase lead quality the four ways to display discounts and there's a lot more but this is a solid start on how to design a winning acquisition strategy so inside of here I have multiple things that I'm sending them and they just have to reply yes so it's cool I've sold you in just these four lines on why you should stay subscribed and then all of this chunk is to get them to reply yes because even
(31:12) though they said they wanted it's like I really need them to reply yes so that I can seg myself to not the promo tap and if you play out the alternative scenario which is that you give a bad lead Magnet or you just immediately send the lead magnet with nothing else all right which is both of those are I consider bad scenarios if you send a good lead magnet but you don't sell them on staying they'll just immediately unsubscribe or just get the thing and then just never check anything again the other uh
(31:34) scenario is that they do follow the steps and then they read the lead magn and say all of that work wasn't worth it and that is like the single thing that I it keeps me up at night and so I just want to make sure that I always give a positive return on time uh relative to anything else someone could consume and so if we're talking about open rates then the next thing that you're going to want talk about is Click through rates CU fundamentally you want them to take action and so a lot of the market of email marketers has actually shifted towards tracking CTR over open
(32:01) rates and I think the biggest reason for that was because Apple privacy laws made it very difficult to track open rates and so I'll give you what our stats are just as maybe a benchmark so for us over the last uh 3 months our average open rate is uh just under 36% so it's 35.
(32:19) 7 and our average CTR is 8 and a half so we have a very strong CTR so I don't know how accurate the open rate stat that I just shared is I just know that that's what we get reporting back on but ctrs we feel very confident on CTR typically will get pared between two things one is percentage of all people you sent it to who took action or clicked and then also percentage of people who opened who clicked so it's like okay so if I had 100,000 people and I got you know 30,000 to open my email and I got 10,000 to click then it would show a 33% per of people who opened
(32:50) clicked but overall I would have a 10% of the 100,000 10,000 who actually clicked and took the next step and so for us cuz day and a half it'd be 8,500 for every 100,000 that we send which is pretty crazy it's pretty good and so that is what I would be optimizing all my effort for but I'd be optimizing that over a longer period so think about it less about each email but think about what my overall uh CTR is for my emails in general because there are some emails that you're like you don't need to make the quote click ask as hard but we want
(33:19) to balance that over time so we're kind of like depositing before we withdraw a little bit I'm going to give you three timing tactics around emails these are all just golden BBS things that'll just give you kind tiny little lifts in terms of your overall performance and so if you're sending let's say one email a week then you might as well maximize the likelihood and effectiveness of that email and so if you're B Toc it seems like Mondays and Tuesdays tend to be better days overall and so there's an average increase in open rate of about 18% for B Toc it's a business consumer
(33:45) now if you're B2B this is kind of interesting it's Wednesday that's actually the bigger lift day and actually is about comparable to the B Toc lift so it's I see that as like there's just a time period for more people that consumers are more distracted call it on Mondays and Tuesdays whereas business people B2B are like working Mondays and Tuesdays like they get they get to catch catch their breath on Wednesday now I could just be adding a narrative to this who knows but fundamentally the stats are there and this is across zillions of emails I got that from Neil Patel he's an awesome marketer and so he shared that with me
(34:15) in terms of days the last tactic is around what time of day so that is days of a week but the next is time of day and so it seems like there's two sweet spots that occur and one is basically right before lunch and right after lunch so it's like 10: to noon and then 1: to three are the kind of like these these sweet spots where where they open the first thing in the morning I think is typically a very competitive time because there's so many actual real business emails that they're going through that they're like well I I got to I got to deal with this stuff first if you kind of slide in in those times you tend to see bigger improvements now
(34:43) that'll be more specific for businesses that are local when you're across time zones I wouldn't lose too much sleep over it for us we do all of our stuff off PSD but I know that I've got a three-hour window if I'm just looking at us and if half my audience is international which it is that's going to be more relevant for the people who only uh transact in one time zone so with that being said let's look at this puppy so this uh this email did exceptionally well this mosy money about testimonials that convert and so the
(35:08) perspective rich people buy time poor people buy stuff ambitious people buy skills lazy people bu distraction and so I put that one in there because for the week it was a super high performer uh in terms of tweets and this email also got plenty it's so funny because I got so many tags of people screenshotting my email and putting that on their story which amazing right cuz normally email list only grow up from you driving it but how amazing would it be if your email list itself brought other people in right and that's at least for me that's my goal so the actual tactical
(35:36) nugget I'll give it to you right now so turning testimonials into ads is very profitable but often very tough so it's like cool there's a problem right and so the main reason is people suck at making testimonials after reviewing all the testimonials and what separated the best from the rest there was one thing the top four all had in common which was a pain-based hook and so these were my top four hooks of all time this was just for gym lunch specifically so I looked over 2500 testimonials and so these are the top four hooks so we were two months away from shutting our doors we were
(36:01) barely making enough survive so this is different ads I paid payroll rent and I'd finished the month with $0 of profit I pay all my expense every month work all day and end up with $ Z of profit so kind of interesting that there's two Z of profit in the top four of all time different guys we there was no script there like that's like my marketer hats like interesting zero zero they both said zero dollars of profit which I find fascinating if those hooks and the hook is one of the most important parts of any AD then we should obsess about what
(36:26) the testimonial hooks are so get more people to watch them and so then it's like okay so the next time you record a testimony or ask for one don't ask them how life was before they started working with you cuz then they're going to give this very long story it's not going to it's be hard to find a really good hook so instead just ask them for their worst moment just say what was the worst moment because that's what all of these were is a moment and so the moments are what makes hooks the details are what make them powerful and so it wasn't just
(36:48) like oh we were struggling it says we were barely making enough to survive we were two months away from shutting our doors like that's much more visceral than stuff was hard right and so then of course we have our CTA per hug uh and one of the things that I've learned with ctas across content including email is a lot of people do the same copy paste CTA or I even see YouTubers like take their mini ads and just like slice them in they're wearing a different shirt or it's a different energy or whatever I think that's a huge mistake it's like if you think about the reason that you make stuff it's to increase the likelihood
(37:20) that people convert in the future or to convert them now and so if you want to increase the likel that they convert then why wouldn't you just take like if that's the most important part shortterm not long-term then why wouldn't you take the extra you know minute or 30 minutes even to just like make it contextual and so if you've noticed even my YouTube videos like this you know the CTA for this video was around the email it's contextual right if I have a thing for beginners then it would probably be around school if I have something that's really high level around like Enterprise Value then scaling workshops for
(37:49) acis.com or the portfolio itself would be the CTA and so making the CTA itself obviously related to the content but also how you bridge into the CTA and so this if you like tactics like these to Great your business you'll find love our actually this is a terrible CTA I should have said something more around I should have linked this more to testimonials so room for improvement but this one still did really well and so yeah like FYI 25% of our rooms over $5 million in revenue and 50% over a million so which just kind of gives an idea of the the quality of the room that people can go to stay rich and then uh I
(38:17) have a funny meme at the end because I like memes and so big picture same format boom reward them for opening boom reward them for reading add your CT in the middle make it contextual and if you do that even once a month you won't make less money and so hey guys we actually just redid our organic opt in for this for our email and so the newest one should be underneath of this video and it's actually because I have something very very juicy that's coming out in the next 30 days it's not what you think but it's really good I've spent a tremendous amount of time on it and I will predict that a lot of
(38:53) people will it'll be a Canon thing within you know the the MOs Nation World I'll just I'll just leave it at that and so you won't want to miss it if you want that and to opt into these lovely very tactical email value bombs that are consistently coming in on a regular basis that take less than 60 seconds to read you can go by clicking the link or go to acis.com newsletter

(00:00) what's going on everyone it is alex from rosa here from gym launch allen prestige labs you get 110 million dollars in revenue so if right now you're in a vehicle uh or a business and it's not growing the way you want to grow you're looking at other people who are doing the same thing as you and you want to do better or better than them or as good as them then i would like to share a kind of the nuggets from a conversation i had yesterday with an agency owner um who was kind of struggling with the same thing so they they're they're an agency
(00:23) owner they're in the real estate space and you've been doing this for a year and a half ish and he's like at what point do i throw in the talent switch industries right and this was an awesome conversation because um the honest truth is you're not that good that's why you're not making money like just like let that sit for a quick second like the reason you're not making money is because you're not that good and that's okay because it wouldn't be reasonable for you to be good because you just started right and started as in the business
(00:58) like you're not 30 years in the business you've been there for a year right and so like is it reasonable to believe that you can have a top one percent income only having been in a game where other people have been doing it for 20 20 years we're in the top one percent probably not right and so the question is then how do you how do you skip through that so the first is asking do i think that the vehicle that i am in is viable and so the easiest way to do that is look around and see if there are other people in the industry that are
(01:20) doing what you're doing and if they are succeeding that means that it is possible and therefore it is possible for you so the next piece is understanding the depth of the value and the skills that are required to be successful and so let me give you a quick example of this i'll give you a theoretical example and then i'll drive it home with the the real estate thing so for those of us in the you know the us we have one word for snow it's snow right um eskimos uh this is from what i heard they anybody any of you guys are eskimos you can let me know
(01:52) if this is true or false but from what i understand they have seven different words for snow all right it's because the different types of snow and you could reason that eskimos understand snow better than we do because it's literally all they have and so the nuance that they have for what snow is is more delineated right and so when i was talking to this um real estate agent agency uh i was like so why are your clients not staying on the obvious answer is they're not making money but he's like but he's like some
(02:27) clients we kill it with some clients we don't kill it for he's like i got one guy who's doing 250 000 a month um just using the leads that we send him and i was like right that's because of him and not you think about it i was like all right so what is that person doing that's different than the rest of your clients right he's like from what i understand i mean he's just it's just he's just calling him up and i was like that would be the same thing as looking at what i do all day and just saying yeah i mean alex just
(02:56) makes money just hops on meetings there's a little bit more to it than that right it's the depth of the understanding it's looking at the sky and saying oh it's white it's snowing right when in reality an expert says oh there's seven different types of snow and this is subtype a right if if you were to ask me how do i make you know like there's only free offers and non-free offers i'd be like no there's 19 types of ways to monetize the word free like oh alex might know more about that right it's because i have more volume
(03:23) the guys who are the eskimos see snow every day and so they've been doing it their whole lives and of course they have more delineation for what types of snow there are and so the solution for this particular owner was this is what i would recommend to him he may or may not do this but it will be the thing that will make him successful is i was like fly out to the guys who 250 000 a month off of your leads and soak up everything how many times does he call in what intervals what's the first thing he says on the phone what's the intonation how
(03:54) does he follow up right after the phone call where where does he meet them how soon does he meet them is the meeting in person is it a zoom call or is it is it you know is it a phone call is he setting up for someone else when they do show up what's the contract look like what does that conversation look like how does he walk around the room when he positions himself and presents the contract when he orders the houses for the showing how does he order them does he order the most expensive one first then something else second and then the
(04:18) one he wants to sell them like what's the process looking and then after the person says yes how does he close the deal out and make sure that he's getting paid he's like well i don't know any of that stuff it was like right and that's why you're not making money i was like if you were the top absolutely if you knew more about how to make real estate agents money we wouldn't be having this conversation because you'd be making them money right and so everyone's unwilling to do the thing which is to to plant the roots
(04:43) right you got to plant the roots deep and the only way to have that level of certainty because if someone says that to him these leads are crap right for example he could look back at them and say no they're not you're doing it wrong because he has the certainty and the conviction that he has done it and he knows that and that there's only two ways to have that level of conviction you can either be a sociopath and lie or you can have done it there is no other trick right like i can speak with confidence in saying that i know that gym launch is
(05:11) better at serving gyms because we have more seven-figure gyms than most people that have in their entire freaking franchises right i have 1500 success stories i know our stuff works right and so i can have that conviction like there's just there's no question about it i did 33 turnarounds for two years right two years i spend in my hotel rooms everyone forgets about that stuff like how do we learn how to sell supplements so well because i i would stand in front of a room of complete strangers and day after day after day i
(05:41) would close these rooms full of people to buy supplements right and the first six months i did it i didn't close anyone because i couldn't figure out how to sell them and then i stumbled into one success and then another success another success and then it became a system and it became so repeatable i could do it in my sleep right but we were like well what's the hack right now you can learn from somebody who's already learned that that's how you fast track success i was on the same call and there was a lady on there who who said
(06:08) um i might have been her but it was the point is if you can't learn from other people's failures then it means that you are literally going to have to make every single mistake yourself which is possibly the stupidest thing you can do like you obviously should learn from your own mistakes but wise people learn from other people's mistakes and even better they learn from other people's successes right i had someone yesterday who was on that same call say like well i don't know if that like what you're saying is is right for xyz i'm like who do you
(06:40) think has more perspective about snow this is your first winter i've been living in alaska for the last 20 years like i was like if you absolutely want to go make the mistake you can absolutely go make it i was like but it's stupid as right think about it and so to wrap this up in terms of like if you were not seeing the success that you believe that you are quote owed which you're not owed anything right then you have to you you are you are you earn the success and you get it through doing and it like i was talking to another guy yesterday
(07:14) who's an entrepreneur they're doing a few million bucks a month right and it was funny because hearing his story is the same story it's the same story that every successful entrepreneur has the same story so listen to it and if it's not your story then it's why you're not where you want to be every single successful entrepreneur has a rocky cut scene they have a two-year four-year six-year period of time where no one talks about it and they did the same thing over and over and over and over again and then finally they have mastery and then at
(07:51) that point they transfer that skill to a new opportunity a new vehicle and then they blow up overnight that's how it happens all right the guy that i was speaking with yesterday has an amazing selling system he's very good at building sales teams that are both outbound and inbound right great guy how did he learn how to do it he saw all these leads that were happening online all these opt-ins that no one was calling for for digital products and he's like and he was a good sales person at that point he said i'll bet you i can
(08:19) figure out a way to get these people to buy and what did he do he started picking up the phone and every day he would do hundreds of dials hundreds of dials to these lists that were just plowing through that no one was talking to and then he finally figured out how to get him to say yes to the first phone call and then he figured out how to set them for the second call and then he figured out how to make the offer on the next call and close them right but it took a all the time of learning how to sell which took him years and
(08:46) then he applied it to a new vehicle and then did more reps with his initial skill and then he learned a system and then once he applied that system he was able to show other people etc right he blew up for me i did 4 000 sales consultations 4 000 000 000 all right sales consults in person it's a lot and so so it's like when we talk about sales stuff the nuances are evident the difference between somebody who just talks about sales that you've seen in a video right and somebody that you can that someone's who's providing excessive value is
(09:24) because of the nuance that you only learn through repetition right from actually putting time under the bar which is the word that i use from the fitness space like you have to put your time under the bar there is no shortcut i was on a podcast where they were asking me they're like it seems like you've you've you know you've had this this great success really quickly quick is relative right but um he was like and if if the people who are listening want to shortcut that success what do they do and i was like you're not that's the
(09:50) answer you're not going to because the the skill is the base of the pyramids the foundation right if your foundation's this small because you only spent six months doing a rocky cut scene then the peak of that pyramid is small but you give me a base that's like this and it's hundreds of feet deep you can build a skyscraper taller than anything you've ever seen right but the foundation is the piece that no one can take from you no one can take my experiences from it right and the skills that were shaped from that
(10:17) and so right now if you're not seeing what you want to see it's because you haven't put the time in you have put the time into the bar you haven't gotten the reps and you haven't done the volume right and so if you see someone that is doing something better than you then go and observe and then execute right iterate sorry um replicate before you iterate go do it and then until you can do it as well as them don't change anything once you can do it as well as them or better than them then you've earned the right to iterate
(10:45) on someone else's system that is my advice so this was a passionate one for you it was just because it stemmed from so many conversations have culminated this if you want to figure out how to how a chiropractor is doing well go to chiropractors are doing well and offer to work for free all right now you're not going to work for free for me i get a dm i get two dms a day like hey man i'll work for free if i can just spend time with you no you have no value to provide to me don't ask right but there are other people who are who are
(11:18) probably closer you know i mean like go message bill gates and say hey bill uh you know i'll work really hard and i'll i'll stand next to you he's not gonna accept that like no person who's like really really making money is ever like because you're just going to literally take from them you have no value to provide right instead have value can provide which might be like working the front desk you might be cleaning the facility might be doing anything so that you can be around a business owner and then you can learn
(11:44) skills that you can then apply all right like when i when we did the gym turnarounds i worked the front desk for 33 different gyms it's a lot of gyms right and so i got a feeling for how how the floor is laid out how the lobbies need to be laid out how you can maximize your sales how you can have more guys selling in the same space right all those things happen because of time under the bar so i'm spending 20 years in alaska looking at snowfall after snow after snowfall and saying ah that's the detail oh when you pick up the phone say it
(12:11) like this right because i tried it that way it didn't work right and if you have to go ram your head on the wall and not learn from other people's mistakes that's dumb so yes moral of the story is put the time in you will you will achieve your success faster by taking the year or two of rocky cutscene and then blowing up look at how everyone else's successes they didn't blow up like they didn't they didn't just blow up right there's there's the rocky cut-scene period if you haven't had that period you probably won't blow up
(12:42) so just start putting the time in now to get your rocky cut scene done to have the skill that you can then apply to the new opportunity that arises the sales guys opportunities you figured out outbound calls where there's a huge gold mine right for me i figured out there apparently there's a lot of gyms who wanted to learn how to get customers right profitably i didn't know i figured everyone was opening their gym to full capacity i didn't know right and then it turns out a lot of people wanted to have that right um
(13:08) billy gene who i talk about all the time he did cold calling for three years or two years before he ever started marketing right that was the rocky cutscene period where he sharpened his sword that's where he learned how to sell right and so all of these things right look at your path look at the rocky cut scene that you have or haven't done and just get it done and then after that you'll build the base of the pyramid so you can have the peak that you want rather than consistently building off of a peak a foundation that's this big and
(13:34) never being able to pass five or ten thousand dollars a month right because you haven't earned it right and the marketplace knows that they can delineate between who really has trench knowledge and who is pretending and that's pretty much it so that's all i got for you happy wednesday keep being awesome catch you soon bye

I cracked Starbucks RECURRING SALES model and built a FORTUNE... - YouTube

Transcript:
(00:00) A month ago, my wife and I sold our uh eight figureure software company and that deal closed uh 30 days ago. And so what I wanted to share with you was um one of the the biggest and most profound takeaways that I had from selling that business and what we look at when we're buying our own companies. If you guys don't know who I am, I'm Alexi. I own acquisition.
(00:21) com or my wife and I own acquisition.com. Uh our portfolio does about $85 million a year in revenue. So, what I want to talk about today is one of the things that took me way too long to realize in uh looking at creating products and ultimately, you know, buying and selling businesses that that are valuable. The biggest piece or biggest takeaway that I've had in creating quote fortunes um is understanding one concept.
(00:44) It's so simple to understand and so hard to do. The key, the one-way direction to creating a fortune through business is to only sell things that people do not stop buying. I'll say it again. The way to create a fortune in business is to only sell things that people do not stop buying. Some of you probably drink Starbucks.
(01:09) You probably will not stop drinking Starbucks. Some of you drink Coca-Cola and will probably not stop drinking Coca-Cola. Some of you buy Apple and will probably not stop buying Apple, right? Some of you watch Netflix and will probably never stop watching Netflix, provided they just continue to do what they're currently doing.
(01:24) The thing that is disheartening, right, and I'll I'll say this because I think it's it's just like these are the obvious things that are so obvious, no one does them, right? Simple scales, fancy fails. All right, repeat successful actions. Do the boring work. Like these are saying we have in our community because most of the success that I've had with business has has not been from curing cancer or inventing a new technology but improving something to the point that people want to continue to buy it and continue to
(01:48) pay for it. And so right now this is the thought experiment that if you're a small business owner I would like you to do. If you were to write down the total number of people that you have ever sold, ever all time and you were to tally that number up and then you were to multiply that by your current average monthly price, how much money would that be? Probably a lot.
(02:16) Maybe a lot more than you currently are making. The next thing to do is if that is the amount of money that you were making, how much money would you have available for you to spend in acquiring new customers? Probably a lot. How convicted would you be if every customer you sold you knew you would not lose? Probably vary. And so I think rather than thinking about all the many tactics, and there are lots of them, of making more money, how do I get more leads, how do I optimize my pricing, how do I sell a higher percentage, all of that stuff, right? Those are a lot of
(02:48) the handto-hand combat. And and I don't want to be mistaken here, like you can become a millionaire just learning to be okay at those things, right? If you just learn how to market and sell, you'll be able to make money. You won't be able to build a fortune, but you will be able to make money.
(03:05) The thing is is that if you can optimize around this single question which is what is something that I can sell that people will never stop buying it after they start and how do I structure the thing in such a way that the value they are getting is so far in excess of what they're paying me that they never want to leave that they call me when their credit card goes down to make sure that they continue to stay and pay.
(03:28) So, right now, many of you probably with your Wi-Fi, right, if your Wi-Fi went out because your card didn't go through, you would probably immediately update your card and get the Wi-Fi back up. If your phone service went down, you would immediately update your card and get it back going. If you if your Netflix got cancelled, you would do the same thing, right? And that is because we value those services far in excess of the price.
(03:48) There is what is called a customer surplus, which means you are getting far more than what you pay for. And so you feel like you're not only getting a good deal, you're getting a crazy deal. And so you never want to stop buying it because the value exchange is so far in your favor. And so when I am now looking at businesses, I am seeing what the overall opportunity is that we're pursuing and what the main value proposition is.
(04:10) And I am thinking to myself, so I'm just giving you the mental frameworks that I'm working with, which is how can I turn this thing that is valuable into something that someone will never want to stop buying. All right? So there's a couple of frameworks that I will that I'll I'll walk you through.
(04:24) Um this is probably the most this is for B2B scenario, but you can probably apply it to anything. Many times there are especially in like the e-learning space, people will sell um a method, which I think by the way is silly because people will never stop. They will they'll definitely buy the method and then never need the method, right? Which is why I prefer models to methods, right? A model can have lots of methods that feed into it, but a method can only it's like a one one and done, right? And so ideally you want to transition your business from a method
(04:50) selling business to a model selling business because then you will have a model that can always evolve over time. Franchises sell models and the marketing will change. It was group on then it was email that it was Facebook ads and Instagram ads and YouTube ads and all the things that have happened since right media will change but the model will remain the same.
(05:08) And so if the model is something that someone needs to continue to have then that's something that they will not get rid of. Right now, in the in the Netflix video that I made, like how I crack recurring revenue, there's eight C's that I look at to make something stickier. All of those things will increase the stick.
(05:20) But the biggest one by far is the simple customer surplus, the value discrepancy in what you sell, uh, sorry, what you deliver and the price that you charge for it, right? And most people try and cut their prices in order to get there when in reality, we should be increasing the value so that rather like you can create a customer surplus by lowering the price so much.
(05:38) The thing is is there's not a lot of profit left over and you won't have a big business. And so unless you have something that costs zero dollars to reproduce um you know like you know Dropbox right virtually zero dollars to reproduce more storage um then it's very difficult to do something like that right the idea if you want to create a fortune is to think consistently how can I make this so that no one stops buying and in the software world which I highly recommend you uh look at all the the writers for business in in software because software is
(06:07) software as a service right SAS All right. Now, that means that all the metrics and all the things that they have quantitatively been able to measure in software as a service 100% applies to service because it's just software doing the job that service is supposed to be doing.
(06:21) And so, if we can do that, right, if we can if we can quantitate it in this way, quantify it in this way, then this is the this is the three-step process that they go through when they're trying to create a billion-dollar unicorn company. All right? And I got this from Mark Rober, um, who was the one of the one of the early guys in u in HubSpot, right? I think he took them from zero to 100 million and now he's a lecturer at Harvard.
(06:40) All right, this is the process that they go through. The first step is is to is is getting enough promotion so that you can get customers. All right, he said, "We're not worried about pricing. We're not worried about value. We needed to be priced high enough that people will care, but not so high that we're trying to maximize profit because that's not the goal of this period of time.
(07:01) " Right now, this unfortunately is where most of the internet marketing community stops. They learn how to promote and they think that that's how they're going to make money, but that's not. You'll make some money, but you won't build a fortune that way. Right? So, the promotion period is simply to get customers. All right? You make sales to get customers.
(07:16) You're not getting making customers to get sales. All right? Very important distinction. And so, when we do that, the idea is that we're we're continually testing the product until we get to the point where people don't leave. And in theory, we should never really leave here until we have figured this piece out. Once we have figured this piece out, then we can start scaling it, right? And so if you're thinking about this in sequence, it's promotion, which is usually zero to a million product, which is 1 to 10 million, which is where you're you're
(07:45) optimizing your product so that people never want to leave. They never want to stop buying. And then once you have something where the product is such that people don't stop buying, all of your marketing efforts in and of themselves will start compounding because people won't leave. And so it's just like you've got this glue and you're blowing all this traffic at this glue and it just sticks and it just keeps and if you never lose a customer, you will literally never stop making more money year-over-year. Think about that. Just
(08:10) like hypothetically, just think about that for a second. You will never stop making money. You will never stop making more money year-over-year if you never lose a customer. And I think that it's just such a profound like ideology shift. It's so easy to say and so hard to do, which is why most people don't want to do it.
(08:26) But if you're part of Mosy Nation and you like doing the the boring work, you like doing the things that other people are not willing to do, then these are the things these are the keys to the kingdom is creating things that people will never stop buying. And that means that you're interviewing customers.
(08:40) It means you're surveying them. It means you're looking at usage patterns. You're looking at the things that they're consuming. You're looking at how you can increase the collateral within your community so that people don't want to leave. And we do these things over and over and over again until we get to the point we're at 1% 2% monthly churn at most rather than um you know 10 or 20% which is what most people have.
(09:04) And if that sounds hard, of course it is. But the thing is is that I guarantee you that no one else is doing it. Everyone's obsessing about their Stripe account screenshots. But the thing is is that the the fortunes are not even made in the follow-up. the fortunes are made in never losing customers because then you have time on your side because then over a long enough time horizon even if you suck at marketing people will find out about your product over a long enough time horizon.
(09:27) And if you have a product that people never stop using, you will be able to make a tremendous amount of money because in 20 years, if you were to think about whatever amount of sales you have right now as a small business owner, you might have been doing this for three years or five years, whatever it is, right? If you were to multiply this and you're 20 years into your career and you've actually been doing the same thing, one, it would be far more likely that you'd have something that you would have figured out how to make the product so good that people
(09:49) wouldn't wouldn't leave. But also, 20 years from now, you'd have so many customers, even if you weren't that good at promotion, that your business would be gigantic. All right? And so I I think I've told this story before, but I had a I had a a consulting engagement that I did years ago where somebody was selling the exact same amount of clients as I was and they were making 300,000 a month and we were doing 4 million a month.
(10:11) And I think I had a hundred times the profit of their company. And it wasn't because they were like we were selling the same amount of customers. It was just that we had such a better monetization. We had such a better product. We were able to deliver so much more value that we were able to grow to a much bigger size.
(10:25) Like if you sell a 100 clients a month B2B, you should be able to build that into into a $100 million enterprise. You have the sales velocity. And so then it's just simply and I know that's like well what about pricing over a long enough time horizon, you should still pro if you're B2B, you'll probably be in in a price point where you would get there if here's the big if you don't lose customers.
(10:43) And so I think the vast majority if there's one message from this video it's what can we look at or reimagine within our customer experience and the product that we deliver that will deliver outsized return so that we have a customer surplus which means the amount of value provide is far in excess to the price that we charge and that doesn't matter what the price is.
(10:58) So when someone says I charge high ticket, I think it's a silly silly concept altogether, right? Because it really should just be high value. That's the real concept, which is high value. All right? Because what is expensive, right? If I said, "Hey, I'll give you my, you know, my Lambo for 20 grand. Is that a good deal?" Absolutely. Right.
(11:15) Price is what you pay. Value is what you get. And that discrepancy is going to be the customer surplus. And so right now, if I said that to this channel, hey, any the first person who wires me 20 grand, right, gets the Lambo, a lot of people would probably wire me 20 grand, right? because the value is clear to understand.
(11:30) If I was selling a house and I said, "Hey, give me, you know, it's a $500,000 house. Give it to you for 50 grand. It's a great deal." Most people would make that offer. And so, the thing is is that that is what the business like that is where fortunes are built is finding a way to build a house for less than $50,000 to build a $500,000 house, build it for $10,000, build it for $5,000, and sell it for $50,000.
(11:52) That's the game that we're trying to play. That is where fortunes are made. That is where fortunes are founded. That is where you sell things that people will never stop buying. And that is the real key to making more wealth and more money than you know what to do with. And the reality is it's very simple to say and very hard to do.
(12:08) And that's why most people will never be wealthy. But you are part of Mosy Nation. And you are not going to be one of those people. Uh because we do the boring work. We do the things that people are not willing to do so that we can have success that they have never dreamed of. So anyways, keep being awesome.
